("Security, Technology, and Global Politics: Thinking with Virilio, PRIO
New Security Studies, pp. 8-10)

For Virilio, attempts to contain the insecurity of geopolitics through
improved global governance, \'free markets\' and the liberal peace might
transform security and war around the world, creating a world of
perpetual peace and prosperity. The global economy - coupled with the
acceleration of technology - might generate harmonious and creative
societies where the unpleasant jobs have been replaced by machines and
where there is a growing consensus that we need to accelerate and
intensify distributive justice around the planet. Technology will not
only improve our health and security - it will foster a cosmopolitan
society built on the information technologies that expand the
possibilities for dialogue. The war game will become the peace game that
aids the improvement of the human condition. Virilio isn\'t so sure
about the optimistic liberal view of history. For Virilio, **[[we are
surrounded by the \'propaganda of an endless progress]{.mark}\', the
promise of [a world where technology and capitalism will
overcome]{.mark} the problems and [suffering]{.mark} that have blighted
the human condition;]{.underline}** the \'propaganda of progress\' is
the vision of the future one often finds in corporate depictions of the
future that illustrate how new products will transform life, creating an
existence where a multitude of technologies are effortlessly integrated
into everyday life to create more rewarding and efficient work and
relationships.27 Virilio is less certain that technology and capitalism
will improve the human condition, asking us to **[[pay attention to what
lies underneath]{.mark} this propaganda of progress]{.underline}** **[in
the world around us - in the stress, suffering, paranoia, control,
exhaustion and inequality that]{.underline}** he thinks might
**[intensify]{.underline}** in coming decades. [**[Progress (and the
peace game]{.underline}**),]{.mark} on this view, **[[is a
progress]{.mark} in the arts and technologies [of control designed to
manage the]{.mark} growing numbers of the [\'living dead\' that are
excluded]{.mark} from the \'legitimate\' economy, to control those that
seek to exploit vulnerabilities in \'network\' society.]{.underline}**
As we see later, for Virilio [**[the peace game is the war game turned
inward]{.underline}**, **[toward]{.underline}**]{.mark} what he calls
[**[the endo-colonization of society]{.underline}**, **[the attempt to
control the constantly mutating terrains of
security]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the post-Cold War
world]{.underline}**. The other side of the \'propaganda of an endless
progress\' is the \'administration of fear\': Virilio suggests that
**[we need to pay attention to the way [fear]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(usually fear **[[of otherness]{.mark} and difference]{.underline}**)
**[is used to [distort debate over the problems we
confront]{.mark}]{.underline}** (so, for example, when fear of
immigrants is presented as the cause of our economic woes and societal
implosion - and the route to further disorder). For Virilio, **[we need
to negotiate our way through both the propaganda of progress and the
administration of fear, to pay attention to the way we can be captured
by these \'easy\' modes of responding to the world around us, to be
constantly aware of these two very different traps]{.underline}**. 9 Our
world might be heading toward the realization of the liberal dream of
progress but Virilio looks around and sees a world of accelerating
ecological, economic and social degradation; **[[politics
becomes]{.mark} [an]{.mark} increasingly narrow [attempt to manage the
insecurity and messiness in societies]{.mark} intent on realizing the
dream of a fast and efficient consumer lifestyle.]{.underline}** On this
view, **[the politics of [security]{.mark}]{.underline}** that promises
to control the messiness **[has a tendency to get out of control,
[nourish]{.mark}ing [the \'war-machine\' and the \'military scientific
complex\']{.mark}, [producing misguided security projects that generate
chaos]{.mark} in the realization of policies that are often [driven by
fear, technological optimism]{.mark} about what technology and war can
achieve, [and]{.mark} a sense of [cultural and racial
superiority]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 28 **[We might believe that we will
learn from our mistakes]{.underline}** (such as the wars that have
dominated the first decade of the twenty-first century after 9111)
**[but that is to become caught up with the \'propaganda of endless
progress\'.]{.underline}** **[[There is an excess to security that
results in \'unnecessary wars\' that become experimental zones]{.mark}
for new technologies]{.underline}** - **[[and]{.mark} there is [desire
to control]{.mark} all aspects of [life]{.mark} in increasingly
intensive and extensive ways that risks to undermine civil liberties,
tipping the balance of liberty and security [toward]{.mark} the
[endo-colonization]{.mark} of society]{.underline}**; **[[an excessive
focus on]{.mark} the problems of [\'otherness\' to the exclusion of the
insecurity that comes from inside,]{.mark} from our financial systems or
modes of consumption]{.underline}**. **[Military and political elites
get caught up in the seductive possibilities offered by new
technologies, the god-like ability to control the world]{.underline}**.
Virilio comments that: the nature of absolute speed is also to be
absolute power, absolute and instantaneous control, in other words an
almost divine power. Today, we have achieved the three attributes of the
divine: ubiquity, instantaneity, immediacy; omnivoyance and omnipotence.
29 We can see an example of this excess of security and the desire to
obtain these attributes of the divine in the discovery in June 2013 that
the National Security Agency obtained direct access to the digital
infrastructures of Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, allowing
the PRISM program to access the emails, file transfers, search histories
and live chats of all citizens, the metadata of the world. While this
desire to become an omnipotent machine of surveillance might confront
ethical and limits - or might confront the limits of what is possible,
the excess of information - the intention is clearly to know everything.
30 Or **[we can see this desire to control the world from a distance in
the development of drone technology: machines of vision and death that
make possible control-at-a distance.]{.underline}** In his preface to
The Administration of Fear, Betrand Richard notes that \'this son of an
Italian communist and a catholic from Brittany traces the rules of the
game in which we are caught. And that we must escape\' .31
**[[We]{.mark} are trapped in a perverse situation where our societies
are obsessed with security - but [are governed with a security politics
and economic policy that]{.mark} appears to be [mak]{.mark}ing the
[societies]{.mark} we live in [more fragile (and thus requir]{.mark}ing
[more \'security\']{.mark} and \'protection sciences\').]{.underline}**
The question that Virilio leaves us with is - after we negotiate through
the propaganda of progress and the administration of fear - how do we
escape the dangers of our accelerating reality, the darker possibilities
made possible by the modem world? There is a sense in Virilio\'s work
that past attempts to re-design how we live were not up to the task,
producing new \'traps\', new types of control. 10 So the optimistic
\'liberal\' student of international politics won\'t find much to agree
with in Virilio\'s vision of politics and security. For the liberal
optimist, the modem age has made it possible for our \'rationality\' to
overcome the irrational and dangerous aspects of the human condition;
while there is much more to \'overcome\' we are heading in the right
direction and progress in this overcoming will be aided by new \'tools\'
and technologies; human existence is more civilized and secure than at
any point in our history.32 **[The liberal will reply that information
technologies are creating the foundation for a global public sphere that
generates a \'transparent society\' that makes it harder for states to
hide what they do]{.underline}**; Virilio replies that **[[information
technologies create new types of control and
incarceration]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Freedom and progress]{.mark}
in this world order [are illusions that mask the]{.mark} stress,
[control and inequality created by the system]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The liberal will suggest that the continued growth in a interconnected
global economy - where crisis is simply a glitch on the way to a world
of progress for everybody around the planet - is a sign of the liberal
capitalist world\'s resilience, its superiority to other ways of
organizing human life.33 Virilio would reply that **[we should be
careful not to mistake this resilience as proof of the universal or
\'timeless\' vitality or appeal of a capitalist (and not necessarily
liberal) world order.]{.underline}** The liberal sees global mobility as
a symbol of the emerging cosmopolitan world order that overcomes the
limits of locality and nationalism. Virilio sees global mobility in
terms of forced migration, of border camps, of climate refugees, of
habitats that can no longer support human life. Writing about Michel
Foucault\'s studies of prisons and asylums Virilio comments: \'I think
that the real imprisonment is just ahead. \'34 For Virilio, the problems
on the horizon will expose the fragility of the ways of organizing life
that were enjoyed in the West through the second half of the twentieth
century: rapid technological, ecological and geopolitical transformation
will force us to confront a reality where it becomes difficult to hold
on to the values and ideas that shaped political imaginations in the
West during much of the previous century.

Securitization and desecuritization ¶ The ceteris paribus normative
push, and political recommendation of the securitization approach has
been 'less security, more politics', and the development of 'possible
modalities' for **[the desecuritization of politics]{.underline}**
(Wæver 1989a, 52): it **[is]{.underline}** generally (which can only be
assessed in practice though) **[more conducive to treat identities as
identities, religion as religion, the environment as the environment,
and so on, and to engage]{.underline}** their **[politics through the
particular modalities and rationalities of those fields rather than
those of security]{.underline}**. In the received reading, whilst
securitization raises issues into the realm of security policies and
practices (arrow 2a in Figure 1), **[desecuritization lowers issues back
into the realm of 'regular politics' or removes issues from the
political agenda altogether]{.underline}** (arrow 1 in Figure 1). ¶
**[[Desecuritization can be achieved]{.mark} through a number of
options: [by]{.mark} simply [not talking]{.mark} about issues [in terms
of security]{.mark}, by [keeping responses]{.mark} to securitized issues
[in forms that do not create security dilemmas]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[or other vicious spirals]{.underline}**, **[[and]{.mark} by
[moving]{.mark} security [issues]{.mark} back in[to 'normal
politics']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Wæver 2000, 253). These options can
follow objectivist, constructivist or deconstructivist strategies in
bringing about desecuritization (Huysmans (1995, 65--67). These
strategies differ in regard to how the process relates to the claimed
threat: has the threat been dealt with, can the security drama be
somehow handled from without, or can identities beyond security threats
be produced from within the process. ¶ **[Beyond conceptualizing
desecuritization as an option or a strategy, it has also been viewed
from the viewpoint of political actors]{.underline}** (de Wilde 2008,
597), **[and their political moves in games of contestation and
resistance]{.underline}** (Vuori 2011a, 2015). **[There can be
desecuritizing actors who evade, circumvent or directly oppose
securitizing moves]{.underline}** by, for example, emphasizing competing
threats (de Wilde 2008, 597). Security policies aim at desecuritization
(the solution to the threatening situation), but desecuritization can
also happen independently from the actions of securitizing or
desecuritizing actors: the original security problem may be solved,
institutions may adapt through new reproductive structures, discourses
may change (e.g., with the loss of interest or audiences), and the
original referent object may be lost (de Wilde 2008). ¶ **[A key issue
of debate has been on whether desecuritization can be considered to be
an active political process, or whether desecuritization can only happen
as a fading away of the issue]{.underline}** (Behnke 2006, 65): the
question is whether the logic and possibility of securitization is
necessarily retained in explicit discussions of whether an issue has
retained the status of a security issue. **[As empirical studies of
securitization and desecuritization dynamics]{.underline}** (e.g.,
Salter and Mutlu 2013; Lupovici 2014; Vuori 2015; Donnelly 2015) have
shown, **[it is difficult to point to a definitive end point for either
securitization or desecuritization: political and social situations
evolve]{.underline}**. Whichever the philosophical stance on how and
whether desecuritization can be achieved (Vuori 2011a), such
**[empirical studies show that political actors do make active
desecuritization moves]{.underline}**. ¶ Indeed, systematizing empirical
studies of desecuritization, Hansen (2012, 529; 539--545) has identified
four ideal type forms for the concept. In regard to its issues of
concern, namely the status of enmity and the possibility of a public
sphere, when a larger conflict is still within the realm of possibility,
but **[when a particular issue is presented with terms other than
security, we have an instance of (1) 'change through
stabilisation]{.underline}**' (arrow 2b in Figure 1); when another issue
takes the place of a previously securitized issue, **[we have (2)
'replacement'; when the originally phrased threat is resolved, we
have]{.underline}** (3) **[rearticulation]{.underline}**; and
finally**[,]{.underline}** when potentially insecure subjects are
marginalized through depoliticization, we have (4) 'silencing' (types
2--3 are represented by arrow 1 in Figure 1). ¶ The previous literature
on both securitization (arrow 2a in Figure 1) and desecuritization
(arrow 1 in Figure 1) has produced ample illustrations of both dynamics.
As a brief example of how both dynamics can alter between the same
political actors, we can use some of the vicissitudes of Sino-Soviet
relations. ¶ China entered the Cold War in the Soviet camp and relied on
the Soviet Union as the guarantee of the international security of the
new People's Republic. Chinese views in the late 1940s clearly
structured the world into two opposing camps, with China firmly in the
Soviet one (Mao 1949). In the 1950s, however, Sino-Soviet relations
soured, and the following 'Sino-Soviet split' (Lüthi 2008) has been used
as an example of the capacity of 'parochial' securitizations to become
disaffected by or even be withdrawn from dominant 'macrosecuritizations'
(Buzan and Wæver 2009, 257). ¶ Following the split, Sino-Soviet
relations in the 1960s were characterized by intensive ideological
conflict, and Mao Zedong securitized Soviet revisionism as a major
threat for the Chinese Communist Party (Vuori 2011b). Indeed, newly
available documents suggest that it was the Chinese side, in effect Mao
Zedong, which was more active in the pursuit of ideological conflict
(Lüthi 2008, 2). In his securitization of the Soviet Union, Mao linked
the revisionism he identified there to that which he also securitized
domestically (Vuori 2011b), and the issue of revisionism was presented
as an issue of life and death for the party. ¶ Sino-Soviet relations
began to mend in the 1980s with the removal of a number of political
obstacles and with the intensification of the conflict between the
United States and the Soviet Union (Wishnick 2001). Yet, it is only with
the fall of the Soviet Union that we can see an overall desecuritization
in the form of rearticulation (Hansen 2012, 542--544) taking place in
Sino-Russian relations. In the aftermath of the end of the Cold War,
China's line was not to take the lead in international affairs. China
worked towards 'world multipolarization', which was exemplified with
China and Russia forming a 'strategic partnership' in 1996. China and
Russia even shared the same 'threat package' of 'terrorism, separatism,
and religious extremism' (the 'three evils') within the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (Jackson 2006, 310). These are strong
indicators of how the two states have managed to reform their identities
away from the Sino-Soviet antagonism. In the overall state relations
then, we can see a rearticulative desecuritization tactic at play on
both sides: ever since the early 1980s, China's policy towards the
Soviet Union (and later Russia) shifted from antagonism to one of
collaboration and negotiation rather than securitization.¶
**[[Desecuritization can be conceptualized]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
above manner **[[as a negative ontological corollary to
securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet, **[[it is also prudent to
investigate securitization and desecuritization]{.mark} as political
moves in order [to]{.mark} potentially [understand]{.mark} the logic of
when and how they are wielded in [practical
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is proposed here that in addition to
instances where a securitized situation is dismantled (arrow 1 in Figure
1), **[[desecuritization]{.mark} can also be viewed as [a political
move]{.mark} that can be [deployed before 'securitization plays' in a
game]{.mark}]{.underline}** of securitization (arrow 2a in Figure 1). In
other words, **[desecuritization moves]{.underline}** -- **[both in
terms of discourse and practice]{.underline}** -- **[can be used in a
pre-emptive manner before the threshold of securitization is
reached]{.underline}** (arrow 2b in Figure 1). For Wæver (2000, 254),
silencing can be a strategy to 'pre-empt or forestall securitization'.
We argue here that beyond silencing, **[[active]{.mark} desecuritization
[efforts can]{.mark} be made to [block]{.mark} the [escalation]{.mark}
of a contention]{.underline}**. Thereby, in addition to change through
stabilization (Hansen 2012) and the silencing of an issue (Wæver 2000),
**[[there can be explicit rebuttals of security frames]{.mark} and
claims [before they are solidified into policy]{.mark}. This tactic can
be termed 'pre-emptive desecuritization through
rebuttal'.]{.underline}**

**[When applied to]{.underline}** the study of **[international
politics]{.underline}**, **[this position turns into a critique
of]{.underline}** **[the state]{.underline}**, or rather, a critique of
sovereignty. **[There is no state]{.underline}**, say post-structural
international relations scholars such as Cynthia Weber and David
Campbell, **[at least if we take the state to constitute a pre-existing
subject to which sovereignty can be attached as an attribute.9
Focusing]{.underline}** on "institutions," the "people," or perhaps on
the state as a transcendental idea, **[[mainstream accounts]{.mark}
always [presuppose that which they intend to
prove]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead **[[sovereignty must be understood
as the process through which]{.mark} political
[subjects]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[come to constitute
themselves]{.mark} as such]{.underline}**. "I suggest," says Weber,
"that sovereign nation-states are not pre-given subjects but in process
and that **[[all subjects]{.mark} in process]{.underline}** (be they
individual or collective) **[[are the ontological effects of]{.mark}
[practices]{.mark} which are [performatively
enacted]{.mark}]{.underline}**."10

Weber\'s idea of "performatively enacted practices" needs further
elucidation.11 Even if we reject the idea of a pre-given self, there is
certainly the illusion of such a being, and the question thus becomes
how that illusion arose. According to poststructural theory, **[the self
is created [through reiterative linguistic
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Language precedes
the]{.underline}** **[human subject]{.underline}**, they explain; **[we
are born into language]{.underline}**, **[and language is best
understood]{.underline}** **[as a semiotic structure
where]{.underline}** the **[meaning]{.underline}** of each word **[is
constituted by]{.underline}** its **[difference]{.underline}** **[from
other words]{.underline}**. It is, as Ferdinand Saussure once argued,
the structure as a whole that ultimately determines what things mean.
According to performativity theorists, in other words, structure is to
practice as langue is to parole; as the abstract rules that make
possible the production of grammatical sentences, that is, are to the
production of an actual sentence.12 A structure, like langue, is a
complex of rules with a virtual existence whereas practice, like speech,
is an enactment of these rules in space and time.

But a semiotic structure is not yet a sovereign self. **[We move closer
to the subject once we]{.underline}** **[realize that [words do not only
mean]{.mark} things [but also do things]{.mark} in the
world]{.underline}**. Words have what John Austin\'s in How to Do Things
with Words, 1962, called a "perlocutionary force."13 The proverbial
example is the "I do" of the wedding ceremony. By speaking the words,
you are not merely conveying meaning, you are also doing something, you
are constituting a marriage. The words are performed and thereby
enacted.14 Adding to Austin\'s conclusions, Derrida emphasizes what he
calls the "citational" quality of even the most pragmatic forms of
language use. That is, **[[the texts we invoke]{.mark} always
[cite]{.mark} seemingly [absent contexts]{.mark} from [which
they]{.mark} ultimately [derive their meaning]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
"Could a performative utterance succeed," Derrida asks,

> if its formulation did not repeat a "coded" or iterable utterance, or
> in other words, if the formula I pronounce in order to open a meeting,
> launch a ship or a marriage were not identifiable as conforming with
> an iterable model, if it were not then identifiable in some way as a
> "citation"?15

This is how the subject comes to constitute itself. "The subject is
inscribed in language, is a \'function\' of language, becomes a speaking
subject only by making its speech conform ... to the system of the rules
of language as a system of differences."16 The human subject is "a being
devoid of Being until it is organized by a system of codes."17

This is an argument further developed by Judith Butler.18 **[Our
identities take shape]{.underline}**, she says, **[through the
perlocutionary force of the discourse we apply to
ourselves]{.underline}**. Talking about the being that we take our
selves to be, **[we quote statements that connote normalcy and imply
acceptance]{.underline}** much as a lawyer might cite supporting
precedents in a court of law. **[By making performative
statements]{.underline}**, and applying them to ourselves, **[a certain
person comes into being]{.underline}**; performativity is "a compulsory
reiteration of those norms through which a subject is constituted";
"subjectivity is performatively constituted by the ritualized production
or codified social behavior."19 **[These statements]{.underline}**, says
Butler, **[are not only repetitive]{.underline}** and ritualistic **[but
also socially determined]{.underline}**. If we misquote the established
discourse and fail to construct an appropriate self for ourselves, we
are punished through various, often surprisingly severe, social
sanctions.20

This is the argument which Cynthia Weber and David Campbell apply to the
study of international relations. "There is no sovereign or state
identity behind expressions of state sovereignty," Weber summarizes.
"**[The identity of [the state is performatively]{.mark} [constituted by
the]{.mark} very [expressions that are]{.mark} said to be [its
results]{.mark}]{.underline}**."21 **[[States]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Campbell concurs, **[[are "]{.mark}unavoidably [paradoxical entities
which do not possess pre-discursive]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[stable
[identities]{.mark}]{.underline}**."22 **[[Foreign policy discourse is
"a persistent impersonation that passes as the
real]{.underline}]{.mark}**"; **[states state and through their
statements they instate and reinstate themselves as sovereign
actors]{.underline}**. This is a constantly ongoing process. "For a
state to end its practices of representation would be to expose its lack
of prediscursive foundations; stasis would be death."23 Weber talks
about sovereignty as a form of simulation, but while simulations usually
are defined through their likeness to the real, the world politics which
she describes contains no originals.24

As an illustration, **[[consider]{.underline}]{.mark}** Thomas
**[[Hobbes\']{.underline}]{.mark}** solution to the problems of life in
the state of nature.25 By handing over their right to self-defense to a
common power who guarantees their security, individuals no longer
threaten each other. Yet **[[prior to the]{.mark} signing of this
[contract]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[there was no people]{.underline}**;
**[[the people]{.mark} literally [declared itself into]{.mark}
[existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.26 Derrida analyzes **[the American
Declaration of Independence]{.underline}** of 1776 in the same terms.27
**[[The authors]{.mark} of the declaration]{.underline}**, he says,
**[[referred to themselves as]{.mark} the]{.underline}**
"**[[Representatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**" of "the good People of
these Colonies," **[[but these]{.underline}]{.mark}** people **[[did
not]{.mark} [exist]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[prior to the issuing of the
declaration]{.underline}** itself. It was only through the signatures
that the people came to constitute itself as such. "The people" who
authorizes their representatives to make the declaration is invented by
the declaration they authorize.28

**[Or [consider]{.mark} the case of [military
interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as discussed by both Weber and
Campbell. Interventions are violations of independence, but as such they
exemplify the power of the same performative practice. Military
interventions, we might say, constitute a discursive boundary along
which the principle of sovereignty breaks down. By analyzing where and
how this boundary is drawn, we learn where and how sovereignty is
produced.29 It is for that reason interesting to see how military
interventions have been justified. In Writing Security, **[Campbell
discusses a striking example]{.underline}**: **[the
Requerimiento]{.underline}**, **[the short proclamation which the
conquistadors read]{.underline}** to the native populations of the New
World **[before they took possession]{.underline}** of their land and
imposed European laws on them.30 "Therefore I beg and require you as
best I can," the conquistadors declared, in Spanish, to the puzzled
locals, "\...

> we will not compel you to turn Christians. But if you do not to it ...
> with the help of God, I will enter forcefully against you, and I will
> make war everywhere and however I can, and I will subject you to the
> yoke and obedience of the Church and His Majesty, and I will take your
> wives and children, and I will make them slaves \...31

As Weber shows in Simulating Sovereignty, **[the right to violate
sovereignty has continued to be a privilege of the most
powerful]{.underline}** states. At the time of World War I, **[national
self-determination was enshrined as an absolute
principle]{.underline}**; absolute, that is, **[as long as it
did]{.underline}** **[not run up against the]{.underline}** fundamental
**[interests of]{.underline}** the **[leading states]{.underline}** ---
compare the invasion in support of the Whites after the Russian
Revolution of 1917. Sovereignty continues to be the core principle of
the international system to this day, except when it is in the interests
of the United States and its allies to violate it ― witness Grenada in
1983 and Panama in 1989 (and, we might add, Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq

Laura **[Sjoberg 13]{.underline}**, Department of Political Science,
University of Florida , Gainesville The paradox of security
cosmopolitanism?, Critical Studies on Security, 1:1, 29-34

Particularly, **[Burke]{.underline}** suggests that security
cosmopolitanism 'rejects a procedural faith in strongly post-Westphalian
forms of government and democracy' (p. 17) and **[reiterates that such
an approach includes 'no automatic faith in any one institutional
design']{.underline}** (p. 24). This seems to move away from one of the
prominent critiques of, in Anna Agathangelou and Ling's (2009) words,
the 'neoliberal imperium,' as reliant on Western, liberal notions of
governance to the detriment of those on whom such a form of government
is imposed. Burke clearly problematizes this imposition, framing many of
the serious problems in global politics as a result of 'choices that
create destructive dynamics and constraints' (p. 15) at least in part by
Western, liberal governments -- characterizing modernity as culpable for
insecurity. **[At the same time, [the solution seems]{.mark} to be
clearly [situated within the discursive framework of the
problem]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Burke suggests that there should be a
primary concern for 'effectiveness, equality, fairness, and justice --
not for states, per se, but for human beings, and the global biosphere'
(p. 24). Unless the only problem with modernity is the post- Westphalian
structure of the state (which this approach does not eschew, but claims
not to privilege), then this statement of values might entrench the
problem. Many of the ideas of equality, fairness, and justice that come
to mind with the (somewhat rehearsed) use of those words in progressive
politics are inseparable from an ethos of enlightenment modernity. This
may be problematic on a number of levels. First, **[[it may fail to
interrupt the series of choices that]{.mark}]{.underline}** Burke
suggests **[[produce]{.mark} [a cycle of
insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second, it may fold back onto itself
in the recommendations that security cosmopolitanism produces. This
especially concerned me in Burke's discussion of how to end 'dangerous
processes,' where **[he places 'greater faith in the]{.underline}**
ethical, normative, and **[legal suppression of dangerous
processes]{.underline}** and actions than in formalistic or procedural
solutions' (p. 24). It seems to me that there is a good argument that
'**[suppression' is itself a 'dangerous process]{.underline}**,**[' yet
Burke's framework does not really include a mechanism for internal
critique.]{.underline}** Another problem that seems to confound security
cosmopolitanism is evaluating the relationships between power,
governance, and governmentality. There are certainly several ways in
which Burke uses a notion of the state that distinguishes security
cosmopolitanism from the mainstream neoliberal literature. For example,
he characterizes the 'state as an entity whose national survival depends
on its global participation, obligations, and depen- dencies,' (citing
Burke 2013a, 5). This view of the state sees it as not only
survival-seeking (in the neo-neo synthesis sense) but also dependent on
its positive interactions with other states for survival. Burke's
approach to government/governance initially appears to be global rather
than state-based, another potentially transformative move. For example,
he sees the job of security cosmopolitanism as to 'theorize and defend
norms for the respon- sible conduct and conceptualization of global
security governance' (p. 21). At the same time, later in the article,
Burke suggests entrenching the current structure of the state. His
practical approach of looking for the 'solidarity of the governing with
the governed' seems to simultaneously interrogate the current power
structures and reify them. Burke says: Such a 'solidarity of the
governed' that engages in a 'practical interrogation of power' ought to
be a significant feature of security cosmopolitanism. At the same time,
however, security cosmopolitanism must be concerned with improving the
global governance of security by elites and experts. (p. 21) **[[This
attachment to]{.mark} the improvement of [existing structures]{.mark} of
governance [seems to be]{.mark} [at the heart of]{.mark} what I see as
[the failure of]{.mark} the [radical potential]{.mark} in the idea of
security cosmopolitanism.]{.underline}** When discussing how the power
dynamics between the elite and the subordinated might change, Burke
suggests that 'voluntary renunciation of the privileges and powers of
both state and corporate sovereignty will no doubt be a necessary
feature of such an order' (p. 25). **[[Relying on the voluntary
renunciation of power by the powerful seems]{.mark} both [unrealistic
and not]{.mark} particularly [theoretically innovative]{.mark}. This
seems to be at the center of a paradox inherent in security
cosmopolitanism: Faith in the Western liberal state is insidious, but
the Western liberal state does not have to be.]{.underline}**
**[Modernity causes insecurity, but need not be discarded
fully.]{.underline}** Some universalizations are dangerous, others are
benign. **[[Dangerous processes must be stopped]{.mark}, even if by
dangerous processes]{.underline}**. Moral entrepreneurship is the key,
but ther e is no clear foundation for what counts as moral. The security
cosmopolitanism critique is inspired by consequentialism, but lacks
deontological foundations despite deontological implications. Burke
calls for (and indeed demands) to 'take responsibility for it' (p. 23)
in terms of 'both formal and moral accountability' (p. 24). In so doing,
he endorses (Booth's vision of) 'moral progress' (p. 25), despite
understanding the insidious deployment of various notions of moral
progress by others. **[[Security]{.mark} cosmopolitanism]{.underline}**,
then, [**[is a proclamation for radical change that is]{.underline}**
i]{.mark}nitially **[[stalled by its internal
contradictions]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and]{.underline}** further
**[handicapped by its lack of capacity to enact the very sort of radical
change]{.underline}** Burke sees it as fundamental to righting the
wrongs he sees in the world. **[[The result seems to be

However, this **[[emphasis on AI]{.mark} through the lens of already

that [discourses]{.mark} around "security" deploy particular "grammars

securitizing actors together" to both [depoliticize and control]{.mark}
particular [sociotechnical arenas]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Hansen &
Nissenbaum, 2009). AI's securitization shares similar traits with those
of cybersecurity more broadly (which itself draws strongly from Cold War
discourse around nuclear arms). **[[AI's]{.mark} "grammar of
[securitization"]{.mark} both [reinforces AI]{.mark}'s status [as an
elite technical discourse and distracts from the effects]{.mark} of that
same discourse [on AI policymaking]{.mark} across the
board]{.underline}**. Hansen and Nissenbaum (2009) identify **[three
"securitization modalities]{.underline}**" which they suggest are
particularly powerful in broader cybersecurity discourse:
**[[hyper-securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}** or "**[a tendency both
to [exaggerate threats and]{.mark} to [resort to excessive
countermeasures]{.mark}]{.underline}**"; **[[everyday security
practices]{.mark}, i.e., "situations in which private organizations and
businesses mobilize individual experiences" to "[make
hyper-securitization]{.mark} scenarios [more
plausible]{.mark}]{.underline}** by linking elements of the disaster
scenario to experiences familiar from everyday life"; **[and
[technification]{.mark}, "a particular constitution of epistemic
authority and political legitimacy" [whereby some subjects are
depoliticized into the realm of the "expert]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p.
1164). The concept of technification aligns closely with our
observations in past work (Greene et al., 2019) and above: that **[most
AI vision statements or sets of ethical principles seek to restrict
debates around the societal impacts of AI to a coterie of technical
experts whose positions are posited, chiefly by themselves, as
technocratic and thus apolitical]{.underline}**. **[[Securitization
rhetoric]{.mark} thus [allows both industry and governments free reign
to set the parameters for AI governance on their own
terms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In its simultaneous insistence on the
inevitability of AI technologies and that experts' hold responsibility
for ethical AI governance, much **[[AI]{.mark} discourse also performs a
flavor of [hyper-securitization, hyp]{.mark}ing [the disruption being
produced]{.mark} by AI systems [while disavowing the role of policy
choices]{.mark} [in]{.mark} accepting [the deployment of problematic
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. And in line with other surveillance
technologies such as CCTV cameras, institutional actors are rapidly
securitizing AI as a threat in itself if deployed by the wrong hands,
while also advocating its use as a means to identify threats to the
national polity (Cassiano, 2019; Chen & Cheung, 2017). **[The
[securitization of AI]{.mark} discourses and technologies also further
[exacerbates existing patterns of digital inequality and power
asymmetries]{.mark} between the global North and South]{.underline}**.
Rumman Chowdhury and Abeba Birhane argue **[the [extractive data
practices]{.mark} of many AI firms [constitute "algorithmic
colonialism]{.mark}," a digital analogue to the exploitative material
extraction of natural resources and human capital to which the Global
South has been subjected for centuries]{.underline}** (Chowdhury, 2019).
**[Algorithmic colonialism entails both [the depredations of neocolonial
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** (in particular the United States and
China) **[[and those of local elites]{.mark} supported by broader
networks of global capital]{.underline}** (Couldry & Mejias, 2019);
**[it also includes algorithmic settler colonialism, through which
[settler colonial states look inward to exploit and dispossess the data
heritage of indigenous populations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (TallBear,
2013). Finally, **[[it]{.mark} relies on globalized digital
infrastructures to [outsource and occlude the immense amounts of human
labor of which "AI" services]{.mark} often actually [consist]{.mark}:
workers around the world are paid meagerly to clean and tag data, train
models, and facilitate other purportedly automated services, while the
more privileged developers of these systems reap the lion's share of the
financial reward]{.underline}** (Gray & Suri, 2019; Poster, 2019a,
2019b). **[[Securitization discourse]{.mark}, particularly around
technification, thus seeks to [push AI]{.mark}/ML systems out of the
hands of citizens]{.underline}** in both the global North and South
**[and to install them [as]{.mark} yet [another weapon in]{.mark} the
game of [neoliberal great power politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More
broadly, **[securitization supports and underpins the various

### L: China

#### China threat discourse is a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}\-\--securitization legitimizes [colonial occupation]{.underline} to [create the conditions]{.underline} for miscalculation and militarization

**[The China threat discourse is linked to a bipolar worldview.
[Through]{.mark} the workings of [Western historical analogy, China
replaces past enemies]{.mark}, such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet
Union, [as the 'Other' against which the West defines and understands
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Kopper & Peragovics, 2019). Western and
metropolitan states frequently contrast their own benignity with the
China threat. As a result, despite arguments that engagement with China
threatens islanders\' ability to act in their own interests (due to
'debt traps'), threatens island ecosystems (due to environmental
destruction), and threatens the demographic dominance of islander
populations (due to large-scale immigration), such island-centred
arguments rapidly recede in the face of assertions of Western
superiority.

**[The [China threat discourse is not merely a means of distancing an
island]{.mark} or archipelago [from China but also a means of bringing
an island]{.mark} or archipelago [into closer relation with]{.mark} its
existing [colonial]{.mark} or metropolitan [state]{.mark}. [The
US]{.mark}A is prominent here both because it has [militarised numerous
island territories]{.mark} worldwide [and]{.mark} because other Western
and metropolitan powers]{.underline}** (e.g. Japan relative to Okinawa,
Denmark relative to Kalaallit Nunaat, Australia relative to Papua New
Guinea, France relative to New Caledonia) **[cannot represent themselves
as equal competitors with China in a multipolar world and must [position
them]{.mark}selves [as allies of the US]{.mark}A [and]{.mark} potential
[alternatives to China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such a bipolar
perspective is unhelpful for **[[islanders]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who
**[[are cast as "pawns in a geopolitical chess game]{.mark} between
larger powers]{.underline}**," included within this or that sphere of
influence, **[rather than as actors in their own right]{.underline}**
(Davis, Munger, & Legacy, 2020).

5.2. Choosing sides

Western and metropolitan powers frequently seem more concerned with
islands' locations than with islanders (Flint, 2021). All our narratives
involve instances of forced relocation. These are not exceptional. For
example, between 1967 and 1973, the British government undertook the
wholesale eviction of the Chagos Islanders to Seychelles and Mauritius,
making way for a joint British-USA military base. Similarly, the
histories of USA and French nuclear testing in Oceania illustrate the
impact of remoteness from the metropole: it is easy to ignore the
welfare of distant Indigenous populations.

In the past, "loss of land in one colonial site precipitated the
extraction of labourers from another and vice versa" (Banivanua Mar,
2016, p. 46). The same is true today, when the time and place of USA
military presence depends on constantly shifting geostrategic factors.
Plans are made to move US Marines from Okinawa to Guåhan at the same
time as plans are made to construct new military facilities at Henoko
Bay on Okinawa. The Japanese government\'s attentiveness to conditions
on Okinawa\'s smaller islands seems largely driven by military concerns
in Tokyo. Kalaallit Nunaat is now at the centre of discussion in both
Denmark and the USA, Jamaica feels itself under military pressure from
the USA, and the USA and Australia plan to strengthen their military
presence in Papua New Guinea by expanding Lombrum Naval Base on Manus
Island---not due to any obvious Chinese military threat to Western and
metropolitan interests but instead due to a Chinese economic challenge
to Western and metropolitan dominance. As Davis (2011, p. 221) notes of
USA overseas military bases in Oceania and the Caribbean, "**[the
imposition of bases on]{.underline}** these **[islands comes with a
painfully obvious political irony. [The US is using territories denied
basic rights]{.mark} of freedom and self-determination [to use military
force that]{.mark}, ostensibly, is being used to [promote these same
values]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

It is not lost on island governments that **[heavy military or economic
engagement with a Western or metropolitan state is prone to be
interpreted as a wholesale rejection of military or economic engagement
with China---and vice versa]{.underline}**. Thus, Kalaallit Nunaat\'s
acceptance of Danish and USA investment is widely seen as a promise that
Chinese businesses will not be permitted to play a major role in
Kalaallit Nunaat\'s economy, and the Jamaican government must constantly
weigh the potential economic benefits it receives from China against the
risk of being deemed a threat to USA security. Similarly, it is
suggested that long-term maintenance of aid and development assistance
from New Zealand to Niue and the Cook Islands and from Australia to
Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands is contingent upon these island
territories pulling back from engagement with China. Western engagement
in Oceania appears increasingly "reactionary," with New Zealand and
Australia playing catch-up on aid and the USA explicitly highlighting
the China threat as the key reason for boosting its presence
(Szadziewski, 2020, p. 3). The bipolar perspective on international
politics seeks to force island states and territories to choose sides
between China and the West.

5.3. A USA threat?

In our island narratives, **[[militarisation]{.mark} by colonial or
metropolitan powers [is explained]{.mark} in part [by the threat of
Chinese aggression. This]{.mark} argument [is circular]{.mark}, given
that [it is]{.mark} precisely the presence of [Western military
installations and]{.mark} USA [colonial outposts that]{.mark} could
[make]{.mark} these islands [sites of military
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At heart are "competing securities"
(Davis, 2020, p. 42), with the metropolitan state\'s "national security"
often existing in tension with islanders\' own conceptions of
'security'. "Danger is not an objective condition" (Campbell, 1992, p.
1), and "viewing continental geographies from the perspective of the
sea" (Bremner, 2016) can clarify aspects of both island-mainland and
mainland-mainland relationships.

Some colonisers and metropolitan powers seek to entrench their interests
in island territories by deploying the USA as a bogeyman: while China in
all cases remains the primary discursive threat, the governments of
Denmark and Japan have warned their respective colonised islands that
engagement with China or failure to accede to metropolitan desires risks
the USA just doing what it wants regardless. In the case of Okinawa,
this involves building and retaining military bases despite local
protests, and in the case of Kalaallit Nunaat, it involves warnings of
USA military intervention should the island open itself up to Chinese
businesses. Even though the only actual military presence on these
islands belongs to either the USA and/or the coloniser (China currently
possesses one overseas military base, located in Djibouti), and even
when metropolitan politicians hint of USA military invasion in the face
of Chinese business activity, it is China that is the primary enemy in
the discourse.

5.4. Neocolonial entrenchment

**[When [China is discussed]{.mark} in relation to colonised islands, it
is often [as a monolithic state entity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with
little or no distinction between individuals, private companies,
state-owned enterprises, universities, and central and local government
bodies. Furthermore, island perspectives on China tend to focus on
triangular (Guåhan-USA-China or Jamaica-USA-China) or four-sided
(Kalaallit Nunaat-USA-Denmark-China or Okinawa-USA-Japan-China) power
relationships, with little reference to other colonised peoples and
territories. Despite the bonds of transnational Indigenous activism,
regional cultural and business bodies, regional governance institutions,
etc., islanders largely remain within colonially structured
understandings of their islands' places in the world. Some islanders
believe the USA is acting oppressively, but we find little evidence of
islanders seeking to use the expansion of Chinese economic activity to
challenge the USA. In Kalaallit Nunaat, however, engagement with China
and the USA is seen as a means of challenging the coloniser, Denmark
(Kwong & Wong, 2020). Colonised societies may be open to wielding
whatever decolonial tools are at their disposal, even when this means
navigating conflicting sources of and responses to colonial power
(Harrison & Popke, 2018).

**[[The existential nature of the purported China threat---]{.mark}with
its military conflict, violently extractive environmental devastation,
and population replacement---[is used to justify neocolonial
entrenchment by the coloniser]{.mark} or metropolitan
power]{.underline}**. Traditional methods of maintaining influence in
and reaping benefits from former colonies are coming under increasing
critical scrutiny. As colonisers struggle to portray tied aid,
immigration schemes, and modernisation programmes as purely beneficent,
**[the [China threat discourse presents]{.mark} an opening for continued
[privileged influence]{.mark}. Metropolitan [essentialisations of
Indigenous peoples]{.mark} as part of nature and thus [as]{.mark}
fundamentally [irrational and non-modern]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Chandler & Reid, 2019) furthermore **[preclude Indigenous peoples from
making their own decisions on matters within the realm of rationality
and modernity, thereby [justify]{.mark}ing [Western paternalistic
policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Optimistically, we may speak of places such as Niue, Barbados, the
Maldives, and the Solomon Islands being able to weigh the options and
choose the partners that best suit their strategic needs. Often though,
this means using the China threat that has been deployed by the
coloniser to extract further economic support from the coloniser, which
may be what the coloniser wanted all along. Although the acquisition of
funds to pay for islander priorities is positive, it remains in the
interests of the colonial or metropolitan state to use such funds to
maintain influence.

For example, Kalaallit Nunaat certainly benefits from having Danish
investment in its airports, but Denmark uses this investment to
reinforce the idea that Kalaallit Nunaat cannot survive without Danish
support. The Danish and USA governments are actively driving away
potential Chinese investors and business partners and then offering to
fill the subsequent funding gaps. This follows a wider pattern of
Western and metropolitan governments simultaneously 1) affirming
islanders\' rights to make their own decisions, 2) presenting
island-metropole economic linkages as indicative of the former\'s
negative dependence on the latter, and 3) working to prevent islands
from forming alternative or parallel dependencies (Grydehøj, 2020b).

**[Western warnings that China engages in 'debt trap
diplomacy']{.underline}** and that Chinese loans, grants, and investment
should be avoided at all costs **[thus seem self-serving. For many
islands, the choice may be between making deals with Chinese actors or
making even worse deals with other actors]{.underline}**. Jamaica\'s
indebtedness, for example, long predates its receipt of Chinese aid and
investment, with the island state being placed under heavy financial and
political obligations to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
particular. In fact, funds derived from Chinese investments in Jamaica
have been crucial to repaying Jamaica\'s IMF debt (Johnston, 2015).
Across Oceania, openness toward engagement with China has partly been in
response to the impacts of Western aid contingent upon neoliberal
structural reforms and other burdens (Rodd, 2020; Szadziewski, 2020).
**[Guåhan receives an increasing number of Chinese tourists, but the
territory\'s [fortification and militarisation]{.mark} have been so
thorough as to [raise the question of what would become of the island
without a Chinese or other existential threat. Alternative futures are
difficult to envision]{.mark} when one\'s whole island has been
conceptualised as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier]{.underline}**" (Perez
Santos, 2019). **[[Island dependence becomes
self-reinforcing]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[One advantage to economic engagement with China is precisely that,
although strings may be attached, these strings are not
colonial]{.underline}**. The governments and peoples of Guåhan,
Kalaallit Nunaat, Okinawa, and Jamaica struggle with dependence on
economic actors that gain and maintain leverage by insisting on the
necessity of following Western or metropolitan practices and relying on
Western or metropolitan expertise. Islands should always exercise
caution when engaging with powerful external economic actors. However,
Chinese corporate focus on profit and state focus on expanding trade and
exercising soft power may be a relief for island societies with long
histories of outsiders coming in, destroying Indigenous cultures and/or
populations, devastating ecosystems, extracting resources for the
benefit of the metropole (frequently through enslaved or coerced
labour), and then blaming islanders for failing to more closely resemble
their colonisers. Chinese business engagement (whether with positive or
negative effects on island communities) simply lacks this emotional
baggage in most parts of the world. One author of this paper has herself
experienced this paternalism in Kalaallit Nunaat, where the Danish
system and thought processes are presented as the only proper way of
doing things: failure at adapting to these systems is regarded as
ineptitude, while desire to try other methods is regarded as a wholesale
rejection of Danish people, culture, and influence. In this context,
warnings emanating from Denmark regarding both China and the USA and the
purported incompatibility of their cultural and political systems with
Kalaallit Nunaat reinforce the idea that Inuit are incapable of making
their own reasoned decisions.

Across our island narratives, it is warned that increased Chinese
tourism and the entrance of Chinese business ventures risk overrunning,
overwhelming, or outcompeting island populations. **[[The spectre of
Chinese political and economic domination looms large]{.mark} in the
discourse of Western and metropolitan political actors. Yet for many
colonised islanders, [colonisation and domination]{.mark} by a foreign
people [is already a fact of life. The epistemic privilege through which
the West takes]{.mark} for granted [its]{.mark} own [centrality]{.mark}
has [contributed to]{.mark} island engagement with China being
conceptualised as a form of [neocolonialism]{.mark} in the absence of
prior colonialism]{.underline}**. A concept that arose in the context of
subaltern revolt against Western domination has been repurposed into a
Western tool for buttressing its privilege---a privilege that is largely
invisible to the West itself but is omnipresent in the eyes of the
colonised.

### L: China---2NC

#### Empirics [prove]{.underline} China won't escalate conflict

**[Shifrinson]{.underline}**, PhD, Assistant Professor of International
Relations, Fredrick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, BU,
**['20]{.underline}**

(Joshua, "The rise of China, balance of power theory and US national
security: Reasons for optimism?" *Journal of Strategic Studies*, Vol.
43)

This framework carries large implications for scholars and policymakers
seeking to understand China's strategy as its power grows and US
relative power declines. As noted, many analysts fear that a rising
China will embark on a predatory course designed to push the United
States down or from the great power ranks. Although it is difficult in
the abstract to describe what the particular elements of Chinese
predation may entail, [the general concern seems to be]{.underline} that
[China will adopt steps that will **rapidly shift the distribution of
power**]{.underline} its favour [by enacting policies that are
increasingly costly]{.underline} [for a]{.underline} relatively
[declining United States]{.underline} to overcome, [pushing the United
States to exhaust itself]{.underline} competing [or to surrender the
issues at stake]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus
**[imperil]{.underline}** [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[position as a great power]{.underline}. Elements of this approach might
involve Chinese efforts to engage in economic warfare by hindering US
economic competitiveness and limiting American economic opportunities;
adumbrate US military advantages; undercut US credibility and prestige;
and weaken US alliances in East Asia or beyond.55 Furthermore, recent
Chinese actions in and around East Asia seemingly give credence to such
concerns. After all, the last decade has witnessed China take an
increasingly assertive stance in its maritime disputes in the South and
East China Seas56 ; enact an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over
the East China Sea57 ; make political and economic inroads into Central
Asia and Africa58 ; influence the domestic politics of Asia-Pacific
states to favour pro-China policies; and expand its defence budget.59
Concurrently, trade tensions with the United States are rising, and the
Chinese government has tried to buttress its authority by cracking down
on domestic opponents.60

China's current strategy: Mixed

**[It is [too early]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[to
declare]{.mark} Chinese [predation]{.mark} a fact]{.underline}**, [just
as there are reasons to question whether Chinese predation is likely in
the future]{.underline}. [On one level, and consistent with
research]{.underline} by scholars such as Avery Goldstein, Alastair Iain
Johnston and others, [there are **less-competitive elements**
**embedded**]{.underline} [in current Chinese strategy]{.underline}.61
**[Chinese [land reclamation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and military
deployments **[in the East]{.underline}** and South [China
Seas]{.underline}, [for instance, have mostly [involved territories
**previously claimed**]{.mark} by the Chinese government]{.underline} --
**[China has not expanded its maritime claims]{.underline}** [so much as
**taken a unilateral approach towards resolving existing
disputes**.]{.underline}62 [Similarly, **China's ADIZ** move **came
after Japan expanded its own ADIZ** and began consolidating control over
the disputed Senkaku Islands]{.underline}.63

[It is also important to recognise]{.underline} that [there are steps
[China **could**]{.mark} plausibly **[have]{.mark}
undertaken**]{.underline} in recent years **[[yet chose not
to]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Despite concerns over]{.underline} a
[Chinese military build-up]{.underline}, for instance, [China did not
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline} [the share of state wealth allocated to
[military spending]{.mark}]{.underline}; military expenditures have
remained at 1.9 per cent of Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) since
2009.64 Likewise, [China has sustained a **minimalist** nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} [even though this force is vulnerable to
disruption]{.underline}.65 [Above all,]{.underline} **[China has not
tried to [form an anti-US alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in East Asia
-- [in fact, there is some evidence that China has **sought to keep the
United States engaged**]{.underline} in East Asia **[rather than exclude
it]{.underline}**.66 For example, [not only did]{.underline} Chinese
President Xi Jinping tell US President Barack Obama in 2014 that the
'Pacific Ocean has ample space to accommodate our two great nations,'
but China's Xinhua news agency greeted Donald Trump's election -- after
a campaign marked by calls for a reduced US role in the world -- with a
warning against US isolationism.67 **[These [moves]{.mark} are [not
consistent with]{.mark} a [predatory campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
[China is pursuing a mixed strategy]{.underline} [that blends both
cooperative and competitive elements]{.underline}.

Of course, it is possible that [Chinese strategy may give
way]{.underline} to predation in the future. [Still]{.underline}, the
approach developed above highlights that [China's future course will
ultimately depend]{.underline} [upon China's threat
environment]{.underline} and the constraints and opportunities this
imposes. And on this basis, [a series of **quantitative**]{.underline}
and qualitative [indicators provides room for **cautious
optimism**]{.underline} [that China **will [at]{.mark} [worst]{.mark}
continue its [mixed strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} vis-à-vis the United
States. As importantly, [there are reasons that China may]{.underline}
-- under certain conditions -- [adopt a supportive
strategy]{.underline}. The logic here is simple: [not only is
China's]{.underline} threat [environment]{.underline} [such that it is
far from clear whether the PRC **would be able to systematically
challenge**]{.underline} the United States [without **significantly
harming its security**]{.underline}, [but China faces competitors
besides the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Combined, these
factors should give China pause before pursuing a predatory course, and
may even offer ground for supporting the United States.

#### China threats are constructed to justify aggression towards China to protect American identity\-\--makes their impacts a self-fulfilling prophecy

**[Turner 13]{.underline}**, Oliver\-\--Research Associate at the Brooks
World Poverty Institute, 2013 ("'Threatening' China and US security: the
international politics of identity," Review of International Studies, pp
1-22)

**[The modern day [China 'threat']{.mark} to the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is not an unproblematic, neutrally
verifiable phenomenon. It [is an imagined construction of American
design and the product of societal representations
which]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to a significant extent, **[have
[established the truth that a 'rising' China endangers US
security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is an increasingly acknowledged,
but still relatively under-developed, concept within the literature.121
The purpose of this article has been to expose **[how 'threats' from
China towards the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[have
always been contingent upon subjective interpretation]{.underline}**.
The three case studies chosen represent those moments across the
lifetime of Sino-US relations at which China has been perceived as most
threatening to American security. The 'threats' emerged in highly
contrasting eras. The nature of each was very different and they emerged
from varying sources (broadly speaking, from immigration in the
nineteenth century and from 'great power' rivalry in the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries). Yet in this way they most effectively
demonstrate how **[[China 'threats' have repeatedly existed as socially
constructed phenomenon]{.mark}. Collectively they reveal the consistent
centrality of understandings about the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[in perceptions of external
danger]{.underline}**. They demonstrate that, **[[regardless of China\'s
ability to assert material force or]{.mark} of [the manner in which
it]{.mark} has been seen to [impose itself]{.mark} upon the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[[the reality of
danger can be manufactured and made real. China 'threats' have always
been threats to American identity]{.mark} so that the individual sources
of 'danger']{.underline}**--- whether a nuclear capability or an influx
of (relatively few) foreign immigrants--- **[have never been the sole
determining factors.]{.underline}** As James Der Derian notes, danger
can be ascribed to otherness wherever it may be found.122 During the
mid-to-late nineteenth century and throughout the early Cold War,
perceptions of China 'threats' provoked crises of American identity. The
twenty-first-century China 'threat' is yet to be understood in this way
but it remains inexplicable in simple material terms. As ever, **[[the
physical realities of China]{.mark} are important but they [are
interpreted in such a way to make them
threatening]{.mark}]{.underline}**, regardless of Beijing\'s intentions.
Most importantly, this article has shown how processes of representation
have been complicit at every stage of the formulation, enactment, and
justification of US China policy. Their primary purpose has been to
dislocate China\'s identity from that of the United States and introduce
opportunities for action. Further, those
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves **[[have reaffirmed the
discourses of separation and difference which make China foreign]{.mark}
from the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[[protecting
American identity from the imagined threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Ultimately, this analysis has sought to expose the inadequacy of
approaches to the study of US China policy which privilege and
centralise material forces to the extent that ideas are subordinated or
even excluded. Joseph Nye argues that the **[[China Threat
Theory]{.underline}]{.mark}** has the potential to become a
self-fulfilling prophecy. Based upon a crude hypothetical assumption
that there exists a 50 per cent chance of China becoming aggressive and
a 50 per cent chance of it not, Nye explains, to treat China as an enemy
now effectively discounts 50 per cent of the future.123 In such way he
emphasises the ideational constitution of material forces and the power
of discourse to create selected truths about the world so that certain
courses of action are enabled while others are precluded. Assessments
such as those of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in
March 2011 **[[should]{.mark} therefore [not only be considered
misguided, but]{.mark} also potentially
[dangerous]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For while they appear to represent
authoritative statements of fact **[they]{.underline}** actually **[rely
upon subjective assumptions about China and]{.underline}** the
**[material capabilities]{.underline}** he describes. In late 2010
President Obama informed Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that 'the American
people \[want\] to continue to build a growing friendship and strong
relationship between the peoples of China and the United States'.124 The
hope, of course, is that a peaceful and cooperative future can be
secured. Following the announcement that the Asia Pacific is to
constitute the primary focus of Washington\'s early twenty-first-century
foreign policy strategy, American interpretations of China must be
acknowledged as a central force within an increasingly pertinent
relationship. The basis of their relations will always be fundamentally
constituted by ideas and history informs us that particular American
discourses of China have repeatedly served to construct vivid and
sometimes regrettable realities about that country and its people.
Crucially, it tells us that they have always been inextricable from the
potentialities of US China policy. As Sino-US relations become
increasingly consequential **[the intention must be for American
representations of the PRC]{.underline}**--- and indeed Chinese
representations of the United States--- **[to become the focus of more
concerted scholarly attention]{.underline}**. Only in this way can the
contours of those relations be more satisfactorily understood, so that
the types of historical episodes explored in this analysis might somehow
be avoided in the future.

### L: Deterrence

#### The attachment to [credible deterrence]{.underline} creates [imperial violence]{.underline} and [instability]{.underline}\-\--sustained and predictable deterrence postures are [impossible]{.underline} in IR, which instead becomes a justification for [military interventions]{.underline}

Research Center at Cornell University.

present, forging radical alternatives, 2016, 49-51,
<https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315883700>

Importantly, **[[the predicates underlying]{.mark} this ideological
formulation of [the relationship between the West and others
suggests]{.mark} necessity and enforcement through
cooperation]{.underline}** or confrontation. In either case, **[the
contemporaneous Western language of geopolitics has provided
pre-ordained answers: redress through treaty]{.underline}**
**[enforcement]{.underline}**, wars of attrition, **[and [enforcement
through military interventions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As a result, from
the discovery of the New World through the slave trade and colonialism
and decolonization, the relations between, on the one hand, continental
Europe **[states and]{.underline}** European **[entities dispersed
through the world and]{.underline}**, on the other**[, political and
cultural entities elsewhere have been mediated by a language of command
unilaterally directed at others: the assumption of the sovereign right
to defend the 'national interest']{.underline}** and unidirectional
extra-territoriality.

**[[There is no standard of violence]{.mark} in this context [other than
that deemed necessary]{.mark} or sufficient [by]{.mark} those with [the
sovereign]{.mark} right to intervene]{.underline}**. Hence, **[[it
is]{.mark} almost [an article of faith that anyone disrupting the
prescribed order must pay]{.mark} in discomfort (military
coercion),]{.underline}** materials (expropriation under occupation),
and sovereignty (stripping local sovereignties of the essential
dimensions of sovereignty allowable to the hegemon).

**[This predetermination of the terms of the
relationships]{.underline}** between Europe and **[others has
necessarily prescribed a commensurate commitment to the requisite
technologies of intervention]{.underline}**. One need not endorse Vijay
Prashad's The Darker Nations (2008) to concur with him that **[European
[violence]{.mark} in non-European empires [has been]{.mark} deliberately
[wedded to]{.mark} the ideology of pre-ordainment]{.underline}**: if no
longer the path of God, it is still the path of reason and pragmatism.
In any case, to reprise an earlier statement, **[[the idea that the West
has a right of intervention]{.mark} is given, as is the determination to
intervene]{.underline}**. Related without dispute are the following: by
faith or reason (or today's rule of law), **[Europe is responsible for
those who might be outside it; the West is answerable
for,]{.underline}** and by right concerned with, **[what happens all
over the globe[; the West will generate]{.mark}]{.underline}** (when
necessary in consultation with others) **[the principles, norms, and
[symbols of communications through which assurances are given to]{.mark}
the self and [others]{.mark};]{.underline}** **[[the West]{.mark} alone
[determines the values]{.mark} or standards [by which]{.mark} conformity
with and [transgressions]{.mark} of its proclaimed universal values [are
measured]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**['Just' use of [violence]{.mark} in this context [is]{.mark} measured
by its propriety as technique, [coterminous with an imperial
desire]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to bring pagans, miscreants, and other
metaphorically fallen entities back into the fold. This can only be done
through intervention by self-professed masters of the universe
**[[to]{.mark} protect themselves and their pre-ordained destiny as
inheritors of the Kingdom]{.underline}**, **[[dispense with illegitimate
sovereigns]{.mark} who endanger the Kingdom, [and]{.mark}
[conquer]{.mark} and subordinate]{.underline}** (once in God's name and
now by reason) heathens and other **['unknowing' sinners]{.underline}**
for their redemption. **[[This]{.mark} outlook [remains central to
modern empires and is a key structuring event of]{.mark} international
relations \[[IR]{.mark}\].]{.underline}**, morality, **[and
existence]{.underline}**.

Time, consciousness, affectivity, and law

**[The right to intervene has ideational]{.underline}**,
constitutional**[, and institutional requirements]{.underline}**.
**[These operate mostly]{.underline}** in the domestic realm when life
decisions are made, **[particularly in security]{.underline}**, access
of resources, and their production, distribution, and consumption. In
these latter instances, **[questions of t]{.underline}**he constitution
and **[institutions]{.underline}** such as the state **[are not merely
standards for determining the propriety of conduct of national
officialdom]{.underline}** or measures of the satisfaction of citizens
with the nature of their relationships with the state. Appreciation of
the law, morality, and ethics appears in the national context
differently than **[[in IR where clarification is demanded]{.mark} in
the relationships between self and others]{.underline}**, between the
freedom and security of nationals and of other nationals, **[between the
security of one state and other states]{.underline}**. **[The responses
to these [demands depend on]{.mark} intangibles and
tangibles]{.underline}**. **[The intangibles include [psychic
dispositions (toward fear]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for instance),
**[psychological factors]{.underline}** (pertaining to, say,
consciousness or awareness, feeling, and motivation) **[and symbolic
resources (intellectual assets, knowledges).]{.underline}** Together,
**[these define the sense individuals and collectives have of the
physical and moral landscape of international relations]{.underline}**.
**[By landscape, I mean]{.underline}** not only regions and the
mechanisms and institutions connecting them but also **[the flows and
dynamics traversing them]{.underline}**. The natural corporeal and
non-corporeal endowments providing access to this landscape do so
through the senses and are expressed through the faculty by which the
body perceives external entities.

**[From the prior formulation, two kinds of sense are implicated into
one another]{.underline}**. **[The first is an historical
sense]{.underline}** (or appreciation) **[of the operation of the
senses]{.underline}** (or faculties) **[on its objects]{.underline}**.
This is determined by the psychology and other sciences of the brain.
**[The second is a sense producing the faculties that is itself the
product of their operations]{.underline}**. One such product is
consciousness, also a faculty. **[Each influences the
other]{.underline}** (Jay 2011). It is often assumed consciousness is
formed through the interactions of fundamental entities: time, space,
and matter. **[Each entity has unique properties, but all are
intricately connected in the manners in which knowledge
operates]{.underline}**, previously by psychology and now by
neuroscience and psychophysics.

To be precise, **[the relation relevant to me is not one implicated in
the physicality of space-time or time-space]{.underline}**. Rather,
**[it is phenomenological]{.underline}** -- that is, **[the manners in
which [time-space]{.mark} [relations]{.mark} are experienced in concrete
circumstances]{.underline}**. In this context, consciousness manifests
itself as a factor of appreciation of time and space and as a means to
integrate the dynamics and flows of time and within space. Consciousness
is not the sum of all knowledges available to the individual mind **[as
it [synthesizes the landscape of social relations,]{.mark} regional
connections, and human activities in conjunction with
temporal]{.underline}** and cultural **[understandings of the
requirement of life for self and others]{.underline}**. What is it then?

**[International relations does not depend on]{.underline}** either
constitutional self-understandings by states or **[observances of
international legal stipulations on global coexistence]{.underline}**.
Rather, **[the existing]{.underline}** constitutional and **[[legal
dispositions are augmented by]{.mark} temporal factors, including the
[imperial drive to conquer and colonize]{.mark} any related spatial
affects.]{.underline}** Whether these may be called national cultures or
not, **[spatially defined entities historically internalize feelings
toward self and others that leave significant impressions on the
mind]{.underline}**, shaping reflexes and moving intellect and body at
the time of decision. **[[These affects]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the way
**[they [shape responses]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the extent to which **[they [characterize
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}** can be filed under the rubric of
affectivity.

**[Important strands of [i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations
scholarship]{.underline}** have followed the intellectual ascendance of
economics and **[[focus]{.mark} attention]{.underline}** **[largely [on
the]{.mark} putatively [controllable world of risk]{.mark}, while
largely neglecting the uncontrollable world of uncertainty. By doing so,
they [train our sight only on control power]{.mark}, sideline protean
power, [and are unable to analyze the
unpredictable]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, in her authoritative
and sophisticated analysis of risk-taking in international politics Rose
McDermott writes that risk inheres in any situation where there exists
uncertainty.59 She combines both risk and uncertainty as she identifies
underlying mechanisms of risk propensity that occur under conditions of
"high" uncertainty. While it is impossible to scale the magnitude of
uncertainty, it is possible to distinguish between two different kinds
of uncertainty. Known unknowns create operational uncertainty, which,
given more or better knowledge and information, may transform into
calculable risk. Far from being a panacea, however, in situations of
operational uncertainty more or better knowledge or information, as in
the squeezing of a balloon, simply pushes radical uncertainty into some
other, unrecognized part of the political context. Unknown unknowns are
unknowable and cannot be converted to risk. Although she does not make
the distinction between the two kinds of unknowns, McDermott
acknowledges the importance of operational unknowns. She writes "most
complex choices fall under the framework of judgment under uncertainty
and decision-making under risk because it is impossible to predict the
characteristics of many different variables simultaneously in advance,
especially when they may have unknown interaction effects. Even the
nature of many of the critical variables may be unknown beforehand."60
Yet, in line with current practice of **[[i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations scholarship]{.underline}**, as she further develops
and applies prospect theory, McDermott puts aside the problem of
uncertainty. She **[thus [makes invisible the practice-driven]{.mark},
protean [power-generating actor responses to]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
**[[uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The present [framework
insists on the need for completeness]{.mark}, rather than narrow
selectiveness, in studying world politics and offers means of
considering approaches focusing on risk-based control power alongside
those tracing protean power practices in the face of
uncertainty.]{.underline}**61 **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** invention
and the **[[destructiveness of]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear
**[[weapons epitomizes the quest for control]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
core idea of nuclear **[[deterrence is "the threat that leaves something
to chance]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Based on the previously noted
mistranslation of Weber, "chance" here is understood to describe risk
rather than risk and uncertainty. Possible protean power effects are
thus rendered invisible. Articulated and developed by Thomas Schelling
in the 1950s and 1960s, **[a risk-based understanding of chance has had
a pervasive influence on the theory and practice of]{.underline}**
nuclear **[deterrence for the last half century]{.underline}**.62
**[[The idea]{.underline}]{.mark}** is based on Schelling's highly
creative conceptual move that **[[reduces]{.mark} [uncontrollable
uncertainty to manageable risk]{.mark} and thus from a problem to a
solution for the issuing of credible]{.underline}** nuclear
**[threats.]{.underline}** For Schelling, **[uncontrollable, accidental
factors feed seamlessly into an escalation of controlled, competitive
risk-taking. [Accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in this theory**[, [are
drawn from a known probability distribution that]{.mark} is said to
[increase as each party draws closer to the brink]{.mark}. In
Schelling's theory]{.underline}** nuclear **[[accidents do not
exist]{.mark}. For accidents do not cause nuclear war; decisions do.
[Accidents are reduced to decisions to manage risk]{.mark} in a
particular manner. They are]{.underline}** no more than **[[appendices
of rational decisions]{.mark}. And decisions are constrained
by]{.underline}** the **[logic]{.underline}** that deterrence theory
articulates. Schelling does not allow the theoretical possibility of
accidental nuclear use or nuclear accidents to impose any limits on
risk-based deterrence models. In this reading, "**[the threat that
leaves something to chance]{.underline}**" **[is so only in terms of
probabilities [transforming]{.mark}]{.underline}** nuclear **[[weapons
into means of control]{.mark}, wielded by actors with select attributes,
rather than creating room for unanticipated challenges to existing rules
of interaction.]{.underline}** It squeezes out of the model
unacknowledged, unfathomable unknowns, contingencies and
indeterminacies. **[[Establishing]{.mark} the [power]{.mark} of full
control over "the]{.underline}** ultimate **[weapon" [upholds the claim
that the theory explains the uncontrollable]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Probabilistic and possibilistic thinking are not interactive and
co-evolving but fuse into a double mask. By transforming, in one
theoretical move, uncontrollable uncertainty into manageable risk
Schelling offers a compelling theory of control power.63 With the
elaboration of the concept of an organizational doomsday machine
subsequent scholarship on nuclear deterrence has taken this approach to
its (il)logical extreme.64 **[Schelling's work has had large
consequences]{.underline}** not only for the study of nuclear deterrence
but **[for the study of war.]{.underline}** In the last two decades,
**[students of security studies have developed and tested extensively
what is now known as the bargaining model of war. It offers a risk-based
view of war that highlights control power and mostly disregards
uncertainty and protean power dynamics.]{.underline}**65 **[This is made
possible by the bargaining model's first core assumption: the parties to
a conflict subscribe to the same understanding of how the world
works.]{.underline}**66 This is vital for the model to work. **[Yet [it
is often wildly implausible to believe]{.mark} that [parties]{.mark}
locked in possibly deadly conflict [share the same
understanding]{.mark}.]{.underline}**67 **[Imagination and potentiality
of how the world might work, central to protean power analysis, thus
escape the attention of the bargaining model. Uncertainty is
key]{.underline}** in allowing competing models of the world to be
sustained. I**[t leads to irreducible and consequential deviations away
from expectations created or implied by risk-based models. [Convergence
of views around one model]{.mark} thus [does not occur.]{.mark} Based on
the implausible assumption of convergence, rationalist models proceed to
think about actors with different preferences.]{.underline}** If they
decide to fight, each side will pay a cost while fighting**[. These
costs open up a range of bargained solutions that both sides should
prefer to war. For the bargaining model, [the puzzle of war is why the
two parties fail to settle]{.mark} within the range of bargained
solutions before war breaks out, knowing that war is always inefficient
after its outbreak. The answer]{.underline}** to the puzzle **[lies in
the existence of imperfections in information and the incentive to
misrepresent,]{.underline}** on the one hand, **[and the inability to
credibly commit to an agreement that prevents war]{.underline}**, on the
other. **[The model introduces a second core assumption: updating of
information will select out inferior models of the world. But [in
security affairs]{.mark}, misperceptions, the fog of war, [and a host
of]{.mark} other [factors prevent]{.mark} the emergence of a succession
of [probability-based, improved models]{.mark}.]{.underline}** There
exists no urn from which to pull red or white balls; players are
color-blind; and there is no way of updating expectations based on the
number of balls left in the urn. Instead, **[there is a lot of bluffing
and interpretation. [Crises are generators of uncertainty rather than
risks]{.mark} with associated probabilities that are known or
knowable]{.underline}**.68 In short, **[on issues of war]{.underline}**
and peace **[world politics simply does not offer]{.underline}**, as the
bargaining model assumes, **[a sufficiently large number of trials to
select out inferior causal models. Even if all actors shared the same
model of the world, which they do not, these [models would
fail]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By making strong but implausible
assumptions, **[the bargaining model of war focuses on the calculable
directionality of control power and overlooks the]{.underline}**
creative imagination, or even **[improvised coping that generates
protean power and transforms the surrounding uncertainty further
still.]{.underline}** **[The bargaining model holds that different
conclusions about future outcomes are possible, but only because of
differences in information not because of differences in worldviews
about the salience of risk and uncertainty. [The probability of
victory]{.mark} in any conflict and the cost of fighting [are assumed to
be calculable and subject to]{.mark} known or [knowable
probabilities]{.mark} by all parties to the conflict. However,
[disagreements are unavoidable]{.mark} when actors put the same
information to work in different worldviews.]{.underline}** As is true
elsewhere**[, in world politics rationality takes the form of many
situationally specific kinds of reasonableness.]{.underline}** And
**[standards of reasonableness differ in worldviews populated
by]{.underline}** different cosmologies, different historical memories,
different conspiracy theories, different emotions, and
**[different]{.underline}** moral **[prescriptions. For example, during
the Cold War many [American analysts]{.mark} and decision-makers
[believed that they had reached an understanding]{.mark} with the Soviet
Union about the stability-inducing effects of a robust arms control
regime. [Russian archives]{.mark} opened after the end of the Cold War
[revealed a starkly different picture]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the
mid-1980s, **[the Soviet Union had deployed a near-automatic nuclear
strike force, which had been decades in the making. Because it was kept
totally secret, this doomsday machine lacked the rationality of nuclear
deterrence that makes contingent irrationality look
rational.]{.underline}**69 "**[[The Soviet
Union]{.underline}]{.mark}**," writes David Hoffman, "**[[was looking
through an entirely different prism]{.mark} than the United
States]{.underline}**."70 **[It is a stroke of luck that today we are in
a position to study this near-calamity.]{.underline}** Conversely,
**[the period of détente in the 1970s rested on a bedrock of illusions
that US and Soviet decision-makers shared about each
other]{.underline}**. "**[The [superpowers]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"
writes Eric Grynaviski, "**[[were simply wrong]{.mark}; they did not
understand each other as well as they thought]{.underline}**."71
Misunderstanding in this instance secured cooperation that accurate
information would have stymied. Filtered through different worldviews,
shared information can be destructive or constructive. It is not the
information but the worldview that drives actors toward war or peace.
Worldviews that incorporate constitutive elements of risk/uncertainty
and actor experiences can capture protean power dynamics; information
models that exclude those elements cannot. Furthermore, many bargaining
models typically suffer from the problem of multiple equilibria --
solutions a rational player would not depart from voluntarily. The folk
theorem establishes that the existence of multiple equilibria is
unavoidable in repeated games with incomplete information and an
appropriate discount for future payoffs. More complicated models that
include uncertainty do exist. But the practical challenge of building
models that can handle non-Gaussian distributions is formidable. In
Lance Taylor's words, "reliably estimating parameters that specify the
form of distributions with fat tails is difficult if not impossible --
one reason why this approach has not been widely pursued."72 Put simply,
because models that incorporate uncertainty are messy and technically
intractable most scholars of international relations who have adopted
the bargaining model do not work with them and thus make us overlook the
relevance of uncertainty in shaping actor responses in world politics.
Because of these shortcomings, scholars relying on the bargaining model
of war systematically bias political analysis toward the management of
risk through control power. One of the original proponents of **[the
bargaining model of war]{.underline}**, James Fearon, **[conflates risk
and uncertainty when \[it states\]]{.underline}** he writes "**[given
identical information, truly rational agents should reason to the same
conclusion about the probability of one uncertain outcome or
another]{.underline}**."73 **[This conflation of the two concepts has
become deeply engrained in many theoretical extensions and empirical
applications of the bargaining model]{.underline}**. Andrew Kydd and
Barbara Walter, for example, build their analysis of different
strategies of terrorist violence on the bargaining model of war.74 In
doing so, they implausibly assume that terrorists are impelled by the
same signaling and commitment logic as are states. Trafficking in
uncertainty, they are not. Matthew Kroenig's analysis of nuclear
bargaining implicitly equates risk with uncertainty.75 He argues that
coercive nuclear bargaining and nuclear brinkmanship rest on the
manipulation of risk through "anguished" calculations of probabilities
in situations of uncertainty and incomplete information. Page Fortna's
analysis of ceasefire agreements is similarly inattentive to the
difference between risk and uncertainty.76 Fortna argues that war is
risky since there is always a chance of losing rather than winning;
uncertainty can undermine cooperation even when perfect information
should yield cooperation automatically. Her empirical analysis relies on
statistical models and significance tests that operate entirely in the
world of risk.77 Finally, relying on the language of the bargaining
model of war, Debs and Monteiro argue that power shifts can be explained
by information problems. Their model "provides specific probabilities
for each event. The fact that the deterrer and target are uncertain
about each other's actions is realistic."78 In sum, **[important
analyses of nuclear deterrence, terrorist violence, nuclear
brinkmanship, ceasefires in civil conflicts, and power shifts are either
reducing uncertainty to risk or treating the terms as
synonyms.]{.underline}**79 **[This is odd in light of the models' focus
on bargaining which is conducted by specific actors with specific
experiences and balancing unique, locally anchored but broadly
influential understandings of reality. Hunches and
intuitions]{.underline}** **[may be hard to measure and
cannot]{.underline}**, by definition, **[be systematized into a single
model; nevertheless, they can play important roles in shaping bargaining
outcomes]{.underline}**. In their inattentiveness to such dynamics the
authors of existing models differ from Napoleon who, acknowledging risk
and uncertainty, had strong feelings about his generals. Although many
of them were smart, he was partial to the lucky ones. The problem lies
in the realm of theory rather than its application to questions of
security. Hedley Bull noticed long ago that **[the central
ideas]{.underline}** in Thomas Schelling's work **[were not derived
solely from formal game theory operating in the world of risk; they also
represented "an imaginative conceptual exercise" dealing with the
problem of uncertainty]{.underline}**.80 In contrast to Schelling
himself, scholars applying the bargaining model of war have overlooked
the centrality of imagination. "In the final analysis," Schelling
writes, "**[we are dealing with imagination as much as with logic \...
poets may do better than logicians at this game \... Logic helps \...
but usually not until imagination has selected some clue to work
on]{.underline}**."81 **[Bypassi]{.underline}**ng **[the technical
virtuosity of formal models of war]{.underline}**, Jonathan Mercer
similarly **[stress]{.underline}**es **[the importance of creativity.
Neglecting the importance of creativity]{.underline}** political
scientists **[risk\[s\] "turning sophisticated political actors into lab
rats \... They have done so because predicting creativity is
difficult]{.underline}** and perhaps impossible -- if one can predict
creativity it cannot be very creative."82 In short, **[imagination and
creativity are integral to and constitutive of a world that mixes risk
with uncertainty and control with protean power.]{.underline}**

The celebration of **[NATO's 70 years of existence
provides]{.underline}** another **[opportunity to unearth the real
history of the ideas, practices and destruction wrought by this military
alliance. Even with]{.underline}** the clear **[exposure of the
cooperation between [NATO,]{.mark} the CIA and the British MI6 to
[spread terror and psychological warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
Europe immediately after the formation of this military alliance, the
**[mainstream [media, academics and policy makers remain silent
on]{.mark}]{.underline}** activities of the 'stay behind armies' and
**[['false flag' op]{.mark}eration[s that distorted]{.mark} the [real
causes of insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the world after 1945. The
evidence of the manipulations of the peoples of the world to ensure the
continued survival of NATO has been well documented in the fraudulent
interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the present multiple
wars against the peoples of Iran. Vijay Prashad had **[identified NATO
as the prime defender of]{.underline}** the Atlantic project. This
Atlantic project, he noted was, "a fairly straightforward campaign by
the **[propertied classes]{.underline}** to maintain or restore their
**[position of dominance]{.underline}**." This Atlantic Project was
anchored in the military alliance called NATO with its principal work,
that of reversing the South Project; the struggles for peace bread and
justice by the poorer citizens of the planet, especially those who had
emerged on the world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and
the Caribbean. **[The ostensive reason for [the founding of NATO was to
'thwart' Soviet aggression, but in practice]{.mark} the organization
[was a prop for western capital]{.mark} and]{.underline}** after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, became the core prop for **[Wall
Street]{.underline}**. In this year, there will be many commentaries on
the fact that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold War relic, that NATO
is obsolete and lost its mandate, but very few will link the expansion
of NATO to the military management of the international system. Prior to
1991, the planners of NATO could justify the existence of NATO on
ideological and political grounds, but with the threat of a multi polar
world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO expanded to the point where
this author joined with others in labelling this organization Global
NATO to reflect its current imperial mandate. **[The Global thrust of
NATO now comprises 29 members from Europe and North America along with
41 'partners' that had started off under the banner of the North
Atlantic Cooperation Council]{.underline}** (NACC) in 1991. **[Since
that time, NATO has launched a lengthy war without end in Afghanistan,
colluded in the destruction of Iraq and conspired with militarists to
forge 'Partnership for Peace']{.underline}** (**[with]{.underline}**
most **[members of the former Warsaw Pact states]{.underline}**). The
core 29 members are now enmeshed with treaties and undertakings from
states involved in the Mediterranean Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. There are
also **[the 'partners' from across the globe: Afghanistan, Australia,
Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and
Pakistan]{.underline}**. This enlargement **[served the military
purposes of encircling China and Russia]{.underline}** who military
planners in the West targeted. There is no shortage of literature on
NATO and its milestones, but very **[few have documented the real crimes
of this global network of anticommunist operatives who precipitated real
terror and psychological warfare]{.underline}** against the citizens of
Europe and North America **[while supporting]{.underline}** mass
**[atrocities from Algeria to Indonesia]{.underline}**, and South
Africa. Books such as that of NATO's Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and
Terrorism in Western Europe by Danielle Ganser and The Brothers: John
Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War, by Stephen
Kinzer used rigorous research techniques to uncover the dark history of
NATO. These two books can be distinguished from the bland international
relations texts that discusses NATO inside the old calculations of
'strategy,' 'concert of democracies', 'security cooperation' and the
balance of power,' and spheres of influence. Most recently, this IR
rendering of the history of NATO has been served up in a document
entitled, NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard
University with one of the coauthors being a former US ambassador to
NATO. This document spelt out ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a
testimony before Congress, Nicolas Burns boiled down the challenge of
NATO to one objective; that the current role of NATO must be to contain
Russia and China.\[2\] On the day before the actual 70thanniversary, on
April 3, the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to
a joint session of the US Congress advocating an expansion of the
alliance while promoting a military buildup against Russia. \[3\]
European progressives will have to reflect deeply on whether the current
sanctions regime and the special propose vehicle called the Instrument
in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of
inter imperialist rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939.
Then, the **[shifting alliances yielded confusion among working peoples
who ultimately went to fight against each other in Europe, spreading
barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima.]{.underline}** The continued struggles for bread, peace and
justice ensure that it is only the authoritarian leaders from the Global
South who are compromised on the real meaning of the existence of NATO.
In the present era, **[there is a new capitalist competition
while]{.underline}** North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**) **[serves as an [integral part of the
Pentagon's world command]{.mark} structure.]{.underline}** Recent
experiences have demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that **[the
moguls of Wall Street are willing [to wage as many wars]{.mark}, to
[destroy]{.mark} as many [countries and]{.mark} to [kill as many
people]{.mark} as necessary [to achieve]{.mark} the [dominance
of]{.mark} US [capitalism]{.mark}. The destruction of Libya was a
classic example of the convergence of finance as warfare, the
weaponization of information and incessant bombing to destroy a
society.]{.underline}** Where at the start of NATO the war scare was the
propaganda method, **[In the]{.underline}** current **[digital age,
brain hacking and the engineering of smart phones have
placed]{.underline}** the **[giant technology firms]{.underline}** of
Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook **[at the forefront of the
new weapons platform of NATO and Wall Street.]{.underline}** This
analysis is in three parts spelling out the rationale for the call for
all progressive forces to join together to concentrate their energies in
the dismantling of NATO. NATO at Birth: Stay behind armies, directed
terrorist organizations and psychological warfare against Europeans. In
the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall there were major press
reports on the role of NATO's stay behind armies that had been operating
inside Western Europe since 1949.Ten years earlier, when **[the
kidnapping and killing of the former Italian Prime Minister, Aldo
Moro]{.underline}** rocked western Europe, it emerged that his demise
**[had been authored by]{.underline}** clandestine paramilitary network
code-named **["Operation Gladio"]{.underline}** that was a false flag
operation of NATO. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's Secret Armies:
Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had meticulously
documented how **[[NATO funded and]{.mark} often even [directed
terrorist organizations throughout Europe]{.mark} in what was termed a
"strategy of tension" with the aim of [preventing a rise of the
left]{.mark} in Western European politics]{.underline}**. NATO's "secret
armies" engaged in subversive and criminal activities in several
countries. In the specific case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the
unforgivable crime of contemplating a government that included Italians
who belonged to the Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the
Cold war, **[the CIA and MI6 had worked closely with former fascists to
oppose]{.underline}** citizens and **[organizations]{.underline}** in
Western Europe **[that were anti-capitalists]{.underline}**. Under the
leadership of US planners such as Allen Dulles, William Colby, Frank
Wisner and later James Angleton, these operatives weaned and nursed a
network of agents and secret arms dumps across Europe, a network that
would remain secret but active throughout the Cold War. \[4\] Ganser
elaborated on the extensive operations of Operation Gladio all across
Europe with the explicit aim of subverting the democratic wishes of
European citizens who were opposed to oppression. It is worth quoting at
length the role of the secret armies. **[["NATO's "secret
armies"]{.underline}]{.mark}** engaged in subversive and criminal
activities in several countries. **[In Turkey]{.underline}** in 1960,
the stay behind army, working with the army, **[[staged a coup]{.mark}
d'état and killed Prime Minister]{.underline}** Adnan **[Menderes; in
Algeria]{.underline}** in 1961, the French stay-behind army **[staged a
coup]{.underline}** with the CIA against the French government of
Algiers, **[which ultimately failed;]{.underline}** in 1967, **[the
Greek stay-behind army staged a coup and imposed a military
dictatorship]{.underline}**; in 1971 in **[Turkey]{.underline}**,
**[after a military coup]{.underline}**, the stay-behind army
**[[engaged in "domestic terror]{.mark}" and killed
hundreds]{.underline}**; in 1977 **[in Spain, the stay behind army
carried out a massacre in Madrid]{.underline}**; in 1980 in Turkey, the
head of the stay behind army staged a coup **[and]{.underline}** took
power; in 1985 **[in Belgium, the stay behind attacked and shot shoppers
randomly in supermarkets]{.underline}**, killing 28; in Switzerland in
1990, the former head of the Swiss stay behind wrote the US Defense
Department he would reveal "the whole truth," and was found the next day
stabbed to death with his own bayonet; and in 1995, England revealed
that the MI6 and SAS helped set up stay behind armies across Western
Europe."\[5\] The mainstream media and University commentaries have not
been able to confront this history in so far as the manipulation and
deception that gave rise to the birth of NATO is still at work against
the citizens of Europe and the United States. War Scare, NATO and
psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe and North America.
**[At the end of World War II, the defense Industries in the USA had
been faced with the choice of conversion and retooling]{.underline}**
the **[factories that made weapons or continue]{.underline}** the
**[massive subsidies for]{.underline}** the **[industries vested in
military]{.underline}** and armaments **[production. The choice
was]{.underline}** eventually made to **[embark on]{.underline}** **[a
propaganda war scare to justify the need for an expanded army and it was
in this context when NATO was conceived. [To sustain]{.mark} the WW II
[armaments]{.mark} enterprise, there [needed]{.mark} to be a cycle of
[war scare]{.mark} and the fabrication [and inflation of threats]{.mark}
and enemies.]{.underline}** It was in this context that Lawrence D.
Bell, President of Bell Aircraft Corporation, in a statement to **[the
U.S. Air Policy Commission]{.underline}** Finletter Commission) on
September 29, 1947, **[stated that "as soon as there is a war scare,
there is a lot of money available."]{.underline}** \[6\] According to
Andrew Cockburn, "The aircraft corporations that had garnered enormous
profits during the war on the back of government contracts had
discovered by 1947 that peace was ruinous. Despite initial high hopes,
the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less
accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were
far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from
the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations, while
efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and
stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly." \[7\]
**[In]{.underline}** the spring of **[1948, [the U.S.]{.mark} Secretary
of Defense]{.underline}** James Forrestal and top officials of the Harry
Truman administration **[[began]{.mark} to sound [alarm about a looming
Soviet attack]{.mark} against Western Europe. It is]{.underline}** now
**[known]{.underline}**, **[from declassified documents, that the
officials were [aware]{.mark} that [there was no credible
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** to back up their war scare. Some
analysts have argued that the war scare of 1948 was devised to save the
aircraft manufacturing industry from plunging into bankruptcy. And this
goal was achieved. In the book Harry S. Truman and the War Scare of
1948, Frank Kofsky states thatwithin 2 months of the emergence of the
scare, the Trumanadministration revamped the aircraft industry by
embarking on a 57% increase in purchase of military aircraft, and the
total budget of the Pentagon was increased by 30%. **[[NATO was
born]{.underline}]{.mark}** on April 4, 1949 **[[out of this propaganda
war]{.mark} to deceive the US citizens about a pending attack of the
Soviet Union]{.underline}** on Western Europe. **[The task of organizing
the deception]{.underline}** of the citizens of the West **[was assigned
to the C]{.underline}**entral **[I]{.underline}**ntelligence
**[A]{.underline}**gency. There are now so many books and articles on
the role of the CIA in deception, propaganda and psychological warfare
that we will not spend a great deal of time on the role of the Covert
agencies in giving legitimacy to the idea of a Soviet threat. Stephen
Kinzer and David Talbot are two writers who have documented extensively
how the Dulles brothers ensnared every major profession in the USA in
this deception. \[8\] It was especially chilling how **[Universities
were suborned to be surrogates for this psychological
warfare]{.underline}**. Noam Chomsky has dealt with this aspect of the
period of the birth of NATO in the work on the Universities and the Cold
War.\[9\] Racists and anticommunists in the propaganda war It was not by
accident that **[the [thinkers and planners]{.mark} of these secret
operations [were]{.mark} known [racists and Nazi
sympathizers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Frank Wisner who hailed from
Mississippi in the USA was a good example of the upright US citizen who
was an architect of the false flag operations and the deception
associated with NATO and western intelligence agencies. After the War,
in 1948 Frank Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special
Projects. Soon afterwards under the direction of Allen Dulles, this
Office of Special Projects was renamed **[the]{.underline}** Office of
Policy Coordination (OPC). This became the **[espionage and
counter-intelligence branch of the C]{.underline}**entral
**[I]{.underline}**ntelligence **[A]{.underline}**gency. Later James
Jesus Angleton was to take this brand of counter intelligence work to
the highest levels of state assassinations. Wisner **[had been
mandated]{.underline}** told **[to create]{.underline}** an organization
that concentrated on **["propaganda, economic warfare; preventive direct
action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation
measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to
underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist
elements in threatened countries of the free world."]{.underline}** It
was from this opaque sounding name of Office of Policy Coordination
where the brainwashing and virulent anti-communism of the Cold War era
was refined. Evan Thomas reported in The Very Best Men: the Daring Early
Days of the CIA, the OPC's charter gave it responsibility for
"propaganda, economic warfare; preventative direct action, including
sabotage, antisabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion
against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance
groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened
countries of the free world." NATO as the principal prop for
international capitalism today. In the celebratory events to memorialize
the founding of NATO in 1949, it is usually forgotten that when the
North American Treaty was signed in April 1949 most of the founding
members were colonial overlords. **[[Colonialism and imperialism]{.mark}
took a new [form under the]{.mark} leadership of [US]{.mark} capitalists
defending the dollar and Wall Street.]{.underline}** At that historical
moment in 1949, **[the [justification]{.mark}]{.underline}** for
starting this organization **[was]{.underline}** that it constituted
**[a system [of collective defense]{.mark}]{.underline}** whereby its
member states agreed to mutual defense in response to an attack by any
external party. The external party in question at that time was the
USSR; insofar as NATO had been formed as an alliance ostensibly to
defend Western Europe against 'communist expansion'. In the Treaty's
renowned Article 5, the new Allies agreed "an armed attack against one
or more of them... shall be considered an attack against them all."
**[The [US]{.mark} military and industrial [leaders studied]{.mark} the
[terror and propaganda tactics of the Nazis]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
order **[[to]{.mark} learn the lessons of how to develop an efficient
military machine.]{.underline}** James Whitman in the book, Hitler's
American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law,
outlined what the fascists had learnt from the eugenics movement in the
United States.\[10\] Although many anti-fascist scientists from Germany
had found a place in the US academy, **[the top planners of the Cold War
[link]{.mark}ed the [US primacy to]{.mark} the [global]{.mark} history
of [racism]{.mark} to the efficient, bureaucratic and professionalism of
conservative Germany.]{.underline}** One of the unspoken aspects of the
first years of NATO was the question of containing the possible
revolutionary impulses of the German working peoples. To forestall such
a possibility, **[the thinkers and planners of NATO collaborated with
the former fascists to learn their skills.]{.underline}** The details of
this alliance have been spelt out in the book on the CIA by David Talbot
in the book, The Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise
of America's Secret Government. **[The [merging]{.mark} of [fascist
ideas with]{.mark}]{.underline}** the ideas of **[[Jim Crow]{.mark} in
the United States were refined [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the secret
operation called, **[[Operation Paperclip]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Anne
Jacobsen, Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to Bring
Nazi Scientists to America, \[11\] elaborated in great detail the secret
program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely
carried out by Special Agents of Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC),
in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians,
such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from
Germany to America for U.S. government employment, primarily between
1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders,
of the Nazi Party. These elements were the foundation of a military
program that has brought us the weaponization of space. **[The creators
of [NATO]{.mark} simultaneously [mobilized]{.mark} the [colonial and
fascist]{.mark} elements in Belgium, Spain, Italy and
France]{.underline}**. Of the twelve **[founding members]{.underline}**,
six **[were]{.underline}** **[outright colonial [powers]{.mark}
and]{.underline}** at **[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** moment, countries
such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and Portugal
**[[looked to the US]{.mark}A [to support]{.mark} their [plunder]{.mark}
of colonial societies]{.underline}**. In the specific case of France,
**[in order [to assist]{.mark} French [colonialism,]{.mark} Algeria was
named as a territory of NATO.]{.underline}** Sixty years later when the
President of France, Macron, apologized for the crimes of killing more
than one million Algerians, there is no reflection inside western
academic institutions on this role of NATO in Africa. Currently, the
French have been the most aggressive in promoting the fiction that the
defense radius of Europe stretches 4000 kilometers out from Brussels, up
to the arctic, well across the Russian frontier and down into central
Africa. It is not widely known that, initially, the **[Portuguese
fascists were some of the principal beneficiaries of the membership of
NATO, with major deployment of [nuclear weapons]{.mark} in the Azores
[as reward for]{.mark} the [NATO support for]{.mark} colonialism in
Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and other Portuguese outposts of [colonial
domination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Prior to the formation of NATO in
1949, the 1947 document of **[[the State
Department]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Cooperative Development of Africa
had **[[stipulated]{.mark} that [colonialism would]{.mark} assist the
[recover]{.mark}y of European [capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
\[12\]The State Department had been explicit in outlining how cheap
foodstuffs and raw materials from Africa would assist Europe's recovery
and create the basis for unity and economic regeneration. **[The USA set
about creating a number of international institutions to guarantee the
survival of Europe and of capitalism, the IMF]{.underline}**, IBRD
(**[World Bank]{.underline}**), the **[NATO]{.underline}**, GATT, to
**[guarantee the strength of the USA in international trade and
finance]{.underline}**. By the time NATO was formed in 1949, the US
planners had already made their plans with Britain and France to extend
their military control over Africa. France was bequeathed the task of
maintaining order in western Africa while the British sought to maintain
naval power incorporating the British facilities from the Suez Canal
down through Aden (Yemen), to Mombasa (Kenya), Simons town **[South
Africa]{.underline}** across to Malaysia. \[13\] The racist **[apartheid
regime]{.underline}** had **[persuaded NATO that it was necessary to
integrate the South African military into the western defense planning
in order to protect the 'Cape route.']{.underline}** After the Suez
crises of 1956 and the 1967 war this alliance with the racist regime
deepened. **[Throughout its existence NATO assisted in the refinement of
the racial status hierarchy in which whites are dominant and people of
color are subordinate.]{.underline}** \[14\] **[This incorporation of
[racist ideas in]{.mark}to [western defense continued a]{.mark} long
[tradition that shaped]{.mark} the outlook of [NATO]{.mark} and
reinforced the outlook of Frantz Fanon]{.underline}**: "Colonialism is
violence in its natural state." France and Britain excelled in this
violence with the Belgians cementing their communications and logistics
coordination to kill Patrice Lumumba and later support the killing of
the Secretary General of the United Nation, Dag Hammarskjold. \[15\]
Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal deepened their links to NATO but
in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower halted the planned offensive of the British
and the French in the Suez war. After this war, both the currencies of
Britain and France suffered sharp declines with France seeking cover
inside the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), while the British
pound accepted its place as a prop to the US dollar in the global
economy. Within a year after the Suez debacle, France had pushed for the
Treaty of Rome that paved the way for the European Economic Community to
be a competitive force with US capitalists. Within the context of the
competition between European capitalists and US capitalists, Charles De
Gaulle exhibited pique at the organization of NATO that supported the
armaments culture of US capital. Charles De Gaulle partially pulled
France out of this alliance in 1966 after it became clear that this
military organization was dominated by the United States and Britain
(supporting their military industries). De Gaulle argued for an
independent nuclear arsenal while remaining a signatory to North
Atlantic Treaty and participating in the North Atlantic Council.
Nicholas Sarkozy ended the farce when France returned to the fold of the
NATO military structures in 2009. The duplicitous actions on the part of
the French leadership were always based on calculations meant to
preserve the dominance of French capital in Africa. When the US devalued
the dollar in 1971 and broke the agreements of the Bretton Woods Treaty,
it was the French who complained about the Exorbitant Privilege of the
Dollar. For a short period, both the President of France and the
Chancellor of West Germany had chafed under the privilege and had worked
hard to bring into being the Maastricht Treaty and the Europe Union to
end the dominance of the dollar in the international capitalist system.
It was known than the one necessary aspect of this emerging common
currency in Europe would be the dismantling of the military occupation
of Europe by US military personnel. Hence, both Giscard de Estaing and
Helmut Schmidt had linked the common currency, the European Central Bank
and common foreign and security policy (CFSP), with the expectation that
ultimately Europe will break from the traditions of NATO. It was in the
face of this threat and the fall of the centrally planned economy that
the forward planners expanded NATO. Emergence of Global NATO and the
myth of 'humanitarian intervention' **[Usually, when an alliance is
formed for a specific purpose such as halting the spread of communism,
that alliance is folded when the mission is complete.]{.underline}**
Hence, after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was expected by
those seeking the 'peace dividend' that the mission of NATO would be
scaled down. **[Instead, [NATO]{.mark} expanded, seeking to encircle
Russia by extending its membership to include former members of the
Warsaw Pact countries.]{.underline}** Progressive scholars have
documented the cynicism of the **[US military planners who
[orchestrated]{.mark} the 'humanitarian [intervention' in the
Balkans]{.mark} in order [to advance]{.mark} the hegemony of US
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[after the fall of the
Soviet Union.]{.underline}** The scholarship on this manipulation of the
European working peoples to entrench NATO is rich and needs to be
revisited at this moment of the celebration of the 70thanniversary of
the founding of NATO. Richard Aldrich in the book, The Hidden Hand:
Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence' brought out evidence
to expose how the massacres in the Balkans, helped give a new impetus to
US hegemony.' \[16\] David Gibbs had argued, "How the Srebrenica
Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy." It is worth quoting at length how
the Balkans war was used to manipulate public opinion in Europe,
"Perhaps most importantly, the massacre helped give a new impetus to US
hegemony, contributing to its post-Cold War legitimacy. In bolstering
America's hegemonic position, the significance of **[the Srebrenica
massacre]{.underline}** cannot be overstated: The massacre **[helped
trigger a NATO bombing campaign that is]{.underline}** widely
**[credited with ending the Bosnian war]{.underline}**, along with the
associated atrocities, and this campaign gave NATO a new purpose for the
post-Soviet era. Since that time, the Srebrenica precedent has been
continuously invoked as a justification for military force. **[The
perceived need to prevent massacres and oppression helped justify later
interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, as well as the
ongoing fight against ISIS.]{.underline}** The recent UN doctrine of
Responsibility to Protect, which contains a strongly interventionist
tone, was inspired in part by the memory of Srebrenica." \[17\] The more
nefarious aspect of this manipulation of humanitarianism was the ways in
which elements such as Bernard Kouchner used their credentials as former
members of the left and progressive forces to give cover to US
imperialism. Since the war in the Balkans it is now accepted by the
military planners that humanitarian intervention acts as a force
multiplier. \[18\] This position was explicitly stated by General Colin
Powell who noted, "Just as surely as our diplomats and military,
American NGOs are out there serving and sacrificing on the front lines
of freedom NGOs are such a force multiplier for us, such an important
part of our combat team." These observations can shed light on the
relationship between NGOs such as Doctors without Borders and the
International Rescue Committee in global militarism. The fiction of
collective western security was effectively broken while **[after the
Asian economic crisis, US capital mobilized NATO to defend Wall
Street.]{.underline}** In this defense of Wall Street, **[NATO
incessantly bombed Kosovo for 79 days in 1999 as it gave itself a new
mission to enlarge US military power right up to the doorstep of
Moscow.]{.underline}** Gingerly, NATO expanded under US President Bill
Clinton from 12 members to 16, then to 19, then to 26 by 2004 and by
2009 to 28 members. Despite vocal opposition from Russia, **[the
discussion of expanding NATO now proceeded to develop the idea of Global
NATO]{.underline}**. In 2019 there were 29 members of NATO. In his
presentation before the US Congress Stoltenberg advocated for a further
expansion of NATO and boasted of the high state of readiness of the NATO
Response Force (NRF) which had been created in 2002. NATO and the
Weaponization of finance **[[Global NATO was the]{.mark} preeminent
force to orchestrate the [weaponization of
everything]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Michael Hudson has
**[outlined]{.underline}** finance as warfare and **[the weaponization
of finance in the current phase of imperialism.]{.underline}** It will
be important to grasp the present sanctions regime of the USA as a form
of warfare. In the current literature on imperialism, the term
weaponization of finance refers to the foreign policy strategy of using
incentives (access to capital markets) and penalties (varied types of
sanctions) as tools of coercive diplomacy. The **[multiple wars agains
Iran represent a model example of the weaponization of finance, the
weaponization of information and the weaponization of
trade.]{.underline}** Under the Presidency of Barack Obama,Treasury
Secretary Jack Lew, noted that the weaponization of finance offers to
the US "a new battlefield...one that enables \[the US\] to go after
those who wish \[the US\] harm without putting \[US\] troops in harm's
way or using lethal force." Instead of fighting countries militarily,
the US can now "cripple them financially. The Obama administration had
retreated from a full scale weaponization of finance with Iran by
signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA ) with Iran in
2015. Under the terms of this agreement in Vienna on 14 July 2015
between Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council---China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United
States---plus Germany),\[a\] and the European Union, it was agreed that
Iran would accept the P5+1 would ensure that Iran did not develop
nuclear weapons. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel had opposed this
agreement. When Donald Tromp became President of the United States, his
administration renounced the JCPOA in 2018 and then signed an executive
order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that continues to do
business with Iran. The order gave companies 90-day or 180-day grace
periods to extract themselves from existing Iranian contacts or face
punitive US measures. Those NATO partners of the USA who signed the
JCPOA refused to accept the sanctions imposed on Iran and in 2019 agreed
to create a special purpose vehicle to manage their trade with Iran.
Britain, Germany and France rolled out INSTEX in February 2019 as one
way to break the weaponization of Finance by the USA but in the cat and
mouse game of economic warfare, the Foreign Ministers of Europe have not
yet been transparent on the full mandate of the special purpose vehicle.
These developments mirror the weaponization of trade \[19\] and finance
within NATO and the problems of inter imperialist rivalry in West Asia.
The threats against the countries that created a special purpose vehicle
(SPV) to help facilitate trade with Iran must be taken very seriously,
especially in the context of the political insecurity generated by
BREXIT. This period reminds the world that of the depression when trade
wars and currency wars eventually fueled open fighting in World War II.
Finance as warfare **[Since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009,
there have been efforts by countries holding US debt to limit their
exposure to the dollar. In 2009, the Russians and the Chinese worked to
establish]{.underline}** an alternative international institution
involving Brazil, Russia, India and China, later including South Africa
and called **[BRICS]{.underline}**. Within the context of BRICS, the
Chinese set about a slow process to internationalize its currency, the
RMB and undertook currency swaps to avoid the US dollar. After failing
to negotiate successfully within the Bretton Woods institution for an
increase of its drawing rights commensurate with its volume of
international trade, the Chinese embarked on major economic and
financial ventures under the banner of One Belt One Road and the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank. When the AIIB was launched in 2015 with
57 countries, the former Treasury Secretary of the US, Lawrence Summers
noted that the launch of the AIIB was a turning point and 'the creation
of the AIIB will undermine the leadership role the U.S. has long enjoyed
in global finance.' Both Russia and China intensified their swap trading
efforts and Russia settled its crude sales to China. "In March 2018 news
broke that Beijing is planning a pilot project for the second half of
the year to pay for imported crude oil with renminbi instead of dollars.
The two countries allegedly selected for the pilot are Russia and
Angola, with rumors that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may
become involved. If this venture is successful, it will act as a spur to
similar schemes for other imports and primary products." China was
joining the leaders of Europe and the countries in Asia and West Asia
who were calling for a multi-currency financial system. Many progressive
economists noted that it was not a matter if more countries would flee
the dollar, but when. One economist writing from Singapore wrote, "the
emergence of a multicurrency or multi-asset international payments
system will take time. It doesn't portend a collapse of the global
payments system, but does point to a redistribution of global wealth.
The seigniorage harvested by the US as the world's banker will gradually
fall, narrowing the room for maneuver in US economic policy, which for
the last 70 years has had the greatest influence on markets globally. As
the power of the dollar wanes, the US will be pressured to adjust to a
world economy vastly changed since 1945." \[20\] The German financial
leaders along with France were maneuvering to speed this change with the
establishment of the special purpose vehicle to continue trading with
Iran. At this time of writing the specific details of the specific
purpose vehicle called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges
(INSTEX) is still being worked out, but the statements of former
Ambassador Nicholas Burns before Congress on March 26 made it clear that
the Foreign Policy establishment in the USA will not retreat from the
weaponization of Finance, especially since INSTEX allows members of NATO
to continue trading and financial arrangements with Iran, China and
Russia. In so far as Global NATO is serving the task of defending the
dollar, the extent to which China has created an alternative clearing
system in the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) will be seen
as another blow to US financial hegemony. Although in its first rollout
of the CIPS system, the Chinese went to great length that it would
cooperate with the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT) system, the current US intelligence war
against the Chinese telecom firm Huawei point to the integration between
Finance, information warfare and cyberwarfare. \[21\] In the book, The
Perfect Weapon, David Sanger discussed the debates within this highest
levels of US intelligence and the Federal Reserve of whether the USA
should use its Federal Reserve and cyber warfare to backdoor into the
Russian Central Bank to make money disappear. It is in this context
where one can note in the planning of NATO strengthening the cyber
capabilities is at the top of the Agenda. The Harvard study emphasized
the importance of winning the Technology Battle in the Digital Age.
**[The convergence of cyberwarfare, economic warfare and information
warfare is being taken to new levels under the current administration
with its wide ranging sanctions against countries in Europe, Asia,
Africa and the Caribbean.]{.underline}** Traditional books on NATO had
surveyed the integration of diplomacy, sanctions and weapons
procurement, but **[the new push of the USA in formulating its position
of unrivalled dominance is turning out to be another front for defending
the dollar. In a world where the USA had imposed sanctions on Cuba,
Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Turkey, North Korea, Syria, Sudan along
with individual sanctions against individuals in Somalia, South Sudan,
Libya, Ukraine and Zimbabwe, the logic of these sanctions]{.underline}**
enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US
Treasury has **[now clarified to]{.underline}** the allies of the USA in
**[NATO the importance finance was warfare.]{.underline}** It was the
former Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, who had warned that the over use of
sanctions could dull their effectiveness. His logic was simple:
Sanctions work because they cut targets off from dealing with U.S.
citizens and American financial institutions---a complete severance from
the world's largest economy and its most important financial center. If
Washington used this power idly, Lew suggested, it could encourage
countries to find partners outside of the United States, and undermine
sanctions' deterrent effect. **[What Lew did not acknowledge was the
relationship between the Treasury, Global NATO and the financial
wars.]{.underline}** Much of the scholarship on the printing of dollars
miss the way in which the infusion of capital in emerging economies
further enmesh these societies into the instability of the system.
Ultimately, the export of the oscillation of the US economy deepens
social and political challenges on the world and reinforces the
militarization of the international political economy. Michael Hudson
outlined three ways in which flooding of dollars through debt leverage
and QE supported the military: (1) the surplus dollars pouring into the
rest of the world for yet further financial speculation and corporate
takeovers; (2) the fact that central banks are obliged to recycle these
dollar inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the federal U.S.
budget deficit; and most important (but most suppressed in the U.S.
media, (3) the military character of the U.S. payments deficit and the
domestic federal budget deficit. He continued, "Strange as it may seem
and irrational as it would be in a more logical system of world
diplomacy the "dollar glut" is what finances America's global military
build-up. It forces foreign central banks to bear the costs of America's
expanding military empire effective "taxation without representation."
Keeping international reserves in "dollars" means recycling their dollar
inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bills U.S. government debt issued largely
to finance the military." After the financial crisis in Europe,
Quantitative Easing was extended to the Eurozone and Japan, but in the
continuing re alignment, of global capitalism, US capital is working
hard to decapitate Russia and China as opponents of Global NATO. **[The
currency wars and weaponization of [finance]{.mark} is now accompanied
by the weaponization of [trade and]{.mark} the weaponization of
information.]{.underline}** Sanger's The Perfect Weapon War, Sabotage,
and Fear in the Cyber Agehas opened one window into how **[[full
spectrum dominance]{.mark} and the militarization of space is now
[linked to the weaponization of information and cognitive
hacking]{.mark}. We now have new terms of warfare, terms such as "fake
news", "disinformation," "weaponized information," "post-truth" and
"alternative facts."]{.underline}** Weaponized information (WI)

contains falsehoods, facts taken out of context and pieces of truth

beliefs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The NATO destruction of Libya was one

to support the destruction of Libya The weaponization of Finance and the
Destruction of Libya **[Not enough is being done to expose the real role
of Global NATO and the role of so called humanitarian operatives in
ensuring that humanitarian interventions become a force
multiplier.]{.underline}** Currently, many countries of the EU
collaborate with France in the North African region in the fabrication
of terror to ensure the deployment of the US Africa Command and French
forces in Africa. **[In Western Europe, NATO has been very successful in
ensuring confusion, demoralization,]{.underline}** paralysis, **[and
apathy in relation to western imperialism in Africa.]{.underline}**
African scholars and progressives are very clear that while calling for
the dismantling of NATO there must be a call for the EURO to break from
the CFA franc zone. Nicolas Sarkozy was very clear that the intervention
in Libya was to save the Euro. Africans cannot have a Newtonian view of
the struggle against imperialism to assure those from the European left
who want solidarity with Africans while supporting French imperialism in
Africa. Global NATO and French machinations are involved in a delicate
dance and there is silence from the left in the EU when it comes to
Europe's 4000 km strategic radius that covers the entire area of West
Africa, North Africa and down through East Africa to Somalia. It is
beyond this commentary to delineate the ways in which German scholars,
religious organizations, German foundations and non-governmental
organizations are now implicated in the criminal acts of France in
Africa, especially the war on terror. It is the task of the progressive
movement to penetrate the areas of cooperation and conflict between
European capitalists and Wall Street so that European workers do not
continue to complicity support 'humanitarian interventions.' **[When 200
African scholars wrote the open letter on the impending crime against
the peoples of Libya, there has been and continue to be silence on the
part of the left in Europe and the United States.]{.underline}** Barack
Obama had described the intervention in Libya as a mistake and the
British Parliamentary Committee outlined how the Libyan intervention had
been based on lies. Obama may have considered the intervention a
mistake, but his understanding of the process did not reveal how Goldman
Sachs was thoroughly implicated the destruction of Libya. The case in
the London High Court of the Libyan Investment Authority vs Goldman
Sachs brought out revealing evidence of how **[firms such as Goldman
Sachs and others involved in the financialization of the energy markets
sought to mobilize the resources of oil rich states]{.underline}** with
Sovereign Wealth Funds **[to keep alive the]{.underline}** private
equity, hedge funds and structured derivatives **[markets of the global
capitalist economy.]{.underline}** Most societies and peoples in the
world want these banks to be brought under control. But Goldman Sachs
benefitted in the ruling because in 2014, two and a half years after the
case was brought before the High Court, there was a war in Libya and
there was no government therefore one could not represent the Libyan
Investment Authority in this arena. We see therefore that the financial
institutions are direct beneficiaries of the warfare that is going on in
Libya. When the United Nations passed Resolution 1970 and resolution
1973 in 2011, those who had signed these resolutions did not understand
then that the resolution was for regime in Libya.\[22\] The current
fighting in Libya remains one of the most inglorious aspects of the 70
year history of NATO but there is silence among those celebrating 70
years of NATO. \[23\] **[Since the writings on Finance capital over a

There is a growing literature on **[[complexity
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}** that has fundamental implications for how
we think about the real in social and political terms (Cilliers, 1998;
Richards, 2002; Urry, 2003; Harrison, 2006; Geyer and Rihani, 2010).
Borrowing from its origins in the natural sciences (specifically the
work of Nobel Prize winning chemist, Ilya Prigogine), complexity
**[[focuses on the chaotic blend of]{.mark} the [order]{.mark}ly and
disorderly [in]{.mark} social and political [life.]{.mark} This implies
that phenomena cannot be properly understood through experimentation in
controlled environments such as the laboratory.]{.underline}** Instead,
**[[complex environments are]{.mark} much more [dynamic]{.mark} with a
plurality of actors engaging with phenomena in a multiplicity of
different ways and generating effects that are unknown to each
other.]{.underline}**

Complexity in the social sciences suggests that **[the issues we engage
with are in a constant process of development rather than being static
entities -- 'facts' -- that just have to be acted upon.]{.underline}**
Moreover, **[the effects of political action are not linear, given that
multiple other parties are acting on the same issue
simultaneously]{.underline}**. Thus, **[action on an issue with a
specific outcome in mind does not guarantee that intended
result]{.underline}** as the actions and behaviours of other interested
parties may interrupt the linearity of action and outcome. For this
reason, **[the actual nature of things is dynamic and always in a stage
of [complex temporal development]{.mark} so that [a snapshot of what
reality]{.mark} actually [entails can only be
momentary]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Connolly, 2010, pp. 17--42).

Complexity theory also suggests that **[the [complicated interaction of
a plurality of actors]{.mark} on social phenomena will always [generate
emergent properties that we may not]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}fully **[[comprehend.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Part of the reason
for this epistemological slippage is that **[we are largely beholden to
established modes of understanding to make sense of the things we
encounter]{.underline}**. **[This [path dependence]{.mark} can [limit
the horizons of possibility]{.mark} and bind us to particular
methodologies]{.underline}** for looking at specific issues. When it
comes to social issues, **[[political actors are always playing
catch-]{.mark}up as they try to maintain traditional modes of
understanding and action as a means of dealing with emerging
problems.]{.underline}** Ultimately, in terms of dealing with emerging
complexities, **[it may actually be politically advantageous to
relinquish path dependent modes of behaviour to develop new approaches
to]{.underline}** the **[fresh problems]{.underline}** that we
encounter.

On this account, **[the [poverty of]{.mark} traditional forms of
[realism is clear because they rely on depicting the obvious 'facts' as
the real. This ties us into existing understandings]{.mark} of what are
often emerging issues [and implies that we should rely on path dependent
tech]{.mark}nologies inherited from the past [to deal with things
that]{.mark}]{.underline}** might **[[require fresh
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The **[epistemological blind spots
of]{.underline}** 'fact-derived **[realism]{.underline}**' **[in complex
environments imply that a more realistic politics might emphasize the
sheer unknowability of all relevant phenomena when it comes to policy
making in a simultaneously orderly and disorderly complex
environment]{.underline}** (Little, 2012). From this perspective,
**[[systems are]{.mark} always [struggling reactively to contain issues
that are constantly changing]{.mark} and evolving in relation to a
multiplicity of actors engaging with them]{.underline}**. In short,
**[[this]{.mark} complex temporality [engenders an epistemological gap

THE ROLE OF THE ACADEMY

**[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we argue, **[operates like a colonial
household.]{.underline}** **[This House of IR shouts to the world: it's
"I vs You!"]{.underline}** Like the singular, patriarchal, and colonial
household that stands for the colonial state**[, the field [theorizes
about itself from a position of imperial sovereignty.]{.mark} Staking
out "civilization"]{.underline}** in a space that's already crowded with
local traditions of thinking, doing, and being yet proclaimed, **[in
willful arrogance, as a "state of nature" plagued by fearful "anarchy"
and [its murderous power politics]{.mark}, the House of IR aims to
[stave off "disorder" by imposing "order."]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Directing Others with declarative statements, **[the House of [IR
assumes to know both the problem]{.mark} (i.e., "power for the few over
the many") [and its solution]{.mark} ("more power for the few over the
many").]{.underline}** **[Such suffocation of Self and Other leaves a
multi-generational legacy similar to the actual colonial
household's.]{.underline}** That is, **[erasures and violences [that
flip the]{.mark} household's original [intent: order turns into
disorder]{.mark}]{.underline}**, repulsion into desire, purity into
hybridity. In the House of IR, especially, another practice rules: the
treatment of the academy's institutional power as an extension of
political power, regardless of empire's devastations and/or secret
indulgences.

IR HOUSEHOLD RELATIONS

Our understanding of the colonial household comes from Ann Laura Stoler
(2002). Her study of colonial management in Indonesia and Indo-china
under Dutch and French rule, respectively, tracks the "genealogies of
the intimate." She asks: how do racialized categories of identity emerge
and become naturalized into the lexicon of colonial governance? Given
the potent politics of categorizing identities, Stoler examines "the
histories of their making, the exclusions they enabled, and violences
they condoned."

**[The House of IR exhibits [a]{.mark} similar [politics of exclusion
and violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It clearly identifies who's
"in," who's "out,"]{.underline}** and who's precariously "on the
border." It also stratifies who's "upstairs" and who's "downstairs."
**[This hierarchical division of space reflects the House's
participation in and complicity with material relations of production
and its uneven distribution of social wealth.]{.underline}**

Inside the Household

Pater realism

**[As its "founding father," [realism heads the House of
IR]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Though labeled a peculiarly **["American
social science"]{.underline}** (Hoffman 1995), realism claims an
intellectual lineage that dates to ancient Greek history, especially
that recorded by Thucydides (5 bc) (cf. Lebow and Strauss 1991; Garst
1989; 5 Jansson 1997; Monten 2006). Subsequently, realists have added
luminaries of power politics like Machiavelli and Hobbes to their
roster. But it was a generation of scholars from post-World War II
Europe, Britain, and **[the US that gave realism its distinctive
voice]{.underline}**. **[Power]{.underline}**, they asserted,
**[reflects objective laws of calculated]{.underline}** (sometimes
amoral) **[self-interest for all states across time and
space]{.underline}**. John Herz, George F. Kennan, Walter Lippmann, and
Hans J. **[Morgenthau]{.underline}** each **[saw "political realism" as
the cure to what they considered the fateful cause of war among
nations:]{.underline}** "legalism," "utopianism," and "idealism"
(Keohane 1986: 9). Abstract **[individualism pivots [realism's
understanding of the world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Primordial
individual units (states) struggle in eternal competition over resources
that confer power and wealth. In this way, realists [justify
instrumental reasoning]{.mark} and behavior]{.underline}**. But then how
do realists explain the existence of an interdependent international
political economy in a world of conflicting nation-states? **[Hegemonic
stability theory comes to the rescue]{.underline}** (Kindleberger 1973).
**[It posits a dominant state or hegemon that willingly bears the
asymmetrical cost of global leadership so the inter-state system may
survive peacefully and prosperously despite anarchy and
competition]{.underline}**. Game theoretic models explain such
cooperation under anarchy as a prisoner's dilemma. Still, these
approaches preserve realism's basic premise in abstract individualism.
They place outside the realm of realist inquiry issues like ideology,
the social bases of state power, its practices, political struggles, and
strategies for reproduction (Rupert 1995).

Yet **[[realists]{.mark} openly [accept their origin in the
white]{.mark} colonial[/imperial state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They
invoke and canonize Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War as the
genealogical text for IR. The book details Athens' struggle against
Sparta for hegemony in the ancient world, interpreted by realists as a
cautionary tale on the uses and abuses of state power. **[This
teleological and political move disciplines IR]{.underline}**, in
effect, **[by deciding who and what counts in not just the study of
world politics but also its practices through statecraft]{.underline}**.
Accordingly, some are included, recognized, and legitimized at the cost
of the many. Realists constantly echo what they claim to be Thucydides'
key lesson in power: "The strong do what they can, the weak suffer what
they must." **[In this way, [realists rationalize empire's brutal
legacy, turning it into an ideological]{.mark} and political
[commitment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Expect violence and colonization,
some realists trumpet, for it is [integral to
empire]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[empire, they add, is what
international politics is all about.]{.underline}** Conveniently
silenced is another reading of this text that tells of empire as a
crisis not only for world politics but the empire itself.

**[Realism stems from]{.underline}** another lineage, rarely
acknowledged: i.e., **[the global capitalist economy. It accounts for
realism's birth into the world and]{.underline}** its growth,
sustenance, and eventual **[dominance in the House of IR]{.underline}**.
In turn, **[[realism generates an ideational infrastructure for]{.mark}
global capitalism's public, political face: the modern, capitalist
state]{.underline}**. What is all this warring imperialism for if not
more wealth and resources for national elites? **[Global capitalism
delivers what [the]{.mark} white colonial/[imperial state
seeds]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Mater liberalism

**[Liberalism naturally allies with realism]{.underline}**. **[They
share common roots in the white colonial/imperial state and its
relationship with global capitalism, albeit with a conceptual division
of labor]{.underline}**. Whereas realism commands the House of IR by
focusing on the state ("power"), **[liberalism organizes, manages, and
reproduces it by emphasizing the market]{.underline}** ("interest") (see
Gilpin 1987). Liberalism started out as a proud tradition of defiance
against authority, such as Martin Luther's fiery repudiation of Catholic
Church hegemony in sixteenth-century Europe. Since then, it has evolved
into an ideological instigator of "free trade," "open markets,"
"instrumental rationality," and other pillars of global capitalism
(Polanyi 1944; Hirschman 1977).

**[Realism and liberalism work in tandem by drawing on the mirage of
"politics" and "economics."]{.underline}** Publicly, **[they convince
"contemporary statesmen]{.underline}** \[like\] the mercantilists of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries **[\[that\] power is a necessary
condition for plenty,]{.underline}** and vice versa" (Keohane 1984: 22).
Privately, **[[realism]{.mark}--liberalism [maintains an infrastructure
of elite, bourgeois rule]{.mark} by seeming to care about democratic
peace, prosperity, and freedom -- but not really. Realism--liberalism's
abstract, ahistorical conceptions of the state]{.underline}**, the
market, **[and the individual are bound by particular cultural
expressions (Western, white, male) that result from concrete political
struggles]{.underline}** (bourgeois, colonial). Yet both the "world"
(materiality, structured inequalities) and "politics" (practices,
discourse) disappear from world politics (Agathangelou 1997). Classical
liberals like Kant, Locke, and Woodrow Wilson, for instance, advocated a
legally-based "perpetual peace," "limited government," and a "league of
nations" to forestall global warfare that, by extension, preserves the
realist--liberal inter-state, commerce- based system, in principle, if
not in form. Similarly, contemporary liberals like Hedley Bull (1966)
and David Held (1995) talk of an "international society" or
"cosmopolitan democracy," respectively, but without regard to the
worldviews or participation of Others in these processes.

Today, **[liberalism reinvents itself into a new family of arguments
labeled neoliberalism]{.underline}**. Without losing the liberal logic
of public vs private, individual vs collective, Self vs Other,
neoliberalism professes good intentions for the masses while complying
with elite demands for new ideas for and methods of preserving
colonial--patriarchal--capitalist structures and their necessary
subjectivities. Take the treatment of "third-world" women, for example.
Liberal and standpoint feminists end up colluding morally and
politically when they seek to "protect" brown women from brown men by
helping them become more like "white" women.

Still, nothing is what it seems. As we see below, mater liberalism and
daughter neoliberalism each has sought to convert Others with missionary
zeal but ended up, instead, with hybrid progeny\...

... Heir apparent: neorealism

Son #1 intrigues the most. **[Heir apparent to the House of IR,
[neorealism springs]{.mark} not [from]{.mark} the union of realism and
liberalism but an open affair between [realism and]{.mark} its
gold-digging neighbor, [economics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Mistress of
her own house but impatient with opportunistic ambitions, **[economics
merges almost giddily with realism to produce neorealism]{.underline}**.
Waltz (1979), for instance, constructs the international system as a
market and states as individual firms, **[[magically accounting for
"order" without an "orderer"]{.mark} in an international system that is
posited, a priori, as anarchical]{.underline}**. On this basis, **[Waltz
infers that [only great powers matter since they alone account for
change]{.mark} and consequence in world politics.]{.underline}**

Similarly, **[[neorealists]{.underline}]{.mark}** and their cousins,
rational choicers, **[[have stormed]{.mark} the House of
[IR]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Like Jimmy Cagney's dying psycho gangster in
White Heat (1949), they crow manically: "Look, Ma, I made it! Top of the
world!" They find no contradiction in denying legitimacy and rights to
others, be these involving intellectual debate, hiring/promotion/grants,
or publications, **[[while failing to deliver on]{.mark} their own
golden [promises of]{.mark}, among others,
"[prediction]{.mark},"]{.underline}** "law-like" regularities, **[[and
"causal explanations]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Green and Shapiro 1994).

Yet **[neorealists remain insecure]{.underline}**. **[Their own
[zero-sum logic induces a paranoid worldview that treats Others as
competition]{.mark} only for legitimacy and resources]{.underline}** --
in this case, in the House of IR. As Stoler notes for colonial
governance in southeast Asia, "it was not the progeny of \[cross-
category\] unions who were problematic but the possibility that they
might be recognized as heirs to a European inheritance . . ." (Stoler
2002: 39). For this reason, **[[tensions]{.mark} between neorealism and
the other progeny of the House of IR [remain
severe]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Even if they win realism, vote neg on presumption\-\--either it [decks]{.underline} aff solvency\-\--it means there are [inevitable]{.underline} motivations for conflict escalation [built into]{.underline} IR [or]{.underline} there's [disincentives]{.underline} for conflict escalation because of MAD

**[[The issue]{.mark} at stake [is how to unsettle the]{.mark} grounds
on which [discourses of realism]{.mark} are constructed [if political

least two **[[significant fronts on which]{.mark} the process of
[reconstituting realism can be enacted]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The first
front is the systemic limitations of existing political institutions in
dealing with complex plurality, and the second is the inability of
prevailing constructions of 'the real' to provide an appropriate
understanding of the emotive and psychological dimensions that may guide
political activity.

In **[[arguing for]{.mark} a process of [reconstituting]{.mark} our
[understanding of realism]{.mark} in politics]{.underline}**, this
contribution **[seeks to break down]{.underline}** some **[established
understandings of]{.underline}** the terms of **[political theory and
'real politics']{.underline}**. **[It [argues that political theory
should be politically engaged]{.mark}]{.underline}**, that the reason
that it is political theory rather than ethics is precisely because
**[it has implications for how the world is organized and raises
action-based questions of how to achieve objectives]{.underline}**. The
challenge here is not only that political theorists need to think about
the application of their work, but also that **[we need to think more
clearly about what constitutes the 'real world' of politics to which it
is applied. [To unnecessarily distance the two, is a]{.mark}n easy
[trap]{.mark} to fall into.]{.underline}** For example, while Swift and
White (2008) argue that political theory has a vital role to play in
practical issues, they still **[[differentiate theory from]{.mark} a
[real politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which is depicted as the things
politicians do and the strategies they employ to gain election.

While this activity is undoubtedly part of real politics, it **[[does
not]{.mark} entirely [constitute what is real]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
short, far too many **[[political theorists]{.mark} readily [accept an
intuitive version of the 'real' without sufficient interrogation
of]{.mark} that reality and [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** sometimes
**[[flimsy epistemological interpretations underpinning
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[By failing to address the epistemological
foundations]{.underline}** of what constitutes 'real politics',
**[[commentators]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as Swift and White
**[--]{.underline}** **[despite]{.underline}** their **[arguments for
political theorists to make modest contributions to real
politics]{.underline}** -- **[actually [reinforce an artificial divide
between political theory and real politics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Thus,
at the same time as Swift and White recognize that political theorists
need to be more engaged with practical issues, their
**[[division]{.mark} between the two [encourages a culture in which
non-engagement is viewed as]{.mark} a [sustainable]{.mark} position for
theory]{.underline}**. **[This provides an opportunity for
[realists]{.mark} to [avoid]{.mark} serious [challenge to what they
consider]{.mark} to be [real]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Geuss, 2008, pp.

### M: Root Cause---War

#### Security politics are the [root cause]{.underline} of warfare\-\--it creates the [necessary conditions]{.underline} for [unending conflict]{.underline} through propaganda to [naturalize]{.underline} militarism

**[Boggs 11]{.underline}** -- Carl, Ph.D. Political Science, University
of California, Berkeley ("The Global IndusTrIal Complex", Published by
Lexington Books, 2011, ISBN 978-0-7391-3697-3) RMT

**[As the American [people are asked to endure]{.mark} burdensome costs
and [sacrifices of war]{.mark}]{.underline}** and preparation for war,
**[mechanisms of legitimation take on new meaning]{.underline}**.
Empire, a bloated war economy, recurrent armed interventions,
**[[hardships]{.mark} on the home front]{.underline}**---all these
**[[must be made to appear "natural,"]{.mark} routine, even welcome if
not noble.]{.underline}** The historical myth of national
exceptionalism, combined with hubris associated with economic,
technological, and military supremacy, contributes to this ideological
function. To translate such an ideological syndrome into popular
language and daily life, **[[to fully incorporate it into]{.mark} the
[political culture, is the task]{.mark} not so much [of]{.mark} a
classical [state-run propaganda]{.mark} system as a developed hegemonic
ideology reliant]{.underline}** more **[[on education]{.mark} and the
media]{.underline}**. In the United States, **[media culture has evolved
into an outgrowth of megacorporate power]{.underline}** that sustains
the most far-reaching ideological and cultural network in history.
**[Hollywood films]{.underline}** alone have for many decades **[served
as a crucial vehicle for legitimation of Empire]{.underline}**. The
repetitive fantasies, illusions, myths, images, and storylines of
Hollywood movies (not to mention TV and other outlets) can be expected
to influence mass audiences in rather predictable ways, much along lines
of advertising and public relations. **[One popular response to the
flood of violent combat]{.underline}**, action-adventure, **[sci-fi, and
horror films]{.underline}** (with their companion video games) **[is
stronger readiness to support U.S. military operations that, in an
intensely patriotic, violent milieu will require]{.underline}** little
**[overt justification except where American casualties are deemed
excessive]{.underline}**. Such ideological legitimation is needed in a
context where even the ensemble of corporate, military, and government
power cannot suffice.

Despite its command of institutional power, tools of violence, and
material resources, therefore, **[[the system requires]{.mark} something
along lines of a culture of [militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the
United States, **[[militarism has]{.mark} indeed [evolved into an
ideology forged by media culture]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[political
messages, [academic discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and patriotic
indoctrination]{.underline}**]{.mark}. If the linkage between militarism
and daily life goes back in history, it has taken on new dimensions with
the dramatic growth of the media and popular culture over the past few
decades. **[If the culture of [militarism endows warfare with]{.mark} a
popular sense of [meaning and]{.mark} purpose]{.underline}**,
**[[it]{.mark} also [constitutes the hegemonic façade behind
which]{.mark} the [power]{.mark} structure [can]{.mark}]{.underline}**
more or less freely [**[operate]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[domestically
and worldwide]{.underline}**. **[The decay of American]{.underline}**
**[economic, political, and social life cannot be understood apart from
this destructive cycle]{.underline}**---**[likely to worsen as the
elites strive to maintain the advantages of Empire against new
challenges]{.underline}**. By the early twenty-first century it was
obvious that **[war, and [orientation to war]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[had become a way of life]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in [the]{.mark}
United States]{.underline}**, **[a society in which both [leaders
and]{.mark} general [population]{.mark} could be said to [have grown
addicted to war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[If the United States fails to
qualify as a full-fledged "warrior society]{.underline}**" **[at the
level of ancient Sparta]{.underline}**, Nazi **[Germany]{.underline}**,
interwar Japan, or even Israel today, **[the military influence is
perhaps even more pervasive]{.underline}**---**[though not always
recognizable as such]{.underline}**---owing to the global presence of
American power.

Who could expect otherwise, as the Pentagon dominates the globe with its
military, technological, and communications presence, with its hundreds
of bases and sites, and its status as the world's biggest landlord
(overseeing 300,000 housing units globally)?
**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[U.S. [military runs its own]{.mark}
vast [propaganda]{.mark} network]{.underline}** with scores of
**[newspapers and magazines]{.underline}**, **[invests in hundreds of
movies and TV programs]{.underline}**, develops state-of-the-art video
games, **[and is by far the largest sponsor of research and
development]{.underline}**, allowing it to influence such fields as
nuclear physics, chemistry, astronomy, and electrical engineering. What
might be called **[[the militarization of the academy is reflected
in]{.mark} the capacity of the Pentagon to shape [research goals
at]{.mark} such respectable universities as UC Berkeley, MIT, Stanford,
Johns Hopkins, Penn State, and Carnegie Mellon]{.underline}**---**[a few
of the more than [350 institutions]{.mark} that routinely get military
contracts]{.underline}**. Under the familiar guise of national security,
**[[American society has seen a convergence of military,]{.mark}
corporate, [and academic centers of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Tens of billions are targeted annually for higher-tech warfare agendas:
urbanassault counterinsurgency methods, satellite technology, nuclear
modernization, robotics and other forms of remote combat, laser-guided
weapons, war-gaming, and database collections among others. 19 In **[a
militarized society the armed forces experience is bound to touch the
lives of tens of millions of people, often in the most intimate
ways]{.underline}**---and **[often outside the ranks of the military
itself.]{.underline}** In her study of the "homefront," Catherine Lutz
comments: "In an important sense . . . [**[we all inhabit an army
camp]{.underline}**, **[mobilized to lend support to the permanent state
of war]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[readiness]{.underline}** that has been
with us since World War II. **[No matter where we live, we have raised
war taxes at work,]{.underline}** **[and [future soldiers at home lived
with the cultural atmosphere of racism and
belligerence]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that war mobilization often uses
or creates, and nourished the public opinion that helps send soldiers
off to war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** . . . **[All experience the problems
bred by war's glorification of violent masculinity]{.underline}** an**[d
the inequalities created by its redistribution of wealth]{.underline}**
**[to the already privileged]{.underline}**." Lutz adds that "**[we
all]{.underline}** have **[lived with the consequences of the
reinvigorated idea that we prove]{.underline}** and regenerate
**[ourselves through violence."]{.underline}** **[This reality turns out
to be even more all-consuming for military personnel]{.underline}** and
residents of Fayetteville, North Carolina---home of the sprawling Fort
Bragg army base---that Lutz chose as the focus of her research. Here
**[all [the contradictions of U.S. militarism came home to
roost]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a "dumping ground for the problems of the
American century of war and empire." Here **[we have exaggerated
problems of [poverty, crime,]{.mark} child [abuse, alcoholism,
prostitution, homelessness, and a wide array of physical and mental
injuries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[These [are]{.mark} the [fruits of a
permanent war system]{.mark} that transfigures daily life for those
within and close to the "homefront" of Empire.]{.underline}**

**[This is a world geared to warfare, preparation for
warfare]{.underline}**, **[killing]{.underline}**, **[and refinement of
the instruments for killing]{.underline}**. In her classic work Military
Brats, Mary Edwards Wertsch brilliantly weaves together narratives of
life in the military, focusing on two lingering motifs---the warrior
ethos, and the authoritarian character of social relations. She writes:
"Growing up inside the fortress \[as she did\] is like being drafted
into a gigantic theater company. **[[The role of the warrior
society]{.mark}, even in peacetime, [is to exist in a state of perpetual
'readiness']{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[one continuous dress rehearsal
for war.]{.underline}** The principal actors are immaculately costumed,
carefully scripted, and supplied with a vast array of props. They
practice elaborate large-scale stage movements---land, air, sea
exercises simulating attacks and defenses." All this is part of a deep
socialization process that Wertsch expertly unravels. Well before 9/11
and the subsequent wars, she could remark that "**[this is a society
prepared to wage war with the same relentless attention to detail it
brings to every moment of every day."]{.underline}** 23 22 **[In such a
culture authoritarian values inevitably prevail]{.underline}**: "The
Fortress, in short, is an authoritarian society. The masks worn there
are authoritarian masks, each exactly like the others of its rank, each
subservient to those of high rungs. The notions of conformity, order,
and obedience reign supreme." She adds: **["The great
paradox]{.underline}** of the military **[is that]{.underline}** its
members, the selfappointed **[front-line guardians of our cherished
American democratic values, do not live in a democracy
themselves]{.underline}**. **[Not only is individuality not
valued]{.underline}** in the military, it is discouraged. There is no
freedom of speech, save on the most innocuous level. **[[There is no
freedom of assembly]{.underline}]{.mark}** for anything that is not
authorized. **[[There is not even a concept of
privacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** . . ." God, community, family,
nation---everything is glorified through the mediations of warfare,
violence, hierarchy, and aggression.

**[[The permanent war system undermines democracy]{.mark} at every
turn]{.underline}**: imperial projects lead to authoritarian controls
domestically and globally. **[[Militarization gives rise not only to a
warrior ethos but to]{.mark} hierarchy, discipline, [secrecy,
surveillance]{.mark}, lopsided allocations, [and narrowed debate in
government operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Richard Falk writes of a
shift toward **[fascism]{.underline}** in the global order that, he
argues, **[permeates American domestic politics as power]{.underline}**
and wealth come to dominate the field of decision-making. **[An
[imperial arrogance]{.mark} that champions U.S.
exceptionalism]{.underline}** and **[[subverts]{.mark} universal norms
of [legality]{.mark} on the world scene,]{.underline}** that strives
toward full-spectrum dominance, sooner or later **[generates a regime of
lawlessness and violence at home.]{.underline}** **[A Hobbesian
universe,]{.underline}** after all, **[is predictably rife with fear and
hate]{.underline}**. Falk observes that **[an [authoritarian scenario
will be]{.mark} momentarily [disguised as necessary security
adjustment]{.mark} to]{.underline}** the threats of **[global
terrorism."]{.underline}** 27 26 While this "scenario" has surely gained
new credence since 9/11, the pattern was set during World War II with
solidification of the war economy and security state. Further, as
discussed in the first two chapters, **[the United States has throughout
its history worked tirelessly to defeat democratic possibilities outside
its own borders.]{.underline}** The **[neocons]{.underline}**, as we
have seen, **[embrace an uncompromising global
authoritarianism]{.underline}** (while preaching "democracy promotion")
driven by U.S. entitlement to world supremacy. Falk argues: " . . . I
consider it reasonable to think of something one might call global
fascism as the mentality of those seeking to regulate the world, from
either above or below, according to their I went on to demonstrate how
the libertarian principle of self-ownership supports PIA and why people
cannot be responsible for all effects of their actions:

On Jan. 13, **[Hawai'ians received a terrifying text]{.underline}**:
\"**[Ballistic missile threat inbound]{.underline}** to Hawai\'i. Seek
immediate shelter. This is not a drill.\" The alert was triggered
accidentally, but **[chaos reigned for nearly 38 minutes]{.underline}**
until a correction was issued. The state's governor later reported that
­children sought refuge in manholes, stores closed and denied shelter to
terrified customers and cars drove at high speed. **[Three days
later]{.underline}**, Japan's public broadcaster, **[NHK]{.underline}**,
**[mistakenly sent a similar alert warning]{.underline}** that North
Korea had just fired a missile. **[A correction was issued in five
minutes. The mishaps further intensified the anxiety]{.underline}** of
many Americans **[who were]{.underline}** already **[alarmed by the
elevated tensions]{.underline}** between the United States and North
Korea. Last November, **[[North Korea tested a missile]{.mark} that
[experts believe can strike anywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the U.S.
mainland. **[[The rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the two
nations **[[has escalated]{.mark} as well]{.underline}**. Last
September, **[Pyongyang threatened to reduce the United
States]{.underline}** to \"**[ashes and darkness]{.underline}**,\" while
President Donald Trump has promised to deliver \"fire and fury\" to Kim
Jong-un's regime. Such nuclear brinksmanship hasn't been seen since the
twilight of the Cold War. For the first time in at least a generation,
Americans are confronting not only the possibility of a nuclear attack,
but also a 24/7 news cycle transfixed by that possibility. Last August,
**[[a CBS poll found]{.mark} that [72 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
Americans **[[are uneasy]{.mark} about a possible
conflict]{.underline}** with North Korea. That same month, **[the
Chicago ­Council on Global Affairs reported that [75
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}** of Americans **[[consider]{.mark} North
Korea's [nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[program [a top
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In perhaps the most dramatic example of
simmering panic, **[[the B]{.mark}ulletin of the [A]{.mark}tomic
[S]{.mark}cientists]{.underline}** **[[set the Doomsday
Clock]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which symbolizes the likelihood of global
catastrophe, **[[to two minutes to midnight]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
January. The last time it was this close was in 1953. While no one knows
what the future holds, people's fears are very real---and the threat
appears to be cropping up more often in psychologists\' offices.
Although there are no hard numbers to report, anecdotally psychologists
say they are seeing more anxiety over a possible nuclear showdown.
\'Clinically significant anxiety\' People were particularly uneasy in
Hawai'i, even before the false alarm. Last December, the state tested
its nuclear warning siren system for the first time since the Cold War.
The Hawai'ian Islands are about 4,600 miles from North Korea. A nuclear
missile would make landfall in 20 minutes and kill an estimated 18,000
civilians. Molly Bahr, a licensed therapist in Honolulu, says that never
in her 10-year career has she seen such an increase in the "frequency
and intensity of fear and clinically significant anxiety," even among
clients who haven't previously experienced such symptoms. Unlike during
the nuclear scares of the 1950s, '60s and '80s, **[today's
[anxiety]{.mark} [ricochets nonstop between]{.mark} cable [news]{.mark},
social [media and]{.mark} online [forums]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[In
an age of breaking news]{.mark} alerts]{.underline}** on smartphones**[,
simply [being an informed citizen]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[means
volunteering]{.mark} oneself [for]{.mark} continuous
[stress]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Graham Davey, PhD, an emeritus professor
of psychology at the University of Sussex in England who specializes in
anxiety disorders, notes that **[contemporary [news consumers
are]{.mark} [experiencing]{.mark} ­[trauma-like
symptoms]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[because of their exposure to
broadcasts]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and breaking news.]{.underline}**
"One of the effects that we've researched is that **[[exposure to
negative news]{.mark} causally [influences your]{.mark} own personal
[worries]{.mark} by [making you catastrophize them
more]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Davey says. (In a 1997 study, Davey and
his colleagues found that people exposed to negative news reported
feeling sadder and more anxious after, and they also tended to obsess
over their own worries more.) Internalizing negative news is especially
prevalent in the United States, where APA's 2017 Stress in America
survey found that 95 percent of Americans follow the news regularly. One
in five Americans, or 20 percent, report that they check their social
media constantly, a significant increase over 2016. More than half of
those surveyed said that the news causes stress. Nobody knows the
potential long-term psychiatric effects of nuclear anxiety. Clinical
studies on the matter are scarce, and because America hasn't grappled
with a serious nuclear adversary in decades, the pathology of this
anxiety has yet to be fully documented. Davey suggests that the anxiety
is temporary and tied to negative news reports, but **[[when the
news]{.mark} is [overwhelmingly negative]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as many
patients feel it is today, **[[anxiety is a chronic
response]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Advising patients Laura Brown, PhD, a
psychologist in Seattle, was 10 during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
She believed then that her hometown of Cleveland was a target, so she
practiced a prayer ritual and wrote imploring letters to President John
F. Kennedy. "I still remember how frightened I was and how frightened
the adults were," Brown says today. "I was fearful that the world could
end at any moment." More than a half-century later, Brown once again
lives in a city that she believes could be in the crosshairs of a rogue
regime. Seattle, one of the most populated metro areas on the West
Coast, has strategic value as a nuclear target. It's near the Whidbey
Island and Kitsap naval bases and the Joint Base Lewis-McChord (formerly
Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base). In addition, Boeing Aviation
operates several facilities in the area. "I've never experienced so much
discussion from people who are feeling anxious and fearful," Brown says.
She advises clients to reduce their time online and read news when
they're less likely to feel vulnerable: midafternoon, for example,
instead of just before bedtime. **[These strategies are the starting
point for recommendations]{.underline}** of psychologists now
**[[counseling an]{.mark} unprecedented [influx of patients]{.mark}
worried [that America is careening toward
disaster]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### L: A2 "Reflexivity"

#### The aff [isn't]{.underline} reflexive\-\--it [does not]{.underline} change the [fundamental nature]{.underline} of security

**[Steele 7]{.underline}** (Brent, Professor of Political Science --
University of Kansas, "'Eavesdropping on Honored Ghosts': From Classical
to Reflexive Realism", Journal of International Relations and
Development, 10, p. 284-285)

This skeptical view of the eschaton means that **[[rather than being
biased, like neorealism]{.mark}, toward the status quo]{.underline}**,30
**[[reflexive realism is]{.mark} instead perpetually [skeptical]{.mark}
of the authority exercised by state elites]{.underline}**, and
**[specifically the 'big ideas' that become a part of elite
discourse]{.underline}** which can lead to dangerous policies.31
**[[Rather than reifying power, reflexive realism asks us to challenge
the manner in which power is projected]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Scan the
words used in this reflexive presentation of realism. Far from being the
dominant, mainstream, status quo monolith that we were trained to
recognize in graduate school, **[[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}** instead
'**[inevitably [antagonistic toward political power
]{.mark}]{.underline}**y \[**[a\] rebellion against the seduction of
prevailing structures of power, identity, and knowledge']{.underline}**
(Williams 2005a: 179, emphasis added).32 Budding IR scholars may tend to
forget that what motivated especially the post (World War II) realists
in their seemingly contrarian positions was their concern for the
republics in which they wrote. Morgenthau was attempting to 'perform' a
'service for his adopted country' (Lebow 2003: 242). With reflexive
realism, we look back at classical realist writings for evidence of such
contemplation about contemporary problems. Morgenthau and Niebuhr not
only buck the common portrayal of 'hawkish' realists, they provided some
of the most insightful arguments against the Vietnam War. Writing in
1969, Morgenthau stated that his: concern is justified not only
historically, in view of the shortcomings of our \[American\] foreign
policies, but also pragmatically, with a view toward avoiding the
mistakes of the past. It is now generally admitted that our Vietnam
policy has failed, but, if we were to let it go at that, we would risk
applying the same faulty assumptions and principles that have brought
the Vietnam disaster upon us to other situations with similarly
disastrous results (1969: viii). According to Jace Weaver (1995),
Niebuhr was a proponent of American exceptionalism until this war.
Despite the fact that Niebuhr recognized how certain religions and
patriotism blinded nation-states from their own limitations, he still
viewed the US' mission as one of necessity during the Cold War. Yet this
view would quickly change,33 so that by 1967, 'The contradiction between
our \[American\] ideal aims of a peace of conciliation and such an
imposed peace, which only a defeated enemy would accept, can be
understood only in the light of an ironic self-deception --- ironic
because we are the victims of our own ideology' (Niebuhr 1968: 11,
emphasis added). And by 1969, Niebuhr would assert that anti-communist
'fanaticism y ha\[d\] caused \[the United States\] to stumble into the
most pointless, costly and bloody war in \[its\] history' (Niebuhr,
quoted in Reinitz 1980: 120). Like the classical realists they resource,
**[[reflexive realists]{.underline}]{.mark}** now **[[provide]{.mark} a
particularly salient, [effective critique of contemporary foreign
policy]{.mark}, but one that is unique when compared to that made by
mainstream realists]{.underline}**. **[The current [debate]{.mark} over
the Iraq War [between]{.mark} neoconservatives and [mainstream realists
]{.mark}]{.underline}**in the US has appeared in various forums, most
notably in the neoconservative publication Commentary (Rosen 2005).
Stephen Walt (2006: 4) stated in a future issue thAT Realists were in
the vanguard of the opposition to war with Iraq in 2003y Today, with
thousands of Americans and Iraqis killed and wounded, a price tag that
will eventually exceed \$1 trillion (!), and no end in sight, which
group seems to have the clearest vision of our national interest? For
all its limitations, realism remains a more valuable guide to U.S.
foreign policy than the idealistic fantasies offered by its primary
intellectual opponents. **[Walt's is [a cost/benefit analysis of
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, one echoed in the ISG report noted at the
beginning of this article. **[However, it [fails to comprehensively
challenge the philosophy that has driven]{.mark} the Bush
administration's]{.underline}** Iraq [**[policy]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[A critique]{.underline}** of the Iraq War set in the mold of Niebuhr
and Morgenthau's critique of Vietnam **[would begin by asserting how
hubristic impulses for American hegemonic expansion actually hastened
American demise]{.underline}**. The inability to recognize the limits of
power in international politics was a strategic miscalculation ---
demonstrating the cyclical pattern of human history rather than the
linear trajectory assumed by eschatologies. The abnormal (and thus
imprudent) behavior, according to reflexive realism, was to invade Iraq.

**[Isacoff 15]{.underline}** (Jonathan, Associate Professor of Political
Science and the Chair of Environmental Studies @ Gonzaga, "Why IR Needs
Deweyan Pragmatism," Perspectives on Political Science, Vol. 44, No. 1,
2015, pg. 26-33)

The well-known RCT scholars Shepsle and Bonchek humorously note that
while it might not be "rocket science," the study of politics should be
scientific.46 Others, especially postmodernist critics, argue against
the notion of political science and IR as science. A Deweyan pragmatist
approach would suggest that this debate is not useful. By that, I mean
that **[[what IR is]{.mark} or [is not is not nearly as important as
what it achieves]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So the question should not be
whether IR is scientific, but rather, how scientific does it need to be
to get the job done? To this, there are many answers, but I suggest a
line of reasoning: the scientific method in the most general sense is
useful in helping to explain how and why, all else equal, causal
processes work. Put differently, **[[if we want to know]{.mark} how and
[why]{.mark} some [states go to war]{.mark} and others do not, [it would
be more useful]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the sense of **[[getting]{.mark} logically [coherent]{.mark},
[empirically verifiable answers]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[to analyze
historical cases]{.mark} systematically]{.underline}** than it would be
to consult with a shaman or use a crystal ball to obtain an answer.
**[This is not say that there is not an important role for [textual
interpretation]{.mark} in the process of studying war and other
international phenomena]{.underline}**. Indeed, I elsewhere argue that
interpretation of historical texts is crucial to making valid claims
about wars.47 **[But]{.underline}** the main point here is that
**[interpretation [is a means]{.mark} toward an end]{.underline}**,
namely, the process of coping with the world via human experience.
**[Toward that end, interpretation is]{.underline}** necessary and
useful, but it is **[[not the end]{.mark} itself]{.underline}**. A
second point is that **[there is clearly a pragmatic and justifiable
need for certain types of quantitative methods]{.underline}**, namely,
statistics, though not necessarily formal models, in some segments of
IR. Taking a simple example for illustrative purposes, if one wished to
study the effect of speed limits on motor vehicle fatalities, the use of
aggregate data statistically analyzed would be far superior to standing
on the corner waiting for an accident to observe or reading several
diary accounts of individual accidents. **[The key point]{.underline}**
here, however**, [is not that]{.underline}** statistical **[methods are
inherently better, or more "rigorous"]{.underline}** than any other type
of method. Rather, **[the use of statistically analyzed data to find
answers to problems]{.underline}** of highway fatalities **[creates
knowledge that if properly applied, would alleviate "concrete human
woes,"]{.underline}** which is to say it would help to save lives. That
is pragmatic political science.48 What Is a Problem?
**[[Many]{.underline}]{.mark}** political scientists **[[believe
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the idea of having **[[a "problem
orientation]{.mark}"]{.underline}** for the field. For example, Atul
Kohli asserts that there is a strong consensus among leading experts
"that comparative politics is very much a problem-driven field of
study." "What motivates the best comparative politics research are
puzzles of real-world significance," writes Kohli, in "The Role of
Theory in Comparative Politics: A Symposium."49 Similarly, Ian Shapiro,
**[responding to the question of what would be [a better
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}** than RCT **[asks]{.underline}** the
question: "**[What is the phenomenon to be explained?]{.underline}**...
**[The formulation of alternative explanations]{.underline}**, in other
words, **[[should be]{.mark} a [problem-driven]{.mark}
activity]{.underline}**."50 This is clearly consistent with Deweyan
pragmatism; in fact, it is inherently pragmatist. "A Deweyan pragmatic
approach to political inquiry," writes Maurice Meilleur, "would
transform political science from a discipline, based on a set of
methods, into a profession, based on a set of problems."51 But what,
more specifically, is a "problem orientation?" First, it is clear that
Kohli and his colleagues mean an empirically driven problem orientation.
That is, the study of **[[politics should be driven by empirical, not
theoretical or methodological problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Careful
not to push this point too far, a Deweyan pragmatist would suggest that
**[[theorization]{.mark} is]{.underline}** an
**[important]{.underline}** activity, **[but it [must not lose its link
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** problems of human experience, which is to say
**[[empirical problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, Kohli and
**[others advocating]{.underline}** an empirically driven **[problem
orientation have little to say about how to identify and value
problems]{.underline}**. After all, there is a limitless supply of
political problems only a fraction of which can be studied. In response,
I would argue that **[some problems are more significant to the
detection and response to human suffering and thus more deserving of
study, than others]{.underline}**. This is itself a tricky ethical
problem, for who is to say what is or is not a "real problem?" One
reader of this manuscript suggested that "What is really going on here,
when one scratches the analytical surface, is not that IR theorists
aren\'t discussing problems; it\'s that they are discussing problems
that the author does not feel are worthy of attention. But why should we
accept that the author\'s "problems" are more important or privileged?
Why does the author get to decide what a "real" problem is?" This is a
good question but it is a misreading of the argument. **[Nowhere
does]{.underline}** Dewey or **[this]{.underline}** author **[imply that
any individual could or should decide or dictate which problems matter
and which do not]{.underline}**. To the contrary, **[the question of
"who decides" is]{.underline}** a **[public]{.underline}** deliberation
problem, a subject Dewey addressed exhaustively in his classic The
Public and Its Problems.52 According to Dewey, **[problems are the
direct outcome of a public\'s determination of its common
good]{.underline}**. A full analysis of how this works, or in some
cases, fails to work in practice is beyond the scope of this article.
But it is important to note that there is no argument here for the
privileging of one private individual\'s notion of what constitutions
"real problem" versus that of another. That is for the public to decide.
Human Woe and Issues That Matter The final point to be made about
reconstruction stems directly from the previous discussion: **[some
problems matter more than others with regard to the alleviation of
concrete human suffering. Which issues matter]{.underline}** the
**[most]{.underline}** in our world? Ultimately, per Dewey\'s political
philosophy touched on above, **[that is for the public to
decide]{.underline}**. Assuming that there ever could be a "common
good," we can hypothesize that **[people might choose to focus
on]{.underline}** issues that affect them daily, **[issues such as
climate change]{.underline}**, poverty, health care, education, racism,
and sexism, as well as **[war and peace]{.underline}**, all issues
**[that are of grave importance to humanity]{.underline}**. IR,
especially in its American form, with its disproportionate emphasis on
global security and great power war, has given scant attention to too
many other issues, and when attention is given to the "lesser" topics,
they are relegated to sub-sub-specializations within the discipline,
"Gender and IR," for instance. More problematic from the standpoint of
pragmatism, **[[the approach-driven wing]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
discipline **[[is more concerned with which paradigm has scored more
points]{.mark} in the epic contest for paradigmatic supremacy [than
with]{.mark} the matter of [how the world]{.mark} could or [should
respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** to climate change or why hundreds of
million of children lack basic nutrition and medical care. **[[The
interpretivist]{.mark}/linguistic [wing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in
contrast, **[[is more concerned with how texts are interpreted]{.mark}
in graduate seminars than with the fact that children in inner cities
cannot even read a text at all]{.underline}.**53
**[[Many]{.underline}]{.mark}** IR scholars are still fighting over
whether and to what extent "unit-level variables" should be taken into
consideration in understanding international politics (and if so,
whether one might still rightly be accepted in the club of realism).54
Others **[are trying to [demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}** that IR
constructivism is really "**[[liberalism in
disguise]{.underline}]{.mark}**."55 **[[This is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
not a stab at "why realism is (yet again) wrong." It is **[a critique of
[the self-definitionally obsessed, paradigm-driven
culture]{.mark}]{.underline}** of academic IR. I would not go so far as
to claim that there are no scholars who study everyday politics; many
clearly do.56 Rather, the problem is that that **[[the incentive]{.mark}
structure [to contribute to]{.mark} the "big [debates]{.mark}" of the
discipline]{.underline}**, namely, those **[[at the paradigmatic
level]{.mark}, is a project that [drifts]{.mark} ever afar [from]{.mark}
the [problems of "concrete human woe]{.mark}" that affect]{.underline}**
the other **[millions]{.underline}** of people who happen not to have
graduate degrees in IR.

Imagery can enact powerful effects, since political actors are almost
always pressed to take action when confronted with images of atrocity
and human suffering resultant from wars, famines and natural disasters.
Usually, humanitarian emergencies are conveyed through media
representations, which indicate the important role of images in
producing emergency situations as (global) events (Benthall 1993;
Campbell 2003b; Lisle 2009; Moeller 1999; Postman 1987). Debbie Lisle
(2009: 148) maintains that, \'we see that the objects, issues and events
we usually study \[. . .\] do not even exist without the media \[.. .\]
to express them'. As a consequence, visual images have political and
ethical consequences as a result of their role in shaping private and
public ways of seeing (Bleiker. Kay 2007). This is because how people
come to know, think about and respond to developments in the world is
deeply entangled with how these developments are made visible to them.
Visual representations participate in the processes of how people
situate themselves in space and time, because seeing involves
accumulating and ordering information in order to be able to construct
knowledge of people, places and events. For example, the remembrance of
such events as the Vietnam War, the terrorist attacks of 11 September
2001 or the torture in Abu Ghraib prison cannot be separated from the
ways in which these events have been represented in films, TV and
photography (Bleiker 2009; Campbell/Shapiro 2007; Moller2007). The
visibility of these events can help to set the conditions for specific
forms of political action. The current war in Afghanistan serves as an
example of this. Another is the nexus of hunger images and relief
operations. Vision and visuality thus become part and parcel of
political dynamics, also revealing the ethical dimension of imagery, as
it affects the ways in which people interact with each other. However,
**[[particular representations do not automatically lead to particular
responses as,]{.underline}]{.mark}** for instance, **[[proponents of
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** so-called **[[\'CNN effect' would
argue]{.underline}]{.mark}** (for an overview of the debates among

between]{.mark} a specific [image and]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
**[political [intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[in which]{.mark}
a dependent variable [(the image) would explain the outcome of]{.mark}
an independent one ([the]{.mark} [act).]{.mark}]{.underline}** David
**[[Perlmutter]{.underline}]{.mark}** (1998: I), for instance,
**[explicitly [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as he calls it,
**[[the]{.mark} \'visual [determinism\' of
images]{.mark},]{.underline}** which dominates political and public
opinion. Referring to findings based on public surveys, he argues that
the **[[formation of opinion]{.underline}]{.mark}**s by individuals
**[[depends not on images but on]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[idiosyncratic]{.mark} predispositions and
[values]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see also, Domke et al. 2002; Perlmutter

### L: No Prior Questions---1AR

#### No prior questions

**[Jackson]{.underline}**, professor of IR -- American University,
**['15]{.underline}** (Patrick Thaddeus, "Must International Studies Be
a Science?" *Millennium - Journal of International Studies* vol. 43, no.
3, p. 942-965, June)

These **[[diverse method]{.mark}ologie[s]{.mark} [have different
approaches to causation]{.mark}, to case [comparison, and]{.mark} to
[explanation]{.mark} in general; those differences]{.underline}**, in
turn, **[mean]{.underline}** that **[[different]{.underline}]{.mark}**
scientific **[[method]{.mark}ologie[s]{.mark} [generate
different]{.mark} kinds of [valid claims]{.mark} with different
epistemic statuses, and should not be regarded as poor approximations to
or deficient forms of one another.]{.underline}** While neopositivists
look for cross-case covariation as the truest mark of causation,
critical realists look for dispositional causal powers, analyticists
apply ideal-typical models to disclose the specific features of
individual cases, and reflexive scholars ground their claims in their
own social locations. There is no reason why this plurality has to lead
to relativism, but neither should it be misunderstood as creating a
simple, homogenous account of the world; translation challenges persist,
and **[the result of a pluralist science is a variety of warranted
knowledge-claims.]{.underline}**22

But for all of this internal diversity, there are important
commonalities among these varieties of scientific methodology that serve
to distinguish them, as a group, from other forms of knowing. Following
Max Weber, we might characterise all four of these scientific
methodologies as aiming at a 'thoughtful ordering of empirical
actuality',23 or, to put it another way, as participating in a form of
knowing that emphasises systematic claims, public criticism intended to
improve those claims, and a specific kind of 'worldliness' that excludes
references to divine commands and magical forces. This is not to say
that a claim has to achieve some specific level of systematicity,
publicity, and/or worldliness in order to be regarded as 'scientific';
the commonality I am highlighting here is not a candidate for a
demarcation criterion that would allow us to distinguish science from
non-science in any kind of definitive fashion.24 Instead, I am
suggesting that in the space marked out by these methodologies,
questions about a claim's systematicity, its susceptibility to public
criticism, and its worldliness are in some sense appropriate questions
to ask. In effect, to regard ourselves as being engaged in scientific
inquiry is to invite these questions, and to submit our claims to
evaluation in terms of these criteria.

The kind of knowledge that is supposed to be produced by efforts to be
as systematic, public, and worldly as one can be is knowledge of a
particular kind: factual, propositional knowledge, or what we might call
'knowing-that'.25 This is the kind of knowing that Wittgenstein had in
mind when he suggested, in the opening sections of the Tractatus, that
the world 'is all that is the case...the totality of facts, not of
things'.26 It is what Aristotle called epistemic knowing: 'universal,
invariable, context-independent' and 'based on general analytical
rationality'.27 It prizes relative impersonality in connecting claims to
their warrants, in that the validity of a claim is not subject to
idiosyncratic impressions but is instead articulated in a way that is
understood as generally established.28 In Weber's formulation, the goal
of this kind of knowing is to produce a set of factual claims that even
someone who did not share our values would find compelling.29

Here again it is important to note that this is not some kind of
absolute standard that these methodologies necessarily meet. **[It is
unclear to me that we ever have perfectly impersonal knowledge, or that
any claim whatsoever achieves anything like universal generality. But
this is not the point.]{.underline}** Instead, the point is that
**[[epistemic claims advanced in the]{.mark} methodological
[mode]{.mark}s [of]{.mark} neopositivism, critical [realism]{.mark},
analyticism, and even reflexivity [are accompanied by standards of
validity that purport to be something other than an arbitrary]{.mark}
whim]{.underline}** binding only on the speaker. **[The logical
condition of possibility for]{.underline}** Sandra **[Harding's
suggestion that]{.underline}** the accumulated body of what we call
'**[scientific knowledge']{.underline}** **[is thoroughly marked by
cultural particularity and a colonial past]{.underline}**, and her call
for a 'strong objectivity' that brings previously marginalised
perspectives back into the conversation, **[is precisely the notion that
there is something illegitimate and untenable about this unacknowledged
partiality]{.underline}**.30 **[And the claim that some account of
things is Eurocentric or androcentric is no more and no less reliant on
similar definitions and procedures shared by a community of speaker and
audience than is the claim that dyadic democracy and war frequency are
inversely correlated]{.underline}**---and as such, **[the very form of
the claim]{.underline}** **[opens the possibility of questioning just
how impersonally, epistemically valid it is. 'Epistemically valid for
me/for us' does not make any sense, because [the very idea of epistemic
knowing implies validity independent of any conceptual
scheme]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[even if]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[vocabulary]{.underline}** within which the
claim is made **[is itself local and contingent.]{.underline}**31

### L: Realism Good/True---2AC

#### Realism is the most [ethical]{.underline} paradigm---it accepts the [inherent insecurity]{.underline} of the nuclear age as a [precondition]{.underline} for genuine hospitality. Rejecting the nation-state lapses into liberal interventionism and [global nuclear civil war]{.underline}.

**[Lundborg, 19]{.underline}**---Swedish Defence University (Tom, "The
ethics of neorealism: Waltz and the time of international life,"
European Journal of International Relations, Volume: 25 issue: 1,
page(s): 229-249, dml)

Conditioned by the trace, **[survival is]{.underline}** thus
**[inseparable from]{.underline}** finitude and **[the constant threat
of [erasure]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1976: 167). According to
Derrida (1984b: 65, emphasis added): 'it belongs to the trace to erase
itself, to elude that which might maintain it in presence'. In this way,
the trace also points to the elusiveness of life, and to the fact that
nothing can ever guarantee the infinite existence of anything. It tells
us that **[life is nothing but a 'play of traces', which lacks an
absolute origin and is inherently mortal]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1984a:
15). **[This]{.underline}** play of traces brings us back to Hägglund's
notion of the 'time of life', which **[[highlights the]{.mark} central
[importance of]{.mark} temporal [finitude for grasping]{.mark} the
general conditions of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As he puts it: 'This
radical finitude of survival is not a lack of being that is desirable to
overcome. Rather, **[the finitude of survival opens the chance for
everything that is desired and the threat of everything that is
feared]{.underline}**' (Hägglund, 2008: 1--2). There is, then, an
important 'double bind' to the tracing of time. On the one hand, it is
because nothing is infinite, immortal or present in itself that new life
can emerge. On the other hand, the lack of self-presence means that life
can never be immune to alteration, contamination and death. **[In order
for anything to live, it must consequently be mortal and open to
unpredictable change]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1976: 143). Even if an
infinite and immortal life, free from dangers, might seem desirable, it
would be a self-refuting desire since it implies desiring the end of the
possibility to desire anything at all. More precisely, it would be the
same as desiring the end of the continuous flow of time that allows new
life to emerge while exposing everything that lives to the threat of
coming to an end. Immortality cancels out the time of mortal life and
renders survival obsolete. Counterintuitively, Hägglund (2008: 32--33)
thus notes, mortality can be seen as the 'best' or most desirable, while
immortality is the 'worst' or least desirable. **[While [this]{.mark}
may seem like a rejection of life, it is, in fact, an affirmation of
life. It positively [affirms the chance to live]{.mark} precisely [on
the condition that inherent]{.mark} in any movement of survival [is the
risk of]{.mark} life coming to [an end. Refusing this]{.mark} risk
[would be]{.mark} the same as [refusing to live]{.mark}, since to live
is to negotiate the relationship between life and death.]{.underline}**
Temporal finitude is significant, moreover, not only for grasping the
general conditions of life, but for explaining why **[any act of
survival must encounter the uncertainty of the future]{.underline}**.
Returning to Waltz for a moment, **[it is precisely [this]{.mark}
uncertainty that [makes it impossible to know if today's friend will
stay a friend or]{.mark} suddenly [turn into an
enemy]{.mark}]{.underline}**: 'In the absence of an external authority,
a state cannot be sure that today's friend will not be tomorrow's
enemy', writes Waltz (2000: 10). **[[If we]{.mark} were able to [acquire
full knowledge]{.mark} of if and when a friend becomes an
enemy]{.underline}**, we would bring the future under our control.
However, then the future would no longer be a genuinely open future, in
which the chance of survival is inseparable from finitude and mortality.
**[[Survival would]{.mark} then [lose its value]{.mark} and become
redundant as [life turns into]{.mark} nothing but [a calculable
formula]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So, what are the implications of
Derrida's notion of survival and his critique of the 'calculable' for
our understanding of 'ethics'? First of all, it means that **[[ethics
cannot be]{.mark} translated into [static]{.mark} ethical
ideals]{.underline}**. As Derrida has elaborated on in relation to a
wide array of issues, including justice, responsibility, hospitality,
friendship and the gift, **[ethics]{.underline}** rather **[depends on
maintaining openness to the perpetual coming of the
future]{.underline}**. This openness means that **[none of these issues
can ever be linked to something pure, uncontaminated and incorruptible
that is immune to unexpected alterations.]{.underline}** To take one
specific example, hospitality is, for Derrida, crucial for thinking
about ethics (see Derrida, 2000). This is because an **[act of
hospitality suggests that the self does not simply exist in pure
isolation of what lies 'outside' the self, but must always negotiate its
relation with]{.underline}** the non-self, that is, **[the
other]{.underline}**. Ethics is, for this reason, inseparable from
hospitality since both terms highlight the necessity of relating to and
opening up space for others. At the same time, **[[hospitality cannot
be]{.mark} 'absolute' or '[pure' in]{.mark} the sense of [conforming to
a static]{.mark} metaphysical [ideal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
Derrida, **[not only would [such]{.mark} an ideal [be impossible to
achieve]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Kantian sense11, **[it would be
essentially [undesirable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is because **[the
very aspiration towards a pure metaphysical ideal would have as its aim
the closure of the uncertainty that makes the self--other encounter
possible in the first place. The welcoming of strangers must therefore
always involve a chance as well as a threat: the chance of some sort of
positive and friendly transformation, and the threat that the other
turns into an enemy doing harm to the host]{.underline}** (Derrida,
2000: 15; Hägglund, 2008: 103--105). The only way to eliminate the
potential threat inherent in any act of hospitality would be to make the
self completely immune to the other. Such immunity, however, would close
down the self--other encounter before it could happen at all. Derrida
(2003: 129) thus rhetorically asks: The visit might actually be very
dangerous, and we must not ignore this fact, but would a hospitality
without risk, a hospitality backed by certain assurances, a hospitality
protected by an immune system against the wholly other, be true
hospitality? Derrida's point here is that **[hospitality categorically
cannot correspond to something pure, like a universal ideal situation
beyond violence]{.underline}**. This is because **[without the threat of
violence, the very act of welcoming the other would not be possible in
the first place]{.underline}**. In order for this act to be 'possible',
it must simultaneously be 'impossible', in the pure metaphysical sense
(see also Bulley, 2017: 12; Vaughan-Williams, 2007: 121). **[While
ethics is often linked to a seemingly self-evident desire to reach an
absolute metaphysical ideal, [Derrida]{.mark}'s philosophy contests the
desirability of such ideals altogether and [offers]{.mark} a stark
[warning against any attempt to immunize the 'good' from the
'bad']{.mark}, 'peace' from 'violence', 'friends' from 'enemies', and so
on]{.underline}**. This is why, in Derrida's view, **[there has to be a
violent or non-ethical opening of ethics]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1976:
140; 1978: 128). **[To desire the closure of this opening would be the
same as desiring the elimination of that which makes any ethics possible
at all: its exposure to the uncertainty of the future, and the
indestructible threat that inheres in all encounters with
others]{.underline}**. Rather than linking ethics to a desire for the
purely good, **[[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Derridean sense
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore **[[tied to an affirmation
of]{.mark} the [uncertainty]{.mark} of the future, which opens up to the
'good' as well as the 'bad'.]{.underline}** The ethics of neorealism
**[[Derrida's]{.mark} notion of]{.underline}** the violent opening of
**[[ethics fits]{.mark} remarkably well [with]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
two core assumptions of Waltz's theory of international politics:
**[[the anarchic]{.mark} structure of the international political
[system and]{.mark} states' [desire to survive]{.mark} within this
system]{.underline}**. On this basis, it can be argued that **[there
is]{.underline}**, indeed, **[an ethics of neorealism]{.underline}**. It
is found in the 'Waltzian baseline' rather than in attempts to use that
baseline to establish law-like patterns of behaviour.12 To grasp the
ethics of neorealism, **[it is]{.underline}** therefore **[necessary to
shift focus]{.underline}** from causal laws and testable hypotheses,
**[to the structural conditions that shape and affect the behaviour of
states in a non-deterministic manner]{.underline}**.13 Hence, **[the
'structure']{.underline}** in Waltz's theory has **[to be grasped as an
open structure that leaves ample room for chance and
contingency]{.underline}**. Crucially, **[if we could know for certain
what states will do on the basis of either the structure of the system
or some predetermined motives of the subjects within the
system]{.underline}**, the uncertainty of international life would
disappear and **[the 'politics' of international politics would lose its
meaning]{.underline}**.14 Rather than trying to rectify the lack of
certainty by creating a stronger sense of certainty, **[it
is]{.underline}** therefore **[imperative to affirm the uncertainties
created by the system. It is important]{.underline}**, moreover, **[to
oppose the distinction between ethical desirability and political
possibility, since the reproduction of this distinction blocks from view
the conditions of international life that make ethical thinking and
action possible in the first place.]{.underline}** Positivist social
science and liberal interpretations of Kant are thus, very crudely put,
the main obstacles to grasping the ethics of international life. In
resisting both moves, **[neo[realism does not]{.mark} seek to [close
down]{.mark} the violent opening of [ethics]{.mark} inherent in the
structure of anarchy]{.underline}**, for example, **[[by
formulating]{.mark} metaphysical [ideals informing states how they
should act or how they ought to be]{.mark}come [friends rather than
enemies]{.mark}. There can be no absolute friendship between states, and
[no state can]{.mark} ever [offer absolute hospitality]{.mark} to
another state. At the heart of every inter-state relation, there is
mistrust, uncertainty and incalculability. To positively affirm the
latter is not to say that uncertainty or incalculability is good per se.
Rather, it implies that they are seen as basic and irrefutable
conditions of international life, which, consequently, are not even
desirable to overcome]{.underline}**. Hence, it also implies that as
long as there is international life, there must be 'the ominous shadow
of the future \[that\] continues to cast its pall over interacting
states' (Waltz, 2000: 39). Crucially, Waltz's reference to
**[this]{.underline}** shadow **[should not be read as an expression of
determinism. It expresses rather an affirmation of uncertainty: the
'uncertainty of each about the other's future intentions and
actions']{.underline}** (Waltz, 1979: 105). **[In order to give
friendship in international politics a chance]{.underline}**, so to
speak, **[the possibility that a friend suddenly becomes an enemy must
never be eliminated. Attempts to create absolute trust in inter-state
relations are therefore not only impossible to achieve in the practical
sense, but essentially undesirable]{.underline}**.15 Along similar
lines, Derrida explains how **[friendship is possible only if one
remains open to the deception of the other, since it is precisely the
unconditional openness to whatever may happen in the encounter between
self and other that makes it possible to develop any sort of friendship
in the first place]{.underline}** (Derrida, 2005: 219). Even if we were
to accept Alexander Wendt's (1999) distinction between different
'cultures of anarchy', some of which are more 'friendly' than others,
**[[it is not self-evident that]{.mark} a culture in which
[friendship]{.mark} is prioritized [over enmity is]{.mark} actually a
[better]{.mark} one]{.underline}**. This is because in order to exclude
the possibility that a friend may suddenly become an enemy, one must
first eliminate the time of international life that makes the
self--other encounter possible in the first place. For the same reason,
the key message of democratic peace theory --- that all states should
become democracies in order to minimize or eliminate the possibility of
wars --- is not only practically impossible, but also ethically
undesirable. It is impossible to verify because there is no democracy
that is immune to corruptibility (Waltz, 2000: 10), but, in addition to
that, it can be seen as undesirable since **[the notion that all states
must conform to the same universal ideal cancels out their freedom to
act, to take moral responsibility and so on]{.underline}**. The
undesirability of **[[a system that eradicates]{.mark} violence,
[borders]{.mark} and discrimination]{.underline}** is further underlined
by Waltz (1979: 111--114) in his discussion of the 'virtues of anarchy'.
Therein, he attacks the idea of transforming the international system
into a world government. Not only **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** such
a transformation **['[be]{.mark} an invitation to prepare for
[world]{.mark} civil [war']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Waltz, 1979: 112),
**[but it would take away the constitutive violence at the heart of
inter-state relations in the structure of anarchy.]{.underline}**
**[[The]{.mark} constant [possibility of war]{.mark} in the
international system [means]{.mark} that [states will always be wary of
provoking others]{.mark} in the search for security]{.underline}**. As
he puts it: **[The constant possibility [that]{.mark} force will be used
limits manipulations, [moderates demands, and serves as an incentive for
the settlement of disputes]{.mark}. One who knows that pressing too hard
may lead to war has strong reason to consider whether possible gains are
worth the risks entailed]{.underline}**.... The possibility that
conflicts among nations may lead to long and costly wars has ...
sobering effects. (Waltz, 1979: 113--114) In this way, **[the conditions
of peace in the international system can be said to rest on the constant
possibility of war]{.underline}**. In making this point, Waltz argues
against moral universalism. Hence, unwittingly or otherwise, he also
opens up space for ethical negotiation by recognizing the finitude of
**[the political subject]{.underline}**, who **[is free to interact with
others only on the condition that self and other do not have to conform
to the 'same' universal ideal.]{.underline}** **[The subject is thus
able to take moral responsibility and ponder on how to make ethical
decisions, which, without difference and alterity, would turn into a
strictly formal procedure based on the 'mechanical application of
rules']{.underline}** (Zehfuss, 2009: 146). **[Responsibility and
ethical decisions are]{.underline}**, thus, **[made possible precisely
by the impossibility of predetermining what is the 'right' decision in
any given context]{.underline}**. As Derrida argues, **[irrespective of
how thorough the decision-making procedure is, and regardless of how
much knowledge is acquired before taking a decision]{.underline}**: the
instant of the decision, if there is to be a decision, must be
heterogeneous to this accumulation of knowledge. Otherwise, there is no
responsibility. In this sense only must the person taking the decision
not know everything. Even if one knows everything, **[the
decision]{.underline}**, if there is one, **[must advance toward a
future that is not known, that cannot be anticipated]{.underline}**.
(Derrida, 2002b: 231) **[The impossibility of anchoring the decision in
rational calculation is]{.underline}**, in this sense, **[what creates
the chance for any decisions to be taken at all]{.underline}**. The
instant of the decision belongs, then, not to a fully present moment in
which the subject calculates the future consequences of the decision,
but to a future that is incalculable (see Derrida, 2002a). **[[It
is]{.mark} precisely [this]{.mark} [incalculability]{.mark}, and the
uncertainty of the future, [that]{.mark}]{.underline}** Waltz's
conception of **[[anarchy]{.mark} positively [affirms]{.mark}. Rather
than making the instant of the decision obsolete by transforming the
decision into a mere application of rules, anarchy makes the ethical
decision 'possible'.]{.underline}** Even if Waltz repeatedly claims that
the desire to survive is a purely pragmatic assumption made strictly for
the purpose of constructing an explanatory theory, it is not neutral or
innocent. First and foremost, Waltzian **[neorealism expresses an ethics
due to the way it affirms states' desire to survive by stipulating the
necessary conditions of their survival]{.underline}**. More precisely,
**[[it]{.mark} affirms the uncertainty of international life by refusing
to reduce the play of relations between states to a calculable formula
or a regulative ideal, and that rather [embraces chance]{.mark} and
contingency as central features of the anarchic system --- features that
make states simultaneously free and insecure]{.underline}**.16 In this
light, **[the primary significance]{.underline}** of Waltz's theory
**[is [not as]{.mark} an [explanatory]{.mark} theory, [but]{.mark} as a
theory [that]{.mark} affirms]{.underline}** the time of international
life, defined by **[the uncertainty of the future]{.underline}** and the
logic of the erasable mortal trace.17 **[It is this notion of the future
that [makes it possible for states]{.mark}, as finite political
subjects, not only to survive, but also [to]{.mark} try to take moral
responsibility and [make ethical decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Why
universal ethical ideals are both impossible and undesirable What are
the implications of my reading of Waltzian **[neorealism]{.underline}**
as an ethics? First of all, it **[contributes to a new understanding of
the difficulties inherent in any attempt to theorize what it might mean
to replace the structure of anarchy with an international or world
political order that is supposedly 'more' ethical]{.underline}**. If
ethics is inextricably interlinked with the structural conditions of
survival, then **[[any attempt to challenge]{.mark} neo[realism]{.mark}
from an 'ethical' perspective [must]{.mark} do so [by replacing
one]{.mark} structure of [survival with another]{.mark}, and there can
be [no guarantees]{.mark} that [the new structure will be less
violent]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} While this does not in any way
prevent such attempts from being made, it does highlight the risky
nature of trying to resolve problems of war and violence in
international politics on ethical terms. For example, **[the idea of
creating [a new]{.mark} form of political [community that
transcends]{.mark} the exclusionary borders of states may seem naturally
desirable]{.underline}** (e.g. Linklater, 1982). **[Yet, regardless of
how sophisticated theories become in terms of articulating the content
and meaning of such a community, there can be no guarantees that
[attempts]{.mark} to actualize it [will]{.mark} not [result in]{.mark}
even [more violence]{.mark}. There are no guarantees]{.underline}**, as
John Mearsheimer (1994: 44) puts it, **[that 'a [fascist discourse far
more violent]{.mark} than realism [will]{.mark} not [emerge]{.mark} as
the new hegemonic discourse'.]{.underline}** Moreover, it is important
to point out that the value of a neorealist ethics is not that it
provides a 'coherent ethical theory'. One interesting attempt to create
such a theory is found in Frost's (2009) Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom
and International Relations. For Frost, the point of developing a
coherent ethical theory is to demonstrate how international relations
can be grasped primarily in ethical terms, rather than as a struggle for
power and survival. His assumption is that 'to engage in international
relations at all ... is to make ethical claims for oneself and to
recognize the ethical standing of others' (Frost, 2009: 19). Frost links
his theory partly to the diverse practices that shape international
interactions, and partly to an 'ethical background theory which
justifies the whole set of rules which constitute the practice' (Frost,
2009: 27). While the background theory is based on an English
School-inspired notion of the anarchic system/society of states, the
practices added to it have the potential to shape international
relations in a direction that is ethically desirable. Arguing for and
against the ethical standing of our interlocutors, 'we construct and
reconstruct the social practices within which international relations
are conducted' (Frost, 2009: 94). The main goal of these practices,
according to Frost, should be nothing less than resolving the tensions
within the current international system between citizen rights and
global human rights (Frost, 2009: ch. 3). In contrast to cosmopolitan
theories, however, he argues that this goal is attainable within the
anarchic structure of the system, through the ethical adjustment of that
system (Frost, 2009: 113). This adjustment involves renegotiating the
relationship between citizen rights and human rights through practice.
Frost (2009: 173) writes: 'Participants in global civil society and the
society of states need to take their own values seriously and need to
attempt to make them real for everybody everywhere'. **[According to
Frost,]{.underline}** **[the segregating borders of states are thus
meant to persist, while the violent forms of exclusion]{.underline}**
that these borders enable **[are to gradually fall away through the
aspiration of [a common]{.mark} goal [that embraces everybody
everywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}**. From the perspective of my reading of
a neorealist ethics, however, **[the notion of a common universal goal
underpinning Frost's ethical theory [is]{.mark} not only impossible, but
also [undesirable]{.mark}. This is [not because the ideal]{.mark} itself
[is 'bad']{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather, it is because **[[it
is]{.mark} precisely [the absence of a]{.mark} common [goal beyond
segregating borders that makes ethic]{.mark}al negotiation
[possible]{.mark} in the first place.]{.underline}** **[As soon as such
an ideal has been formulated, and the guidelines for how to attain it
have been articulated, the incalculable future in which the encounter
between self and other is allowed to play out is cancelled
out]{.underline}**. As previously noted, **[while this encounter might
result in more or less violence, it is the uncertainty of the future
that makes the encounter possible in the first place.]{.underline}**
Frost's **[attempt to formulate a universal ethical ideal that embraces
everyone everywhere while, at the same time, retaining
the]{.underline}** segregating borders of the **[international system is
thus problematic]{.underline}**. The primary reason for this, then, is
that in articulating a universal ethical ideal, his theory works to
undermine the conditions of international life. In brief, what Frost
fails to recognize is that **[what makes international ethics possible
is also what makes impossible the aspiration of a universal ethical
ideal that is applicable to everybody everywhere]{.underline}** --- like
that of a perfect alignment of citizen rights and human rights.
**[Rather than seeking to resolve these tensions, the tensions should be
kept alive. Only in this way can we, moreover, maintain a distinctly
international ethics without reverting to a 'global
ethics']{.underline}**. For **[the latter]{.underline}** to make any
sense, it **[has to be based on ideals that transcend]{.underline}** the
**[borders]{.underline}** of states, whether those ideals are linked to
a specific goal or just to a general attitude of openness to political
negotiation and contestation (Hutchings, 2010: 215). **[Irrespective of
what precisely they are supposed to entail, the ideals associated with a
global ethics become problematic as soon as the attempt is made to
transform difference and the plurality of wills into one and the same
will]{.underline}**. It is problematic for the same reason that
philosophical attempts to create a new metaphysics that is supposed to
resolve the violence of metaphysics. **[Such attempts can only have as
their aim the ultimate destruction of the very possibility of
philosophical thought]{.underline}** and writing,
**[which]{.underline}**, per definition, **[are metaphysical and
therefore violent]{.underline}** (see Derrida, 1978). The temporal
horizon of neorealism **[To argue against the desirability of universal
ethical ideals is]{.underline}**, essentially, **[to recognize the
importance of finitude for thinking about international
ethics]{.underline}**. Waltz's neorealist **[conception of international
anarchy and of the desire of states to survive therein offers one way of
affirming this notion of international ethics. This is not to
say]{.underline}**, however, **[that international
anarchy]{.underline}** in Waltz's theory **[should be seen as a perfect
ideal that all politics and ethics must aspire to
maintain]{.underline}**. In order for my deconstructive approach to the
ethics of neorealism to make any sense, **[the international must also
be seen as something finite and deconstructible, rather than as an end
in itself]{.underline}**. To think of the finitude of the international,
**[we do not have to look for something that 'transcends' or comes
'after' the international, like a world government or cosmopolitan
community]{.underline}**.18 **[[We]{.mark} only [have to]{.mark} focus
on the principles that]{.underline}**, according to Waltz, **[are meant
to [keep]{.mark} the international order [alive]{.mark}: the structure
of [anarchy]{.mark} and states' desire to survive]{.underline}**. While
these are mutually dependent, **[they]{.underline}** also **[point to a
situation in which the struggle to stay alive might threaten the system
in which this struggle takes place]{.underline}**. To illustrate this
point, **[consider]{.underline}** the issue of **[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**, which Waltz controversially saw as a possible
method of creating a more peaceful international order (see Waltz,
1990b). For Waltz, **[[only if]{.mark} nuclear [catastrophe
remains]{.mark} a [real]{.mark} possibility [will states need to]{.mark}
actively [deter the]{.mark} nuclear [threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**.19
Thus, **[nuclear deterrence 'works' only if nuclear war remains a
constant possibility, hence only insofar as the problem of nuclear war
is not permanently resolved]{.underline}** (Waltz, 1990b: 743--744).
**[[What creates]{.mark} the possibility of [nuclear war
constitutes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in this sense, **[[the conditions
of]{.mark} international security and [peace. What makes]{.mark} the
prospect of nuclear war different from other wars is]{.underline}**, of
course, **[the planetary scale on which its effects are likely to be
felt]{.underline}**. As such, **[it poses a threat]{.underline}** not
only to individual states, but also **[to the entire system of
states]{.underline}**. On this point, there is another parallel to be
drawn between Waltz and Derrida, for whom **[[apocalyptic
discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}** on nuclear war are interesting because
they highlight 'the absolute effacement of any possible trace' (Derrida,
1984c: 28). Hence, these discourses **[[raise the stakes]{.mark} of
survival [even further by pointing to the finitude of everything that
lives]{.mark}, as well as to all those attempts at keeping the
apocalypse at bay, deferring it through deterrence]{.underline}** and so
on (Derrida, 1984d: 29). Understood as a global threat to the entire
international order, nuclear war highlights the temporal horizon of the
whole neorealist project as conceived by Waltz. This is the horizon of
the horizon, or the structure of the structure, which gives meaning to
the 'international' as a finite as opposed to infinite category shaping
the behaviour of states. **[Rather than simply reaffirming a static
world-view, which perpetually reproduces itself in a circular
fashion]{.underline}**, Waltz puts forward a notion of **[the
international]{.underline}** that **[is both finite and mortal. The
international continues to live on]{.underline}** in this sense, **[but
only on the condition that it is exposed to the threat of coming to an
end]{.underline}**. Other examples of how the international system may
come to an end relate to the increased impact of global capital and
global warming. While these are often depicted as typical examples of
transnational phenomena, they nevertheless emanate from a system in
which states are free to make sovereign decisions, for example, on how
to deregulate the emissions of pollutants and financial markets.
**[Individual states are]{.underline}** thus **[free to actively
contribute to setting in motion processes that might put an end to the
system that conditions their survival]{.underline}**. In this way,
**[there is a self-destructive potential built into the system, which
threatens to make it collapse from within and on its own
terms]{.underline}** (see also Frost, 2009: 163--168). Crucially, the
self-destructive potential of international politics does not contradict
Waltz's theory. After all, he argues that **[the system shapes, not
determines, state behaviour]{.underline}**. He recognizes that **[as
long as states interact within an anarchic structure, they are
simultaneously free and insecure]{.underline}**. This freedom and
insecurity mean that **[survival in international politics can never
become a predictable science that is able to 'remove the uncertainty of
politics']{.underline}** (Waltz, 1990a: 37). **[Sometimes, the struggle
to survive does more harm than good to the ones seeking to survive.
Sometimes, this struggle may even set in motion processes the effects of
which will be felt on a planetary scale, provoking an irreversible decay
of the entire system of sovereign states.]{.underline}** Conclusion The
ethics of neorealism, as argued in this article, stems from the mutual
interaction of the two core themes of Waltz's theory: **[the structure
of anarchy and states' desire to survive]{.underline}**. Together, they
**[affirm]{.underline}** Derrida's notion of **[the violent opening of
ethics: the opening to a future that makes new life possible while
exposing everything that lives to finitude and the threat of erasure.
Ethics and violence are]{.underline}**, thus, **[inextricably
interlinked, which means that any attempt to immunize the former from
the latter is untenable. Before any moral obligations, and before any
normative commitments, the ethics of neorealism addresses the more
fundamental problem of what it means for states to live and be free in a
system that guarantees nothing]{.underline}**. In this way, Waltzian
**[neorealism articulates the basic conditions of international life,
which all attempts to theorize international ethics]{.underline}**,
either by remaining 'within' the international system or by arguing in
favour of its transcendence, **[must come to terms with]{.underline}**.
One of the main challenges that springs from my reading of the ethics of
neorealism relates to how **[[universal ethical ideals]{.mark} not only
become impossible to achieve in the practical sense, but are also
fundamentally undesirable]{.underline}**. They are undesirable because
**[the desire to fulfil them [undermines the conditions that
make]{.mark} international [life possible]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline}**. On this basis, a whole range of **[attempts to
theorize the meaning and implications of international ethics,
which]{.underline}** in various ways **[hold on to the notion of ethical
ideals beyond the violence of inter-state relations within an anarchic
structure, become untenable]{.underline}**. This even includes classical
realism and the thought of Morgenthau, whose sharp distinction between
ethical desirability and political possibility dissolves in light of the
neorealist ethics presented in this article. According to this notion of
ethics, then, **[the desirable cannot be placed beyond political
possibility since it essentially is political
possibility]{.underline}**: the possibility of whatever happens in the
interaction among states in the structure of anarchy. As was pointed out
in the penultimate section of this article, there is also a temporal
horizon of neorealism. This horizon is best illustrated by the threat of
**[[nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[highlights the possible
end of the entire]{.underline}** international political **[system. The
threat of nuclear war demonstrates why this system, just like the state,
ought to be seen as a finite as opposed to infinite category. Stressing
the finitude of the system [means that there is no metaphysical
truth]{.mark}, moral or otherwise, [to which it]{.mark} either [can or
should conform. It]{.mark} also [means that there is always space, and
time, for]{.mark} an ongoing ethical-political
[negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While the latter might very well
include efforts to produce a 'lesser violence', its main force is that
of a perpetual coming of the future. **[As long as this future is
allowed to play out, there is]{.underline}**, I believe, **[reason to be
optimistic: optimistic not about the possible fulfilment of universal
ethical ideals, but about the future itself, and whatever it holds for
international life]{.underline}**.

### L: Realism Good/True---1AR 

#### Realism [is not]{.underline} interventionism 

John J. **[Mearsheimer]{.underline}**, 20**[18]{.underline}**, Prof of
Poli Sci @ UChi, The Great Delusion LIBERAL DREAMS AND INTERNATIONAL
REALITIES, Yale University Press, e book page 220-221

**[[Most]{.mark} students of international politics [associate realism
with]{.mark} rivalry and [conflict]{.mark}. This, of course, is one
reason realism is so unpopular in liberal societies]{.underline}**.2 It
is also disliked because realists consider war a legitimate tool of
statecraft that can be employed to either maintain the balance of power
or shift it in an advantageous way. Advocates of realpolitik downplay
the prospects for cooperation among states, moreover, because they think
countries have to provide for their own security, given that they
operate in a world with no higher authority to protect them. To maximize
their survival prospects, those states have little choice but to compete
for power, which can be a ruthless and bloody business. Realism does not
inspire a hopeful outlook for the future.

Nevertheless, **[[realists are generally less warlike than
liberals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who have a strong inclination to use
force to promote international peace, even while they dismiss the
argument that war is a legitimate instrument of statecraft. This point
is illustrated by Valerie Morkevičius's observation, in her comparison
of the two bodies of theory, that **[most realists opposed the U.S.
invasion of Iraq in 2003, while America's three most prominent just war
theorists (Jean Elshtain, James Turner Johnson, and Michael Walzer)
"viewed the war more positively." She concludes that "conventional
wisdom holds that realists support the recourse to war more than just
war theorists. I argue that the opposite is true: [just war theory
produces a more bellicose orientation than
realism]{.mark}."]{.underline}**3

**[Many [realists]{.mark} actually [believe that if states acted
according to balance-of-power logic, there would be hardly any
wars]{.mark} between the great powers]{.underline}**. These "defensive
realists" maintain that the structure of **[[the international system
usually punishes aggressors]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and that the push
toward war usually comes from domestic political forces. [Great
powers]{.mark}, in other words, most often [go to war for non-realist
reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This perspective is nicely captured in
the title of Charles Glaser's important article "Realists as
Optimists."4 Other prominent defensive realists include Jack Snyder,
Stephen Van Evera, and even Kenneth Waltz, who is sometimes mistakenly
said to argue that international anarchy causes states to act
aggressively to gain power.5 Two other realists, Sebastian Rosato and
John Schuessler, advocate a realist foreign policy for the United States
that they describe as a "recipe for security without war."6

The historian Marc **[Trachtenberg, who looks at the world from the
perspective of a defensive realist, explicitly argues that following the
dictates of realism leads to a relatively peaceful world]{.underline}**,
while acting according to what he calls "impractical idealism" leads to
endless trouble. His reading of history tells him that "**[serious
trouble developed only when states failed to act in a way that made
sense in power-political terms." [Conflict occurs when states "squander
\[power]{.mark}\] on moralistic, imperialistic, or ideological
enterprises." Realism, he maintains, is "at heart a theory of
peace]{.underline}**, and it is important that it be recognized as
such." In brief, "power is not unstable."7

I do not share this sanguine understanding of realism. The structure of
the international system often forces great powers to engage in intense
security competition and sometimes initiate wars. International politics
is a nasty and brutish business, and not just because misguided liberal
ideas or other malevolent domestic political forces influence states'
foreign policies. Great powers occasionally start wars for sound realist
reasons.

Still, **[[even if states act according to]{.mark} my [harsher version
of realism, they are likely to fight fewer international wars]{.mark}
than if they follow liberal principles. There are three reasons why even
hard-nosed offensive realists like me are less likely to advocate war
than liberals.]{.underline}** First, because **[great powers operating
[under realist dictates]{.mark} are principally concerned with
maximizing their share of global power, [there are]{.mark} only a
[limited]{.mark} number of [regions where they should be willing to
risk]{.mark} a [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Those places include the
great power's own neighborhood and distant areas that are either home to
another great power or the site of a critically important resource. For
the United States, three regions outside the Western Hemisphere are of
vital strategic importance today: Europe and East Asia, because that is
where the other great powers are located; and the Persian Gulf, because
it is the main source of an exceptionally important resource, oil.

This means the United States should not fight wars in Africa, Central
Asia, or areas of the Middle East that lie outside the Persian Gulf.
During the Cold War, for example, realists maintained that American
policymakers should avoid wars in the "Third World" or "Developing
World" because it was populated with minor powers that were of little
strategic significance.8 **[Almost every realist opposed the Vietnam
War, because Vietnam's fate held little strategic consequence for the
global balance of power]{.underline}**.9

Liberals, on the other hand, tend to think of every area of the world as
a potential battlefield, because they are committed to protecting human
rights everywhere and spreading liberal democracy far and wide. They
would naturally prefer to achieve these goals peacefully, but they are
usually willing to countenance using military force if necessary. In
short, while realists place strict limits on where they are willing to
employ force, liberals have no such limits. For them, vital interests
are everywhere.

Second, **[[realists are inclined to be cautious about using
force]{.mark} or even the threat of force because they recognize that
balance-of-power [logic will compel other states to contain
aggressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even if they are liberal democracies.
Of course, balancing does not always work, which is why wars sometimes
occur. Great powers are especially vigilant about their security, and
when they feel threatened, they invariably take measures to protect
themselves. This wariness explains why Russian leaders have stubbornly
opposed NATO enlargement since the mid-1990s and why most American
realists opposed it as well. **[Liberals, however, tend to dismiss
balance-of-power logic as irrelevant in the twenty-first century. This
kind of thinking helps to make liberals less restrained than realists
about using military force]{.underline}**.

Conclusion: Reconnecting IR, Security, and Strategy

By revisiting the conceptions of Carl von Clausewitz and Thomas
Schelling, two central, yet distinctive, strategists, I have showed that
**[[strategic studies]{.mark} helps [transcend]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}**
**[[rationalism/constructivism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
materialism/idealist, **[[problem-solving/critical
theorizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[dichotomies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[and]{.mark} [bridges]{.mark} [gaps]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see also
Vennesson 2017). While reason certainly plays a central role in
strategic studies, **[[the field is not dogmatically rationalist]{.mark}
and combines material and nonmaterial factors]{.underline}**. **[The
quest for [emancipation]{.mark} is not only compatible with,
but]{.underline}** often **[[necessitates]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[the logics of strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[These dimensions
have never been hidden or suppressed (except perhaps in critical
security accounts): they have always been constitutive of strategic
studies]{.underline}**.

Although these dichotomies prove to be misleading, it does not mean that
nothing has been learned by engaging with them. One lesson is that it is
important to distinguish strategic studies from related, but distinct,
bodies of thought. These dichotomies miss the mark in part because
**[[strategic studies is]{.underline}]{.mark}** at times
**[[conflated]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[with]{.mark}
weapon-systems-centered operational research]{.underline}**, system
analysis, **[or even]{.underline}** Kenneth Waltz's
**[[neorealism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Such [reductionist
perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[lead to a distorted view of the
field as a whole]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Critical security advocates
are, nevertheless, correct that "hectic empiricism" and the permanent
quest of the new fad has been a cause of strategic studies decline.
Critics are also right to remind students of strategy that references to
strategic thinkers such as Carl von Clausewitz or Thomas Schelling
cannot remain shallow and ritualistic. While they should not become the
exclusive focus of the field, conceptual and epistemological questions
about strategy are important and deserve careful consideration (see for
example Nordin and Öberg 2015).

**[[Breaking out of the conceptual jails]{.mark} in which strategy has
been incarcerated [makes it easier]{.mark} for students of security and
IR [to reappropriate strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, one of the oldest
and central forms of practice and knowledge surrounding international
security. **[It offers]{.underline}** a distinctive conception of the
very nature of world politics and, more specifically, **[a theory of
political action in international relations]{.underline}**. While I can
only sketch a research agenda here, several promising dimensions \[are
noteworthy.\] ~~stand out~~. First, **[[strategic thinking provides a
versatile]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[not military-focused, [view]{.mark}
of security: it has a core---the threat and use of organized force for
political ends---but it can go well beyond]{.underline}**. This is
because **[strategic thinking can be]{.underline}** (and has been)
**[used [to analyze any]{.mark} security [issue]{.mark}]{.underline}**
when actors interacting in a conflicting environment are involved and
use a range of coercive means. Second, **[[strategic studies is
politics]{.mark} and polities-centered, [not
state-centric]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[any kind of political
community]{.underline}**, large or small, **[can develop strategic
actions]{.underline}**. Political communities' political ends provide
guiding parameters that are connected to diverse means in myriad ways.
Third, [**[strategy is global]{.underline}**, **[not
Western-centric]{.underline}**, **[in its roots and
manifestations]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Vennesson 2017). Fourth,
**[strategy is about real reason, how security actors actually think and
feel, not rationalism]{.underline}**. Fifth, it is social-materialist:
it recognizes the reciprocal determination of technology and society.
Finally, **[[strategic thinking can make emancipations possible through
problem-solving]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Showing that **[[strategic studies is not]{.mark} intrinsically
rationalist]{.underline}**, materialist, **[and
[acritical]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[facilitates the intellectual
reacquisition of, and critical reengagement with, strategic
thought]{.underline}**. **[The examination of [strategic thought reveals
a rich repository]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[of insights,
concepts]{.mark}, precedents, [and categories]{.mark} profoundly [well
suited to probe]{.mark} current [situations]{.mark} and needs [in world
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead of dealing with strategic
thinking at arm's length, security and IR specialists can embrace a vast
reservoir of ideas, concepts, and mechanisms available for theory
building. **[Strategic thinking provides an intricate set of
information, knowledge, and concepts, which are partially universal and
transhistorical and partially contextual historically and
culturally]{.underline}**. This information crystalizes in the
discourses of strategic thinkers and in the actions of strategists.
Security and IR **[[scholars]{.mark} [can]{.mark} profitably
[revisit]{.mark} this vast reservoir of [concepts]{.mark} and mechanisms
forged by strategists and strategic theorists and borrow [and]{.mark}
[reformulate them]{.mark} to serve their purpose]{.underline}**.
**[[Examples include polarity]{.mark}, escalation, grammar of war,
[freedom of action]{.mark}, [stability]{.mark}, indirect approach,
threat that leaves something to chance, [and political-strategic
expectation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Moreover, **[by focusing on how states use their material resources,
strategic perspectives offer a promising path to reconceptualizing
power]{.underline}** (Biddle 2004; Seybert and Katzenstein 2018). They
notably suggest that capability is not primarily a matter of material
resources but how potential capacities are actualized in creative ways.
Viewed through these lenses, **[the concept of power itself requires
more disaggregate treatment, as it is inherently multidimensional and
not easily fungible across specific tasks and geopolitical
contexts]{.underline}**. Strategic perspectives also suggest a careful
examination of differences in the ways in which strategic actors
actualize and employ their potential capacities. In addition, the
strategic understanding of world politics emphasizes the logics of the
situation and their interlocking features---including the tactics of the
actors involved---and downplays preconditions, antecedents, or
previously existing causes. It recognizes that **[international
interactions have logics of their own and tend to take off and become
independent from the conditions of their genesis]{.underline}**. It
seeks to explore what these critical events or processes are made of. In
that sense, strategic thinking is indispensable for approaching what
Lucia Seybert and Peter Katzenstein call "protean power"---that is, "the
effect of improvisational and innovative responses to uncertainty that
arise from actors' creativity and agility in response to uncertainty"
(Seybert and Katzenstein 2018, 4).

Finally, **[going beyond conventional dichotomies helps reconnect
practical and social scientific knowledge]{.underline}** (Desch 2019).
**[[Strategic thought]{.mark} is a central form of enriched practical
knowledge about conflict, and international relations]{.underline}**
more broadly, **[which [finds its source over centuries of practical
self-reflection]{.mark} and judgement]{.underline}**. **[[Emptying
strategy out of security theories]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policies
**[that do not involve military force, [such as]{.mark} poverty, famine,
political [oppression]{.mark}, and environmental
degradation]{.underline}**--- to name but a
few---**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** proving
**[[unwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[as well as
unsustainable]{.underline}**. **[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}** security
**[[issues]{.mark} might not directly implicate military power, but
they]{.underline}** often **[[involve]{.mark} a set of]{.underline}**
mental and physical **[[operations to]{.mark} calculate,
[prepare]{.mark}, and conduct finalized collective [action in a
conflictual environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### L: A2 "AI"---2AC

#### AI is a [real threat]{.underline}, but [empirics prove]{.underline} that [norms]{.underline} solve\-\--legal apparatuses are [key]{.underline}

**[Maas 19]{.underline}**, Matthijs\-\--Faculty of Law, Centre for
International Law, Conflict and Crisis, University of Copenhagen,

Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK ("How viable is
international arms control for military artificial intelligence? Three
lessons from nuclear weapons," Contemporary Security Policy, vol 40, no
3, 2019)

More often, **[[norms]{.mark}---implicitly the "nuclear
taboo]{.underline}**" against the (first) use of nuclear weapons
(Carranza, 2018), **[and explicitly the norms encoded by international
legal instruments, including the]{.underline}** Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (**[NPT]{.underline}**) **[and
the]{.underline}** Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty
(**[CTBT)---appear to have served as a factor in [constrain]{.mark}ing
[nuclear proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though such norm
enforcement is not without challenge (Knopf, 2018). Nonetheless, these
global legal instruments can function, in part because they can provide
shared normative frameworks that disseminate and promote
non-proliferation norms, -interests and -identities at the
domestic-political level, tipping the balance of domestic contestation
towards coalitions seeking non-proliferation. While one might expect
such effects of "norms capture" to be stronger in liberal societies than
in non-liberal ones, some scholars have suggested that even in the
latter case, state elites who are not accountable to their own publics
simply come to internalize the normative characterization of a
successful state as one that abides by its treaty commitments (Rublee,
Bertsch, & Wiarda, 2009, p. 222), or at the very least, have incentives
for compliance with international non-proliferation norms, to foster a
reputation for reliability in the eyes of other states (Williamson,
2003, p. 81). Moreover, **[global international
regimes]{.underline}**---defined by Krasner (1982) as "**[sets of
implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision-making
procedures around which actors' expectations converge in a given area of
international relations]{.underline}**" (p. 2)---**[can serve as
Schelling Points around which global society can coordinate multilateral
collective sanctions or rewards]{.underline}** (Müller & Schmidt, 2010).

To what extent have non-proliferation norms driven nuclear restraint? Of
course, it can be hard to disentangle causal connections between
membership in normative (legal) instruments such as the NPT and nuclear
restraint, since such behavior could reflect existing policy preferences
by the states. Some reviews of the nuclear (non-)proliferation records
have suggested that "NPT membership and the NPT regime\'s norms have
modest or marginal impacts on nuclear proliferation" (Jo & Gartzke,
2007, p. 185), though others found that, when accounting for states' ex
ante treaty commitment preferences, state ratification of the NPT treaty
regime was "robustly associated with a lower likelihood of pursuing
nuclear weapons" (Fuhrmann & Lupu, 2016, p. 530).

Intriguingly, while public norms seem to be able to strengthen the hands
of (non-)proliferation coalitions, they do not seem to reliably shift
state policymaking where these coalitions do not already exist in
sufficient strength. For instance, in 1994 Ukraine chose to join the NPT
and renounce its nuclear arsenal in spite of respectable Ukrainian
public support for retaining the weapons (Sagan, 1996, p. 80).
Conversely, in 1999 the U.S. Senate rejected the CTBT in the face of
widespread U.S. public support.

As with all history, it can be hard to distill unambiguous causal
chains; yet surveys of the distinct state rationales for nuclear
proliferation and of --non-proliferation or the abandonment of ongoing
nuclear programs (Garnett, 2012; Sagan, 1996, 2011; Solingen, 1994; van
der Meer, 2011, 2014), suggests that, far from proliferation cascades
fueled by security and strategic concerns, a far wider array of motives
shaped these decision-making processes, with elements of all three
models---security, domestic politics, and norms---playing different
roles amongst different states, and often contributing to a decision to
forego or abandon nuclear proliferation. For instance, Solingen has
charted the role of ascendant liberalizing coalitions, in countries such
as Taiwan, South Korea, and Argentina, in shifting towards nuclear
restraint, because of the favorable impact of this decision on
international trade, aid, technology and investment opportunities, as
well as to reduce perceived wasteful budgets for such military programs
(Solingen, 1994). The broad history of nuclear restraint suggests that,
far from a foregone conclusion, arms races involving strategically
appealing technologies can be slowed, channeled, or stopped. This
suggests that halting, managing or containing military AI arms races is
viable---and hints at a range of considerations for doing so.

In the first place, it suggests that security concerns are conducive but
not decisive to arms races, and that a limited number of "first-mover"
major powers may share an interest in supporting global legal regimes
aimed at the non-proliferation of certain forms of military AI, such as
cyber warfare systems, which might otherwise empower conventionally
weaker (or non-state) rivals. Given that this group of "leading" states
is initially small, bilateral agreements may suffice; however, the
unevenly shared stakes in the technology may render eventual
multilateral negotiations more difficult (cf. Picker, 2001).

In the second place, **[the [domestic-politics]{.mark} model [suggests
that strengthening]{.mark} the hand of [domestic coalitions
pursuing]{.mark} the [non-proliferation of AI]{.mark} weapons [is one
path]{.mark}way [towards shifting]{.mark} state decision-making [away
from]{.mark} pursuing more [problematic]{.mark} categories of [military
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even in the face of clear national security
interests. Of course, one caveat here concerns the fact that military AI
may have far broader appeal than nuclear weapons did, such that it is
harder to find domestic coalitions that are clearly opposed to its
development in all cases. For instance, the strategic benefits of
developing nuclear weapons are almost solely military and relatively
discrete---a half-finished nuclear weapon is not even half as useful as
a finished one, and the road from starting a nuclear program towards
developing, not just a working weapon or small arsenal, but a credibly
survivable and deliverable deterrent is long and potentially less useful
(because more provocative to well-armed adversaries) than not initiating
a nuclear breakout to begin with. In contrast, the benefits of pursuing
military AI might be more linear and gradual, with intermediate advances
in subfields (e.g., image recognition or drone swarming command and
control) enabling not just immediate application to battlefield roles,
but also economically productive spin-offs to civilian applications.
These features, combined with the comparatively lower reputational
costs, may make some forms of military AI more palatable. But not all.
Exceptions may be found in high-performance adversarial contexts (such
as cyber warfare or aerial warfare) where AI systems or platforms end up
directly engaging with each other. In such cases, as Payne (2018a) has
argued, "marginal quality might prove totally decisive" because "other
things being equal, we can expect higher-quality AI to comprehensively
defeat inferior rivals" (p. 24). In such domains, the incentives for
parties to independently develop "second-rate" military AI capabilities
might be lower. Conversely, where AI systems do not have to "fight their
like" directly (e.g., logistics; facial recognition), second-best AI
systems still offer military advantage, and could proliferate widely
(Horowitz, 2018a, 2018b). This suggests that **[the precise appeal of
military AI systems to different parties may be more complex---which
offers openings for tailored engagement with domestic
coalitions]{.underline}**.

Thirdly, **[[the "norms"-model suggests that]{.mark}, while
policy-makers may pursue the [development of AI]{.mark} in general
because of its "symbolic" value as a marker of global scientific
leadership, this [may not transfer to]{.mark} the development of AI for
[military purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, **[the degree to
which military AI confers status may be mixed]{.underline}**: Pursuing
openly autonomous "killer robots" may indeed remain unappealing for
states. For instance, over the past years, global surveys of public
opinion show that in most countries (excepting India), majorities oppose
the deployment of autonomous weapons (Open Roboethics Initiative, 2015;
Roff, 2017). An opposition appears to be on the rise: an even more
recent survey by Ipsos showed an increase in global opposition (from 56%
to 61%) since 2017 (IPSOS, 2019). At the same time, other surveys have
shown that public opposition to these weapons can be very
context-dependent, and drops off if their usage is framed as being
defensive and aimed at reducing casualties amongst friendly troops
(Horowitz, 2016; West, 2018). In another U.S. survey, Americans
generally expressed mixed support for the United States investing more
in AI military capabilities, but also for the United States to cooperate
with China to avoid the dangers of an AI arms race (Zhang & Dafoe, 2019,
pp. 26--30).

Moreover, **[[advocacy efforts might]{.mark} well be able to
[shift]{.mark} these [public norms on military AI further---and]{.mark}
thereby [alter the]{.mark} reputational [penalties and rewards of
deploying new systems or for complying with]{.mark} restrictive [global
regulation]{.mark}, respectively]{.underline}**. Indeed, it is important
to recognize the considerable efforts that have been put into making
"killer robots" normatively unpalatable, notably by movements such as
the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of 89 NGOs from 50
countries (cf. Joshi, 2019). In fall 2018, both the European Parliament
as well as United Nations Secretary General António Guterres called for
bans on autonomous weapons (European Parliament, 2018; Guterres, 2018);
and at present at least two dozen states are pursuing such a legally
binding ban---although states such as the United States, United Kingdom,
and Russia still explicitly oppose such an initiative (Joshi, 2019).
Even if such public advocacy efforts have not (yet) produced a ban on
autonomous weapons, this does not mean they have not already influenced
the normative space around military AI.

However, to what extent will a specific opprobrium on the---important,
but narrow---category of autonomous weapons transfer to other types of
military AI? Indeed, beyond "killer robots," it is unclear to what
extent states will face a meaningful or strong "military AI taboo" with
the same strength as the "nuclear taboo." After all, the latter norm was
possible and potent, because nuclear weapons are a "single" technology
with a single discrete, publicly visible and viscerally horrifying use
mode. This created a natural and unambiguous "red line" in usage, not to
be crossed. Conversely, **[[the deployment and use of AI]{.mark} in many
(non-kinetic) military applications [is already a
fact]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such that this Rubicon has been crossed.
Moreover, **[the [tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark} moreover very
[heterogeneous]{.mark}, such that whereas [visceral
applications]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., "killer robots") **[[may
generate public opprobrium]{.mark} and restrictive activism, [more
diffuse or less kinetic ones]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., logistics
systems; capabilities to track missile submarines) **[[may
not]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[It would therefore be advisable that
organizations pursuing bans of the technology, consider the degree to
which framings of "killer robots" continue to correspond to developments
in military AI, including other usages which are potentially unethical,
unsafe, or destabilizing]{.underline}**.

Finally, while public norms or activism against military AI may
strengthen domestic political coalitions already opposed to these
weapons, they alone are not always able to sway policymakers in the
first place. **[[A key route lies]{.mark} therefore [in shaping
policymakers' norms]{.mark} (and indirectly the domestic political
landscapes). [This relies on]{.mark} the [(top-down]{.mark})
norm-shaping [influence]{.mark} exerted b[y global legal instruments and
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but also on the (bottom-up)
institutionalization of norms by "elite entrepreneurship in norm change"
(Lantis, 2018), and specifically through "epistemic communities" of
expert groups.

Throwing the Baby Out with the Bathwater? **[Chan warns that the
discourse on Thucydides's Trap and power transition can create a

encourages 'othering' the opponent and contributes to confrontation.
Should we, then, throw out the proposition that war is more likely when
the system is undergoing a power transition? It might be worthwhile to
go back to what Thucydides's Trap refers to: "the severe structural
stress caused when a rising power threatens to upend a ruling one. In
such conditions, not just extraordinary, unexpected events, but even
ordinary flashpoints of foreign affairs, can trigger large-scale
conflict."\[112\] **[[Instead of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy,

against "facile analogizing" and emphasizes that "the differences matter
at least as much as the similarities."\[114\] **[The purpose of
analogizing Thucydides's Trap is not to shoehorn China and the United
States into the roles of Athens and Sparta]{.underline}** respectively,
as Chan suggests (17-18), **[but to underscore the enduring feature of

dynamics of conflict highlighted by Thucydides remain]{.underline}** as
**[relevant]{.underline}** today as it was two thousand years ago.
**[Many scholars accuse structural theory of determinism]{.underline}**,
as Chan does, (14, 34), **[even though structuralists do not adopt it.

critique of power transition theory than of Thucydides's Trap. Students
of power shifts should take his argument seriously and avoid the
pitfalls he identifies. We should not, however, hastily dismiss the
warnings of Thucydides's Trap.

straightforward reading of China's aspirations based on scouring
statements from leaders and official documents includes revising the
political and security order in Asia to reduce the role of Washington
and its regional alliances, thereby removing the major constraint on
Chinese power. In essence, **[[China seeks]{.mark} a tacit
[dominance]{.mark} in a hierarchical Asia]{.underline}** with Beijing at
the top. When Xi talks about building an "Asia for Asians" and a
"community with a shared future for mankind" that is what he means.

**[[If Xi succeeds, it would mean]{.mark} a region where [power tramples

to Party dictates, [and]{.mark} where [markets are
fixed]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[for favored companies]{.underline}**
instead of being open and competitive. **[[Beijing seeks to make the

of **[its domestic [autocracy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So, a region and

### L: A2 "Deterrence"

#### Deterrence is the [most]{.underline} ethical military posture\-\--it's fundamentally defensive and views the use of force as exclusively a last resort\-\--there's [zero chance]{.underline} of the aff spilling up to affect [overall global peace]{.underline} which makes [some]{.underline} middle-ground military solution imperative 

Eldridge **[Colby 7]{.underline}**, Adjunct Staff Member of the RAND
Corporation, formerly a staff member in the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence and on the Commission on the Intelligence
Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction,
2007, "Restoring Deterrence," Orbis, Vol. 51, No. 3, p. 413-428

One might ask: **[If deterrence is so effective at providing
security]{.underline}**, then **[why has there been a rush to abandon it
in the wake of the Soviet Union\'s collapse and 9/11?]{.underline}**
Shouldn't such a successful policy have earned greater loyalty? **[The
answer]{.underline}** to these questions **[illuminates]{.underline}**
the **[serious divisions among Americans about]{.underline}** what
**[the purpose of]{.underline}** our **[foreign policy]{.underline}**
should be.¶ **[[Deterrence]{.mark} was not a policy that
[won]{.mark}]{.underline}** out in **[[the Cold War because it
was]{.mark} the most loved]{.underline}**. **[It was]{.underline}**,
instead, [**[the best of a menu of bad options]{.underline}**. **[Hard
right anti-Communists]{.underline}** **[thought deterrence
weak]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[a concession of Soviet hegemony in
Eastern Europe]{.underline}** and a failure of Western will. They called
for the rollback of Communist suzerainty, even going so far as to
advocate preventive strikes against the Soviet Union and China before
they were able to field nuclear weapons. **[[The
left]{.underline}]{.mark}**, meanwhile, **[[detested deterrence
as]{.mark} an [immoral]{.mark} use of terror as a threat]{.underline}**,
**[a reliance on weapons whose very existence they
decried]{.underline}**. Believing that no state objective could justify
the use of nuclear weapons, **[the left advocated]{.underline}**
reducing our strategic forces, **[moving towards
abolition]{.underline}**, and a conciliatory policy towards the Soviets.
**[Since neither the right nor the left could win
out]{.underline}**---fortunately---**[deterrence arose as an option few
liked but all responsible parties could endorse]{.underline}**.20¶
**[With the collapse of the Soviet threat, this agreement lost its
raison d'être]{.underline}**. Interventionists left and right broke free
of the restrictive bonds a deterrence and containment strategy had put
in place. **[[For hard-edged advocates for U.S. primacy,
like]{.underline}]{.mark}** Donald **[Rumsfeld or]{.underline}** Dick
[**[Cheney]{.underline}**, **[a deterrence posture would prevent the
U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[from
exercising regional hegemony]{.mark} in the Middle East or East
Asia]{.underline}**. For neoconservative and liberal interventionists
like Paul Wolfowitz, Tony Blair, or Michael Ignatieff, anxious to spread
democracy, halt genocide and other humanitarian crises, and "end tyranny
in our world,"21 deterrence was too hesitant about such interventions.
And **[[for pacifist leftists]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and even a few
old hawks---**[[deterrence was]{.mark} a system of [terror]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**, one that could be discarded at the end of
history. They, therefore, called for abolishing nuclear weapons, the end
of using threats for security, and internationalizing security
responsibility. **[Deterrence was left with few friends]{.underline}**.¶
**[Its erstwhile friends should now consider returning]{.underline}**.
**[[Contrary to the]{.mark} arguments of the pacifist-inclined
[left]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a strategy of **[disarmament and
[conciliation is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[morally
irresponsible]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the face of Al Qaeda and its
like. Despite what the neo-conservatives and the liberal
interventionists had hoped, the high moral rhetoric of liberating Iraq
has yielded to a grimmer sense of the moral duties of considering
consequences, necessity, and proportion. We have relearned the truth of
the critiques of revolutionary France and of Woodrow Wilson---that
**[[even the honest pursuit of high-minded]{.mark} liberal [aspirations
can]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[yield death and
chaos]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[History has its own ways and means and
we should moderate our hope for its coming with a reverential fear of
its wrath]{.underline}**.¶ In between these two extremes,
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a security policy that
**[offers a way forward for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[that [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[not only
more effective because more tailored]{.underline}**, **[but
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[also [more moral]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It
is more moral because **[a deterrent posture would entail a strategy
that is more proportionate, more necessary, more responsive,
and]{.underline}**, ultimately, **[more just]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[[deterrence comports with]{.mark} the]{.underline}** **[fundamental
human [intuition]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[that [it
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** generally **[[only moral to fight when
attacked]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this it complies with the classical
conception of just war, which mandates that wars only be conducted when
one\'s cause is just, waged by a legitimate authority, motivated by a
right intent, fought with a real prospect of success, conducted
proportionately, and undertaken only as a last resort. Deterrence
satisfies these criteria. **[[It is a defensive strategy]{.mark} that
responds to invasions or attacks, and is therefore just]{.underline}**;
**[it sets out]{.underline}** relatively **[clear guidelines for when it
mandates that the government fight, and]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is
governed by legitimate authority]{.underline}**. It is driven by a
desire to protect, deter, and avenge, and is therefore motivated by
right intent; its realistic red lines and threats are backed up by the
awesome power of the United States, and therefore likely to succeed; and
it responds when attacked and asks from the rest of the international
community only respect for its marked out positions rather than
revolutionary transformation, and is therefore proportional.22 Finally,
**[by its nature it is [undertaken as a last resort rather than
preventively]{.mark}]{.underline}**.23 It was the fundamental moral
attractiveness of this position that continually frustrated both Soviet
efforts to decouple Europe from the American nuclear umbrella during the
Cold War and occasional American efforts to roll back the Soviet
empire.¶ But **[[theorizing]{.mark} about war and peace]{.underline}**
**[[cannot remain at]{.mark} the level of
[abstraction]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[It must
bear]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[moral [responsibility
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[actual consequence]{.underline}**]{.mark}
and the power of contingency, as Max Weber pointed out.24 **[And
[deterrence]{.mark}, defense by calculation,]{.underline}** **[[uniquely
satisfies the moral requirement]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that
[leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whatever their benevolent intentions,
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** basically **[[responsible for]{.mark} the
[consequences]{.mark} that contingency produces from their
actions]{.underline}**. **[This it does [by grounding]{.mark} a
nation\'s [security on its own credible
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**[---**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[on]{.underline}** either [**[changing the world through
force]{.underline}**, **[as]{.underline}**
**[neo-cons]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ervatives
[advocate]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[nor]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[by
[hoping]{.mark} that [a more peaceful world will emerge, as the left
proposes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Both of [**[these
extremes]{.underline}** **[ground security on radical
changes]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the way the world
operates]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**, therefore, necessarily
**[enmesh us in the rest of the world\'s affairs]{.underline}**, thereby
**[[exponentially expanding our vulnerability]{.mark} to all the
permutations that chance and contingency may produce]{.underline}**.
**[Deterrence]{.underline}**, rather, **[narrows our profile, and
thereby reduces our exposure to risk]{.underline}**.¶ **[[A deterrent
posture follows]{.underline}]{.mark}** John Quincy Adams' adage
[**[that]{.underline}** **[America should not]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[go [seek]{.mark}ing [monsters to destroy]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
the ancient dictum that a moral act is a proportional one.25 Perhaps the
greatest sin of the recent strategy is its disproportion, its confusion
of the necessary with the desirable. It may be desirable to "end
tyranny" and distribute the blessings of liberty worldwide, but its
desirability must be carefully balanced against the costs of its
enactment. If Iraq teaches us anything, it must be that a moral policy
is not only one guided by the best of intentions, but one that is
realistic.

### L: A2 "Miscalc"

#### Miscalc is a [useful frame]{.underline}\-\--it recognizes the [complexity]{.underline} of the international arena, which [solves the link]{.underline}

**[Nordmann]{.underline}**, Professor of Philosophy and History of
Science and Technoscience at Darmstadt Technical University,
**['18]{.underline}**

(Alfred, "Four Horsemen and a Rotten Apple. On the Technological
Rationality of Nuclear Security," in *Jahrbuch Technikphilosophie:
Arbeit und Spiel*, pg. 279 -- 294)

The apple is rotting. [[During]{.underline}]{.mark} the times of [[the
Cold War]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}]{.mark} [precarious
[equilibrium]{.mark}]{.underline} [of strategic threats had its own
working order]{.underline}. **[It [could be
trusted]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, in fact, **[had to be
trusted]{.underline}** in many ways. [The [weapons were]{.mark}
carefully **[monitored]{.mark}**]{.underline}, subject to permanent
surveillance from many points of view. [They were closely
watched]{.underline} through the eyes of one\'s own strategists,
technicians and engineers, military personnel, local opposition forces,
but also through the eyes of friends and foes, international agencies
and monitoring groups. [Everyone was attending to the
weapons]{.underline} [for different]{.underline}, [perhaps conflicting
reasons]{.underline}, and yet the many observations were maintained in a
relation of mutual support. The weapons themselves became fixated and
paralyzed at their center of attention.

[When the so-called **»four horsemen«**]{.underline} (Henry Kissinger,
George Shultz, William Perry, Sam Nunn) and political leaders like
Barack Obama have [called for a world without nuclear arms]{.underline},
[it is because they are worried about the **break-down of**]{.underline}
this **[working order]{.underline}**.24 [In their view, the
[current]{.mark} modes of [monitoring]{.mark},]{.underline}
proliferation, negotiation, [and sanctioning [represent a deviation
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the Cold War rationality [of deterrence with
its system of **[mutual checks and balances]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [[they call for]{.mark} **adequate ways of [controlling
material flows]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [of regulating
access]{.underline}, of instituting transparency and accountability.
**[[Their question is]{.mark} a [technical]{.mark}
question]{.underline}**: [[Given]{.mark} the half-life of
plutonium]{.underline} [and given the [volatility of]{.mark} systems of
[government]{.mark}]{.underline} in many parts of the world, [[how does
one institute]{.mark} a robust international system of
[arms-control]{.mark}?]{.underline} Thus, [they worry only
secondarily]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} the [weapons might get
into the wrong hands]{.underline}, politically speaking and in the short
term. [They pose **primarily** a question]{.underline} [from within a
technologically advanced]{.underline}, economically and politically
[robust knowledge society]{.underline} --- aside from the United States,
[who can be counted upon to reliably provide the necessary know-how in
the long term?]{.underline} Who can take responsibility for the
management of what was once and is no longer a denumerable, firmly
circumscribed set of nuclear things?

This point can be further developed by briefly considering three other
aspects of the current state of debate: First, as Christopher Daase has
pointed out, the extension into the future of the nuclear privilege of
weapon states in the NPT becomes questionable when this privilege no
longer serves to maintain a taboo in times of strategic conflict but
when it somewhat arrogantly declares whose hands are the good hands such
that they can be entrusted to carry out a managerial process. Inclusion
and exclusion can be justified more easily on the criterion of the
possession of nuclear weapons, it becomes contestable if the criterion
is the cultural competence of handling with due diligence and care a
dangerous and globally endangering commodity.25 Second, this may prove
to be the reason why some of the non-nuclear states like Norway,
Austria, Mexico are seizing the moment to claim that, if anyone, they
are best suited to frame the question or redefine the terms of the
debate. They wish to bring the humanitarian consequences to the fore and
thus the mishandling of the bomb, irrespective of a balance of power or
terror.26 Finally, [[when the question is]{.mark} one of
[maintaining]{.mark} or recreating [a safe working order **for a
dangerous tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline} [and when the arms race
is taking place between knowledge societies and their claims that the
technology is with them in good hands]{.underline}, [[the general
tech]{.mark}nical [capabilities]{.mark} of these societies [become
**increasingly important**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The responsibility of
diplomats and negotiators in the political and military sphere to create
conditions for global security is shifting to the maintenance, broadly
speaking, of a safety culture in civil society.

If this diagnosis is correct, the rules of the game have changed as has
the rationale for inclusion and exclusion in the club of nuclear-weapon
states, and the definition of the community of responsible actors.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} global [[challenge]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} defined [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} as
**[[preserving peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** or security in an age of
ideological conflict and competing national interests.
[I[nstead]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the challenge is one of **[tending to a
working order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} nuclear
[safety]{.mark}]{.underline} and safeguards[. [Issues of
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} and disarmament,
[transparency]{.underline} [[and **control**]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[appear]{.mark} in the collective consciousness]{.underline} [as
[analogous to]{.mark} the global threat of [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Both put]{.underline}]{.mark} [national
and stakeholder [interests **into a managerial
mode**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The Earth and the Bomb need to be
**handled with care**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[grounded in the]{.mark}
perhaps illusory [hope that]{.mark} in good hands]{.underline},
[with]{.mark} a technical mindset, [and [attunement **to**]{.mark} **the
[complexity]{.mark} of affairs**]{.underline}, [[the challenge can be
**met**]{.mark} and the danger **contained**.]{.underline}

Hazardous Waste

At this point [it may appear as if I wanted to recommend or **valorize
an engineering approach**]{.underline} [that **abstains from moral and
political judgement**]{.underline} but brings to the table the requisite
understanding for maintaining, modulating, recreating a working order or
technological system. **[This is not the case.]{.underline}** [I am
arguing merely that [one need to **take seriously**]{.mark} the
**different [modes of conceiving]{.mark} the [problems]{.mark}** that
are **in need of solution**]{.underline} --- [not only because the
definition of [a problem **entails a**]{.mark} **conception of its
[solution]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[reasoning processes]{.mark}
adequate to it**]{.underline}. **[If only for heuristic
purposes]{.underline}** [[we should attend to]{.mark} the implications
of [a shift]{.mark} from the logic of warfare and deterrence [to a
**logic of attunement and trust**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [attunement
to a working order and trust in the good hands of technical
expertise]{.underline}. In conclusion, here are some of these
implications, briefly stated.

First of all, [the [acquisition of]{.mark} working
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and the ability to]{.mark}
**maintain**]{.underline} [and [**modulate** a working
order]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[does nothing to justify technocratic
approaches o]{.mark}r to [en-throne]{.mark} the expertise of [managers
and engineers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As the case of the klu(d)ge served
to remind us, [deviations from strategic rationality]{.underline}
[coincide with deviations from top-down engineering or rational
design]{.underline}. [The situations in which working
knowledge]{.underline} [comes to the fore are **highly
ambivalent**,]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} [it is the challenge of
maintaining a rotten apple]{.underline} [or]{.underline} of
[managing]{.underline} material flows in [an ageing nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. [In these situations]{.underline}, [[rational
decision making is]{.mark} of the kind [where a]{.mark}]{.underline}
security [**[update]{.underline}** [is scheduled to the
o]{.underline}]{.mark}[perating [s]{.mark}ystem]{.underline} of a
computer [[and users wonder]{.mark} a bit nervously whether it is
**really such a good idea** to install the update.]{.underline} Not only
the [[r]{.mark}eaders]{.underline} of Charles Per-row\'s Normal
Accidents [will wonder [whether the]{.mark} security [update]{.mark}s
[might **increase**]{.mark} the **complexity**]{.underline}, perhaps
**[[instability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps
**[insecurity]{.underline}** [of the operating system]{.underline}.27
And of course, with the end of the Cold War, the operating system of
nuclear security has been changed, prompting us to ask anew what are the
conditions for stability and security.

### L: A2 "NATO"

#### Cooperation with NATO is necessary [now]{.underline} to prevent [existential risks]{.underline}\-\--threats are [real]{.underline}, but cooperation can help [mitigate risk]{.underline}

**[Kagan 22]{.underline}**, Robert\-\--Stephen & Barbara Friedman Senior
Fellow with the Project on International Order and Strategy in the
Foreign Policy program at Brookings Institute ("The Price of Hegemony:
Can America Learn to Use Its Power?" Foreign Affairs, vol 101, no 3,
2022,
https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/fora101&div=54&id=&page=)

Thankfully, that was not to be. But now that Putin has made his
mistakes, **[[the question is whether the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[will continue to make its own mistakes or]{.mark} whether Americans
will [learn]{.mark}, once again, [that it is better to contain
aggressive autocracies early]{.mark}]{.underline}**, before they have
built up a head of steam and the price of stopping them rises. The
challenge posed by Russia is neither unusual nor irrational. The rise
and fall of nations is the warp and woof of international relations.
National trajectories are changed by wars and the resulting
establishment of new power structures, by shifts in the global economy
that enrich some and impoverish others, and by beliefs and ideologies
that lead people to prefer one power over another. If there is any blame
to be cast on the United States for what is happening in Ukraine, it is
not that Washington deliberately extended its influence in eastern
Europe. It is that Washington failed to see that its influence had
already increased and to anticipate that actors dissatisfied with the
liberal order would look to overturn it.

F**[or the 70-plus years since World War II, the United States has
actively worked to keep revisionists at bay]{.underline}**. But many
Americans hoped that with the end of the Cold War, this task would be
finished and that their country could become a \"normal\" nation with
normal \-- which was to say, limited \-- global interests. But **[[the
global heg- emon cannot tiptoe off the stage]{.mark}, as much as it
might wish to. [It especially cannot retreat when there are still major
powers that]{.mark}, because of their history and sense of self, [cannot
give up old geopolitical ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}** \-- unless
Americans are prepared to live in a world shaped and defined by those
ambitions, as it was in the 1930s.

**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would be better]{.mark} served
[if it recognized]{.mark} both [its position]{.mark} in the world [and
its true interest in preserving the liberal world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the case of Russia, this would have
meant doing everything possible to integrate it into the liberal order
politically and economically while deterring it from attempting to
re-create its regional dominance by military means. **[The [commitment
to]{.mark} defend [nato]{.mark} allies [was never meant to preclude
helping others under attack]{.mark} in Europe, as the United States and
its allies did in the case of the Balkans]{.underline}** in the 1990s,
and the United States and its allies could have resisted military
efforts to control or seize land from Georgia and Ukraine. Imagine if
the United States and the democratic world had responded in 2008 or 2014
as they have responded to Russia\'s latest use of force, when Putin\'s
military was even weaker than it has proved to be now, even as they kept
extending an outstretched hand in case Moscow wanted to grasp it.
**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [ought to be]{.mark} following
the same policy toward China: make [clear]{.mark} that it is prepared to
live with a China that seeks to fulfill its ambitions economically,
politically, and culturally but [that it will respond]{.mark}
effectively [to any Chinese military action against its
neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[It is true that acting firmly in 2008 or 2014 would have meant
risking conflict. But [Washington is risking conflict
now]{.mark}]{.underline}**; Russia\'s ambitions have created an
inherently dangerous situation. It is better for the United States to
risk confrontation with belligerent powers when they are in the early
stages of ambition and expansion, not after they have already
consolidated substantial gains. Russia may possess a fearful nuclear
arsenal, but the risk of Moscow using it is not higher now than it would
have been in 2008 or 2014, if the West had intervened then. And it has
always been extraordinarily small: Putin was never going to obtain his
objectives by destroying himself and his country, along with much of the
rest of the world. If the United States and its allies \-- with their
combined economic, political, and military power \-- had collectively
resisted Russian expansionism from the beginning, Putin would have found
himself constantly unable to invade neighboring countries.

Unfortunately, **[it is very difficult for democracies to take action to
prevent a future crisis]{.underline}**. The risks of acting now are
always clear and often exaggerated, whereas distant threats are just
that: distant and so hard to calculate. **[[It always seems better to
hope for the best rather]{.mark} than try to [forestall the worst.
This]{.mark} common conundrum [becomes]{.mark} even more [debilitating
when Americans]{.mark} and their leaders [remain]{.mark} blissfully
[unconscious of the fact that they are part of a never-ending power
struggle]{.mark}, whether they wish to be or not]{.underline}**.

But **[[Americans should not lament the role]{.mark} they play in the
world. [The reason the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has often [found
itself entangled in Europe]{.mark}, after all, [is because what it
offers is genuinely attractive]{.mark} to much of the world \-- [and
certainly better]{.mark} when [compared with any]{.mark} realistic
[alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If Americans learn anything from
Russia\'s brutalization of Ukraine, it should be that there really are
worse things than U.S. hegemony.®

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? **[Taken literally, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}**. **[This suggests a rather low
threshold]{.underline}** for what counts as a global catastrophe. An
event causing just one death on each continent (say, from a jet-setting
assassin) could rate as a global catastrophe, because surely these
deaths would be catastrophic for the deceased and their loved ones.
**[However, in common usage, a global catastrophe would be catastrophic
for a significant portion of the globe]{.underline}**. Minimum
thresholds have variously been set around ten thousand to ten million
deaths or \$10 billion to \$10 trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković
2008), or death of one quarter of the human population (Atkinson 1999;
Hempsell 2004). **[Others have emphasized catastrophes that cause
long-term declines in the trajectory of human
civilization]{.underline}** (Beckstead 2013), **[that human civilization
does not recover from]{.underline}** (Maher and Baum 2013), **[that
drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline}** (**[Bostrom]{.underline}** 2002, **[using
the term "existential risk"), or that result in human
extinction]{.underline}** (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). **[A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that [some]{.mark}
[catastrophes]{.mark} [are vastly more important than
others]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to
recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983).
**[Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several
hundred million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but
humanity would presumably carry on. However, with nuclear
winter]{.underline}**, per Sagan, **[[humanity]{.mark} [could go
extinct]{.mark}. The loss would be not just an additional four billion
or so deaths, but the [loss of all future
generations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, **[the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
more]{.underline}**. **[Sagan estimated [500 trillion lives]{.mark},
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
[may]{.mark} even [be an underestimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
analysis here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the
human species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. **[An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an infinite length of time or instead
merely an astronomically large but finite length of time]{.underline}**
(see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, **[the stakes with
global catastrophes could be much larger than the loss of 500 trillion
lives. Debates about the infinite vs. the merely astronomical are of
theoretical interest]{.underline}** (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007),
**[but they have limited practical significance. This can be seen when
evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, [society should try 500 trillion times harder to
prevent]{.mark} a [global catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it should
[to save a person's life]{.mark}. Or, preventing one million deaths is
equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability of global
catastrophe. This suggests society should make extremely large
investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives.]{.underline}** Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
**[society should be willing to spend]{.underline}** at least that much
to prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to
spend at least **[\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the
probability of global catastrophe]{.underline}**. Thus **[while
reasonable disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much
to count future generations, even low-end positions suggest vast
resource allocations should be redirected to reducing GCR. This
conclusion is only strengthened when considering the astronomical size
of the stakes]{.underline}**, but the same point holds either way. The
bottom line is that, **[as long as something along the lines of the
standard riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used,
then even tiny GCR reductions merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause permanent
harm to global human civilization. The discussion thus far has assumed
that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is not
universally held]{.underline}**. **[People often value some people more
than others]{.underline}**, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. **[Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline}** who are distant in space, time, or social
relation, as well as the unborn members of future generations. **[This
debate is crucial]{.underline}** for all valuations of risk, including
GCR. Indeed, if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then
global catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably
have better things to do with our time than worry about them. **[[While
everyone has the right to their own views]{.mark} and
feelings]{.underline}**, we find that **[[the strongest arguments are
for the widely held position that all human lives should be valued
equally]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This position is succinctly stated in
the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848
Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident:
that all men and 3 women are created equal". **[Philosophers speak of an
agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere"]{.underline}** (Nagel 1986)
**[or a "veil of ignorance"]{.underline}** (Rawls 1971) **[in which each
person considers what is best for society irrespective of which member
of society they happen to be]{.underline}**. **[Such a perspective
suggests [valuing everyone equally]{.mark}, regardless of who they are
or where or when they live. This in turn [suggests a very high value for
reducing GCR]{.mark}, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}**

### M: A2 "Root Cause"---1AR

#### Root cause explanations [fail]{.underline}\-\--causes violence by [locking in]{.underline} a [static]{.underline} approach to politics

**[Bleiker 14]{.underline}** -- (6/17, Roland, Professor of
International Relations at the University of Queensland, "International
Theory Between Reification and Self-Reflective Critique," International
Studies Review, Volume 16, Issue 2, pages 325--327)

This book is part of an increasing trend of scholarly works that have
embraced poststructural critique but want to ground it in more positive
political foundations, while retaining a reluctance to return to the
positivist tendencies that implicitly underpin much of constructivist
research. The path that Daniel Levine has carved out is innovative,
sophisticated, and convincing. A superb scholarly achievement.

For Levine, **[the key challenge in]{.underline}** international
relations (**[IR]{.underline}**) scholarship **[is]{.underline}** what
he calls **["unchecked reification"]{.underline}**: **[the widespread
and dangerous process of forgetting "the distinction between theoretical
concepts and the real-world things they mean to describe]{.underline}**
or to which they refer" (p. 15). **[The [dangers are
real]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Levine stresses, **[[because IR deals with
some of the most difficult issues]{.mark}, from genocides to
war]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[Upholding one subjective position
without]{.mark} critical [scrutiny can]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus
**[[have far-reaching consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Following
Theodor Adorno---who is the key theoretical influence on this
book---Levine takes a post-positive position and assumes that the world
cannot be known outside of our human perceptions and the values that are
inevitably intertwined with them. His ultimate goal is to overcome
reification, or, to be more precise, to recognize it as an inevitable
aspect of thought so that its dangerous consequences can be mitigated.

**[Levine]{.underline}** proceeds in three stages: First he reviews
several decades of IR theories to resurrect critical moments when
scholars displayed an acute awareness of the dangers of reification. He
refreshingly breaks down distinctions between conventional and
progressive scholarship, for he **[detects self-reflective and critical
moments in]{.underline}** scholars that are usually associated with
**[straightforward positivist positions]{.underline}** (such as E.H.
Carr, Hans Morgenthau, or Graham Allison). But Levine also shows how
these moments of self-reflexivity never lasted long and were driven out
by the compulsion to offer systematic and scientific knowledge.

The second stage of Levine\'s inquiry **[outlines why]{.underline}** IR
scholars regularly closed down critique. Here, he points to a range of
factors and phenomena, from peer review processes to the speed at which
academics are meant to publish. And here too, he eschews conventional
wisdom, showing that work conducted in the wake of the third debate,
**[while explicitly post-positivist]{.underline}** and critiquing the
reifying tendencies of existing **[IR]{.underline}** **[scholarship,
often lacked critical self-awareness]{.underline}**. As a result, Levine
believes that many of the **[respective authors failed to appreciate
sufficiently that]{.underline}** "**[[reification is a consequence of
all thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**---including itself" (p. 68).

The third objective of Levine\'s book is also the most interesting one.
Here, he outlines the path toward what he calls "**[sustainable
critique]{.underline}**": a form of self-reflection that can counter the
dangers of reification. Critique, for him, is **[not just something that
is directed outwards, against particular theories or
theorists]{.underline}**. **[It is also inward-oriented, ongoing, and
sensitive to the "limitations of thought itself"]{.underline}** (p. 12).

The challenges that such a sustainable critique faces are formidable.
Two stand out: First, if the natural tendency to forget the origins and
values of our concepts are as strong as Levine and other Adorno-inspired
theorists believe they are, then how can we actually recognize our own
reifying tendencies? Are we not all inevitably and subconsciously caught
in a web of meanings from which we cannot escape? Second, if one
constantly questions one\'s own perspective, does one not fall into a
relativism that loses the ability to establish the kind of stable
foundations that are necessary for political action? Adorno has, of
course, been critiqued as relentlessly negative, even by his
second-generation Frankfurt School successors (from Jürgen Habermas to
his IR interpreters, such as Andrew Linklater and Ken Booth).

The response that Levine has to these two sets of legitimate criticisms
are, in my view, both convincing and useful at a practical level. **[He
starts off with depicting reification not as a flaw that is meant to be
expunged, but as an a priori condition for scholarship]{.underline}**.
The challenge then is not to let it go unchecked.

**[[Methodological pluralism lies at the heart of]{.mark} Levine\'s
[sustainable critique]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He borrows from what
Adorno calls a "constellation": an attempt to juxtapose, rather than
integrate, different perspectives. It is in this spirit that Levine
advocates **[[multiple methods to understand the same event or
phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[He writes of the need to validate
"multiple and mutually incompatible ways of seeing"]{.underline}** (p.
63, see also pp. 101--102). In this model, **[[a scholar
oscillates]{.mark} back and forth [between different methods and
paradigms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[trying to understand]{.mark} the
event in question from [multiple perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[No single method can]{.mark} ever [adequately represent the
event]{.mark} or should gain the upper hand]{.underline}**. **[But [each
should]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in a way, **[[recognize and capture
details]{.mark} or perspectives that the [others
cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p. 102). **[In practical terms, [this
means combining]{.mark} a range of [methods]{.mark} even
when]{.underline}**---**[or, rather, [precisely
when]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[they are deemed
incompatible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[They can range from
poststructual deconstruction to the tools pioneered and championed
by]{.underline}** **[positivist social sciences]{.underline}**.

**[[The benefit of]{.mark} such]{.underline}** a **[[methodological
polyphony]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[is not just the opportunity to
bring out nuances and new perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Once
the false hope of a smooth synthesis has been abandoned, the very
incompatibility of the respective perspectives can then be used to
identify the reifying tendencies in each of them]{.underline}**. For
Levine, this is how **[[reification may be "checked at the
source"]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and]{.underline}** this is how **[a
"critically reflexive moment might thus be rendered
sustainable"]{.underline}** (p. 103). It is in this sense that
**[Levine\'s approach is not really post-foundational
but]{.underline}**, rather, **[an attempt to "balance foundationalisms
against one another"]{.underline}** (p. 14). There are strong parallels
here with arguments advanced by assemblage thinking and complexity
theory---links that could have been explored in more detail.

# Alt

### Alt: Alt Fails---2AC (Realism)

#### The alt can't overcome realist preferences -- if it does, that's [worse]{.underline}.

**[Colatrella, 20]{.underline}**---associate adjunct professor of
government and sociology at the University of Maryland University
College (Steven, "Solidarity or Human Rights? National Sovereignty and
Citizenship in the Twenty-First Century," *Bringing the Nation Back In:
Cosmopolitanism, Nationalism, and the Struggle to Define a New
Politics*, Chapter 2, pg 34-38, dml)

**[When one is seen by others to be only a human being,
without]{.underline}** any of the **[social, political or cultural
characteristics]{.underline}** that make one fully human, **[the result
may be compassion and charity but it may also be just as
likely]{.underline}** be seen as **[an invitation to further
abuse]{.underline}**. "**[Bare life]{.underline}**," as Arendt and
Agamben term it, **[cannot be the basis for human
dignity]{.underline}**.

For **[human [rights still require states]{.mark} to enforce them, just
not the same state that is repressing or violating them]{.underline}**.
But **[the [enforcement]{.mark} of rights [by]{.mark}]{.underline}**
external states or by **["[the international community" means
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Immanuel Kant warned that **[peace could not
come from forcing a single state that refused to accept even a positive
value or policy of [the world]{.mark} community to get in line, since
that is not peace but war]{.underline}** (Kant). Machiavelli warned that
**[republics [need a plurality]{.mark} of republics, able [to
criticize]{.mark} each other, [encourage]{.mark} each other to [best
practices, engage in competition. When all]{.mark} republics [fall under
a single]{.mark} central [power]{.mark}---even a collective one---[we
find an empire]{.mark}, not a republic. A condition in which the world
community was unanimous and forced a recalcitrant state into accepting
policies it and its citizens had not approved would be analogous to
empire]{.underline}**, to **[[that]{.mark} world polity]{.underline}**
that Arendt likewise warned **[[would not result in]{.mark} a
[stronger]{.mark} enforcement of [rights, but in the greatest threat to
them]{.mark}, and one [without external recourse]{.mark} for
redress]{.underline}** (Arendt 298).

Nor are these abstract problems. Mark Mazower has painstakingly shown
that the entire conception of international law has always been based on
the "standard of civilization" in which certain states were within such
a standard, and so legitimized to enforce their conception of
international law, while other peoples and states and communities were
outside of it, and so vulnerable to having the will of others imposed
upon them (Mazower 70). In short, **[colonialism, neocolonialism,
and]{.underline}** the current regime of **[human rights are closely
linked, and it is no accident that [the]{.mark} countries that find
themselves [targets of]{.mark} humanitarian [interventions under the
"responsibility to protect" are]{.mark} ones that are [not
within]{.mark} the current updated version of [the standard of
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**---that is to say, not allies of the
United States and often opposed to neoliberalism. Thus, even **[in
[shifting]{.mark} from the]{.underline}** older
**[[national]{.underline}]{.mark}** government's
**[responsibility]{.underline}** to its own citizens
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** a conception that **[the
[international]{.mark}]{.underline}** community has a
**[[responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** to protect human rights, we
find that **[we have [merely changed which fox is guarding the
chickens]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Human Rights and Global Citizenship

As a legalistic concept, human rights require a political authority to
define what they are legally. One of the most widely cited works on
human rights, Jack Donnelly's Universal Human Rights in Theory and
Practice fails from the start on this point with its key analogy: human
rights, like property rights, are a preexisting condition. This notion
has already been dismantled by Arendt as shown above. By contrast,
international relations theorists recognize that **[human rights must be
granted and recognized by global institutions, but the lack of a central
international authority makes this very difficult]{.underline}**. **[The
realist school]{.underline}** of international relations (Morgenthau;
Waltz) **[sees anarchy reigning in a state of nature in world politics,
making the protection of human rights well nigh
impossible]{.underline}**. The so-called English School of International
Relations sees an international society as precarious, in which
**[norms, though real, are enforced by national states that see
adherence to such norms as]{.underline}** advantageous for maintaining
the international society and **[in the interest of the individual
states in question]{.underline}** (Bull). These theories are united in
that they see international organizations as instruments for carrying
out what has already been agreed to by national states. Neither position
posits a global polity as existing, and many theorists in each camp
would see such a polity as undesirable.

Others are less pessimistic. **[[Constructivists]{.mark} view human
rights as a discourse that has achieved]{.underline}** a certain degree
of **[autonomy from institutional settings]{.underline}**, though the
geopolitical limits on the discourse remain (Risse; Ropp and Sikkinke
16). Some political theorists seek to found human rights solely on the
narrow basis of historical liberal theory, with all the baggage that
this involves---from class privilege and economic doctrine to the
policies of existing international organizations such as the IMF and
WTO, and with the historical affiliation with Anglo-American hegemonies
intact (Charvet and Nay). Samuel Moyn's demonstration of the Christian
roots of human rights merely shifts the instrument of human rights
formation from political constitutionalism to Christian ethos. In both
cases, however, **[the Western origin of the rights concept belies its
alleged universality]{.underline}**. Donnelly's influential work engages
in intellectual gymnastics to find a plausible basis for universal human
rights. But **[even this work [admits that]{.mark} despite all, [people
must live in determined polities]{.mark} or they would find themselves
in a Hobbesian state of nature, [and]{.mark} that in the end [states
have]{.mark} human rights [responsibilities only to their own]{.mark}
citizens and territorial residents]{.underline}** (Donnelly 30--32).

**[Clearly, only global citizenship could address all of these
difficulties]{.underline}**, and there has been considerable work done
on developing that idea. Robert Paehlke seeks the basis for global
citizenship in the movements to limit corporate depravity and U.S.
militarism worldwide, hoping ironically that the opposition to the
current global governance regime will provide that same regime with a
stronger basis for legitimacy (Paehlk 15, 200--02). Andrew Moravcsik
instead argues that democratic republican governments have often
accepted the limitations on sovereignty imposed by international human
rights regimes when the gains in reducing domestic political
uncertainty---the risk of having a domestic opposition reverse preferred
policies---outweigh that compromise (Moravcsik 217--52). **[Efforts at
conceptualizing a "[global democracy" are]{.mark} perpetually
[challenged by the lack of any global]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or even
international, or even European **[[demos]{.mark} or
people]{.underline}** (Held 220). Aristotle's criteria continue to
matter in the twenty-first century. **[It seems difficult to avoid the
conclusion that [even under the most global]{.mark} of human rights
[regimes, rights remain]{.mark} inextricably [tied to]{.mark} domestic
politics and [national governments]{.mark}. If there is a role for civil
society and popular social [movements]{.mark}, their [impact must
be]{.mark} primarily [at the national level]{.mark}, and be
[differentiated]{.mark} in that impact [in different countries]{.mark}
and political communities. [To be effective beyond national boundaries,
they must act in concrete ways in solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** with
brother and sister movements and struggles or **[[with]{.mark} efforts
to bring about analogous gains to those already won or being fought for
in each [other's national]{.mark} political
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This means that **[the struggles,
acts of solidarity, and discourses of movements from the
pre-globalization era]{.underline}**, especially from the immediately
preceding era of anti-colonial and analogous movements, **[are
surprisingly relevant]{.underline}** to addressing our problems today.

### Alt: Alt Fails---Rejection Bad

#### Wholesale rejection is [bad]{.underline}\-\--it makes ethical politics [impossible]{.underline} and reproduces violence

**[Abraham, 17]{.underline}**---Johns Hopkins University (Kavi Joseph,
"Making Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial
Thought," International Political Sociology (2017) 11, 221--238, dml)

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that **[those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with a number of possible
[responses]{.mark}: one is to [deem realism]{.mark}, in all its complex
and contradictory manifestations, [as]{.mark} a failed, unethical, and
[fundamentally racist/]{.mark}imperial project]{.underline}**. A second
response is to politically align against liberalism, while holding this
partnership at arm's length. **[A third response]{.underline}**, derived
from Ayoob's (2002) subaltern realism, **[is to work on an epistemic
register, selectively taking insights from realist traditions that help
better explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}**. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this **[[failing does not
delegitimize]{.mark} other [realist insights]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
What is important for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to
combine plausible realist insights with other categories that can grasp
the extent of global politics, including the dynamics of the
postcolonial experience, better. The final response is the one I
advance. To adopt a mode of argumentation concerned with **[building a
counter-imperial machine is to neither dismiss constituencies that
become caught up in imperial formations, nor merely to tactically align
with them; rather, establishing resonant connections among postcolonial
and realist lines of thought, [highlighting shared dispositions]{.mark}
to difference, is to [push]{.mark} the latter [toward]{.mark}
repositioning itself on [new ethical lines that limit]{.mark}
contemporary forms of [violence]{.mark}. To recover a minor position in
realism is [not to accept all realist positions]{.mark}, nor is it to
synthesize or convert any theoretical line into a coherent framework. It
is]{.underline}**, however, **[to amplify the shared spirituality that
informs both realist and postcolonial thinking, drawing constituencies
toward prudential rather than imperial defenses of difference. It is to
furnish current research agendas with an anti-imperial focus, to seek
the creative possibilities that may arise when divergent constituencies
meet, interfuse, and shift]{.underline}**. Thus, our response to
Morgenthau, as to other realists, is to cultivate the connections that
do exist, not for epistemic reasons but for a political project that
strengthens counter-imperial movements. Thinking from the Present By way
of conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that motivates
a theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial thinking. If
the ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of liberalism
and its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a return to
classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and above
postcolonial approaches. However, **[the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a counter-imperial machine]{.underline}**, to
cultivate a shared spirituality **[that can gather diverse and divergent
constituencies to confront dangerous practices]{.underline}**. In my
estimation, **[[countering an imperial machine that operates in complex
ways]{.mark} and at complex sites [requires]{.mark} a political strategy
as unwieldy and diffuse, [linking constituencies that we may otherwise
dismiss.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[That]{.mark} a tradition of
[realism]{.mark} regularly [circulates through halls of power]{.mark}
across the globe [should be reason not to reject]{.mark} righteously
[but]{.mark} rather [to leverage its authorized status. We can talk
about imperialism]{.mark}, knowledge production, [and race here, while
they]{.mark} can talk [about anarchy]{.mark}, power, and self-interest
[there---or we]{.mark} can theoretically work on the lines of thought
that reverberate among us]{.underline}**. To reiterate, building a
countermachine is not driven to "pragmatic" reconciliation or consensus
and, thus, remains distinct from the "eclecticism" of other plural
approaches popular in IR today. While the combinatory logic of
paradigmatic synthesis has its place, the connections between realist
and postcolonial thought articulated here are made in a far more
agonistic manner. Rather than produce something like a
"postcolonial-realism," **[this]{.underline}** argument **[involves
[push]{.mark}ing contemporary [realist scholarship toward new research
agendas]{.mark} and new forms of critique]{.underline}** that both
capture a spirit internal to its own traditions while confronting the
realities of contemporary global politics. It engages with minor
positions along the realist canon to orient today's realism away from
the logic of great power politics operating under anarchy toward an
understanding of how the logic of liberal order permits forms of
imperial intervention. Needless to say, **[drawing together realist and
postcolonial thought]{.underline}**, as this essay has done, **[can be
met with analytical skepticism and political hostility. A mode of
argumentation that refuses comparisons of theoretical cores or
non-truncated readings of select theorists strikes a note of analytical
evasion]{.underline}**. To this there is no defense---other than that
already discussed at length. On the other hand, if the expressly
political purpose of this work is accepted, **[the argument anticipates
strong political reservations: why align the project of postcolonial
theory with realism, an unethical tradition of militarism and
realpolitik?]{.underline}** To this I would respond that while a kind of
strategic essentialism has its place, **[[reducing "realists"]{.mark} to
a coherent body of thought not only obscures the complexity of their
thinking]{.underline}** (see never-ending interpretations of Machiavelli
as an example) **[but [reproduces the narrative]{.mark} of
transhistorical unity [that some]{.mark} realists [use to authorize
unethical]{.mark} policy [programs]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline}**. More critically, however, **[in embodying an
unproductive ahistoricism, it poses conventional realist categories of
anarchy, selfinterest, and military power as the political problem to
confront whereas the present historical context demands attunement to
how some of these drives]{.underline}** (militarism, national interest)
**[connect with discrete problems of liberalism and imperial
practices]{.underline}**. In fact, there are good reasons to think that
the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and Morton
2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR theory
is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of a US liberal
world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while realism may
have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must theorize
from the present. In doing so, we may find that **[[countering imperial
formations may benefit from resonances]{.mark}
established]{.underline}** not just **[[among]{.underline}]{.mark}**
postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and other "critical" theorists
but **[contemporary [realists]{.mark} who identify links between
liberalism and imperialism]{.underline}** (Walt 2013). Indeed, **[[if
realism]{.mark} as a policy program defending the national interest [is
entangled with]{.mark} current militaristic and [imperial interventions,
we should push the premise]{.mark} of this statement, [that difference
should be defended, in anti-imperial]{.mark} and prudential
[directions]{.mark}. Doing so may allow new openings to emerge in the
present sense of closure, new strategies to think and defend alternative
politics]{.underline}**. In this way, we may more fully embody
postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow critique or
brash conversion but rather attentive translation.
