U.S. Security Assistance," Center for American Progress,

[U.S. security assistance is broken and in need of an
overhaul]{.underline}. Over the past two decades, the bureaucratic
system developed to deliver billions of dollars of military aid to
partner nations has evolved and expanded not by design but as the result
of a series of ad hoc legislative and policy changes. [Though the U.S.
Department of State was initially in charge]{.underline} of security
assistance policy and accounts, [since 9/11, the]{.underline} U.S.
Department of Defense (**[DOD]{.underline}**) [has established a
separate]{.underline}, well-funded security [assistance bureaucracy at
the Pentagon. This has inhibited effective congressional oversight,
harmed coordination between diplomacy and defense, and contributed to
the growing militarization of U.S. foreign policy. It has created a
**dysfunctional**]{.underline} and bifurcated [security assistance
system]{.underline}. [Under the current security assistance system, the
returns on America's security investments are **limited**,
**inconsistent**, and **not** **strategic**. The consequences of today's
broken system include increased reliance on the military to solve
foreign policy challenges; a perpetuated status quo]{.underline} whereby
nondemocratic partners receive U.S. assistance and where human rights
abuses are ignored; [and an **ineffective and unwieldy**
bureaucracy]{.underline}. This matters because the United States depends
on capable allies and partners as a core component of its national
security strategy, but the current system is not suited to the task. [A
new administration can change this by embracing]{.underline} wholesale
[reform]{.underline} of the security assistance system. To do so,
however, a [Biden]{.underline}-Harris administration [must]{.underline}
move quickly to work with Congress and include such reforms in any
effort to [**rebuild and revive** U.S. diplomacy]{.underline}. [This
will require]{.underline} talking not only about **[security
assistance]{.underline}** **[authorities]{.underline}**, but
fundamentally about **[money and resources]{.underline}** as well. [Any
reform efforts intending to bolster the role of the State Department
must start by examining how funding is]{.underline} oriented and
[balanced between]{.underline} the [departments]{.underline}. This
necessitates close cooperation with the Hill. There must be a dramatic
realignment of U.S. security assistance. This report provides an
overview and a systemic critique of the current bureaucratic structure
of U.S. security assistance and outlines how transferring resources and
responsibilities for security assistance back to the State Department
will better advance U.S. interests and address the current geopolitical
challenges America confronts. It calls for reviving the centrality of
diplomacy by restoring the State Department's role, as originally
intended under U.S. law, as the overseer of all U.S. foreign assistance.
It also offers recommendations for expanding and training the security
assistance workforce, improving interagency coordination, elevating
human rights concerns in security assistance policy, and adapting best
practices from the DOD. Specifically, this report calls for transferring
the following programs and funding from the DOD to the State Department:
The relatively newly created Section 333 train and equip authority,
which replicates the State Department's Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
authority The DOD's security assistance authorities that focus on
long-term security force reform to the State Department, including the
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund, and the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative fund This would result in a roughly \$7 billion transfer,
significantly augmenting the State Department's budget and capacity to
guide security assistance policy. [Putting the State Department back in
charge]{.underline} of security assistance [will]{.underline} be a major
reform and will [require]{.underline} significant operational changes
within the department, as well as [a dramatic expansion of its
administrative capacity]{.underline}. This will take time to implement
and require significant reform within the agency. [The DOD has done an
admirable job]{.underline} in setting up a new institutional structure,
in implementing assistance, and in coordinating with the State
Department. [However, officials across the U.S. foreign policy world
acknowledge that the system is **not working**]{.underline}. Tommy Ross,
a former [DOD]{.underline} official in charge of overseeing the
Pentagon's security assistance, recently argued that U.S. [security
assistance is "**not** fit for purpose" and is "**out of sync** with
U.S. priorities]{.underline} when it comes to where resources are needed
most [and]{.underline} the types of [capabilities required by America's
allied and partners."]{.underline}1 Indeed, throughout much of the last
decade, [it has been DOD officials who publicly argued for increased
funding for the State Department]{.underline}.2 Ultimately, [the
current]{.underline} bifurcated security assistance [system is
suboptimal and results in the bureaucratic diminishment of the State
Department relative to the]{.underline} military considerations of the
[DOD]{.underline}. [Transferring]{.underline} resources and
[responsibility to the **State** Department would centralize
responsibility for foreign aid under diplomatic control]{.underline},
while improving interagency cooperation, as DOD would remain the primary
implementer of U.S. assistance. Some of these ideas will likely be met
with innate skepticism from a generation of security professionals whose
experience in Washington has been characterized by an ever-withering
State Department and an ever-strengthening Pentagon. This report
anticipates and rebuts likely arguments against reform, including the
capacity of the State Department to take on this responsibility, the
benefits of the Pentagon's current management, or the unnecessary
disruption that would result from significant bureaucratic change laid
out in this proposal. [Failing to reform security assistance not only
leaves the United States with a **wasteful and inefficient** status quo,
it also perpetuates the **marginalization of diplomacy** and locks in
the **military's newly found dominance** in driving U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}. [The current security assistance
system]{.underline} evolved to address the threats posed by the
post-9/11 era and [is now outdated and ill-suited for a new geopolitical
environment]{.underline} characterized by competition. [If the next
administration is to revive U.S. diplomacy and rebuild the State
Department, it must empower the agency to oversee]{.underline} and
direct [foreign assistance]{.underline}. The [Biden]{.underline}-Harris
administration [should]{.underline} seize the opportunity to work with a
new Congress to [reform the system]{.underline} from its first days in
office [and **restore an effective tool** in the U.S. foreign policy
arsenal.]{.underline} A new [security assistance]{.underline} system,
[centralized and coordinated within the State Department, would allow
the United States to wield its security assistance **more effectively
and responsibly** in today's competitive geopolitical
environment.]{.underline} Arms transfers, training, and [support
could]{.underline} also [better support U.S. foreign policy
goals]{.underline}, in particular [bolstering democratic partners and
emerging democracies, making them stronger U.S. partners to counter
threats from authoritarian actors]{.underline}. [Empowering the State
Department to]{.underline} oversee and [manage security assistance would
also ensure that aid is used to advance a values-based foreign policy
that **respects and supports human rights**]{.underline}.3 [It would
also give U.S. **diplomats greater clout and leverage** and]{.underline}
potentially [create greater coherence to]{.underline} the provision of
[foreign assistance overall]{.underline}. [The result would be to
strengthen **a key tool in the U.S. foreign policy toolbox** and
increase the **clout and authority of America's diplomats**, which is
badly needed in this new era of geopolitical competition]{.underline}.

### Do the cp -- assistance vs cooperation

#### "Security cooperation" requires the Department of Defense. The counterplan's "security assistance" is administered by the Department of State. 

**Kerr 18**, Visiting Research Fellow at the National Defense University
(NDU) in the Center for Complex Operations (Alexandra, "Defense
Institution Building in the U.S. Context," *Connections*, 17.3)

Finally, [in the U.S. government, "security cooperation" and "security
assistance"]{.underline}---[which]{.underline} [are the chief lines of
effort in the U.S. toolkit to help partners bolster their security and
work with the **U**nited **S**tates to support common security
objectives]{.underline}---[are]{.underline} overlapping but
**[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[interchangeable]{.underline}**.
[**The distinction between "security cooperation" and "security
assistance" activities has to do with the agency administering the
program**: in simplest terms, it is **either** an activity of the
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense (security cooperation) or the
**D**epartment **o**f **S**tate (security assistance)]{.underline}.
[DOD]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the Department of State
([DOS]{.underline}) [have shared responsibility for engaging with
foreign partner militaries]{.underline} since the mid-twentieth century,
[with]{.underline} the bulk of congressional **[security assistance
funding]{.underline}** [allocated to DOS]{.underline}. [Any security
assistance administered by DOD]{.underline}---whether funded under Title
10 (Armed Services) or Title 22 (Foreign Affairs) of the U.S. Code---[is
a "**security cooperation**" activity]{.underline}.\[21\] After the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the legal framework for the
funding and administration of such activities evolved in response to
emerging threats. Congress increasingly granted funding and authorities
directly to DOD under Title 10 for security cooperation.\[22\]
Therefore, while DOS security assistance programs can include DIB
components, the majority of DIB-specific programming is currently funded
under and implemented by the Department of Defense and is thus
considered security cooperation.

#### Security Cooperation is administered by the DoD, Security Assistance is DoS

**McLaren 14**, US Air Force Captain (McKay, "Enhancing the Assessment
of the Costs and Benefits of International Pilot Training (IPT) Within
the U.S. Air Force: Is It Worth It?," RAND Dissertations)

[U.S. Code Title 22 provides congressional authority to conduct DoS
Security Assistance programs]{.underline}. The programs are carried out
through two basic laws, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the
Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA).24 AECA enacted congressional
legislative controls over export of defense articles and services. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs
Committee are responsible for foreign assistance and Security Assistance
program authorization legislation. The Senate and House Armed Services
Committees are responsible for defense programs authorization
legislation. [The term **security cooperation** is used within DoD,
whereas the term **security assistance** is used within the
DoS]{.underline}. It is important to note that these congressional
committees play a role only in FMS authorization. Although Congress
maintains legislative control over exports, FMS is a nonappropriated
program, external to the U.S. budget, and the president is charged with
signing off on spending for the program. Through Executive Order 11958,
as amended, the President delegates selected functions in the AECA to
the secretaries of State and Defense. They are required to provide
reports to Congress and obtain specific congressional approval on
certain exports or transfers. [The DoS has responsibilities relating to
**security assistance**, which include managing the export of defense
articles, services, training, and military technology]{.underline}.25
[DoD has responsibilities relating to **security cooperation**, which
include activities to encourage and enable international partners to
work with the United States to achieve strategic
objectives]{.underline}.26 The military departments and other DoD
agencies involved in managing FMS programs are collectively called
implementing agencies (IAs). The Army, Navy, and Air Force usually have
the responsibility of being the IA in the process of FMS.27 The Air
Force agency for all security cooperation programs is the Office of the
Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs
(SAF/IA). The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition has
oversight in the execution by virtue of having responsibility for Air
Force acquisition. SAF/IA is supported by the Air Force Security
Assistance Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for most FMS
and other logistics functions. The Air Force Security Assistance
Training (AFSAT) squadron at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is in
charge of planning and, with AETC, managing the Air Force international
military training. It is organized under the authority of AETC.

#### The State Department implements [Assistance]{.underline}, the Department of Defense implements [Security Cooperation]{.underline}

**Tankel 20**, associate professor at American University, and an
adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, and
Tommy Ross, non-resident senior associate at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, 2020, ("RETOOLING U.S. SECURITY SECTOR
ASSISTANCE," *War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2020/10/reforming-u-s-security-sector-assistance-for-great-power-competition/>,
(accessed 5-21-2022)

[The United States provides]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**
sector [**assistance** to foreign]{.underline} civilian and [military
forces]{.underline}, agencies, and institutions ranging from local law
enforcement and judicial systems to standing militaries. [This
assistance is intended to]{.underline} strengthen U.S. access to key
territories and facilities, [shape partners' national security
decision-making]{.underline} and governance, [and build their capacity
and capabilities for use against shared threats and
adversaries]{.underline}. [It also promotes]{.underline} the U.S.
defense industry via arms transfers, supports the [infrastructure and
operations of multilateral organizations **such as NATO**, and
**increases military interoperability**. The State Department implements
**assistance** across the entire security sector, **including
organizations responsible for defense**]{.underline}, law enforcement,
and security of key assets like ports and borders. [The **Department of
Defense** has a narrower mandate, and provides assistance to partner
militaries under the **umbrella of security cooperation**]{.underline}.
[The Pentagon]{.underline} also [engages in]{.underline} a range of
other [activities]{.underline} --- combined [exercises]{.underline},
staff [talks]{.underline}, port [visits]{.underline}, and officer
[exchanges]{.underline} --- [that fall under **security
cooperation**]{.underline} as well. **[We]{.underline}** use the term
security sector assistance for simplicity, and
**[distinguish]{.underline}** where these additional **[security
cooperation]{.underline}** activities are relevant. The U.S. government
does not typically define Foreign Military Sales as assistance, but we
believe it should, and that it ought to factor Direct Commercial Sales
into its assistance planning as well. Both types of sales can lead to
sustained U.S. engagement with a partner in the form of training,
maintenance, and sustainment for the purchased items.

#### Any other interpretation is derived from, [and causes]{.underline}, confusion

**Tecott 21**, PhD in Political Science @ MIT (Rachel, "The Cult of the
Persuasive: The U.S. Military's Aversion to Coercion in Security
Assistance," Proquest Dissertations)

[There is confusion in the lexicon around]{.underline} Security Force
Assistance (SFA). SFA, **[security assistance]{.underline}**, [security
cooperation]{.underline} (SC), building partner capacity (BPC), foreign
internal defense (FID), defense institution building (DIB),
[train-and-equip, advise-and-assist, and by-with-andthrough all refer to
efforts by one nation to improve the capacity of another nation's
security sector]{.underline}. [Within the United States government,
these terms are **attached to different legal authorities**, different
funding sources, and different strictures **with respect to the
agencies**]{.underline}--- [civilian or military---responsible for
implementation]{.underline}. [The terms refer to an eclectic set of
activities]{.underline}, ranging from educational programs like the
International Military Education and Training Program (IMET), to
personnel exchanges, to unit-level training, to unit-level advising, to
wholesale efforts to build militaries from scratch. [The byzantine
nature of security assistance and security cooperation terminology,
authorities, agencies, and activities **has caused
confusion**]{.underline} and sparked criticism **[among]{.underline}**
the growing community of policymakers and **[scholars trying to better
track it, understand it, and improve it]{.underline}**.17 This study
uses interchangeably the terms security assistance and Security Force
Assistance (SFA), defined by U.S. Army Field Manual 3-07.1 as "the
unified action to generate, employ, and sustain local, host-nation, or
regional security forces in support of a legitimate authority."18 SFA
technically refers to efforts to build the entire security sector of a
partner--- including their police, National Guard, and gendarme. This
study focuses, however, exclusively on efforts by the United States to
build the partner's military (the largest subset of SFA activities), and
excludes analysis of efforts to build non-military security forces.19
SFA, in turn, is the largest subset of **[SC]{.underline}**, which
[refers to "all Department of Defense interactions with foreign defense
establishments to build defense relationships that promote U.S. security
interests]{.underline}."20

### Do the cp -- prefer our interp

#### Given that basically [any]{.underline} activity is included, the [only functional limit]{.underline} on the topic has to come at the [agent-level]{.underline}

**Mazarr 22**, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation.
Previously he worked at the U.S. National War College, where he was
professor and associate dean of academics; as president of the Henry L.
Stimson Center; senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies; senior defense aide on Capitol Hill; and as a
special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Michael,
"Security Cooperation in a Strategic Competition," RAND,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA650-1.html>)

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [Official U.S. government definitions of security
cooperation are very **broad**.]{.underline} [One
definition]{.underline} from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
[states that security cooperation]{.underline}

> [comprises all activities undertaken by]{.underline} the Department of
> Defense ([DoD) to encourage and enable international partners to work
> with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to achieve strategic
> objectives. [It includes **all** DoD interactions with foreign defense
> and security establishments,]{.underline} including all
> DoD-administered Security Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense
> and security relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests,
> including all international armaments cooperation activities and SA
> activities; develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to host nations.3

[Such definitions clearly include almost **any security-related
activity** for **any purpose**.]{.underline} To scope the focus of the
study, [we reviewed]{.underline} official state documents and strategies
and the literature on security cooperation to identify [11 types of
activities]{.underline}:

1\. [military aid]{.underline}, which includes funding through the
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense Articles
program, and other grants and loans

2\. [arms sales]{.underline} and transfers,4 such as U.S. arms sales
through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales
(DCS) programs

3\. [military capacity-building]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities
under Section 1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and
Sections and 2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the train and equip
authority)

4\. [education and training]{.underline}, including international
military education and training (IMET), professional military education
(PME), and regional centers

5\. [personnel exchanges]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities under the
Military Personnel Exchange Program and the State Partnership Program

6[. military exercises]{.underline}, both bilateral and multilateral and
those that involve foreign partners

7\. [access-related agreements]{.underline}, such as status of forces
agreements (SOFAs) and agreements related to base access and
information-sharing

8\. [armament-related agreements]{.underline}, such as those for
co-development of systems and for research, development, test, and
evaluation activities

9\. [sustainment of donor-nation equipment]{.underline} by the donor,
the partner, or third parties

10\. [institutional capacity--building]{.underline} to strengthen the
partner institutions that support security services

11\. [humanitarian assistance and disaster relief]{.underline} (HA/DR),
which offers support for efforts to relieve suffering.

These categories offered a consistent template for gathering data across
our various study components. [A major challenge was that reliable and
consistent data on each of the 11 categories were not
available]{.underline} for all the competitors---not even for the United
States. Especially at the unclassified level, **[there is simply no
comprehensive roster of security cooperation activities]{.underline}**
by the United States, and neither China nor Russia publishes inclusive
data sets of its programs. An additional challenge was that, in some
cases, the different countries define the categories somewhat
differently, so we could not develop data on entirely comparable sets of
security cooperation activities.

### Do the cp -- cooperation -\> DoD

#### Security Cooperation requires the [DoD]{.underline} to be the source of funding

**Fenell 11**, Captain, US Marine Corps, In Partial Fulfillment of the
Requirements for the Degree MASTER OF ARTS in INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, at
the UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO (Nathan, "Security Cooperation Poorly
Defined" December,
<https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1020&context=thes>)

[Security cooperation is]{.underline} a compilation of [financial,
educational, and material resources, that]{.underline} at their
foundation [are supported by the United States]{.underline}, in
particular the **[Department of Defense]{.underline}**, and are used to
support the peaceful development of democracies in foreign countries.
The [**resources provided by the Department of Defense** are available
to foreign countries after the host nation]{.underline} requests the
peaceful assistance of the U.S. military in response to systemic
deficiencies in the bureaucratic management of a nation state or when a
nation state [recognizes that its military limitations prevent it from
properly defending its geographic borders]{.underline}. The host
nation's request for support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the
foreign country to develop its internal capacity to protect its people
and limit internal or external threats. The security cooperation
exercise Baltic Operation, held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign
country using the resources 9 provided by the United States to improve
its national defense capabilities in direct response to a perceived
threat to its sovereign borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting
to develop its military capabilities and project an image of strength in
an effort to maintain the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the
conclusion of the Singing Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future
Russian incursion across its borders. [In contrast to this appropriate
use and definition of security cooperation]{.underline} as a strategy to
prevent conflict, the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [is using the
term security cooperation]{.underline} as a way [to]{.underline}
[define]{.underline} a national **[exit]{.underline}** strategy from a
two front war, a strategy that at its heart is based on the
reconstruction of a damaged infrastructure. [The false labeling
of]{.underline} reconstruction operations as [security cooperation is
the foci of this thesis project]{.underline}.

#### It\'s strictly limited to DoD actions

**Reynolds 19**, et al, Commandant, Defense Institute of Security
Cooperation Studies (Ronald, "The Management of Security Cooperation,"
<http://cebw.org/images/docs/Legislacao_Webinar/Greenbook_39_0.pdf)>

**[Introduction to Security Cooperation]{.underline}**

Introduction

[The term security cooperation was first introduced in 1997 by the
Defense Reform Initiative]{.underline} (DRI). At that time, the then
named Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day to day
management responsibilities of many security assistance programs
authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export
Control Act (AECA). The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain
Department of Defense (DoD) funded international programs along with
their personnel and associated resources. So that other U.S. government
(USG) agencies, the private sector and foreign governments could better
understand DSAA's enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security
assistance (SA), DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA) effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs. In addition, DSCA leads the broader USG
security cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation
programs continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs) or the
military departments (MILDEPs). What further complicated the management
of security cooperation was that the in-country point of contact between
the USG and the host nation generally is either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA) sponsored defense attaché office (DAO) or the DSCA
sponsored security cooperation office (SCO). These two spigots for
security cooperation with a country required a broad knowledge and skill
baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD and its agencies and
the MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of
in-country security cooperation were generally resolved with the
establishment of the Senior Defense Official-Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT)
having oversight over both the SCO and DAO organizations. It was not
until 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a **formal**]{.underline}, yet
still very broad, **[definition of security cooperation]{.underline}**
in Joint Pub 1-02:

> [All **DoD** interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation.

[DODD 5132.03]{.underline}, DoD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation, 29 December 2016, [further defines security
cooperation with assigned responsibilities]{.underline}:

> [All **DoD** interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and partner nation military and security
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to allied
> and partner nations. This includes DoD administered security
> assistance programs.

#### [Budget classification]{.underline} proves it's military-to-military 

**Van Eerden 20**, Captain (James, "Seeking Alpha in the Security
Cooperation Enterprise A New Approach to Assessments and Evaluations,"
Journal of Advanced Military Studies, 11.1)

[The]{.underline} Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 [President's Budget: Security
Cooperation]{.underline} Consolidated [Budget]{.underline} [Display
outlines seven categories of security cooperation]{.underline} activity,
including [military-to-military engagements]{.underline}, [support to
operations]{.underline}, and [humanitarian and assistance activities,
among others]{.underline}.6 The **[security cooperation]{.underline}**
[framework traditionally includes]{.underline} [security
assistance]{.underline} (SA), [security force assistance]{.underline}
(SFA), [and]{.underline} some aspects of [foreign internal
defense]{.underline} (FID).7 In the context of this article, **[the term
security cooperation refers]{.underline}** primarily **[to
military-to-military engagement]{.underline}**s, [where the U.S.
military engages in training partner forces under the auspices of Title
10 and Title 22 authorities]{.underline}.

### Do both -- links to cp

#### Security Cooperation is [exclusively funded]{.underline} by the Department of Defense, and Security Assistance is [exclusively]{.underline} Department of State funding.

**White 14**, Major, USMC, a Joint Doctrine Development Officer with the
Joint Staff J7 (Taylor, "Security Cooperation How It All Fits" *Joint
Forces Quarterly*,
https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/jfq/jfq-72/jfq-72_106-108_White.pdf?ver=2014-03-13-152407-220)

Department of Defense (DOD) [security cooperation
activities]{.underline} support or are combined with other assistance
programs and often are a part of nation assistance. This
[often]{.underline} occurs in a manner that may [appear
confusing]{.underline} or convoluted to the joint warfighter. This
article portrays how the programs and activities converge. Although the
various [terms]{.underline} and activities in show in the accompanying
figure appear to have simple names and meanings, they in fact [have
**strict definitions** based on funding **and**
authorities]{.underline}. While some of the activities directly support
one another, others have distinct boundaries between their definitions
and functions. The joint community is beginning to address the framework
of security cooperation in a new joint doctrine publication, Joint
Publication (JP) 3-XX, *Security Cooperation*. [It is important to
embark with clear definitions and understanding of the complex
relationship among these terms]{.underline} to facilitate understanding
by the joint force.

[Security cooperation is]{.underline} referred to in both joint
professional military education programs and joint staffs as [a
tool]{.underline} to be [employed by combatant commands.]{.underline}
However, in other settings, it is a set of programs managed by the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Extensive review of joint doctrine
and policy reveals that the definition of *security cooperation* appears
to encompass these areas and more. After expanding our understanding of
security cooperation, other terms such as [*security force assistance,
foreign internal defense,* and **security assistance**]{.underline}
provide additional specificity for the tasks being conducted, yet some
of these actions [fall **outside security cooperation**]{.underline}.
Even though security cooperation spans the range of military operations
and is inclusive of large-scale operations conducted in support of
foreign nations, it is not all-encompassing of security related support
from U.S. agencies other than DOD.

[Nation assistance is support rendered by foreign forces within another
nation's territory]{.underline} based on mutual agreements.1 While this
term is used to describe the comprehensive approach to assisting other
nations, the definition associated with nation assistance has two
limitations: it does not encompass support to regional organizations,
and it is only assistance by foreign forces. [A better, broader term is
*foreign assistance*, which is assistance to foreign nations ranging
from the sale of military equipment to donations of food and medical
supplies]{.underline} to aid survivors of natural and manmade
disasters.2 When examining the current definitions for *foreign
assistance* and *nation assistance*, we find significant overlap:

> *Foreign assistance to foreign nations* \[ranges\] *from the sale of
> military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
> survivors of natural and man-made disasters. U.S. foreign assistance
> takes three forms: development assistance, humanitarian assistance,
> and security assistance.3*

This term is likely to resonate with the State Department, which has an
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance and a designated foreign assistance
budget.

*Nation assistance---assistance rendered to a nation by foreign forces
within that nation's territory based on agreements mutually concluded
between nations.4*

The term nation assistance is not often used in policy or strategy. For
example, the current National Security Strategy mentions foreign
assistance three times but does not use the term nation assistance. The
first opportunity to create some clarity is to replace the term nation
assistance with foreign assistance in the upcoming revisions of JP 3-0,
Joint Operations, and JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense.

If foreign assistance were to replace nation assistance in joint
doctrine, the definition would include that portion of security
cooperation that falls outside the realm of nation assistance in
figure 1. Foreign assistance then encompasses all of security
cooperation and reduces some of the ambiguity. [Security
cooperation]{.underline} then [focuses **strictly on the DOD
contribution** to foreign assistance and encompasses all DOD
interactions with foreign defense establishments to build]{.underline}
both national and regional [defense relationships]{.underline} that
promote specific U.S. security interests, [develop allied and friendly
military capabilities for self-defense]{.underline} [and multinational
operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access to host nations]{.underline}.5

Having addressed the larger constructs, it is possible to review and
clarify the relationships between other programs and activities that
occur within them. First is **[security assistance]{.underline}** with a
specific definition in relation to both DOD and State. It [refers to a
group of programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline}
of 1961, as amended, [and the Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} of
1976, as amended. [These programs are **funded and authorized by
State**]{.underline} to be administered by DOD through the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency.6 This is the process by which the United
States provides defense articles, military training, and other
defense-related services. [That portion of security assistance **outside
of security cooperation**]{.underline} in figure 1 [reflects **State and
other civilian agency** involvement]{.underline}.

## Solvency

### Solvency -- generic

#### Achieving consensus at NATO requires [diplomatic]{.underline}, not military, efforts

**Burns 21**, Professor of Diplomacy and IR at Harvard (Nicholas, "A
Time for Diplomacy," *Belfer Center*,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/time-diplomacy)>

**[Diplomacy]{.underline}** also **[works best]{.underline}** when
far-sighted leaders take charge of a crisis and point the way ahead.
[Think of]{.underline}: FDR and [Churchill's organization of a massive
global coalition]{.underline} to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
Helmut Kohl, Mikhail [Gorbachev]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} George
H.W. [Bush's negotiations to unite Germany in]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} Alliance and to end the Cold War. Nelson
[Mandela]{.underline} who used a four-year diplomatic negotiation to
dismantle and destroy the apartheid regime. Angela [Merkel]{.underline}
who led the world diplomatically in confronting and sanctioning Vladimir
Putin following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Diplomacy
and negotiations, of course, do not always succeed. At its worst, if
diplomacy fails, war, lawlessness, and destruction ensue -- Vietnam,
Rwanda, and Iraq in the past. Syria, Tigray, Myanmar, and China's power
grab in the South China Sea in the present. That is one reason why it is
so important to integrate effectively the work of ambassadors and
Generals combined with the unique power of intelligence officers.
Foreign policy making in the U.S. Government is a team sport. It takes
coordination among all the country's actors to succeed. We diplomats
understand that our ability to succeed is often related directly to the
intelligence on which we depend and the military partners with whom we
share power. It has long been understood that diplomacy and defense are
inextricably tied to each other. [When I was U.S. Ambassador to NATO,
the majority of my staff was from the Pentagon]{.underline} -- both the
uniformed military and Defense Department civilians. [We thought hard
about aligning our diplomatic moves with our military
might]{.underline}. When we responded to the 9/11 attacks, we drew on
the resources of both diplomats and warriors. When NATO went into
Afghanistan, we thought of it as a combined military and diplomatic
mission. What has been missing in the U.S. government in recent years is
a strong, energetic, self-confident diplomatic corps. President
[Biden]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Secretary of State Tony [Blinken
have shown they appreciate the need to elevate diplomacy as a
first-order priority for the United States]{.underline}. From their
first days in office, they have emphasized their determination to
strengthen America's diplomatic power in the world. President Biden
chose the State Department as the site of his first foreign policy
speech. Some of his earliest and most notable appointments immediately
strengthened our diplomatic bench behind Secretary Tony Blinken --
Ambassadors Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Wendy Sherman, Victoria Nuland, and
Samantha Power, as well as an impressive and experienced NSC team led by
Jake Sullivan, Jon Finer, Kurt Campbell, Laura Rosenberger, Sumona Guha,
and many others. For President Biden's new emphasis on diplomacy to
succeed, however, the career Foreign Service, in particular, will need
to be strengthened dramatically. It is no secret that the Foreign and
Civil Service are at their lowest points in morale and effectiveness in
the memory of anyone listening today in this Zoom room. I began my
diplomatic career 41 years ago as an intern at our embassy in
Nouakchott, Mauritania in the Sahara Desert. I have witnessed many highs
and lows of American diplomacy since. Frankly, I have been shocked to
see the damage done to the career Foreign Service during the last four
years. The result is disastrously low morale, a lack of budgetary
support, the debilitating departure of some of our most senior career
diplomats, the sidelining of the Service for a time, and the resulting
lack of confidence in its future by a younger generation of diplomats
who will be most critical to its resurrection. President Biden and
Secretary Blinken have a rare opportunity to lead a radical overhaul at
[the State Department]{.underline}. Under their leadership, this [must
remain a first-order priority for the administration]{.underline}. In
November just following the Presidential election, two former American
Ambassadors, Marc Grossman, Marcie Ries, and I released a Harvard
Kennedy School report entitled, "A U.S. Diplomatic Service for the 21st
Century." Our goal was to recommend the fundamental steps necessary to
reform the Foreign Service and to reposition it for success in the
future. Based on conversations with over 200 people inside the U.S.
government and beyond in over 40 workshops during the past pandemic
year, we reported that the Foreign Service "is confronting one of the
most profound crises in its long and proud history." We recommended a
determined, bipartisan effort to revive and restructure it.
Specifically, we called for a new Foreign Service Act by Congress to set
a renewed mission and mandate for the 21st century diplomatic corps. The
last time Congress passed such an Act was in 1980 when the world was a
very different place with very different challenges. than it is now. We
advocated a "relentless focus on diversity" to counteract the woeful
lack of progress in the percentage of African Americans, women, Latinx
Americans, Asian Americans and other minorities in the senior ranks of
American diplomacy. We called for the creation of a new Diplomatic
Reserve Corps and a Mid-Level entry program to ensure the inclusion in
the diplomatic ranks of experienced citizens with specialized skills.
Given the proliferation of political appointee Ambassadors at the State
Department, we also recommended that, by 2025, 90 percent of Ambassadors
should be career appointees, not 70 percent as is the current practice.
We also recommended that 75 percent of the powerful Assistant Secretary
of State positions be held by career officers. During the Trump
Administration, not a single one of these Assistant Secretary positions
was led by a Senate-confirmed career officer. This was the first time in
memory that the Foreign Service had been entirely unrepresented at that
critical leadership level. Finally, we proposed to rename the "Foreign
Service of the United States" the "United States Diplomatic Service." We
believe it signals transformation and reinforces the vital role our
diplomats perform in service to our nation. This new title would begin
with the two words, of course, that are most important -- United States.
A reinforced career diplomatic corps would help President Biden and his
successors from either party to revive American leadership in the world.
President Biden's great insight has been to see our alliances as the
critical asset we have in this long-term battle for global power and the
future of democracy. [The NATO Alliance is fundamental to a long-term
peace in Europe. It has expanded a zone of security]{.underline} to
encompass the great majority of Europeans, East and West. It protects
all of us, particularly smaller countries, from the Russian Bear. [It
will be **largely a diplomatic task** to return the U.S. to **leadership
of the Alliance** and to maintain allied unity in containing Russia
power in the next few days, weeks, months, and years]{.underline}.

### Solvency -- AI

#### State Department should be the central hub for [all]{.underline} AI foreign policy

**Dukeman 20**, senior fellow at FP21 and a Ph.D. student at Princeton
University, where he researches institutional reform in U.S. foreign
policy agencies. He previously helped found the U.S. State Department's
Center for Analytics (Ryan, "WINNING THE AI REVOLUTION FOR AMERICAN
DIPLOMACY," *War on the Rocks*,
https://warontherocks.com/2020/11/winning-the-ai-revolution-for-american-diplomacy/)

**[The State Department Should Lead on AI]{.underline}**

[Why is diplomacy]{.underline} --- **[rather than defense]{.underline}**
or industrial policy --- [the right venue]{.underline} for advancing a
digital democracy agenda, or something like it**[?]{.underline}**
[Simply put, the multidimensional and transnational nature of AI
requires an integrated, strategic approach, and **diplomats are uniquely
skilled** in making policy across these issues more than the sum of
their piecemeal parts]{.underline}. To channel former French Prime
Minister Georges Clemenceau, [AI is too important to be left to the
generals]{.underline} --- or the technologists --- [alone]{.underline}.
So far, most of the government's focus on AI has been through research
and development investments at [the Defense Department]{.underline}, or
through White House Office of Science and Technology Policy efforts to
capitalize on it as an innovative economic windfall. Unfortunately, this
[approach]{.underline} --- including leaving much of the
intergovernmental norm-setting on AI to peer-to-peer military
discussions --- [misses the strategic forest for the tactical
trees]{.underline}. Issue-specific approaches that target global AI only
as a military tool or an economic boon have two dangerous flaws: [They
largely ignore AI as a human rights issue, and forsake the potential for
alliances and issue-linkage across policy areas]{.underline}. [For
example]{.underline}, existing [efforts]{.underline} have
**[fail]{.underline}**ed to leverage U.S. technological leadership to
advance global norms aligned with Western values, or [to use foreign
assistance to promote inclusive digital development at
scale]{.underline}. [The State Department's diplomats maintain a
**comparative advantage** over interagency peers in remedying exactly
these flaws. Diplomats are skilled in dealing with crosscutting global
problems, and well suited to play a leading, orchestrating role in
advancing a concerted American vision for AI across its economic,
security, and human rights aspects]{.underline}. In Washington, at their
posts, and [in multilateral organizations, diplomats spend much of their
days integrating peer agencies' competing perspectives to advance a
concerted U.S. agenda; leveraging instruments of national power such
as]{.underline} foreign aid, **[military assistance]{.underline}**, or
visa regulations [to advance disparate goals across different issues;
and negotiating in bilateral and multilateral fora on economic,
political, human rights, and military matters]{.underline}. [The State
Department's sustained leadership in international organizations, which
will play a major role in digital technology governance, is an
additional underutilized advantage]{.underline}. [The White House is
wrong not to include the State Department as a "**key agency**" in its
strategy on AI]{.underline}. In fact, [the department may be **the**
keystone agency]{.underline} --- [linking disparate, issue-specific
efforts together so the result is more than the sum of its
parts]{.underline}.

#### State Department-led assistance solves AI [rules-for-engagement]{.underline} and escalation

**Blinken 21**, US Secretary of State ("Secretary Antony J. Blinken at
the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence's (NSCAI)
Global Emerging Technology Summit,"
<https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-national-security-commission-on-artificial-intelligences-nscai-global-emerging-technology-summit/)>

We're moving quickly, because we want to ensure that as [AI]{.underline}
and related [technologies transform how we live]{.underline}, how we
work, how we compete, [how we defend ourselves]{.underline}, that
**[we're staying ahead of change]{.underline}**, indeed that we are
shaping change and, critically, making sure it delivers for our people.
My colleagues, I think, have very capably covered the administration's
work on these issues as it relates to our domestic renewal, our economy,
and our defense. So what I'd like to do today is to focus on the [State
Department's distinct role]{.underline}, because diplomacy **[will be
critical]{.underline}**. [Working with partners and allies to develop
and deploy technology is going to help us tackle the most urgent
challenges we face]{.underline}, from pandemics to the climate crisis.
[Diplomacy will]{.underline} also **[be essential]{.underline}** to
mitigating risks, [from preventing cyber attacks that target our
businesses, to regulating technology that threatens our privacy, to
defending our democratic values and way of life]{.underline}. And let me
just pause for a second on that last point, because I think it deserves
emphasis. It's fundamentally what's at stake here. More than anything
else, our task is to put forth and carry out a compelling vision for how
to use technology in a way that serves our people, protects our
interests and upholds our democratic values. It's not enough to
highlight the horrors of techno-authoritarianism, to point to what
countries like China and Russia are doing, and say that it's wrong and
dangerous, even as it is. [We've also got to make the positive case for
our own approach, and then we've got to deliver. That is the challenge
before us]{.underline}. [We need]{.underline} the United States and we
need its **[partners]{.underline}** to remain the world's innovative
leaders and standard setters, [to ensure that universal rights and
democratic values remain at the center of all the innovation that's to
come, and that it delivers real benefits in people's lives]{.underline}.
That fundamentally is the test that we have to pass, and it's a test I
think you've heard President Biden allude to. In short, [democracies
have to pass the tech test together]{.underline}. And
**[diplomacy]{.underline}**, I believe, **[has a big role to play in
that]{.underline}**. Now, any time you hear someone from the **[State
Department]{.underline}** talking, we're likely to throw in
**[pillars]{.underline}** and frameworks and tranches, so I can't be any
different today. We have to have our pillars, so let me walk you through
six of them -- (laughter) -- that cover the approach to these issues. I
know you'd be disappointed without it. [The]{.underline} first is
[reducing the national security risks posed by malicious cyber
activities and emerging technologies]{.underline}. This is the most
basic thing our diplomacy has to do: protect our people, protect our
networks, prevent conflict, and establish standards of responsible
conduct in cyberspace. Already, we've brought countries together around
an approach that recognizes international law to make it clear that
countries are governed in cyberspace just like they are offline and that
defines norms that apply not only in wartime but in peacetime too,
because we're now dealing with significant cyber incidents outside the
context of war. We've also called for practical confidence-building
measures; for example, steps as simple as establishing points of
contact, so that in the event of a major cyber incident we actually know
who to call. Under American leadership, UN member-states have come
together repeatedly to reaffirm this basic framework. Now [we're working
to bring allies and partners along to respond collectively]{.underline}
when others engage in malicious cyber activity. [That's what happened
after the SolarWinds intrusion]{.underline}. We attributed it to Russia;
22 countries, the European Union, **[NATO quickly supported that
conclusion]{.underline}**. **[And that's important]{.underline}**,
because when we speak with one voice, we can more effectively deter
future bad acts. Last month, as some of you will have noted, at the NATO
summit, NATO reaffirmed that a cyber attack could trigger Article V --
"an attack on one is an attack on all" -- and that's an important step
too in deterring those attacks and protecting our national security in
the cyber age. [We're also treating ransomware not only as a law
enforcement issue but also as a national security issue]{.underline}.
Ransomware and other cyber crimes affect all of us -- our businesses,
local governments; our most critical infrastructure, from power grids to
hospitals. As you know, one in four Americans has been the victim of a
cyber crime, at a cost of more than \$4 billion every single year.
That's a direct threat to the safety, to the well-being of our people,
and so it's at the top of our diplomatic agenda. And it's also why we're
elevating ransomware in our engagements with Russia. [Our message is
clear: Countries that harbor cyber criminals have a responsibility to
take action.]{.underline} [If they don't, we will]{.underline}. We're
**[strengthen]{.underline}**ing our diplomatic and **[foreign assistance
tools]{.underline}** to fight transnational cyber criminals, and we're
working to expand membership in the global cyber crime treaty known as
the Budapest Convention. We'll launch similar efforts **[on
AI]{.underline}** and other emerging technologies. If they're going to
be used as part of our national defense, [we want the world to have a
shared understanding of how to do that responsibly, in the same way that
we've hammered out rules for how to use conventional and nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [That's how we **reduce the risk of
proliferation**. It's how we prevent **escalation or unintended
incidents**]{.underline}.

### Solvency -- cyber

#### The State Department is [comparatively]{.underline} the best actor for leading cyber policy. They promote consensus with allies on [norms]{.underline}, [capacity building]{.underline}, [intel-sharing]{.underline} and [resilience]{.underline}

**Williams 21**, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for
Global Security Research (CGSR) at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (BK, et al, "US and Allied Cyber Security Cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific," *Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory*,
<https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1787217>)

The workshop\'s penultimate panel stressed a renewal of innovation in
diplomatic practice. An [active cyber diplomacy holds the promise of
restoring stability to cyberspace]{.underline}, and, for the United
States, advocating for a free, interoperable, and secure internet
globally. [State Department retains the bureaucratic competencies and
personnel to enact forward-looking cyber diplomacy]{.underline}, but
they have much ground to cover on norm construction, capacity building,
and affirming that states follow international law in cyberspace.
[Diplomacy\'s most substantial roles are protecting]{.underline} an
on-line ecosystem where [human rights]{.underline} are respected,
[restoring stability by reducing incentives for states to act
maliciously, and demonstrating U.S. leadership in]{.underline} digital
rights and [emerging technology]{.underline}. [Cyber diplomats at the
State Department]{.underline} and DHS [cooperate with allies on publicly
attributing blame for aggressive cyber acts]{.underline} to
state-sponsored APTs. [State Department is active in]{.underline} the
UN\'s Group of Governmental Experts and Open-Ended Working Group,
[lobbying for an internet of information freedom rather than information
control by states]{.underline}. Thus far, as one panelist emphasized,
the State Department has not yet framed its cyber diplomacy efforts in
the realities of the cyber strategic environment. The State Department
can make strides in supporting Persistent Engagement by socializing
foreign service officers and diplomats, who are the face of diplomacy,
to the domain\'s competitive nature. [Shaping international discourse on
cybersecurity norms, responsible state behavior, and governance can be
best attained by]{.underline} a corps of **[diplomats]{.underline}** who
are unified with the United States\' cyber doctrine. [Norm construction
from the bottom up presents the best route to shape global norms.
Leveraging agile coalitions of allies to build norms represents a
workable solution]{.underline} to adversary intransigence at the UN.
Values, by themselves, do not have the power to influence norms against
concerted state pressures to assert authoritarian control over the
internet. Competitive [allied **cyber diplomacy can shape** the
standards and norms that determine the future of the
internet]{.underline}. [A competitive cyber diplomacy **relies on the
State Department\'s core competency** in creating]{.underline} bilateral
and [**multilateral agreements** for capacity building, threat
intelligence sharing, resilience measures, and to promote best practices
in a competitive cyber ecosystem]{.underline}. [Diplomats understand
countries\' strategic and political environments, and the State
Department has the capacity to scale]{.underline} Hunt Forward
[operations]{.underline}. USCC \[[US Cyber Command]{.underline}\]
**[encounters]{.underline}** **[limits]{.underline}** in growing Hunt
Forward. Collaboration between the State Department and USCC may present
the best avenue to consensually operate in other countries\' networks to
observe malicious actors. [The State Department will guide the United
States\' cyber diplomacy]{.underline}, **[not]{.underline}** USCC
\[**[US Cyber Command]{.underline}**\], [and]{.underline} integrating
cyber authorities [will]{.underline} create synergies for how the United
States can [restore stability in cyberspace and safeguard the United
States\' cybersecurity]{.underline}.

#### DoS-led cyber initiatives solve ambiguity

to 2019, she was cyber adviser to the director of policy planning at the
U.S. Department of State (Emily, "From Reaction to Action: Adopting a
Competitive Posture in Cyber Diplomacy," *Texas National Security
Review*, 3.4)

[The U.S. government needs to reach]{.underline} an interagency
[consensus on the preferred boundaries of acceptable behavior outside of
armed conflict and promote them in international fora. **The State
Department is the natural leader for these efforts**]{.underline}.
Interagency discussions should proceed in tandem with consultations with
the private sector. Currently, discussions with private sector entities
all too often are isolated within individual agencies, with little
coordination between agencies --- even between the State Department and
USAID. Agreed-upon conventions can then be reinforced by the actions of
all departments and agencies. [Working]{.underline} bilaterally,
[multilaterally]{.underline}, and [through international institutions,
the United States --- **led by the State Department** --- can influence
and message what behaviors it views as unacceptable]{.underline}. [This
can help **reduce the ambiguity that adversaries exploit**, enhance the
ability to build coalitions to support the U.S. view, and enable the
United States to more effectively secure commitments from like-minded
countries to impose consequences on those whose actions are counter to
the principles]{.underline}.

### At: Military key

#### The DoS can work with defense agencies of foreign countries, and that's NOT security cooperation

**Tankel 20**, Stephen Tankel, associate professor at American
University, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New
American Security, and Tommy Ross, non-resident senior associate at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2020 (Stephen,
"RETOOLING U.S. SECURITY SECTOR ASSISTANCE," War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2020/10/reforming-u-s-security-sector-assistance-for-great-power-competition/)>

[The United States provides]{.underline} security sector [assistance to
foreign civilian and military forces, agencies, and institutions ranging
from local law enforcement and judicial systems to standing
militaries]{.underline}. This assistance is intended to strengthen U.S.
access to key territories and facilities, shape partners' national
security decision-making and governance, and build their capacity and
capabilities for use against shared threats and adversaries. It also
promotes the U.S. defense industry via arms transfers, supports the
infrastructure and operations of multilateral organizations such as
NATO, and increases military interoperability. [The State Department
implements assistance across the entire security sector, **including
organizations responsible for defense**]{.underline}, law enforcement,
**[and security of key assets]{.underline}** like ports and borders.
[The **Department of Defense** has a narrower mandate, and provides
assistance to partner militaries under the **umbrella of security
cooperation**]{.underline}. [The Pentagon]{.underline} also [engages
in]{.underline} a range of other [activities]{.underline} --- combined
exercises, staff talks, port visits, and officer exchanges --- [that
fall under **security cooperation**]{.underline} as well. We use the
term security sector assistance for simplicity, and distinguish where
these additional security cooperation activities are relevant. The U.S.
government does not typically define Foreign Military Sales as
assistance, but we believe it should, and that it ought to factor Direct
Commercial Sales into its assistance planning as well. Both types of
sales can lead to sustained U.S. engagement with a partner in the form
of training, maintenance, and sustainment for the purchased items.

#### Only [non-military]{.underline} assistance promotes the trust necessary for Security Assistance to succeed

**Stohl 16**, senior associate with the Managing Across Boundaries
Initiative at the Stimson Center (Rachel, "[The Pitfalls of the Pentagon
Taking the Lead on U.S. Security Assistance]{.underline}," World
Politics Review,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/19963/the-pitfalls-of-the-pentagon-taking-the-lead-on-u-s-security-assistance)//BB

[Oversight and transparency over these myriad programs are often
extremely difficult.]{.underline} Numerous government accounts provide
this money, and depending on the program, different congressional
committees maintain oversight. [The stove-piped nature of U.S. military
assistance and the steadfast secrecy that surrounds decisions made for
reasons of "national security" often create an artificial division
between national security interests and foreign policy
ideals]{.underline}. [They also make it nearly impossible
to]{.underline} identify the exact amount of spending, to [evaluate the
effectiveness and impact of various programs, and to avoid duplicating
resources and efforts across different offices and
agencies]{.underline}. This tension between the State Department and the
Pentagon is not new. For decades, there have been contradictions between
advancing U.S. security interest and foreign policy goals, such as the
protection of human rights. Traditionally, the State Department was the
primary decision-maker that determined who received security assistance
and for what purpose. Yet all of that began to change after Sept. 11.
Before 9/11, Congress had already begun authorizing the Pentagon to
support foreign militaries in roles that had long been filled by the
State Department. Starting with anti-drug training in the Western
Hemisphere, the number and size of these programs has steadily grown
since. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the purpose of "train and equip"
programs was altered to fill an expanding list of priorities to "build
partner capacity," known as BPC. A RAND Corporation study in 2013 found
that of 184 unique authorities that underwrite 165 BPC programs, at
least 70 are managed and can be utilized by the Pentagon to provide
security cooperation. The mandates of these programs are vast, ranging
from counterterrorism to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
After 9/11, the Defense Department created military assistance programs
to supplement traditional State Department ones. But from the outset,
the appropriated funds that support these programs were subject to fewer
restrictions than their State Department counterparts. For example, the
Pentagon's Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship Program was
originally created in 2002 with a mandate that critics claimed served
the same purpose as the State Department's International Military
Education and Training program. The Pentagon program provided nonlethal
counterterrorism training, but lethal training was made available two
years later. Beyond the lack of transparency and oversight, [a larger
and more philosophical concern is that foreign policy has become
militarized]{.underline}. Similarly, in 2006, the Pentagon was
authorized to use \$200 million of its Operation and Maintenance funds
to equip and train foreign militaries for counterterrorism operations.
In creating these parallel training authorities and
[funding]{.underline} them [through the defense budget]{.underline}, the
Pentagon [is]{.underline}, in effect, [able to implement]{.underline}
its [security assistance without applying Foreign Assistance Act
restrictions, which are intended to ensure that human rights and other
foreign policy concerns are taken into consideration when determining
the provision of security assistance]{.underline}. Experts have counted
a tripling of military assistance out of the Pentagon budget from 2008
to 2015. That money comes with greater influence. And although the State
Department can veto some programs, others are outside its authority, and
program planning is not always shared with State Department personnel.
After 9/11, the Pentagon gained a larger role, not just because it had
the money, but because it was believed that it had the experience and
means to react more quickly to changing situations and needs in an
expansive and fast growing war on terror. While many of the countries
receiving Pentagon military assistance are seen as national security
priorities, their behavior often raises foreign policy concerns that
make diplomatic engagement difficult. Providing arms to these countries
also increases the risk that U.S.-origin weapons could be used against
the United States, its soldiers, its allies and/or its interests. In
many cases, [military]{.underline} and security [assistance is provided
to achieve short-term security gains, which may **undermine** long-term
U.S foreign policy interests]{.underline}. These issues are compounded
by the fact that the Pentagon simply has more money and resources to
address these concerns, and it has become easier for it to simply foot
the bill. Pentagon spending on military assistance has totaled at least
\$122 billion since 2001, compared to approximately \$119 billion for
the State Department. The Security Assistance Monitor, a program of the
Center for International Policy that tracks U.S. security assistance to
countries around the world, has documented a tenfold increase in
Pentagon security aid programs since 2001---from \$1 billion in 2001 to
\$10.8 billion in 2015. State Department spending nearly doubled in that
time from \$4.6 billion to \$8.3 billion. However, it is not the dollar
figure that is worth comparing, but rather the meteoric rise of Pentagon
spending, as opposed to a more gradual increase from the State
Department. This increased spending has made some observers
apprehensive. A Congressional Research Service report last May raised
serious concerns about the roles of the State Department and the
Pentagon with regard to security assistance and reconciling foreign
policy objectives with security goals. It highlighted the lack of
reporting requirements for Pentagon programs compared to the State
Department and the resulting lack of oversight and accounting. In
addition, Pentagon programs are not subject to country-by-country public
reporting, making understanding a recipient country's priorities,
activities and funding impossible. At least 66 Pentagon programs do not
allow any specific country information to be made available at all.
Beyond this lack of transparency and oversight, a larger and more
philosophical concern is that foreign policy has become militarized.
Recipient countries and communities have the impression that help only
comes from the U.S. military, which changes the context of assistance
and the relationship with those receiving it. The mission and its
perception differ depending on whether the help comes from the U.S.
military, or instead from the U.S. Embassy, the United States Agency for
International Development or other civil servants from various U.S.
government agencies. Today, [American security assistance has become
unnecessarily military in nature, simply because there are additional
Pentagon]{.underline} funds and [programs]{.underline} that can quickly
move money. At a fundamental level, [when speaking with members of the
U.S. military]{.underline} involved in these types of missions, such as
building schools or bridges in African countries, [they have recognized
that they are simply there to complete their work and to strengthen
military-to-military relationships]{.underline}. [They]{.underline}
often [don't worry about diplomatic aspects or the types of
relationships they are establishing.]{.underline} To be sure, developing
any relationship, particularly in countries with questionable and at
times poor records of democracy and human rights, is important, and
[military relationships may buy]{.underline} the [security]{.underline}
that is desired [in the short term. But in the long term, without
**deeper diplomatic relationships and nonmilitary engagement**, it will
be **impossible** to achieve larger strategic objectives and foster an
**environment of trust**]{.underline}.

### At: State department ineffective

#### We're overhauling and revitalizing diplomacy now -- that makes the State Department effective

**Blinken 21**

(Antony J, "Secretary Antony J. Blinken on the Modernization of American
Diplomacy", 10/27,
<https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-the-modernization-of-american-diplomacy/>)
DB

So today, I'm pleased to share with you our plan to modernize the
purpose and institution of American diplomacy. Some of our proposals are
already being implemented; others will be rolled out soon. And as I said
on Monday when I met with our chiefs of mission around the world and
with department leaders, at every step, we want to hear from our people
about how we can most effectively do the things that I'll lay out today.
[There are, as with any good plan, a few pillars -- five of
them]{.underline}. [First, we will **build our capacity and expertise**
in the areas that will be critical to our **national security** in the
years ahead, particularly climate, global health, **cyber security** and
**emerging technologies**, economics, and **multilateral
diplomacy**]{.underline}. This isn't just a new list of priorities by a
new administration. [It reflects a significant reorientation of U.S.
foreign policy that focuses on the forces that most directly and
consequentially affect Americans' lives, livelihoods, and security, and
that will increasingly be at the heart of our alliances and
partnerships, and core to our engagement with strategic
competitors]{.underline}. **[On cyberspace and emerging technologies, we
have a major stake in shaping the digital revolution that's happening
around us and making sure that it serves our people, protects our
interests, boosts our competitiveness, and upholds our
values]{.underline}**. [We want to **prevent cyber attacks** that put
our people, our networks, companies, and critical infrastructure at
risk]{.underline}. We want the internet to remain a transformative force
for learning, for connection, for economic growth, not a tool of
repression. [We want to **shape the standards that govern new
technology**, so they ensure quality, protect consumer health and
safety, facilitate trade, respect people's rights]{.underline}. We want
to make sure the technology works for democracy, fighting back against
disinformation, standing up for internet freedom, reducing the misuse of
surveillance technology. And [we want to promote **cooperation**,
advancing this agenda tech by tech, issue by issue, with democratic
partners by our side]{.underline}. **[All of this is work for American
diplomacy]{.underline}**. After an intense review led by Deputy
Secretary Sherman and McKeon that included consultations with partners
in Congress and outside experts, I intend, with the support of Congress,
to establish a new bureau for cyberspace and digital policy headed by an
ambassador-at-large, and to name a new special envoy for critical and
emerging technology. Both will report to Deputy Secretary Sherman for at
least the first year. [We will also bring more **specialized talent**,
including STEM expertise, to the department, and ensure that we're
developing expertise as well in these areas across the Foreign and Civil
Service]{.underline}. By taking these steps, we'll be better able to
make sure that the United States remains the world's innovation leader
and standard setter. On global health security, we're conducting a
review to determine how the department can best lead on this issue. Stay
tuned for the results there. It's critical that we not only help end the
COVID-19 pandemic, but also build back better global health security to
prevent, to detect, and mitigate future pandemics. After the ordeal of
the past 21 months, this is an opportunity and a responsibility that we
must, and we will, seize. On climate, President Biden created the
position of special presidential envoy for climate, and Secretary Kerry
and his team are hard at work integrating climate diplomacy across the
department. We've created new Foreign Service positions dedicated full
time to climate issues, one in every regional bureau and in critical
posts overseas, for example, in India and Brazil. And we'll seek new
funding to educate and train officers worldwide on climate diplomacy.
[Multilateral diplomacy -- well, that's diplo-speak for the need to
cooperate with other countries to contend with the greatest challenges
of our time, none of which we can tackle effectively alone]{.underline}.
If we're not engaged in international institutions, then we leave a void
likely to be filled by others who may not share our values and
interests, or no one steps up and we squander the benefits of collective
action. And wherever and whenever new rules are being debated, for
example, on how the global economy should work, how the internet should
be governed, how our environment should be protected, how human rights
should be defined and defended, American diplomats need to be at the
table. So, **[we're ramping up our expertise, our skills, and our
training]{.underline}**. And [we've created a new office within the
International Organizations Bureau with a single mandate to ensure that
we and our closest partners can win elections to lead key institutions,
be appointed to key bodies, serve in key positions across the United
Nations, and push back against those looking to undermine the integrity
of the international system that we help to build, to shape, and to
lead]{.underline}.

#### Policy, not resources, is key

**Burns 20**

(William J, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
"The Damage at the State Department Is Worse Than You Can Imagine",
Atlantic, 3/12,

DB

First, in much the same sense that Marshall's concept relied on European
self-help, [**State will have to show what it can do for itself**, not
just what the next president or Congress can do for it]{.underline}.
[Neither State nor other beleaguered institutions can simply wait for
relief to be delivered]{.underline}. **[They'll have to start by making
the case themselves, through their own example, pursuing reforms that
don't initially require additional authorities or expenditure of
political capital]{.underline}**. At the State Department, these actions
should include stripping away layers of bureaucracy, streamlining
decision making, and pushing accountability and responsibility downward
in Washington and outward to well-qualified ambassadors overseas. A
reform effort will have to address the atrophy of tradecraft and core
skills within the diplomatic corps, the shameful diversity deficit, and
the lack of fluency in areas such as economics, climate change, and new
technologies. Reform also means reshaping antediluvian approaches to
leadership, management, recruitment, and performance, and most of all,
rediscovering the honor and purpose exemplified by career professionals
during the Trump impeachment hearings, and upholding that example even
when inconvenient to professional progress. Second, [sustaining that
initiative will require rebalancing U.S. national-security tools---in
both **budget** and **policy** terms]{.underline}. Much as Marshall
appreciated the significance of priming the pump in Europe, a new
administration and Congress will need to be supportive. Some of this
will inevitably be financial, enough of a budgetary boost to allow a
"training float" so that much more systematic professional training will
be possible; to accommodate the return to service of some of those
driven out in recent years; and to allow for the injection of talent and
experience from key sectors, such as technology, where State lacks
in-house expertise. Money isn't the first or second answer to most needs
at State, but it matters---especially at a moment when our greatest
rival, China, has doubled spending on diplomacy. **[The most important
rebalancing will be in policy, not resources]{.underline}**. [That
begins with **reemphasizing diplomacy** as America's tool of **first
resort** and reversing the post-9/11 trend toward the militarization of
foreign policy]{.underline}. The next administration should reverse the
debilitating habit, far more pernicious in the Trump era than ever
before, of filling unprecedented numbers of senior (and not-so-senior)
jobs in Washington and ambassadorships abroad with political loyalists,
many of whom have questionable qualifications and motivations. Finally,
a renewed State Department will have to make a new effort to connect
effectively not only with other parts of the executive branch and
Congress, but also with the wider America it serves. Marshall and his
colleagues spent time selling their recovery plan on the Hill and across
the country. His successors understood the institutional challenge of
making the case for American diplomacy, which lacks the natural
constituencies of the U.S. military, and the political imperative for
trying to do so. James Baker, who served as secretary of state under
George H. W. Bush, titled his memoir The Politics of Diplomacy---he knew
better than most that without a firmer political foothold, the State
Department and the policies it seeks to implement would both suffer.
Restoring American society's faith in our foreign policy ought not be a
lost cause today, given the increasing range of players, from governors
and mayors to business executives and civil-society groups, who share a
stake in disciplined American leadership around the world, and whose
connection to the needs and aspirations of the middle class ought to
inform the substance and conduct of our diplomacy. Building differently
is about realizing that Washington does far too much preaching of the
gospel of U.S. leadership to the American heartland, and not enough
listening. [If new leaders learn from past missteps, if they avoid the
illusion of restoration to a normal that has long lost its normalcy, and
if they approach the task of rebuilding with the mix of daring and
humility that defines American diplomacy at its best, the **State
Department**---and American institutions more broadly---can **climb out
of the deep hole** it's in, despite Trump's furious excavation
proje]{.underline}ct.

#### Successful State diplomacy ensures future funding and political support

CHANGE THAT LASTS [Any effort to reform the State Department should
start from within]{.underline}. [It should focus in the first year of a
new administration or a new term on what can be accomplished under
**existing authorities** and **without significant new
appropriations**]{.underline}. [That is the moment of greatest
opportunity to set a new direction---and the moment of greatest
vulnerability to the habitual traps of bureaucratic inertia, overly
elaborate and time-consuming restructuring plans, partisan bickering,
and distracting forays into the capillaries of reform rather than its
arteries]{.underline}. [If the department can take the initiative and
demonstrate progress on its own, that would be the best advertisement
for **sustained congressional support** and **White House backing** for
a new emphasis on diplomacy]{.underline}. **[It would be the best way to
show that U.S. diplomats are ready to earn their way back to a more
central role]{.underline}**. [It could help **generate momentum** for a
**rebalancing of national security budget priorities** at a moment when
U.S. rivals are not standing still; in recent years, the Chinese have
doubled their spending on diplomacy and greatly expanded their presence
overseas]{.underline}.

### Perm Do Both

#### Military assistance [does not]{.underline} trade off with State Department involvement

**Early 11**, Lt Col, USAF (Billie, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," *Air War College*,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf>)//BB

When the three indicators of militarization are applied to DOD's
security assistance efforts, results indicate that [the United States
relies **heavily** on DOD to pursue foreign policy objectives, but **not
at the expense** of State Department responsibilities. DOD uses security
cooperation to build relationships with partner nations and respond to
humanitarian efforts, and uses security assistance as a flexible tool to
build the capacity of foreign military forces so they can respond to
threats in their regions before conditions require a greater US military
response]{.underline}. Whenever possible, [DOD proactively shapes the
global security environment promoting US interests. DOD has the option
to use its new Section 1206 authority to respond to urgent and emerging
threats based on regional command priorities, or to influence
longer-term State Department programs in support of country
requirements]{.underline}. Also, [DOD's considerable force presence and
commander influence can sway security assistance decisions favorably
toward US interests. However, the State Department maintains a **high
degree of direct involvement** and oversight in all security assistance
decisions]{.underline}.

### Perm Do CP

#### Security cooperation includes the DOS

MAJ Nicholas R. **Simontis, 13** - U.S. Army School of Advanced Military
Studies United States Army Command and General Staff College Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas "SECURITY COOPERATION: AN OLD PRACTICE FOR NEW
TIMES" <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589722.pdf>

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among
Defense, State, USAID, and other agencies]{.underline} as needed.

#### State [controls]{.underline} security cooperation -- all DOD SC is carried out through embassies under [direct]{.underline} supervision of State

assistance**

[Who Conducts Security Cooperation]{.underline}

The following paragraphs describe the key participants and stakeholders
for planning and

managing SC activities at both the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels.

Strategic / National Level

The National Security Council (NSC) generally provides the initial
guidance and translation of national-level decisions pertaining to FID,
SA, and SC. The Department of [State]{.underline} (DoS) [is]{.underline}
generally [the lead]{.underline} government [agency for U.S.
international affairs]{.underline}. The Secretary of State advises the
President in forming foreign policy, including the national FID effort.
The DoS assists the NSC in building national FID related policies and
priorities, and is the lead government agency to carry out these
policies. [The DoS Policy Planning Staff, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs]{.underline} ([PM)]{.underline}, and the new Bureau of Conflict
and Stabilization Operations (CSO) [are the most involved with
interagency planning for]{.underline} FID, [SA, and SC.]{.underline} The
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security is
the principal advisor and focal point for SA matters within DoS; control
and coordination of SA extends from this office to the Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. At the national
level, the PM is the principal channel of liaison between DoS and DoD.
Generally, [DoS directs the overall U.S. Government]{.underline} (USG)
[SA program and DoD executes via SC programs and
activities]{.underline}.

DoD Directive 5132.03, Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security
Cooperation, dated October 24, 2008, establishes DoD policy and assigns
responsibilities under the GEF, which provides SC guidance to the GCCs,
and titles 10 and 22 of the United States Code (USC), and statutory
authorities, executive orders, and policies relating to the
administration of SC, including SA programs authorized by the FAA and
AECA, as amended. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy USD(P)
serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of
Defense on all SC matters. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Global
Security Affairs) establishes SA policy and supervises SA programs
through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Secretaries
of the Military Departments (MILDEPs) coordinate on SC policy guidance,
campaign plans, and allocate resources to achieve SC objectives. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) provides implementation
guidance for U.S. military plans and programs and provides the Secretary
of Defense with military advice concerning SC.15

Operational and Tactical Level

The Director, DSCA, under the authority, direction, and control of the
USD(P), directs,

administers, and provides DoD-wide guidance to the DoD Components and
DoD representatives

to U.S. missions, for the execution of DoD SC programs for which DSCA
has responsibility.

Other security SC programs are managed by other Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the

GCCs, or MILDEPs. Specifically, GCCs develop campaign plans to conduct
SC programs and

activities in accordance with the GEF, and complete campaign plan and
campaign support plan

assessments.16

[The U.S. diplomatic mission to a host nation includes representatives
of all U.S. departments and agencies physically present in a
country]{.underline}. [The President gives the Chief of
Mission]{.underline} (COM), normally **[an ambassador]{.underline}**,
[full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of
**all** USG executive branch employees in country]{.underline}. The COM
has authority over all USG executive branch employees within the mission
and host country except for employees under the command of a U.S.
military commander (Title 22, USC, Section 3927).17 [The Senior Defense
Official]{.underline} (SDO) or Defense Attaché (DATT) [is the principal
DoD official in a U.S. embassy]{.underline}, as designated by the
Secretary of Defense. The SDO or DATT is the COM's principal military
advisor on defense and national security issues, the senior
diplomatically accredited DoD military officer assigned to a diplomatic
mission, and the single point of contact for all DoD matters involving
the embassy or DoD elements assigned to or working from the embassy. In
addition to being the diplomatically accredited DATT, [the SDO is the
chief of the Security Cooperation Organization]{.underline} (SCO)
[within the Country Team. The SCO includes all DoD elements located in a
foreign country with assigned responsibilities for carrying out SA and
SC management functions]{.underline} under titles 22 and 10 USC. SCOs
typically include military assistance advisory groups, military missions
and groups, offices of defense and military cooperation, liaison groups,
and defense attaché personnel designated to perform security
assistance/cooperation functions.18

#### Substantial security cooperation is funded and controlled by State

Assistance in a Period of Constrained Resources"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA568436.pdf> **SC = Security
Cooperation. SA = Security Assistance. FID = Foreign Internal Defense
assistance**

[Significant portions of U.S. military security cooperation are funded
as foreign assistance activities managed by the Department of
State]{.underline}, and appropriated by Congress. With the amount of
funding in the Defense appropriations bills, [it's not common knowledge
that these military programs are funded under DoS budget
authorities]{.underline}. The State Department has always taken its lead
role on foreign assistance seriously, as a significant foreign policy
tool. Over the past ten years, DoS focused on substantial internal
reforms including foreign assistance planning and implementation. The
U.S. government struggles to prepare for a future of persistent conflict
and budget constraints. It is important to solidify reforms and
institutionalize the integrating actions planned in the Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review and the 3D Planning Framework to
implement effective and efficient foreign assistance activities.

### No Solvency -- generic

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

### No Solvency\-\--Risk Aversion/Resources

#### Risk aversion and understaffing decimates solvency

**David**, Acosta and Krohley **21**, Colonel Arnel P. David is a US

Sergeant Sean A. Acosta is a civil affairs noncommissioned officer, and

MILITARY'S LOOMING FAILURE," *Modern War Institute*,
<https://mwi.usma.edu/getting-competition-wrong-the-us-militarys-looming-failure/>)//BB

At present, [we are engaged in global competition with China
(and]{.underline}, to a much lesser extent, [Russia]{.underline}). We
are engaged in a regional contest with Iran. Global jihadist networks
remain a potent threat. That said, we do ourselves a devastating
disservice when we approach the rest of the world on the basis of its
utility in these contests. American policy in Ukraine is downstream of
our rivalry with Russia. The same is true for our engagement in Iraq
with respect to Iran, and across much of the Global South vis-à-vis
China. We instrumentalize bilateral relationships with smaller powers in
pursuit of advantage against our rivals, while neglecting the local
details that define the strategic landscape. This instrumentalization is
readily apparent to those on the receiving end, provoking cynicism and
frustration from Kyiv to Baghdad and beyond. Ultimately, it is
exploitative and self-defeating---just as it was during the Cold War,
when this same mentality led us to disaster from Vietnam to Nicaragua.
[The new great game will be won or lost based, above all else, on
contextual understanding, partnerships, and alliances]{.underline}. It
is not America's responsibility to solve intractable problems in distant
lands. However, we absolutely must understand said problems (as we have
demonstrably failed to do over the past twenty years), so that we might
manage our entanglements and the expenditure of finite resources.
[Across much of the globe, this task falls to the US
**military**]{.underline}. [The Department of State is **understaffed**,
and **isolated** from ground truth by]{.underline} crippling **[risk
aversion]{.underline}**. The intelligence community's priorities lie
elsewhere. From sub-Saharan Africa to the South China Sea, [the military
is]{.underline} often [our **principal point** of contact with contested
terrain]{.underline}.

#### The military doesn't suffer from the same resource shortages that the State Department does

Background, Major Issues, and Options for Congress," Congressional
Research Service, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA493001.pdf>)//BB

[In addition to its regional advantage, DOD enjoys two other advantages:
**greater planning and execution capabilities**, and substantially
**greater budgetary resources**. DOD can muster more \[hu\]manpower than
any other agency]{.underline}. [While U.S. military personnel may be
stretched in wartime, there still exist substantial reserves of
personnel that can be tapped to plan and carry out activities. The
combatant commands enjoy considerably more personnel than do individual
embassies, and their personnel are oriented toward planning activities,
whereas State Department personnel are oriented toward collecting
information and furthering U.S. policy through diplomacy, such as
person-to-person contact]{.underline}. Despite waging a war in Iraq,
CENTCOM created a new Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa (CJT-HOA)
of roughly 2,000 U.S. military personnel (the number fluctuates
regularly) to plan and carry out efforts in the Horn of Africa that
include much foreign assistance activity. In Iraq, DOD temporarily
provided military personnel to fill about 100 State Department PRT
posts, until the State Department could contract persons with the needed
expertise to fill them.

### No Solvency\-\--Political Backlash

#### Diplomatic assistance causes [political backlash]{.underline}\-\--that wrecks solvency

**Kralev 20**, Executive Director @ WIDA, The Washington International
Diplomatic Academy (WIDA) is an independent organization that provides
practical professional training in diplomacy and international affairs
--- both in person and online --- to students, recent graduates and
professionals in government, NGOs and the private sector (Nicholas, "Why
Politicians Don't Trust Diplomats," Washington International Diplomatic
Academy,
<https://diplomaticacademy.us/2020/06/14/kralev-why-politicians-dont-trust-diplomats/)//BB>

[So politicians' lack of trust in the Foreign Service is based on
perceptions that are largely divorced from reality]{.underline}. Like
most Americans, [they know very little about our diplomats]{.underline}.
In a challenge to such a conclusion, previous administrations have often
pointed to entrusting a few senior Foreign Service officers, including
William J. Burns and Thomas R. Pickering, with top State Department
posts as an example of the respective president's reliance on
professionals. That may speak of these officers' capabilities, but it
doesn't make up for sidelining or ignoring the service as an
institution. At least Bush and Obama understood that having held a
prominent position under an administration of the other party is also a
part of a career diplomat's job. For example, Bush appointed R. Nicholas
Burns ambassador to NATO and later undersecretary of state, even though
Burns had been State Department spokesman under Clinton. And Obama
appointed Victoria Nuland an assistant secretary of state despite her
earlier role as a close adviser to Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.
In contrast, Trump has retaliated against officers who held key
positions during the Obama administration. [Politicians' **decades-long
distrust** of the Foreign Service has significantly undermined the
authority of the **professionals and ultimately weakened U.S. diplomacy
globally**]{.underline}. [The very real danger that there won't be
enough properly trained diplomats to **restore America's clout in the
future worries us**]{.underline} at the independent Washington
International Diplomatic Academy. So much so that, although we were set
up to offer short-term courses, we've decided to start a one-year
post-graduate practical training program for people who aspire to become
diplomats --- the first such effort outside government. Our instructors,
all former senior Foreign Service officers, have a lot to teach.

### No Solvency\-\--Trust

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### The DoD is best for improving strong relationships with host countries

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[Our relationships provide us with a reservoir of strength. They allow
us to operate by, with, and through our allies and partners to meet
shared security challenges]{.underline}. The degree of partnership
should not be measured by the quantity of security cooperation programs,
but rather by their quality. [The Department of Defense has learned from
large-scale assistance programs that for lasting impact, a comprehensive
engagement plan involves more than training and equipping. Importantly,
we are building a culture of **learning and adaptation**, drawing on
lessons from program successes, as well as, from programs that did not
have the desired impact. We are building a learning agenda and
integrating it into decision processes, and measure program impact in a
way that assesses real change, rather than counting our own inputs into
programs as successes in themselves]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} seek
to [learn]{.underline} lessons and avoid the fallacy of sunk costs [by
ruthlessly prioritizing programs that are strategic, and setting
appropriate expectations for programs that provide more of a tactical
advantage. Through this approach, we can unlock the **comparative
advantages our allies and partners** bring as we **collectively work**
together to meet our shared objectives]{.underline}.
