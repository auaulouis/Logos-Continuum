"[Security assistance]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "[security
cooperation]{.underline}" are two terms that refer to U.S. activities to
train, equip, and otherwise assist foreign partners. The term [security
assistance is a generic term]{.underline} used throughout the U.S.
government **[to describe assistance provided to foreign military and
security forces]{.underline}**, regardless of the agency providing that
assistance. However, DOD uses the term security assistance to refer
specifically to assistance provided under Title 22 authority, funded
with monies appropriated to the State Department and managed by the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), an agency under
[the]{.underline} Office of the Secretary of Defense, Policy.3

[DOD defines]{.underline} "**[security cooperation]{.underline}**" [as
a]{.underline} broad **[set of activities undertaken by
DOD]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} encourage and [enable international
partners to work with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
achieve strategic objectives]{.underline}. [Included in the definition
are]{.underline} DOD [interactions with]{.underline} **[both foreign
defense and foreign nonmilitary security establishments]{.underline}**.
Security cooperation includes all DOD-administered security assistance
programs that (1) build defense and security relationships that promote
specific U.S. security interests, including all international armaments
cooperation activities and security assistance activities; (2) develop
allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations; and (3) provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
contingency access to host nations.4 [According to DOD]{.underline},
[security assistance is a subset of DOD's security
cooperation]{.underline} portfolio.

[Authority for]{.underline} DOD to conduct [security cooperation
activities]{.underline} [is enacted in two]{.underline} primary
[places]{.underline}: **[Title 10]{.underline}** (Armed Forces) U.S.C.
**[and]{.underline}** **[N]{.underline}**ational
**[D]{.underline}**efense **[A]{.underline}**uthorization
**[Acts]{.underline}**.

#### Violation -- The plan isn't non-military which opens up infinite tiny unpredictable affirmatives. Voter for limits and debatabiliity

### 2NC -- O/V

#### Our interpretation has a set caselist -- we'll insert it which provides an intent to exclude assistance and vague affs.

[Congress has provided DOD with]{.underline}, by CRS's estimate, more
than 80 separate authorities [to assist and engage with foreign
governments, militaries, security forces, and populations]{.underline},
although other organizations have identified a larger number of
authorities. 22 [These authorities are briefly described
below]{.underline} under the following rubrics:

- Contingency Operations and Related Coalition Operational Support;

- Global and Regional, Non-Contingency Train and Equip, and Other
  Assistance;

- Multi-purpose;

- Operational Support;

- Counternarcotics, Counter-Transnational Organized Crime, and

<!-- -->

- Counterproliferation;

- Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief;

- Exercises;

- International Armaments Cooperation;

- Education and Exchange Programs;

- Military-to-Military Contacts;

- Defense Institution Building and Support; and

- Recovery and Accounting of Missing Personnel.

**[Unlike]{.underline}** State Department **[security
assistance]{.underline}** authorities **[that are broad
and]{.underline}** usually **[subject to a wide range of]{.underline}**
general **[conditions]{.underline}** elsewhere in law, Title 10
[security cooperation]{.underline} authorities [are usually]{.underline}
**[targeted, specifying the types of support or assistance that may be
provided and the conditions associated with these types of
assistance]{.underline}**. One condition on security cooperation
authorities (with certain exceptions) is the DOD Leahy Law (10 U.S.C.
2249e) prohibition on assistance to units of foreign security forces
credibly believed to have committed gross violations of human rights. 23
Conforming to the Title 22 U.S.C. law vesting the Secretary of State
with responsibility to exercise "continuous supervision and general
direction" of military assistance, including military education and
training, many security cooperation statutes require Secretary of State
"concurrence" (i.e., approval) or other State Department input.

#### List of programs

**DSCA 2021**

\[Defense Security Cooperation Agency, "Security Cooperation
Management",
https://dscu.edu/documents/publications/ebooks/greenbook.aspx\]

Security Cooperation While all of the programs previously mentioned are
authorized under 22 U.S.C (Title 22), and are under the general control
of the Department of State (DoS), the Department of Defense (DoD)
administers many of them. Title 10 [U.S. Code]{.underline} Section 301
[defines security cooperation programs and activities **of DoD** as any
program or interaction of U.S.C. with the security establishment of a
foreign country to build capabilities, provide access or build
relationships]{.underline}. As such, many of the previously described
FAA and AECA-authorized security assistance programs administered by the
DoD, in accordance with the SAMM, fall under the broad definition of
security cooperation. [The following is a categorization of
programs]{.underline}, and a brief explanation, based upon a partial
list presented in the 2016 DoD Guidance for Security Cooperation. For
more detail on the different programs that can be found under each
category, access and download the Security Cooperation Programs book
found on the DSCU website or use the SC Programs Viewer on the Security
Assistance Network Web (SANweb). **[Train and
Equip]{.underline}**/Security Cooperation: DoS Administered Title 22
This category includes security assistance programs previously
identified and described, and these programs are normally implemented
and managed by DoS, USAID, or both. While under the authority of DoS,
[DoD provides material assistance and related training to partner
nations to develop specific capabilities and/or capacities]{.underline}.
These programs are authorized by either the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA)
(22 U.S.C. 2151, et. seq.) or the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22
U.S.C. 2751, et. seq.): • Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) • Drawdowns •
Economic Support Fund (ESF) Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) •
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) •
Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR) •
Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) • Third-Country Transfers Train and
Equip/Security Assistance: DoD-Administered Title 22 This category
includes security assistance programs previously identified and
described. While under the authority of DoS, DoD provides materiel
assistance and related training to partner nations to develop specific
capabilities and/or capacities. These programs are also authorized by
either the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) (22 U.S.C. 2151, et. seq.) or
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2751, et. seq.): • Excess
Defense Articles (EDA) • Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP) •
Foreign Military Sales (FMS) • Foreign Military Construction Services
(FMCS) • International Military Education and Training (IMET) • Leases •
Military Assistance Program (MAP) Train and Equip/Security Cooperation:
Title 10 Programs Under the authority of Title 10, Chapter 16, and/or
the current National Defense Authorization Act, DoD provides material
assistance and related training to partner nations to develop specific
capabilities and/or capacities. This is normally done using DoD
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding, but, in some instances,
Congress appropriates additional funding for DoD to conduct these
programs. Although it is DoD funding, these programs, and all security
cooperation, must be coordinated with DoS. Security Cooperation
practitioners refer to these programs as Building Partner Capacity (BPC)
programs and execute them using a pseudo Letter of Offer and Acceptance.
All BPC programs require congressional notification. Below are just a
few examples. Examples with four digits in quotes represent temporary
authorities whose authorizations can be found in various National
Defense Authorizations Acts. • "1022" Authority to Provide Counterdrug
(CD)-Funded Support to Law Enforcement Agencies • "1206" Training of
Security Forces and Associated Security Ministries of Foreign Countries
to Promote Respect for the Rule of Law and Human Rights • "1226" Support
to Certain Governments for Border Security Operations • 333, Foreign
Security Forces: Authority to Build Capacity • Afghanistan Security
Forces Fund (ASFF) • European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) Iraq Security
Forces Fund (ISFF) • Counter ISIS Train and Equip Fund (CTEF) •
Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative (MSI) **[Operational
Support]{.underline}** Operational support assistance [programs are
designed to enable partner countries to participate in coalition
operations by developing specific capabilities needed for said
operations.]{.underline} Alternately, they might focus on enhanced
interoperability among partner countries and sustain partner operations
in cases where partner countries cannot sustain operations on their own.
These are normally done using DoD O&M funding and congressionally
appropriated funds. These programs, and all security cooperation, must
be coordinated with DoS. Below are just a few examples: • "1234"
Logistics Support for Coalition Forces Supporting Certain U.S. Military
Operations • "1207" Cross Servicing Agreements for Loan of Personnel
Protection and Personnel Survivability Equipment in Coalition Operations
• "1233" Coalition Support Fund (CSF) • 331, Friendly Foreign Countries:
Authority to Provide Support for Conduct of Operations • Acquisition and
Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) • Coalition Readiness Support Program
(CRSP) **[Defense Institution Building]{.underline}** (DIB) DIB, as per
the 27 January 2016 DoD Directive 5205.82, [is the development and
capacity building of partner nation defense institutions, normally at
the ministerial or chief of defense level, in support of U.S. foreign
policy and security cooperation goals]{.underline}. According to this
directive, DIB attempts to promote principles vital to the establishment
of defense institutions that are effective, accountable, transparent,
and responsive to national political systems, especially regarding good
governance, oversight of security forces, respect for human rights, and
the rule of law. Some areas of focus for DIB are defense institutions,
organizations and processes that can ensure effective oversight,
management, and execution of logistics, personnel, budgets, policy,
strategy, and doctrine for effective development, employment, and
sustainment of defense capabilities. DIB is authorized and funded under
Title 10, Section 332, Friendly Foreign Countries; International and
Regional Organizations: Defense Institution Capacity Building to bring
into the Partner Nation (PN) both full-time resident advisors and
long-term, episodic Subject Matter Expert teams. Funding from other
programs can also be used for DIB related training, education, and
professional development. **[International Armaments
Cooperation]{.underline}** International Armaments Cooperation (IAC)
[can best be described as U.S. bilateral and multilateral agreements
with partner countries]{.underline} focused on three cooperative areas.
First, [to share the costs associated with the cooperative
research]{.underline}, development, test, evaluation, and production [of
mutually required weapons systems]{.underline} or components, defense
technologies, systems, or equipment; second, [to foster joint production
and follow-on support of defense articles or equipment;
and]{.underline}, third, [to procure foreign technology]{.underline},
equipment, systems or logistics support. Over time, a variety of names
have been applied to this area of cooperation to include Armaments
Cooperation, International Armaments Cooperation (IAC), International
Armaments Cooperation Programs (IACP), and Defense Cooperation in
Armaments (DCA). Chapter 13 of this book provides more information on
this topic. Below are just a few examples: • Information Exchange
Program (IEP) • 311, Exchange of Defense Personnel Between United States
and Friendly Foreign Countries • Test and Evaluation Program (TEP) •
Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program • Cooperative Research,
Development, and Acquisition Programs • Defense Trade • Cooperative
Logistics **[Humanitarian Assistance]{.underline}** Humanitarian
assistance consists of [a group of security cooperation programs
designed to improve DoD access, visibility, and influence in a partner
nation (PN) or region]{.underline} and to build the capacity of the PN
government while addressing a humanitarian need. Combatant commands
(CCMDs) may carry out activities funded by Overseas Humanitarian,
Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) across respective Unified Command Plan
(UCP) theaters, offering DoD another tool to promote regional stability
and security. Requests for OHDACA funds for any of these programs are
generally initiated by the in-country SCO. The CCMD then consolidates
and prioritizes before forwarding to DSCA for any required coordination
with DoS/USAID and the military departments. It should be noted that the
DoS has parallel programs generally managed by USAID in response to any
requests by the affected U.S. embassy responding to country
requirements. DoS and USAID annually receive even more funding for
overseas humanitarian, disaster, and migration assistance programs.
Below are just a few examples: • Center for Excellence in Disaster
Management & Humanitarian Assistance (CFE-DM) • Commander's Emergency
Response Program (CERP) • Excess Property as Humanitarian Relief •
Foreign Disaster Relief (FDR) • Humanitarian Assistance Transportation
Program (HATP) • Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) during Military
Operations • DoD Humanitarian Assistance (HA) • Humanitarian Daily
Rations (HDR) • Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) • Space-A Transport of
NGO Relief **[Education]{.underline}** There are many [security
cooperation programs that provide education opportunities to PN military
and civilian personnel]{.underline}. Training can take place in the
U.S., in the PN's country and in some cases in a third country. Training
can include professional military education, tactical training, and/or
technical skills training when they acquire new equipment from the U.S.
Below are just a few examples: "1206" Training of Security Forces and
Associated Security Ministries of Foreign Countries to Promote Respect
for the Rule of Law and Human Rights • 342, Regional Centers for
Security Studies (RCSS) • 345, Regional Defense Combating Terrorism and
Irregular Warfare Fellowship Program (CTIWFP) • 346, Distribution to
Certain Foreign Personnel of Education and Training Material and
Information Technology to Enhance Military Interoperability with the
Armed Forces • 347, International Engagement Authorities for Service
Academies • 348, Aviation Leadership Program (ALP) • Attendance at the
USCG Academy [Exercises]{.underline} Combined exercises are exercises
[between the U.S. forces and those of one or more
countries.]{.underline} It is common error to refer to these exercises
as multinational, coalition, or joint operations, but this is
doctrinally incorrect. It should be noted that the term "joint" refers
to two or more services, e.g., Army and Air Force. Exercises can be both
joint and combined, while most combined exercises are singleservice
combined exercises. The primary purpose of combined exercises is the
training of U.S. forces, emphasizing interoperability and capability
building, though the host nation also benefits from the training as
well. There are three types of exercises that may fall under this title:
• Field Training Exercises (FTX): These are the most realistic of
exercises, taking the form of actual forces in the field, thus allowing
all the moving parts to be tested. These are also the most resource
intensive in money, manpower, material, and preparation time. • Command
Post Exercises (CPX): An exercise in which the forces are simulated,
involving the commander, the staff, and communications/coordination
among the participating headquarters. • Table Top Exercises (TTX):
Tabletop exercises are the least resource-intensive of these three
types, ranging from a formal, detailed planning process to a simple
discussion. TTXs are excellent when senior leaders want to explore a
number for possible scenarios or possible futures. Below are just a few
examples of security cooperation exercise programs and related
activities: • "1251" Training for Eastern European National Security
Forces in the course of Multilateral Exercises • 321, Training with
Friendly Foreign Countries: Payment of Training and Exercise Expenses •
322, Special Operations Forces: Training with Friendly Foreign Forces •
Defense Health Program • Exercise-Related Construction (ERC) • Joint
Exercise Program **[Contacts]{.underline}** There can be some confusion
about the definition of contact events and/or Military-to-Military (M2M)
events. In the past, Section 168 of Title 10 provided authorization for
contact events and/or Mil-to-Mil events. However, part of NDAA 2017,
Section 168, was repealed, and these types of events are now authorized
under Chapter 16 of Title 10, specifically Subchapter II
Military-to-Military Engagements. One of the most important things to
remember is that [events conducted under this authority should not cross
into the training realm. They should be designed to enable defense and
military leaders to engage with partner countries for discussions,
exchanges of tactics, planning, and other purposes that encourage
democratic orientation of defense establishments and military forces of
other countries]{.underline}; but not training. Contacts are largely
conducted between U.S. military and civilian defense personnel and the
military and civilian defense personnel of a partner country but may
also include non-defense personnel of partner countries who play key
security roles. Events, normally, but not always, fall into one of these
categories: • Traveling contact teams • Familiarization visits •
Military liaison teams • Seminars and conferences held primarily in a
theater of operations • Distribution of publications primarily in a
theater of operations • Personnel expenses of DoD personnel as they
relate to above activities Below are just a few examples of the
authorities under which DoD conducts contact events: • 311, Exchange of
Defense Personnel between United States and Friendly Foreign Countries:
Authority • 312, Payment of Personnel Expenses Necessary for Theater
Security Cooperation • 342, Regional Centers for Security Studies (RCSS)
• 344, Participation in Multinational Military Centers of Excellence An
organization that might be involved in supporting contact events is the
National Guard, which is part of the Department of Defense State
Partnership Program (SPP), which is authorized under 10 USC 341 (Title
10, Chapter 16, subchapter V). More on this later in this chapter.
**[Exchanges]{.underline}** There are a variety of options for
conducting exchanges [of military and civilian defense personnel with
partner countries that may be used to develop familiarity with partner
country systems, processes, interoperability, and technical
expertise]{.underline}. There can be exchanges of civilian or military
personnel between DoD and ministries of defense. There can be exchanges
of military personnel between units of U.S. armed forces and foreign
armed forces. There can also be exchange of personnel on a nonreciprocal
basis. Below are just a few examples of the authorities under which DoD
conducts exchanges: • 311, Exchange of Defense Personnel Between United
States and Friendly Foreign Countries: Authority • Reciprocal, No-charge
Flight Training School • Reciprocal, No-charge Professional Military
Education (PME) Student Exchanges • Reciprocal, No-charge Unit Exchanges

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the
relevant policies, programs, or activities of any executive agency.
Complicating matters, though, Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance" that, in contrast to the
presidential policy definition, 130 encompasses DoS programs, but not
DoD or other executive agency programs. 131 In addition, [Congress has
defined "security cooperation" as DoD specific]{.underline}, 132 but it
has not defined "security assistance." [The DoD]{.underline} adheres to
the presidential policy definition and further [defines "security
cooperation" as]{.underline} all its [relationship building and foreign
partner development activities]{.underline}, including "security
assistance," which the DoD defines as a subset of security cooperation
that is funded and authorized by the DoS and administered by the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency. 133 [The DoS, on the other hand, uses the
term "security assistance]{.underline}" in a manner that contradicts the
DoD's definition, employing it to describe any DoS or DoD assistance to
foreign military or other security forces. 134

and Non-State Threats: A Call for an Integrated Strategy",
https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/46290/2005_08_Security_Cooperation_and_Non-State_Threats.pdf\]

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 The OSD SCG directs
that DOD Security Cooperation "will be integrated with other elements of
national power...in order to achieve national security, defense, and
foreign policy objectives."35 This formulation, while helpful, obscures
two key facts. First, [Security Cooperation]{.underline} includes
activities that by their very nature [involve the simultaneous
application of more than one element of national power]{.underline}.
Security Cooperation at a minimum requires the combination of diplomatic
relations, military assistance, military-to-military contacts, and
public diplomacy. In other words, Security Cooperation is itself an
application of at least three of the classic elements of national
power.36 Second, [DOD is not the only entity in the USG that interacts
with foreign governments to achieve the stated objectives:]{.underline}
relationships, capabilities, information and intelligence, and access.
[The Department of State, the Intelligence Community, and]{.underline}
to a lesser extent, [other departments]{.underline} and agencies,
[conduct activities aimed at the accomplishment of these
objectives,]{.underline} broadly understood. [There is,]{.underline}
however, [no common USG]{.underline}, or interagency,
[definition]{.underline} or concept of Security Cooperation.37 We will
return to this issue in the final section of this paper. For the
purposes of the present discussion, this paper offers the following
working definition of Security Cooperation[: Security Cooperation refers
to all USG assistance provided to foreign law enforcement, security, and
defense establishments in support of national defense, security, and
foreign policy objectives]{.underline}.38

### 1AR -- Counter Interp -- SC = Mil Acts

#### Security cooperation means developing military relations

**DSCA 2021**

\[Defense Security Cooperation Agency, "Security Cooperation
Management",
https://dscu.edu/documents/publications/ebooks/greenbook.aspx\]

The term security cooperation was first introduced in 1997 by the
Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). At that time, the Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day-to-day management
responsibilities of many security assistance programs authorized by the
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export Control Act (AECA).
The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain Department of Defense
(DoD)-funded international programs along with their personnel and
associated resources. In order for U.S. government (USG) agencies, the
private sector, and foreign governments to better understand DSAA's
enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security assistance (SA),
DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), effective 1 October 1998. In recent years, DSCA has absorbed
management responsibilities for many DoD international programs while
also leading the wider USG security cooperation enterprise. However,
many security cooperation programs continue to be managed by other
elements of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the combatant
commands (CCMDs), or the military departments (MILDEPs). Further
complicating the management of security cooperation was the in-country
point of contact between the USG and the host nation. This point of
contact was either the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)- sponsored
Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or the DSCA-sponsored Security Cooperation
Office (SCO). These two spigots of securiy cooperation within a country
required a broad knowledge and skill baseline of the very different
international programs that are initiated, funded, and managed
throughout the DoD, its agencies and the MILDEPs. Most disconnects
regarding SCO-DAO coordination of incountry security cooperation were
generally resolved with the establishment of the Senior Defense
Officials/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) having oversight over both the SCO
and DAO organizations. On 9 June [2004]{.underline} that [DoD published
a formal, yet]{.underline} still very [broad, definition of security
cooperation]{.underline} in Joint Pub 1-02: [All DoD interactions with
foreign defense establishments to build defense relationships that
promote specific U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly
military capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to a host
nation]{.underline}. DODD 5132.03, DoD Policy and Responsibilities
Relating to Security Cooperation, 29 December [2016]{.underline},
[further defines security cooperation]{.underline} with assigned
responsibilities: [All **DoD interactions** with foreign defense
establishments to **build defense relationships** that promote specific
U.S. security interests, **develop allied and partner nation military
and security capabilities** for self-defense and multinational
operations, **and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access** to allied and partner nations]{.underline}. This includes
DoDadministered security assistance programs. According to Title 10 U.S.
Code Section 301, the term "security cooperation programs and activities
of the Department of Defense" means any program, activity (including an
exercise), or interaction of the DoD with the security establishment of
a foreign country to achieve a purpose as follows: (A) To build and
develop allied and friendly security capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations. (B) To provide the armed forces with access to
the foreign country during peacetime or a contingency operation. (C) To
build relationships that promote specific United States security
interests. Other DoD policy statements identify DoD-managed or
administered security assistance programs as components of security
cooperation.

#### "Should" is mandatory

\[Judge Henry Nieto, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009 People v.
Munoz, 240 P.3d 311, Colo. Ct. App. 2009\]

[\"S**hould\" is \"used . . . to express duty,
obligation**]{.underline}, propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third
New International Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting
the word in various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions,
although **[the weight of authority appears to favor interpreting
\"should\" in an imperative, obligatory sense]{.underline}**. HN7A
number of courts, confronted with the question of whether using the word
\"should\" in jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth
Amendment protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have
upheld instructions using the word. **[In the courts of other
states]{.underline}** in which a defendant has argued that the word
\"should\" in the reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently
inform the jury that it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if
insufficient proof is submitted at trial, the courts have squarely
rejected the argument. They reasoned that **[the word \"conveys a sense
of duty and obligation and could not be misunderstood]{.underline}** by
a jury.\" See State v. McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan.
1995); see also Tyson v. State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92
(Ga. Ct. App. 1995) (finding argument that \"should\" is directional but
not instructional to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa.
Super. 477, 504 A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably,
**[courts interpreting the word \"should]{.underline}**\" in other types
of jury instructions \[\*\*16\] **[have]{.underline}** also **[found
that the word conveys]{.underline}** to the jury **[a sense of duty or

Ark. 859, 554 S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [**the Arkansas Supreme Court
interpreted the word \"**should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on
circumstantial evidence **[as synonymous with the word
\"must\"]{.underline}** and rejected the defendant\'s argument that the
jury may have been misled by the court\'s use of the word in the
instruction. Similarly, [**the Missouri Supreme Court rejected a
defendant\'s argument that the court erred by not using the word
\"**should\" in **an instruction**]{.underline} on witness credibility
**[which used the word \"must\" because the two words have the same
meaning]{.underline}**. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958).
\[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, **[the Arizona

In any event, we note that Faretta\'s use of the word \"should\" in
identifying warnings relevant to waivers of counsel itself cautions
against interpreting the quoted language as clear establishment of a
legal mandate. **[Although grammatically the word \"should\" is simply
the ]{.underline}****[past tense of \"shall,]{.underline}**\" see Oxford

Issues of Cricket Communications, Inc.," online:

AT&T also argues that Merger Commitment 7.4 only permits extension of
"any given" interconnection agreement for a single three year term. AT&T
Brief at 12. Specifically, AT&T asserts that because Cricket adopted the
interconnection agreement between Sprint and AT&T, which itself was
extended, Cricket is precluded from extending the term of its agreement
with AT&T. Id

This argument relies upon an inaccurate assumption: that the agreement
(contract) between Sprint and AT&T, and the agreement (contract) between
Cricket and AT&T, are one and the same. In other words, to accept AT&T's
argument the Commission must conclude that two separate contracts, i.e.
the interconnection between Sprint and AT&T in Kentucky ("Sprint
Kentucky Agreement") and the interconnection between Cricket and AT&T in
Kentucky ("Cricket Kentucky Agreement"), are one and the same. Upon this
unstated (and inaccurate) premise AT&T asserts that "***the ICA*** was
already extended"; id. at 14, and "***the ICA*** Cricket seeks to extend
was extended by Sprint . . . ."; id. at 15, and, finally, "Cricket
cannot extend ***the same ICA*** a second time . . . ." Id. (emphasis
added in all). Note that in the quoted portions of the AT&T brief (and
elsewhere) **[AT&T uses vague and imprecise language]{.underline}** when
referring to either the Sprint Kentucky Agreement, or the Cricket
Kentucky Agreement, i**[n hopes that the Commission will treat the two
contracts as]{.underline}** one and **[the same]{.underline}**. But it
would be a mistake to do so. The contract governing AT&T's duties and
obligations with Sprint is a legally distinct and separate contract from
that which governs AT&T's duties with Cricket. The Sprint Kentucky
Agreement was approved by the Commission in September of 2001 in Case
Number 2000-00480. The Cricket Kentucky Agreement was approved by the
Commission in September of 2008 in Case Number 2008-033 1. **[AT&T
ignores]{.underline}** the fact **[that these are two separate and
distinct contracts because it knows that the merger commitments apply to
*each* agreement]{.underline}** that an individual telecommunications
carrier has with AT&T. Notably, Merger Commitment 7.4 states that
"AT&T/BellSouth ILECs shall permit ***a requesting telecommunications
carrier*** to extend ***its*** current interconnection agreement . . . .
As written, **[the commitment allows any carrier to extend "*its*"
agreement]{.underline}**. Clearly, the use of the pronoun
**["its"]{.underline}** in this context **[is possessive]{.underline}**,
such that **[the term "its" means - *that* particular carrier's
agreement]{.underline}** with AT&T **[(and not any other carrier's
agreement]{.underline}**). Thus, the merger commitment applies to each
agreement that an individual carrier may have with AT&T. It necessarily
follows then, that Cricket's right to extend its agreement under Merger
Commitment 7.4 is separate and distinct right from another carrier's
right to extend its agreement with AT&T (or whether such agreement has
been extended).

We do not find any ambiguity in KRS 341.070(1). It is our opinion that
**[the key word in the statute is the word \'in,\' preceding the words
\'each of three calendar quarters\',]{.underline}** and if the word is
accorded its ordinary and common meaning, **[the statute does not
require simultaneous employment. According to Webster\'s]{.underline}**
New International **[Dictionary, the word \'in,\' used with relation to
a period of time, means \'during the course of.\']{.underline}** The
same meaning, expressed in another way, would be **[\'within the limits
or duration of.\']{.underline}** Employing this meaning, the statute
says that an employer is subject to the Act if, during the course of, or
within the limits or duration of each of three calendar quarters, he had
in covered employment four or more workers, to each of whom the required
amount of wages was paid. This clearly means that the employment need
not be simultaneous. **[Obviously, the word \'in\' does not mean
\'throughout\' or \'for the entire period of,\' because then there would
be no point in adding the requirement of the payment of a minimum of
\$50 in wages.]{.underline}** In these times, no worker employed for a
full calendar quarter would be paid less than \$50 in wages. The
appellant seeks to read into the statute the words \'at the same time,\'
following the words \'had in covered employment\'. There is no
justification for this, unless the word \'in\' means \'during any one
period of time in.\' [**We are not aware of any authority** **for
ascribing such a meaning to the word \'in\'**]{.underline}.

[artificial intelligence]{.underline} (AI), [the ability of a digital
computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly
associated with intelligent beings.]{.underline} The term is frequently
applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the
intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to
reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.
Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been
demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex
tasks---as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or
playing chess---with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing
advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as
yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or
in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some
programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and
professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial
intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse
as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting
recognition.

Biotechnology: What Does it Mean? The term biotechnology was used for
the first time by Karl Erkey, a Hungarian Engineer, in 1919. Was it the
start of biotechnology? The answer is no&&& Later on biotechnology was
defined by different scientists. As per one definition [biotechnology
is, "Application of the principles of engineering and biological science
to create new products from raw materials of biological origin, for
example, vaccines or food]{.underline}." Or in other words, it can also
be defined as[, "the use of living organism/s or their product/s to
modify or improve human health and human environment]{.underline}".
Apart from their beneficial applications, biotechnological principles
has potential for destruction too, the best example for this is
'bioterrorism'. Biotechnology from fiction, myth, and reality can be
simply understood by reading the novel and watching movie
"Frankenstein". In this science fiction, Frankenstein has created a
human life which became a monster, this monster became the reason for
the destruction of Frankenstein, the creator of human life.
Biotechnology: A Basic Requirement As we know, [the technological
application of biological material is considered as
biotechnology.]{.underline} If, we want to understand how it works, then
it is essential for us to know what is the starting point or material
for biotechnology. In general[, biotechnology uses either living
material or biological products to create new products for their use in
various]{.underline} pharmaceutical, medical, agricultural, and
environmental [applications]{.underline}, with the ultimate goal to
benefit humanity, for example, production of recombinant proteins,
resistant crops, vegetables, higher milk producing animals, and the list
is endless.
