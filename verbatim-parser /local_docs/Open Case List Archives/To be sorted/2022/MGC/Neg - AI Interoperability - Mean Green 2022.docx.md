For the regular person on the street, the term 'cyber war' is more
likely to bring to mind the 1983 movie "WarGames" and the [doomsday
articles]{.underline} that [appear regularly in the media about the
'cyber battlefield' and]{.underline} an [impending World War
III]{.underline}. This essay argues that [the threat of cyber war is
**exaggerated**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} although it can, by
definition, be stated that we are already in a state of cyber war, the
impact on states is **[negligible]{.underline}** compared to
conventional war domains.

The argument is presented in 3 steps. The first step is to define cyber
war and cyber weapons, referencing scholars and experts in the area of
conventional war and the cyber domain. The second step is to explore who
has been exaggerating the threat of cyber war and what their motivations
might be. The third is to explore the evidence and quantify the
probability and impact that cyberwar has had on states to date.

'Cyber war' is a term often used interchangeably in media with
cyber-crime, cyber-attacks, cyber-conflict and cyber-incidents, creating
confusion amongst the public and scholars alike. Clausewitz (1989, 75),
in his book, On War, defines war as 'an act of force to compel the enemy
to do our will'. Rid (2012, 7) on the other interprets Clausewitz use of
'force' as meaning 'violent' force. According to Rid, if an act is not
potentially violent, it is not an act of war. However, Stone (2013, 107)
describes 'cyber war' as a politically motivated act of force, not
necessarily lethal and not necessarily attributable. The definition by
Powers and Jablonski states more simply that cyber war is the
utilisation of digital networks for geopolitical purposes (Nocetti 2016,
464). Neither of the latter two definitions requires violence to qualify
as cyber war. Under these definitions, the Stuxnet cyber-incident in
2010 and the Estonia incident in 2007 would constitute an act of cyber
war, and as such we could say that nations have been at cyber war in the
past and are likely to continue to engage in cyber war in years to come.

For this essay, I will use Stones definition to argue that even though
states may engage in cyber war, the concept of cyber war is exaggerated.
It seems that [cyber war is **deliberately exaggerated** in the media
and by politicians for **financial** and **political**
gains]{.underline}. There are countless examples in the media and in
politics of the exaggeration of the threat of cyber war and the language
used plays a big factor in creating a sense of fear in the community.

The Four Corners report, Hacked, is a classic example where the
reporter, Andrew Fowler describes the current situation in Australia as
'... a secret war where the body count is climbing every day' (Fowler
2013). The documentary reveals nothing violent or lethal about cyber
incidents. The documentary is actually about hackers working from
locations overseas, having targeted key Federal Government departments
and major corporations in Australia.

In another example, NATO may be interpreted as exaggerating the threat
of Cyber War when they invited Charlie Millar to present at their
Conference for Cyber Conflict at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence in 2017. Millar is an independent security
evaluator, and his presentation was titled 'Kim Jong-il and me: How to
build a cyber army to attack the US'. He later presented similar content
at Def Con 2018. His presentation described the steps he would take to
mount a cyber war, including the types of people he would engage, how
much he would pay them, what his strategy would be and how much it would
cost in total.

Who stands to gain from the exaggeration and hype? Logically, [one group
would be those that gain financially from the sale of cyber protective
services and software]{.underline}. According to Valerino, 57% of
technical experts surveyed said that we are currently in a cyber arms
race and 43% said that the worst-case scenarios are inevitable
(Valeriano and Ryan 2015). Translate this into sales and Gartner
projects worldwide security spending will reach \$96 Billion in 2018, up
8 Percent from 2017 and to top \$113 billion by 2020 (Gartner 2017).

Additionally, [there may be **political motivations** to exaggerate the
threat of cyber war]{.underline}. Cyberspace is not well understood by
the general public and fear is natural. In the US's cyber security
debate, observers have noted there is a tendency for policymakers,
[military leaders, and media]{.underline}, among others, [to use
frightening 'cyber-doom scenarios' when making a case for action on
cyber security]{.underline} (Dunn 2008, 2).

There is some evidence to suggest that more recently in the political
arena; we may be maturing in our understanding of the real threat of
cyber war. The Tallinn Manual, an academic, non-binding study on how
international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare, was
written at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber
Defence Centre of Excellence. It was first published in 2013 with the
title 'The Tallinn Manual on the International Law of Cyber War'. In
2017, it was re-released with the revised title 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on
the International Law of Cyber Operations'. The change in title from
'war' to 'operations' signifies a more moderate use of language from
NATO and is an acknowledgement that cyber incidents generally fall below
the threshold at which International Law would declare them to be a
formal act of war. Experience over the 4 short years from 2013 to 2017
has demonstrated that cyber incidents tend to have a low-level impact on
the target state. As the book's authors put it 'the focus of the
original Manual was on the most severe cyber operations, those that
violate the prohibition of the use of force in international relations,
entitle states to exercise the right of self-defence, and/or occur
during armed conflict' while the new version 'adds a legal analysis of
the more common cyber incidents that states encounter on a day-to-day
basis and that fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed
conflict' (Leetaru 2017).

To get a better sense if cyber war is exaggerated, we must also consider
the probability of cyber war in the future. The probability of cyber war
should be weighed up against the probability of conventional war. Where
tensions are already high, for example, between North Korea and the US
or Russia and Estonia, I would argue that cyber war is more likely than
conventional war. This is due to factors including; cyber warfare is
less costly than conventional warfare, states are less rational in their
decision space in the cyber realm, states find cyber attribution very
difficult to achieve so attacks can be undertaken covertly and cyber war
is considered 'a challenge' and central to the hackers' ethos (Junio
2013, 128). Further, Sanger describes in his book, The Perfect Weapon,
cyber weapons (such as cyber vandalism, Distributed Denial of Service
(DDOS), intrusions and advanced persistent threat (APT)) as the 'perfect
weapons' for the following reasons;

They are cheap: When compared to Nuclear weapons, there are only a
handful of nations globally that can afford the technology to create a
nuclear weapon.

They are easily accessible: Unlike a Nuclear bomb that requires uranium,
a highly protected metal, in the production process, a cyber weapon can
be created with minimal investment and highly available IT
infrastructure.

They can be dialled-up or dialled-down relatively easily. A ballistic
missile, the force of the explosion cannot be adjusted as easily as a
DDOS attack. A DDOS attack can be adjusted to last an hour, a few days
or a few weeks.

They have a huge range in how they are used: Sabotage as with Stuxnet,
Espionage as with the Chinese industrial spying on the US, North Korea's
infiltration of Sony, the Iranians attack on Las Vegas Sands Corp.
casino operators.

The significant factor is that cyber weapons can and are being used
every day for discrete, [**low-level** cyber conflicts]{.underline} to
undermine and disrupt rivals, but historically it [has **not
progressed** to open conflict, nor has it **warranted** a **military
response**]{.underline} (Sanger 2018). [Additionally, massive cyber
operations would necessarily impact the civilian population and violate
the immunity of non-combatants. The conditions of war dictate that this
is **"taboo"** and to date, rival states have **shown restraint** in
their use of cyber weapons for this reason]{.underline} (Valeriano and
Ryan 2015). [It appears that the threat that cyber weapons represent to
national security is overstated and the threat of cyber war is
**overstated**]{.underline}.

[The US and]{.underline} likely [other **highly networked nations**
appear **reticent**]{.underline} about using cyber weapons for
significant cyber conflict [given their
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline}. Ironically, NSA programs such as PRISM
have made the US more of a target given the sheer volume of sensitive
information stored in one place. Regardless of US defences, there is no
way to make this information completely secure from intrusion, and as
such, the very act of storing the information makes them more
vulnerable.

Rid (2012) is among some academics who argue that [cyber
war]{.underline} has never and [will likely **never
eventuate**]{.underline}. The benefits of being on this side of the
debate mean that public funding can be allocated away from offensive
cyber security initiatives to other, potentially more important
initiatives, such as public health and housing. The government is
constantly under pressure to prioritise public spending and it is
imperative that they have realistic, accurate projections regarding the
risk of cyber war, the probability and the impact, to allow them to
focus spending on the most important areas.

\-- ECM

[The specter of cyber war is back]{.underline}. Not only does Russia's
massive military buildup along Ukraine's borders bring a growing risk of
the largest-scale military clash since World War II, but many analysts
stress the potential for destabilizing and devastating cyber-attacks in
its wake. Jason Healey predicts that if Russia invades, "the opening
salvo is likely to be with offensive cyber capabilities." William
Courtney and Peter A. Wilson from RAND warn of the "massive employment"
of cyber warfare tools to create "shock and awe causing Ukraine's
defenses or will to fight to collapse." Accordingly, the United States
and the United Kingdom have deployed cyber warfare teams to help Ukraine
defend against an impending strategic cyber strike against critical
infrastructure. [Some]{.underline} go further, [suggest]{.underline}ing
[that Russia may not need to use military force]{.underline} at all,
[because cyber strikes can]{.underline} "achieve much **[the same
effect]{.underline}** from across the border." [This assessment
is]{.underline} apparently [shared by]{.underline} policymakers working
on countering [the]{.underline} Russian threat to Ukraine, with an
(anonymous) senior [Biden administration]{.underline} official recently
stating as much.

These predictions suggest that cyber operations will provide significant
strategic advantages to Russia either as complements to military force,
or as standalone instruments --- or at least that policymakers and
commentators think that they will. Current [warnings of escalating cyber
warfare conjure deep-seated fears of cyber doom and the]{.underline}
recurring [specter of a]{.underline} "**[cyber Pearl
Harbor]{.underline}**" strategic surprise attack. In practice,
**[however]{.underline}**, **[cyber warfare has been a
failure]{.underline}**. Our [research shows]{.underline} **[that cyber
operations have remained irrelevant on the battlefield]{.underline}**,
while standalone operations to weaken Ukraine through election
interference, critical infrastructure sabotage, and economic disruption
largely failed to contribute to Russia's strategic goals of making
Ukraine abandon its pro-European Union and pro-NATO foreign policy.
Consequently, current fears of cyber warfare defy not only Russia's
track record in Ukraine, but also strategic logic. [Given that Russia's
cyber op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} **[have
failed]{.underline}** to produce significant strategic value to date,
**[why would we expect this to suddenly change now]{.underline}**? Or,
to put it more pointedly: If cyber operations offer such effective and
potent instruments, why did Russia go through the trouble (and costs) to
mobilize its troops? **[Current predictions of cyber onslaught do not
offer a persuasive answer]{.underline}**.

Giving in to these fears risks fighting phantom threats, playing into
Russia's hands by distracting from the need to counter its military
threat and sowing fear and confusion --- at least among Western
audiences. A level-headed analysis of the threat that distinguishes what
is theoretically possible from what is practically feasible is urgently
needed. Our [research suggests]{.underline} that, [contrary to
hysteria]{.underline}, [cyber op]{.underline}eration[s **will remain of
secondary importance**]{.underline} and at best provide marginal gains
to Russia.

\-- ECM

[Russia]{.underline} also [deploys cyberattacks as a]{.underline}
poignant warning or **[threat]{.underline}**, often to put more force
behind diplomatic actions.

For instance, [on April 8]{.underline}, 2022, while Ukrainian President
Zelensky gave an invited address to the Finnish Parliament, [the Finnish
foreign and defense ministries were hit by a distributed denial of
service attack]{.underline}. Finnish government systems were back up in
an hour, but given the circumstances, this cyberattack appears to have
been designed to signal Russia's displeasure with Finland's plans to
join NATO and its support of Ukraine. [This attack was presaged by
Russian diplomatic statements warning Finland of]{.underline}
"**[retaliatory steps" to joining NATO]{.underline}**. To date, it
remains the only significant cyberattack against Finland or Sweden as
they planned their applications to join the alliance. [This attack bears
similarities to other instances where Russia used
cyberattacks]{.underline} to emphasize diplomatic warnings.

Following the 2015 doping scandal that resulted in the Russian Olympic
team being banned from the Olympics through 2022, Russian military
intelligence launched a significant cyberattack against the Swedish
Sports Confederation while Sweden was issuing a bid to host the 2026
Winter Olympics. These cyberattacks were part of a "systematic campaign"
targeting FIFA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the United States
Anti-Doping Agency in furtherance of diplomatic goals rather than
military or societal disruption.

Three Distinct Uses of Cyberattacks

Russia uses cyberattacks in three different ways. First, it deploys
cyberattacks to prepare and facilitate military conflict by attacking
critical infrastructure such as government websites, IT servers, banks,
media outlets, and power plants. [As the]{.underline} Second [Ukraine
War shows]{.underline}, [Russia seeks to disrupt]{.underline} and
disable **[critical infrastructure to advance its military
goals]{.underline}**.

[Russia]{.underline} also deploys cyberattacks **[as part of a hybrid
war strategy]{.underline}** that substitutes for war. These attacks may
be persistent over longer periods of time. However, Russia deploys
cyberattacks in smaller quantities and often combined with other hybrid
or political war techniques, such as disinformation campaigns and civil
actions in targeted countries. **[In these instances]{.underline}**,
**[Russia does not]{.underline}** [appear to intend imminent military
action]{.underline}, but may seek to degrade defensive capabilities.

Cyberattacks may also be deployed as a more isolated threat signal and
complement to diplomatic warnings, when a country takes actions that
Russia interprets as unfriendly. For these purposes, [cyberattacks are
more frequently combined with traditional diplomacy]{.underline}.

**[2NC/1NR -- XT 2 & 3 No Escalation]{.underline}**

**Empirics prove -- You should subscribe a low risk to their advantage**

**Orenstein 6/7**/2022

Mitchell Orenstein is a Senior Fellow at FPRI's Eurasia Program and
Professor and Chair of Russian and Eastern European Studies at the
University of Pennsylvania, "Russia's Use of Cyberattacks: Lessons from
the Second Ukraine War",
<https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/06/russias-use-of-cyberattacks-lessons-from-the-second-ukraine-war/>
\-- ECM

**[The empirical record of cyber conflict]{.underline}**, however,
[suggests that what is feasible]{.underline} in practice
[is]{.underline} far more **[limited]{.underline}**. [Ukraine has been
a]{.underline} "giant [test lab]{.underline}" where Russia, one of the
world's foremost cyber powers, has experimented with cyber operations
for eight years. Yet [these op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}
**[have failed]{.underline}** [to produce significant strategic
value]{.underline} either as force complements or standalone tools.

The substitutability argument --- that states can or do substitute cyber
operations for the use of force --- has little empirical support since
Russia levied no major cyber operations against Ukraine in the runup to
the military escalation of the conflict in 2014. While it is possible
that we do not know about such operations given their veil of secrecy,
it is clear that any attempted but undetected cyber surprise strike
failed to produce any measurable effects.

Evidence supporting the complementarity perspective is similarly
sobering. One of us has examined the role of low-level disruptive cyber
operations in the military conflict and their relevance for battlefield
events (and outcomes). [Disruptive attacks can]{.underline} directly
[affect military op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} as they seek to
sabotage an opponent's ability to fight. For example, the Russia-backed
separatists in the Donbas and Luhansk regions used malware to retrieve
data from mobile devices on the locations of Ukrainian artillery troops,
facilitating better reconnaissance against these troops. Pro-Ukrainian
hackers hijacked CCTV cameras behind enemy lines to obtain intelligence
on the movement of Russian artillery in the separatist-controlled
territories.

Focusing on the period of the most intense fighting, between 2014 and
2016 --- the time when, if cyber tools are an effective complement to
armed force, Russia would have been most likely to use them --- we
applied a series of statistical tests to thousands of cyber and military
operations. **[The findings showed a strong, escalatory dynamic between
military operations by both sides but no significant correlation in
either direction between military and cyber operations]{.underline}**,
**[and no reciprocity between cyber
op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}**. This evidence demonstrates
that in one of the first armed conflicts where both sides used low-level
cyber operations extensively, digital operations unfolded independently
from the events on the ground and had no discernible effect on them.
Hence, in stark contrast to expectations about the force-multiplying
advantages of cyber operations, [these findings suggest hacking groups
faced considerable difficulties in responding to battlefield events,
much less shaping them]{.underline}.

**Limiting challenges mean no risk of cyber doom**

**Orenstein 6/7**/2022

\-- ECM

[Considering the underwhelming track record of cyber
warfare]{.underline} in Ukraine to date, **[there is little reason to
expect cyber doom of the kind]{.underline}** that some now predict. For
these warnings of a Russian cyber onslaught to become reality, cyber
operations would need to produce effects at a scope and scale that they
have previously failed to attain. Importantly, [current warnings fail to
make a persuasive case on why we should expect such a
transformation]{.underline}.

Rather, they rest on the implicit assumption that with the change in
strategic context, the role of cyber operations will change as well.
This comes out clearest in Maggie Miller's recent commentary suggesting
that [military escalation in Ukraine would finally herald "**a true
cyberwar**"]{.underline} where Russia could "take down the power grid"
or launch a disinformation campaign to undermine the government in Kyiv.
Dmitri Alperovitch offers a more level-headed analysis, underlining that
cyber operations alone will fall short of achieving Russia's goals.
However, he also suggests that they can complement force as an
"extension of warfare itself," disrupting command and control to provide
battlefield advantages, sabotaging critical infrastructure, and
undermining public trust in the government to "send a powerful signal
that resistance is futile." **[Yet]{.underline}**, as we have seen,
[Russia has]{.underline} attempted most of these objectives in the past
and has [failed. Even in a full-scale invasion]{.underline}, we have the
same aggressor, with the same hacking groups, with the same skill level
going after the same sets of possible targets. [Why would we expect
different]{.underline} results?

Changing the strategic context of deployment does not change the
mechanism of action that cyber operations rely upon to produce outcomes
--- and its intrinsic constraints. [Cyber
op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} [rely on a mechanism of
subversion]{.underline} that exploits vulnerabilities in adversary
systems to use them against the adversary. [This mechanism
holds]{.underline} great strategic promise but poses **[significant
operational challenges]{.underline}**. It requires creativity and
cunning to remotely manipulating complex systems that others designed
and operate without alerting the victim to one's presence. These
challenges produce an operational trilemma between the speed, intensity
of effects, and level of control that actors have over these effects.
This trilemma limits strategic value, since **[in most
circumstances]{.underline}** [cyber
op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} [will be **too slow, too weak, and
too volatile**]{.underline} [to contribute]{.underline} measurably [to
strategic goals]{.underline}. The constraining role of this trilemma is
evident across all five of Russia's disruptive cyber operations against
Ukraine thus far, underlining their relevance. Importantly, [**all
available** evidence indicates that]{.underline} these [intrinsic
constraints limit the strategic value of cyber operations]{.underline}
regardless of strategic contexts.

**No large-scale cyber-attacks or retaliation**

[The problem of perceptions and controlling escalation is not
new]{.underline}. In August 1914, the major European powers expected a
short and sharp "Third Balkan War." The troops were expected to be home
by Christmas. After the assassination of the Austrian archduke in June,
Austria-Hungary wanted to give Serbia a bloody nose, and Germany gave
its Austrian ally a blank check rather than see it humiliated. But when
the Kaiser returned from vacation at the end of July and discovered how
Austria had filled in the check, his efforts to de-escalate were too
late. Nonetheless, he expected to prevail and almost did.

Had the Kaiser, the Czar, and the Emperor known in August 1914 that a
little over four years later, all would lose their thrones and see their
realms dismembered, they would not have gone to war. Since 1945, nuclear
weapons have served as a crystal ball in which leaders can glimpse the
catastrophe implied by a major war. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in
1962, leaders learned the importance of de-escalation, arms-control
communication, and rules of the road to manage conflict.

Cyber technology, of course, lacks the clear devastating effects of
nuclear weapons, and that poses a different set of problems, because
there is no crystal ball. During the Cold War, the great powers avoided
direct engagement, but that is not true of cyber conflict. And yet [the
threat of cyber **Pearl Harbor**s has been **exaggerated**. Most cyber
conflicts occur **below the threshold** established by the rules of
armed conflict. They are **economic** and **political**, rather than
**lethal**. It is **not credible** to threaten a **nuclear
response**]{.underline} [to cyber theft]{.underline} of intellectual
property by China [or cyber meddling]{.underline} in elections by
Russia.

According to American doctrine, [deterrence is not limited to a cyber
response]{.underline} (though that is possible). [The US will respond to
cyberattacks across domains or sectors, with any weapons of its choice,
**proportional** to the damage that has been done. That can range from
**naming** and **shaming** to economic sanctions to kinetic
weapons]{.underline}. Earlier this year, a new doctrine of "persistent
engagement" was described as not only disrupting attacks, but also
helping to reinforce deterrence. But the technical overlap between
intrusion into networks to gather intelligence or disrupt attacks and to
carry out offensive operations often makes it difficult to distinguish
between escalation and de-escalation. Rather than relying on tacit
bargaining, as proponents of "persistent engagement" sometimes
emphasize, explicit communication may be necessary to limit escalation.

novel threats from cyberspace, a rising tide of refugees, resurgent

Washington needs clear thinking about its vital interests and foreign
policy priorities. Above all, a successful [[U.S. grand
strategy]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/grand-strategy)
must identify where the United States should be prepared to wage war,
and for what purposes. [For all the talk of how U.S. foreign policy and
the country\'s place in the world will never be the same after the
presidency of Donald Trump, the best strategic road map for the United
States is a familiar one. Realism-the hard-nosed approach to foreign
policy that guided the country throughout most of the twentieth century
and drove its rise to great power-remains the [best
option](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-06-14/realist-world).]{.underline}
[A quarter century ago, after the Cold War ended, foreign policy elites
abandoned realism in favor of an unrealistic grand strategy-liberal
hegemony-that has weakened the country and caused considerable harm at
home and abroad.]{.underline} To get back on track, [Washington should
return to the realism and restraint that served it so well in the past.
If Washington rediscovered realism, the United States would seek to
preserve the security and prosperity of the American people and to
protect the core value of liberty in the United States.]{.underline}
Policymakers would recognize the importance of military strength but
also take into account the country\'s favorable geographic position, and
they would counsel restraint in the use of force. [The United States
would embrace a strategy of \"offshore balancing\" and abstain from
crusades to remake the world in its image, concentrating instead on
maintaining the balance of power in a few key regions. Where possible,
Washington would encourage foreign powers to take on the primary burden
for their own defense, and it would commit to defend only those areas
where the United States has vital interests and where its power is still
essential.]{.underline} [Diplomacy would return to its rightful place,
and Americans would promote their values abroad primarily by
demonstrating democracy\'s virtues at home]{.underline}. IF IT AIN\'T
BROKE\... In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the United
States was weak, leaders from George Washington to William McKinley
mostly avoided foreign entanglements and concentrated on building power
domestically, expanding the country\'s reach across North America and
eventually expelling the European great powers from the Western
Hemisphere. In the first half of the twentieth century, U.S. presidents
such as Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt used the country\'s
newfound strength to restore the balance of power in strategically
critical regions outside the Western Hemisphere. But they let other
great powers do most of the heavy lifting, and thus the United States
emerged relatively unscathed-and stronger than ever-from the world wars
that devastated Asia and Europe. Letting other states shoulder the
burden was not possible during the Cold War, so the United States
stepped up and led the alliances that contained the Soviet Union.
American leaders paid lip service to democracy promotion, human rights,
and other idealistic concerns, but U.S. policy was [[realist at its
core]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-08-28/truth-about-liberal-order).
Through the Bretton Woods system and its successors, the United States
also helped foster a more open world economy, balancing economic growth
against the need for financial stability, national autonomy, and
domestic legitimacy. Put simply, for most of U.S. history, American
leaders were acutely sensitive to the balance of power, passed the buck
when they could, and took on difficult missions when necessary. But when
the Soviet Union collapsed and the United States found itself, as the
former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft put it in 1998,
\"standing alone at the height of power . . . with the rarest
opportunity to shape the world,\" U.S[. leaders rejected the realism
that had worked well for decades and tried to remake global politics in
accordance with American values. A new strategy-[liberal
hegemony](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-06-14/liberal-world)-sought
to spread democracy and open markets across the globe. That goal is the
common thread linking President Bill Clinton\'s policy of \"engagement
and enlargement]{.underline},\" President George W. Bush\'s \"freedom
agenda,\" and President Barack Obama\'s embrace of the Arab revolts of
2010-11 and his declaration that \"there is no right more fundamental
than the ability to choose your leaders and determine your destiny.\"
Such thinking won broad support from both political parties, the federal
bureaucracies that deal with international affairs, and most of the
think tanks, lobbies, and media figures that constitute the foreign
policy establishment. [At bottom, liberal hegemony is a highly
revisionist strategy. Instead of working to maintain favorable balances
of power in a few areas of vital interest, the United States sought to
transform regimes all over the world and recruit new members into the
economic and security institutions it dominated. The results were
dismal: failed wars, financial crises, staggering inequality, frayed
alliances, and emboldened adversaries.]{.underline} HEGEMONIC HUBRIS
When Clinton took office in 1993, the United States was on favorable
terms with the world\'s other major powers, including China and Russia.
Democracy was spreading, Iraq was being disarmed, and Iran had no
nuclear enrichment capacity. The Oslo Accords seemed to herald an end to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Washington seemed well positioned
to guide that process. [The European Union was adding new members and
moving toward a common currency, and the U.S. economy was performing
well. Americans saw terrorism as a minor problem, and the U.S. military
seemed unstoppable. The wind was at the country\'s back. Life was good.
But those circumstances fueled a dangerous overconfidence among American
elites.]{.underline} Convinced that the United States was \"the
indispensable nation,\" as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
famously put it in 1998, they believed they had the right, the
responsibility, and the wisdom to shape political arrangements in every
corner of the world. That vision turned out to be a hubristic fantasy.
Repeated attempts to broker peace between the Israelis and the
Palestinians all failed, and the two-state solution sought by three U.S.
presidents is no longer a viable option. [Al Qaeda attacked the U.S.
homeland on September 11, 2001, and Washington responded by launching a
global war on terrorism, including invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
Those campaigns were costly failures and shattered the U.S. military\'s
aura of invincibility. Much of the Middle East is now embroiled in
conflict, and violent extremists operate from Africa to Central Asia and
beyond. Meanwhile, India, Pakistan, and North Korea tested and deployed
nuclear weapons, and Iran become a latent nuclear weapons state. The
collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2008 exposed widespread
corruption in the country\'s financial institutions and triggered the
[worst economic
crisis](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-09-13/crisis-next-time)
since the Great Depression-a calamity from which the global economy has
yet to fully recover. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea]{.underline}, and it
has interfered in a number of other countries since then-and its
relations with the West are now worse than at any time since the Cold
War. [China\'s power and ambitions have expanded, and cooperation
between Beijing and Moscow has deepened. The eurozone crisis, the United
Kingdom\'s decision to withdraw from the EU, and energetic populist
movements have raised doubts about the EU\'s future. Democracy is in
retreat worldwide;]{.underline} according to Freedom House, 2018 was the
13th consecutive year in which global freedom declined. Illiberal
leaders govern in Hungary and Poland, and the Economist Intelligence
Unit\'s annual Democracy Index has downgraded the United States from a
\"full\" to a \"flawed\" democracy. [The United States was not solely
responsible for all these adverse developments, but it played a major
role in most of them. And the taproot of many of these failures was
Washington\'s embrace of liberal hegemony. For starters, that strategy
expanded U.S. security obligations without providing new resources with
which to meet them.]{.underline} The policy of \"dual containment,\"
aimed at Iran and Iraq, forced the United States to keep thousands of
troops on the Arabian Peninsula, an additional burden that also helped
convince Osama bin Laden to strike at the U.S. homeland. [NATO expansion
committed Washington to defend weak and vulnerable new members, even as
France, Germany, and the United Kingdom let their military forces
atrophy.]{.underline} Equally important, U.S. efforts to promote
democracy, the open-ended expansion of NATO, and the extension of the
alliance\'s mission far beyond its original parameters poisoned
relations with Russia. [And fear of U.S.-led regime change encouraged
several states to pursue a nuclear deterrent-in the case of North Korea,
successfully. When the United States did manage to topple a foreign foe,
as it did in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, the results were not thriving
new democracies but costly occupations, failed states, and hundreds of
thousands of dead civilians]{.underline}. It was delusional for U.S.
leaders to expect otherwise: creating a functional democracy is a
difficult process under the best of circumstances, but trying to do it
in fractured societies one barely understands is a fool\'s errand.
Finally, globalization [[did not
deliver]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-10-15/how-save-globalization)
as promised. Opening up markets to trade and investment brought great
benefits to lower and middle classes in China, India, and other parts of
the developing world. It also further magnified the already staggering
wealth of the world\'s richest one percent. But lower- and middle-class
incomes in the United States and Europe remained flat, jobs in some
sectors there fled abroad, and the global financial system became much
more fragile. This sorry record is why, in 2016, when Trump called U.S.
foreign policy \"a complete and total disaster\" and blamed out-of-touch
and unaccountable elites, many Americans nodded in agreement. They were
not isolationists; they simply wanted their government to stop trying to
run the world and pay more attention to problems at home. Trump\'s
predecessors seemed to have heard that message, at least when they were
running for office. In 1992, Clinton\'s mantra was \"It\'s the economy,
~~stupid~~.\" In 2000, Bush derided Clinton\'s efforts at \"nation
building\" and called for a foreign policy that was \"strong but
humble.\" Obama pledged to end foreign wars and focus on \"nation
building at home.\" [These expressions of restraint were understandable,
as surveys had repeatedly shown that a majority of Americans believed
the country was playing the role of global policeman more than it should
and doing more than its share to help others.]{.underline} According to
the Pew Research Center, in 2013, 80 percent of Americans agreed that
\"we should not think so much in international terms but concentrate
more on our own national problems and building up our strength and
prosperity here at home,\" and 83 percent wanted presidents to focus
more on domestic issues than on foreign policy. Clinton, Bush, and Obama
all understood what the American people wanted. But they failed to
deliver it. So has Trump. Although his Twitter feed and public
statements often question familiar orthodoxies, [the United States is
still defending wealthy NATO allies, still fighting in Afghanistan,
still chasing terrorists across Africa, still giving unconditional
support to the same problematic Middle Eastern clients, and still hoping
to topple a number of foreign regimes. Trump\'s style as president is
radically different from those of his predecessors, but the substance of
his policies is [surprisingly
similar](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/trump-traditionalist).
The result is the worst of both worlds: Washington is still pursuing a
misguided grand strategy, but now with an incompetent vulgarian in the
White House]{.underline}. REALISM IN PRACTICE [Four presidents have now
pursued a grand strategy built around the goal of American hegemony, and
all four have fared poorly.]{.underline} As the political scientist John
Mearsheimer and I have argued previously [[in these
pages]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/case-offshore-balancing),
it is time for the United States to return to its traditional approach
of offshore balancing. This strategy begins by recognizing that the
United States remains the most secure power in modern history. [It has
thousands of nuclear weapons and powerful conventional forces, and it
faces no serious rivals in the Western Hemisphere. The Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans still insulate the country from many threats, giving U.S.
leaders enormous latitude in choosing where and when to fight. In
addition to working to maintain U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere,
American policymakers have long sought to prevent other great powers
from imitating the United States by dominating their own
regions.]{.underline} A peer competitor with no serious rivals nearby
would be free to project power around the world-as Washington has for
decades. From an American perspective, it is better if the major powers
in Eurasia have to keep a wary eye on one another, making it harder for
them to interfere near American shores. The United States intervened in
the world wars to prevent Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and imperial
Japan from dominating Europe and Asia. This same principle inspired the
Cold War strategy of containment, although in that case, the United
States could not pass the buck and had to bear most of the costs itself.
[Today, there is no potential regional hegemon in Europe, whose states
should gradually take [full
responsibility](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-08-15/pay-europe)
for their own defense. The countries of the European Union are home to
more than 500 million people and boast a combined annual GDP exceeding
\$17 trillion, whereas Russia-the main external threat to EU states-has
a population of just 144 million and an annual GDP of only \$1.6
trillion.]{.underline} Moreover, NATO\'s European members together
annually spend more than three times what Russia does on defense. [The
idea that the EU (whose roster includes two nuclear-armed powers) lacks
the wherewithal to defend itself against a neighbor whose economy is
smaller than Italy\'s is risible. NATO still has ardent defenders on
both sides of the Atlantic, but they are living in the past. The
alliance played an invaluable role in containing the Soviet Union and
preventing the return of an aggressive, expansionist
Germany]{.underline}. But the Soviet Union is long gone, and Germany is
now a liberal democracy firmly committed to the status quo. NATO\'s
leaders have worked overtime to devise new missions since the Berlin
Wall came down, but the alliance\'s attempts at nation building in the
Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya have not gone well. Unless NATO\'s
European members decide to back a U.S.-led effort to balance against
China (and it is not clear that they will or should), it is time for the
United States to gradually disengage from NATO and turn European
security over to the Europeans by beginning a coordinated withdrawal of
U.S. military forces from Europe, allowing a European officer to serve
as NATO\'s supreme allied commander, and making it clear that the United
States will no longer be Europe\'s first line of defense. Washington
should take these steps not with rancor or resentment but with a sense
of accomplishment and a commitment to cooperate on issues on which
American and European interests align, such as climate change,
counterterrorism, and the management of the world economy. Washington
should also return to its traditional approach to the Middle East. To
ensure access to the energy supplies on which the world economy depends,
the United States has long sought to prevent any country from dominating
the oil-rich Persian Gulf. But until the late 1960s, it did so by
relying on the United Kingdom. After the British withdrew, Washington
relied on regional clients, such as Iran, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. U.S.
forces stayed offshore until January 1991, a few months after Saddam
Hussein, the leader of Iraq, seized Kuwait. In response, the George H.
W. Bush administration assembled a coalition of states that liberated
Kuwait, decimated Iraq\'s military, and restored balance to the region.
[Today, Washington\'s primary goal in the Middle East remains preventing
any country from impeding the flow of oil to world markets. The region
is now deeply divided along several dimensions, with no state in a
position to dominate.]{.underline} Moreover, the oil-producing states
depend on revenue from energy exports, which makes all of them eager to
sell. [Maintaining a regional balance of power should be relatively
easy, therefore, especially once the United States ends its
counterproductive efforts to remake local politics. U.S. forces in Iraq
and Syria would be withdrawn, although the United States might still
maintain intelligence-gathering facilities, prepositioned equipment, and
basing arrangements in the region as a hedge against the need to return
in the future.]{.underline} But as it did from 1945 to 1991, Washington
would count on local powers to maintain a regional balance of power in
accordance with their own interests. As an offshore balancer, the United
States would establish normal relations with all countries in the
region, instead of having \"special relationships\" with a few states
and profoundly hostile relations with others. No country in the Middle
East is so virtuous or vital that it deserves unconditional U.S.
support, and no country there is so heinous that it must be treated as a
pariah. The United States should act as China, India, Japan, Russia, and
the EU do, maintaining normal working relationships with all states in
the region-[[including
Iran]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2018-10-24/pompeos-dangerous-delusions).
Among other things, this policy would encourage rival regional powers to
compete for U.S. support, instead of taking it for granted. For the
moment, Washington should also make it clear that it will reduce its
support for local partners if they repeatedly act in ways that undermine
U.S. interests or that run contrary to core U.S. values. [Should any
state threaten to dominate the region from within or without in the
future, the United States would help the rest balance against it,
calibrating its level of effort and local presence to the magnitude of
the danger. With its relationships with Europe and the Middle East
right-sized and rationalized, an offshore-balancing United States could
focus primarily on the country that is its only potential peer
competitor and the world\'s only other would-be regional hegemon: China.
If China\'s power continues to grow, it is likely to press its neighbors
to distance themselves from Washington and accept China as the dominant
power in the Asia-Pacific.]{.underline} [Were China to become a regional
hegemon in Asia, it would be better positioned to project power around
the world and extend its influence into the Western Hemisphere. To
counter this possibility, the United States should maintain and deepen
its current security ties with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and
South Korea and continue to nurture its strategic partnerships with
India, Singapore, and Vietnam. Once the United States is no longer
subsidizing its wealthy European allies or squandering trillions of
dollars on costly quagmires in the greater Middle East, it can more
readily afford the military capabilities needed to balance
China.]{.underline} Maintaining an effective Asian coalition will not be
easy, however. Washington\'s Asian allies are separated from one another
by water and vast distances, and they are reluctant to jeopardize their
commercial ties with China. [The relationship between Japan and South
Korea has a troubled history that makes close cooperation difficult.
Local powers will be tempted to let Washington do most of the work, and
sophisticated U.S. leadership will be necessary to hold this coalition
together and ensure that each member contributes its fair
share.]{.underline} Trump\'s missteps-abandoning the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, starting trade disputes with Japan and South Korea, and
indulging in an amateurish flirtation with North Korea-have not helped.
OFFSHORE VENTURE Defenders of the status quo will no doubt
mischaracterize this course of action as a return to isolationism. That
is nonsense. [As an offshore balancer, the United States would be deeply
engaged diplomatically, economically, and, in some areas, militarily. It
would still possess the world\'s mightiest armed forces, even if it
spent somewhat less money on them. The United States would continue to
work with other countries to address major global issues such as climate
change, terrorism, and cyberthreats. But Washington would no longer
assume primary responsibility for defending wealthy allies that can
defend themselves, no longer subsidize client states whose actions
undermine U.S. interests, and no longer try to spread democracy via
regime change, covert action, or economic pressure.]{.underline}
Instead, [Washington would use its strength primarily to uphold the
balance of power in Asia-where a substantial U.S. presence is still
needed-and would devote more time, attention, and resources to restoring
the foundations of U.S. power at home.]{.underline} By setting an
example that others would once again admire and seek to emulate, an
offshore-balancing United States would also do a better job of promoting
the political values that Americans espouse. This approach would also
involve less reliance on force and coercion and a renewed emphasis on
diplomacy. [Military power would remain central to U.S. national
security, but its use would be as a last resort rather than a first
impulse. It is worth remembering that some of Washington\'s greatest
foreign policy achievements-the Marshall Plan, the Bretton Woods system,
the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and the peaceful reunification of
Germany-were diplomatic victories, not battlefield ones.]{.underline} In
recent years, however, both Democratic and Republican administrations
have tended to eschew genuine diplomacy and have relied instead on
ultimatums and pressure. Convinced they hold all the high cards, too
many U.S. officials have come to see even modest concessions to
opponents as tantamount to surrender. So they have tried to dictate
terms to others and have reached for sanctions or the sword when the
target state has refused to comply. But even weak states are reluctant
to submit to blackmail, and imposing one-sided agreements on others
makes them more likely to cheat or renege as soon as they can. For
diplomacy to work, both sides must get some of what they want.
[Moreover, offshore balancing requires a sophisticated understanding of
regional politics, which only knowledgeable diplomats and area
specialists can provide. In particular, creating an effective coalition
to check China\'s ambitions in Asia will be as much a diplomatic task as
a military mission, and success would depend on a deep bench of
officials who are intimately familiar with the history, languages,
cultures, and sensitivities of the region.]{.underline} A return to
offshore balancing should also be accompanied by a major effort to
rebuild and professionalize the U.S. diplomatic corps. Ambassadorships
should be reserved for qualified diplomats rather than VIPs or campaign
donors, and the State Department must develop, refine, and update its
diplomatic doctrine-the ways the United States can use noncoercive means
of influence-much as the armed services continually refine the military
doctrines that guide their conduct in war. The ranks of the Foreign
Service should be significantly increased, and as their careers advance,
career diplomats should receive the same opportunities for professional
education that senior military officers currently enjoy. OUT WITH THE
OLD Despite the disappointments of the past 25 years, the American
foreign policy elite remains convinced that global leadership is their
birthright and that Washington must continue trying to force other
countries to conform to U.S. dictates. This perspective is an article of
faith at almost every foreign policy think tank inside the Beltway and
is repeatedly invoked in task-force reports, policy briefs, and op-eds.
A similar groupthink pervades the U.S. media, where unrepentant
neoconservatives and unchastened liberal internationalists monopolize
the ranks of full-time pundits; proponents of realism, restraint, and
nonintervention appear sporadically at best. The result is that foreign
policy debates are heavily skewed in favor of endless intervention.
[Moving back to a more realist grand strategy will require broadening
the parameters of debate and challenging the entrenched interests that
have promoted and defended a failed foreign policy.]{.underline} The
clubbiness of the foreign policy establishment has also produced a
disturbing lack of accountability. Although the community contains many
dedicated, imaginative, and honorable individuals, it is dominated by a
highly networked caste of insiders who are reluctant to judge one
another lest they be judged themselves. As a result, error-prone
officials routinely fail upward and receive new opportunities to repeat
past mistakes. [Consider the officials responsible for (and the
commentators who cheered on) the bungled Middle East peace process, the
misguided expansion of NATO, the botched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,
the CIA\'s torture of detainees in the war on terrorism, the National
Security Agency\'s warrantless surveillance of Americans, the disastrous
NATO intervention in Libya, and the American machinations in Ukraine
that gave Russia a pretext to seize Crimea.]{.underline} None of those
officials or commentators has suffered significant professional
penalties for his or her mistakes or malfeasance. Indeed, nearly all of
them still enjoy prominent positions in government, think tanks, the
media, or academia. No one is infallible, of course, and a desire to
hold people accountable could be taken too far. Policymakers often learn
from past mistakes and become more effective over time. But when the
same people keep making the same errors and neither recognize nor regret
them, it is time to look for new people with better ideas. [Despite the
stagnation within the foreign policy establishment, the prospects for a
more realist, more restrained U.S. foreign policy are better today than
they have been in many years. For all his flaws, Trump has made it
easier to propose alternatives to liberal hegemony by expressing such
disdain for the elite consensus.]{.underline} Younger Americans are more
skeptical of their country\'s imperial pretensions than are their
elders, and some new members of Congress seem bent on clawing back some
of the control over foreign policy that presidents have amassed over the
past 70 years. [Furthermore, powerful structural forces are working
against liberal hegemony and in favor of offshore balancing. China\'s
rise and the partial revival of Russian power are forcing the United
States to pay closer attention to balance-of-power politics, especially
in Asia.]{.underline} The intractable problems of the Middle East will
make future presidents reluctant to squander more blood and treasure
there-especially in chasing the siren song of democracy promotion.
Pressure on the defense budget is unlikely to diminish, especially once
the costs of climate change begin to bite, and because trillions of
dollars\' worth of domestic needs cry out for attention. For these
reasons, the foreign policy elite will eventually rediscover the grand
strategy that helped build and sustain American power over most of the
nation\'s history. The precise path remains uncertain, and it will
probably take longer to get there than it should. But the destination is
clear.

**China will never match US hegemony -- but maintaining offensive
postures makes war from Chinese decline inevitable**

Michael, Tufts University; American Enterprise Institute, "Conditional
Convergence and the Rise of China: A Political Economy Approach to
Understanding Global Power Transitions", Journal of Global Security
Studies DB

[The conventional wisdom about current trends in the balance of power
relies heavily on power transition theory, which assumes that economic
convergence is an unconditional process in which poorer countries
inevitably catch up with richer countries]{.underline}.
**[Economists]{.underline}**, however, **[have shown that convergence is
rare and conditional on a set of geographic, institutional, and
demographic factors that, so far, have not been incorporated into major
theories of international change]{.underline}**. In this article, I have
discussed these factors and analyzed the growth prospects of the United
States and China in light of them. **[The results cast doubt on China's
ability to rival the United States as an economic and military
superpower]{.underline}**. The good news is that **[the world is
unlikely to experience a full-blown hegemonic rivalry anytime
soon]{.underline}**. This is an extraordinary development for global
security. [In the past five hundred years alone, there have been sixteen
hegemonic competitions in which a rising power challenged a ruling power
for top-dog status]{.underline}. [Twelve of them ended in catastrophic
wars, and even some of the peaceful cases were brutal cold wars that
inflicted tremendous harm]{.underline}. During the Cold War, for
example, the United States and the Soviet Union divided the globe into
rival blocs, waged proxy wars that killed millions of people, and
brought the world to the brink of nuclear Armageddon. [Today, by
contrast, the United States does not face a peer competitor, and the
world, though far from perfect, is more peaceful and prosperous than
ever before]{.underline}. The bad news is that **[China may become more
authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad as its economic growth
slows, and this shift may undermine global security in numerous
areas]{.underline}**. **[History suggests that when a rising power peaks
and starts to decline before its ambitions have been fulfilled, its
people tend to become disgruntled, and its leaders usually respond by
suppressing domestic dissent and demonizing foreign
adversaries]{.underline}**. [Russia]{.underline}, for example, [has
become more hostile, revanchist, and disruptive since the collapse in
world oil prices in the late 2000s gutted the Russian economy and
crimped President Vladimir Putin's popularity]{.underline}. [China seems
to be going down a similar path]{.underline}. Over the past decade,
[China's economic growth rates have been cut in half, and the Chinese
government has responded by massively expanding its internal security
system, exporting parts of that system to other countries, waging
information warfare on democratic countries, promoting "internet
sovereignty," flouting international trade rules, and ramping up its
military presence on and around disputed features in the East and South
China Seas in flagrant violation of international law]{.underline}.
These actions may be just a preview of what is to come in the years
ahead, as the economic, geographic, and demographic problems highlighted
above grow worse. Trade disputes and territorial conflicts are only the
most obvious risks posed by a stagnating and recalcitrant China. Less
obvious are transnational problems, such as climate change and disease,
which may fester without Chinese cooperation. [Avoiding this fate
requires other countries, and especially the United States, to handle
China with a blend of reassurance and deterrence]{.underline}.
**[Unfortunately, the widespread view that China is an emerging
superpower has caused the United States to abandon engagement in favor
of unbridled competition]{.underline}**. In just the past few years, the
United States has labeled China a rival, imposed steep tariffs on
Chinese goods and severe restrictions on Chinese investment and
immigration, **[inserted US forces into East Asian territorial
disputes]{.underline}**, and made plans to hit China early and hard in
the event of war. **[This competition has not only increased the risk of
US--China conflict but also threatened global security by hamstringing
the World Trade Organization and effectively killing the Paris Climate
Accord and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty]{.underline}**. Thus,
**[the stage has been set for tragic conflict: China is becoming more
recalcitrant as it suffers slowing growth, while the United States,
consumed by false prophecies of China's inexorable rise, is becoming
more confrontational]{.underline}**. **[The main threat to global
security, therefore, is not a US-China power transition driven by
economic convergence but divergence in US and Chinese perceptions about
the long-term trends in the balance of power]{.underline}**. **[China
may not be able to stem its growth slowdown, but Americans can take note
of it and recalibrate US policy accordingly]{.underline}**.

At the same time, [the first two-and-a-half decades of our unipolar
system have been anything but peaceful in what concerns U.S, involvement
in interstate conflict. U.S. forces have been employed in four
interstate wars]{.underline} -- Kuwait (1991), Kosovo (1999),
Afghanistan (2001-), and Iraq (2oo3-2011) -- [in addition to many
smaller interventions]{.underline} including Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia, and

the Cold War]{.underline}, In fact, [the first two-and-a-half decades of

history [account for more than 30 percent of the nation\'s total

Table 5 presents a list of great powers divided into three periods: from
1816 to 1945, multipolarity; from 1946 to 1989, bipolarity; and
unipolarity since 1990.9 Table 6 then presents summary data about the
incidence of war during each of these periods. [Unipolarity is by far
**the most conflict prone of all systems** according to]{.underline} two
important criteria: [the percentage of years that great powers spend at
war and the incidence of war involving great powers]{.underline}. In
multipolarity, 18 percent of great-power years were spent at war versus
16 percent in bipolarity. [In unipolarity]{.underline}, in contrast, a
remarkable [**64 percent** of great-power years have been]{.underline}
until now [spent at war]{.underline} -- by far [the **highest**
percentage **in all systems**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [during
multipolarity and bipolarity the probability that war]{.underline}
involving a great power [would, break out in any given year
was]{.underline}, respectively, [4.2 percent and 3.4 percent. Under
unipolarity, it is]{.underline} 16.o percent -- or around **[four times
higher]{.underline}**.

[It might be argued that the higher number of years]{.underline} that
great powers spent at war under unipolarity [are]{.underline} merely
[the result of]{.underline} the long, grinding, and unforeseen
[occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline} by U.S. forces.11 [But
even if these two wars had gone according to]{.underline} U.S.
[plans]{.underline} -- if the Afghanistan War had ended in the spring of
2002 and the Iraq War in the summer of 2003 -- [unipolarity would still
be particularly **prone to great-power involvement in
war**]{.underline}. [Even if the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [had not occupied either Afghanistan or Iraq, it
would]{.underline} still [have spent 16.0 percent of the post-Cold War
years at war]{.underline}, which is about the same as the respective
percentages for bipolar and multipolar systems. [In other words, even if
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had refrained from any
military occupations, the frequency of its use of military force in
major operations]{.underline} would still [give us **no reason to
believe that unipolarity is any more peaceful** than any
other]{.underline} past configuration of the [international
system.]{.underline}

As things turned out in both Afghanistan and Iraq, [the last
two-and-a-half decades saw a sharp increase in]{.underline} both [the
incidence of conflict and]{.underline} the [percentage of]{.underline}
great-power [years spent at war.]{.underline} This is a particularly
puzzling finding given that the current unipole -- the United States --
is a democracy in a world populated by more democracies than at any time
in the past. In light of arguments about how democracies are better able
to solve disputes peacefully, choose to engage only in those wars they
can win, and tend to fight shorter wars, the United States should have
spent fewer years at war than previous nondemocratic great powers.12

[As we can see, post-Cold War history can be used in support
of]{.underline} both [the]{.underline} widespread [claim]{.underline}
that the overall level of conflict has declined and of the claim [that
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has experienced an
**unprecedented level of involvement in interstate war**]{.underline}.
[Reality seems to be chafing against the view that unipolarity produces
no incentives for conflict]{.underline}; at least in what concerns the
unipole\'s involvement in interstate wars, [the past two-and-a-half
decades]{.underline} seem to [point in the opposite
direction.]{.underline}

**[2NC/1NR -- Unipolarity Bad]{.underline}**

**Heg doesn't solve stability \-- empirical analysis proves it
destabilizes the world and multipolar systems aren't worse.**

**Cambanis 12** \[Thanassis - Fellow at The Century Foundation and
Professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public
Affairs "The lonely superpower,"
http://bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/01/22/the-lonely-superpower/FRkSf1s5n9lXku4VqvEtqJ/story.html\]

Now, however, with a few decades of experience to study, a young
international relations theorist at Yale University has proposed a
provocative new view: [American dominance has destabilized the world in
new ways, and the United States is no better off in the wake of the Cold
War]{.underline}. In fact, he says, [a world with a single superpower
and a crowded second tier of distant competitors encourages, rather than
discourages, violent conflict\--not just among the also-rans, but even
involving the single great power itself.]{.underline} In a paper that
appeared in the most recent issue of the influential journal
International Security, political scientist Nuno P. Monteiro lays out
his case. [America]{.underline}, he points out, [has been at war for 13
of the 22 years since the end of the Cold War, about double the
proportion of time it spent at war during the previous two
centuries]{.underline}. "I'm trying to debunk the idea that a world with
one great power is better," he said in an interview. "If you don't have
one problem, you have another." Sure, Monteiro says, the risk of
apocalyptic war has decreased, since there's no military equal to
America's that could engage it in mutually assured destruction. But, he
argues, the lethal, expensive wars in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, and
Afghanistan have proved a major drain on the country. Even worse,
Monteiro claims, [America's position as a dominant power, unbalanced by
any other alpha states actually exacerbates dangerous tensions rather
than relieving them]{.underline}. Prickly states that Monteiro calls
["recalcitrant minor powers" (think Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan),
whose interests or regime types clash with the lone superpower, will
have an incentive to provoke a conflict. Even if they are likely to
lose, the fight may be worth it, since concession will mean defeat as
well. This is the logic by which North Korea and Pakistan both acquired
nuclear weapons, even during the era of American global dominance, and
by which Iraq and Afghanistan preferred to fight rather than surrender
to invading Americans.]{.underline} Of course, few Americans long for
the old days of an arms race, possible nuclear war, and the threat of
Soviet troops and missiles pointed at America and its allies. Fans of
unipolarity in the foreign policy world think that the advantages of
being the sole superpower far outweigh the drawbacks \-- a few regional
conflicts and insurgencies are a fair price to pay for eliminating the
threat of global war. But Monteiro says that [critics exaggerate the
distinctions between the wars of today and yesteryear]{.underline}, and
many top thinkers in the world of security policy are finding his
argument persuasive. If he's right, it means that the most optimistic
version of the post-Cold War era \-- [a "pax Americana"]{.underline} in
which the surviving superpower can genuinely enjoy its ascendancy \--
[was always illusory. In the short term, a dominant United States should
expect an endless slate of violent challenges from weak
powers]{.underline}. And [in the longer term, it means that Washington
shouldn't worry too much about rising powers]{.underline} like China or
Russia or the European Union; [America might]{.underline} even [be
better off with a rival powerful enough to provide a
balance]{.underline}. You could call it the curse of plenty: [Too much
power attracts countless challenges, whereas a world in which power is
split among several superstates might just offer a paradoxical
stability. From the 1700s until the end of World War II in 1945, an
array of superpowers competed for global influence in a multipolar
world, including imperial Germany and Japan, Russia, Great Britain, and
after a time, the United States. The world was an unstable place, prone
to wars minor and major. The Cold War era]{.underline} was far more
stable, with only two pretenders to global power. It [was]{.underline},
however, [an age of anxiety. The threat of nuclear Armageddon hung over
the world]{.underline}. Showdowns in Berlin and Cuba brought America and
the Soviet Union to the brink, and the threat of nuclear escalation hung
over every other superpower crisis. Generations of Americans and Soviets
grew up practicing survival drills; for them, the nightmare scenario of
thermonuclear winter was frighteningly plausible. [It was also an age of
violent regional conflicts.]{.underline} Conflagrations in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America spiraled into drawn out, lethal wars, with the
superpowers investing in local proxies (think of Angola and Nicaragua as
well as Korea and Vietnam). On the one hand, superpower involvement
often made local conflicts far deadlier and longer than they would have
been otherwise. On the other, the balance between the United States and
the USSR reduced the likelihood of world war and kept the fighting below
the nuclear threshold. By tacit understanding, the two powers had an
interest in keeping such conflicts contained. When the Soviet Union
began its collapse in 1989, the United States was the last man standing,
wielding a level of global dominance that had been unknown before in
modern history. Policy makers and thinkers almost universally agreed
that dominance would be a good thing, at least for America: It removed
the threat of superpower war, and lesser powers would presumably choose
to concede to American desires rather than provoke a regional war they
were bound to lose. That is what the 1991 Gulf War was about:
establishing the new rules of a unipolar world. Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait, Monteiro believes, because he miscalculated what the United
States was willing to accept. After meeting Saddam with overwhelming
force, America expected that the rest of the world would capitulate to
its demands with much less fuss. [Monteiro compared the conflicts of the
multipolar 18th century to those of the Cold War and current unipolar
moment]{.underline}. What he found is [that the unipolar world isn't
necessarily better than what preceded it,]{.underline} either [for the
United States or for the rest of the world. It might even be
worse.]{.underline} ["Uncertainty increases in
unipolarity,"]{.underline} Monteiro says. ["If another great power were
around, we wouldn't be able to get involved in all these wars." In the
unipolar period, a growing class of minor powers has provoked the United
States, willing to engage in brinkmanship up to and including violent
conflict. Look no further than Iran's recent threats to close the Strait
of Hormuz]{.underline} to oil shipping and to strike the American Navy.
Naturally, Iran wouldn't be able to win such a showdown. But Iran knows
well that the United States wants to avoid the significant costs of a
war, and might back down in a confrontation, thereby rewarding Iran's
aggressive gambits. And if [(or once) Iran crosses the nuclear
threshold, it will have an even greater capacity to deter the United
States]{.underline}. During the Cold War, on the other hand, regional
powers tended to rely on their patron's nuclear umbrella rather than
seeking nukes of their own, and would have had no incentive to defy the
United States by developing them. [Absent a rival superpower to check
its reach, the United States has felt unrestrained, and at times even
obligated, to intervene as a global police officer or arbiter of
international norms against crimes such as genocide]{.underline}. [Time
and again in the post-Cold War age, minor countries that were supposed
to meekly fall in line with American imperatives instead defied them,
drawing America into conflicts in the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti, Iraq, and
Afghanistan]{.underline}. This wasn't what was supposed to happen: [The
world was supposed to be much safer for a unipolar superpower, not more
costly and hazardous.]{.underline}

[Liberal hegemony is an ambitious strategy in which a state aims to turn
as many countries as possible into liberal democracies like itself while
also promoting an open international economy and building international
institutions]{.underline}. In essence, **[the liberal state seeks to
spread its own values far and wide]{.underline}**. My goal in this book
is to describe what happens when a powerful state pursues this strategy
at the expense of balance-of-power politics. [Many in the West,
especially among foreign policy elites, consider liberal hegemony a wise
policy that states should axiomatically adopt]{.underline}. Spreading
liberal democracy around the world is said to make eminently good sense
from both a moral and a strategic perspective. For starters, it is
thought to be an excellent way to protect human rights, which are
sometimes seriously violated by authoritarian states. And because the
policy holds that liberal democracies do not want to go to war with each
other, it ultimately provides a formula for transcending realism and
fostering international peace. Finally, proponents claim it helps
protect liberalism at home by eliminating authoritarian states that
otherwise might aid the illiberal forces that are constantly present
inside the liberal state. **[This conventional wisdom is
wrong]{.underline}**. **[Great powers are rarely in a position to pursue
a full-scale liberal foreign policy]{.underline}**. **[As long as two or
more of them exist on the planet, they have little choice but to pay
close attention to their position in the global balance of power and act
according to the dictates of realism]{.underline}**. [Great powers of
all persuasions care deeply about their survival, and there is always
the danger in a bipolar or multipolar system that they will be attacked
by another great power]{.underline}. In these circumstances, [liberal
great powers regularly dress up their hard-nosed behavior with liberal
rhetoric]{.underline}. **[They talk like liberals and act like
realists]{.underline}**. [Should they adopt liberal policies that are at
odds with realist logic, they invariably come to regret it]{.underline}.
But occasionally a liberal democracy encounters such a favorable balance
of power that it is able to embrace liberal hegemony. That situation is
most likely to arise in a unipolar world, where the single great power
does not have to worry about being attacked by another great power since
there is none. Then the liberal sole pole will almost always abandon
realism and adopt a liberal foreign policy. Liberal states have a
crusader mentality hard-wired into them that is hard to restrain.
[Because liberalism prizes the concept of inalienable or natural rights,
committed liberals are deeply concerned about the rights of virtually
every individual on the planet]{.underline}. **[This universalist logic
creates a powerful incentive for liberal states to get involved in the
affairs of countries that seriously violate their citizens'
rights]{.underline}**. To take this a step further, the best way to
ensure that the rights of foreigners are not trampled is for them to
live in a liberal democracy. **[This logic leads straight to an active
policy of regime change, where the goal is to topple autocrats and put
liberal democracies in their place]{.underline}**. [Liberals do not shy
from this task, mainly because they often have great faith in their
state's ability to do social engineering both at home and
abroad]{.underline}. Creating a world populated by liberal democracies
is also thought to be a formula for international peace, which would not
just eliminate war but greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the twin
scourges of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. And lastly, it is an
ideal way of protecting liberalism at home. [This enthusiasm
notwithstanding, **liberal hegemony will not achieve its goals, and its
failure will inevitably come with huge costs**]{.underline}. [The
liberal state is likely to end up fighting endless wars, which will
increase rather than reduce the level of conflict in international
politics and thus aggravate the problems of proliferation and
terrorism]{.underline}. Moreover, [the state's militaristic behavior is
almost certain to end up threatening its own liberal
values]{.underline}. **[Liberalism abroad leads to illiberalism at
home]{.underline}**. Finally, **[even if the liberal state were to
achieve its aims---spreading democracy near and far, fostering economic
intercourse, and creating international institutions---they would not
produce peace]{.underline}**. The key to understanding liberalism's
limits is to recognize its relationship with nationalism and realism.
This book is ultimately all about these three isms and how they interact
to affect international politics. [Nationalism is an enormously powerful
political ideology]{.underline}. It revolves around the division of the
world into a wide variety of nations, which are formidable social units,
each with a distinct culture. Virtually every nation would prefer to
have its own state, although not all can. Still, [we live in a world
populated almost exclusively by nation-states, which means that
liberalism must coexist with nationalism]{.underline}. Liberal states
are also nationstates. [There is no question that liberalism and
nationalism can coexist, but when they clash, nationalism almost always
wins]{.underline}. [The influence of nationalism often undercuts a
liberal foreign policy]{.underline}. For example, **[nationalism places
great emphasis on self-determination, which means that most countries
will resist a liberal great power's efforts to interfere in their
domestic politics---which, of course, is what liberal hegemony is all
about]{.underline}**. These two isms also clash over individual rights.
Liberals believe everyone has the same rights, regardless of which
country they call home. Nationalism is a particularist ideology from top
to bottom, which means it does not treat rights as inalienable. In
practice, the vast majority of people around the globe do not care
greatly about the rights of individuals in other countries. They are
much more concerned about their fellow citizens' rights, and even that
commitment has limits. Liberalism oversells the importance of individual
rights. **[Liberalism is also no match for realism]{.underline}**. At
its core, [liberalism assumes that the individuals who make up any
society sometimes have profound differences about what constitutes the
good life, and these differences might lead them to try to kill each
other]{.underline}. [Thus a state is needed to keep the
peace]{.underline}. But **[there is no world state to keep countries at
bay when they have profound disagreements]{.underline}**. **[The
structure of the international system is anarchic, not hierarchic, which
means that liberalism applied to international politics cannot
work]{.underline}**. [Countries thus have little choice but to act
according to balance-of-power logic if they hope to
survive]{.underline}. There are special cases, however, where a country
is so secure that it can take a break from realpolitik and pursue truly
liberal policies. The results are almost always bad, largely because
nationalism thwarts the liberal crusader. My argument, stated briefly,
is that [nationalism and realism almost always trump
liberalism]{.underline}. Our world has been shaped in good part by those
two powerful isms, not by liberalism. [Consider that five hundred years
ago the political universe was remarkably heterogeneous; it included
city-states, duchies, empires, principalities, and assorted other
political forms]{.underline}. [That world has given way to **a globe
populated almost exclusively by nation states**]{.underline}. Although
many factors caused this great transformation, two of **[the main
driving forces behind the modern state system were nationalism and
balance-of-power politics]{.underline}**. The American Embrace of
Liberal Hegemony This book is also motivated by a desire to understand
recent American foreign policy. The United States is a deeply liberal
country that emerged from the Cold War as by far the most powerful state
in the international system. 1 The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991
left it in an ideal position to pursue liberal hegemony. 2 The American
foreign policy establishment em braced that ambitious policy with little
hesitation, and with abundant optimism about the future of the United
States and the world. At least at first, the broader public shared this
enthusiasm. The zeitgeist was captured in Francis Fukuyama's famous
article, "The End of History?," published just as the Cold War was
coming to a close. 3 Liberalism, he argued, defeated fascism in the
first half of the twentieth century and communism in the second half,
and now there was no viable alternative left standing. The world would
eventually be entirely populated by liberal democracies. According to
Fukuyama, these nations would have virtually no meaningful disputes, and
wars between great powers would cease. The biggest problem confronting
people in this new world, he suggested, might be boredom. [It was also
widely believed at the time that the spread of liberalism would
ultimately bring an end to balance-of-power politics]{.underline}. The
harsh security competition that has long characterized great-power
relations would disappear, and realism, long the dominant intellectual
paradigm in international relations, would land on the scrap heap of
history. "In a world where freedom, not tyranny, is on the march," Bill
Clinton proclaimed while campaigning for the White House in 1992, "the
cynical calculus of pure power politics simply does not compute. It is
ill-suited to a new era in which ideas and information are broadcast
around the globe before ambassadors can read their cables." [Probably no
recent president embraced the mission of spreading liberalism more
enthusiastically than George W. Bush, who said in a speech in March
2003, two weeks before the invasion of Iraq]{.underline}: "[The current
Iraqi regime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord and
violence in the Middle East]{.underline}. [A liberated Iraq can show the
power of freedom to transform that vital region, by bringing hope and
progress into the lives of millions]{.underline}. America's interests in
security, and America's belief in liberty, both lead in the same
direction: to a free and peaceful Iraq." Later that year, on September
6, he proclaimed: "The advance of freedom is the calling of our time; it
is the calling of our country. From the Fourteen Points to the Four
Freedoms, to the Speech at Westminster, America has put our power at the
service of principle. We believe that liberty is the design of nature;
we believe that liberty is the direction of history. We believe that
human fulfillment and excellence come in the responsible exercise of
liberty. And we believe that freedom---the freedom we prize---is not for
us alone, it is the right and the capacity of all mankind." Something
went badly wrong. **[Most people's view of U.S. foreign policy today, in
2018, is starkly different from what it was in 2003, much less the early
1990s]{.underline}**. **[Pessimism, not optimism, dominates most
assessments of America's accomplishments during its holiday from
realism]{.underline}**. [Under Presidents Bush and Barack Obama,
Washington has played a key role in sowing death and destruction across
the greater Middle East, and there is little evidence the mayhem will
end anytime soon]{.underline}. American policy toward Ukraine, motivated
by liberal logic, is principally responsible for the ongoing crisis
between Russia and the West. [The United States has been at war for two
out of every three years since 1989, fighting seven different
wars]{.underline}. We should not be surprised by this. Contrary to the
prevailing wisdom in the West, a **[liberal foreign policy is not a
formula for cooperation and peace but for instability and
conflict]{.underline}**. In this book I focus on [the period between
1993 and 2017, when the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations, each
in control of American foreign policy for eight years, were fully
committed to pursuing liberal hegemony]{.underline}. Although President
Obama had some reservations about that policy, they mattered little for
how his administration actually acted abroad. I do not consider the
Trump administration for two reasons. First, as I was finishing this
book it was difficult to determine what President
**[Trump]{.underline}**'s foreign policy would look like, although it is
clear from his rhetoric during the 2016 campaign that he **[recognizes
that liberal hegemony has been an abject failure and would like to
abandon key elements of that strategy]{.underline}**. Second, **[there
is good reason to think that with the rise of China and the resurrection
of Russian power having put great power politics back on the table,
Trump eventually will have no choice but to move toward a grand strategy
based on realism, even if doing so meets with considerable resistance at
home]{.underline}**.

School, "The New Spheres of Influence: Sharing the Globe With Other
Great Powers.", Foreign Affairs, Vol. 99, Iss. 2 DB

COME HOME, AMERICA? In the heady aftermath of the Cold War, American
policymakers pronounced one of the fundamental concepts of geopolitics
obsolete. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described a new world \"in
which great power is defined not by spheres of influence ... or the
strong imposing their will on the weak.\" Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton declared that \"the United States does not recognize spheres of
influence.\" Secretary of State John Kerry proclaimed that \"the era of
the Monroe Doctrine is over,\" ending almost two centuries of the United
States staking claim to its own sphere of influence in the Western
Hemisphere. Such pronouncements were right in that something about
geopolitics had changed. But they were wrong about what exactly it was.
U.S. policymakers had ceased to recognize spheres of influence\--the
ability of other powers to demand deference from other states in their
own regions or exert predominant control there\--not because the concept
had become obsolete. Rather, **[the entire world had become a de facto
American sphere]{.underline}**. Spheres of influence had given way to a
sphere of influence. The strong still imposed their will on the weak;
the rest of the world was compelled to play largely by American rules,
or else face a steep price, from crippling sanctions to outright regime
change. **[Spheres of influence hadn\'t gone away; they had been
collapsed into one, by the overwhelming fact of U.S.
hegemony]{.underline}**. **[Now, however, that hegemony is fading, and
Washington has awakened to what it calls \"a new era of great-power
competition,\" with China and Russia increasingly using their power to
assert interests and values that often conflict with those of the United
States]{.underline}**. **[But American policymakers and analysts are
still struggling to come to grips with what this new era means for the
U.S. role in the world]{.underline}**. **[Going forward, that role will
not only be different; it will also be significantly
diminished]{.underline}**. While leaders will continue announcing grand
ambitions, diminished means will mean diminished results. **[Unipolarity
is over, and with it the illusion that other nations would simply take
their assigned place in a U.S.-led international order]{.underline}**.
**[For the United States, that will require accepting the reality that
there are spheres of influence in the world today\--and that not all of
them are American spheres]{.underline}**. THE WORLD AS IT WAS Before
making pronouncements about the new rules of geopolitics, post-Cold War
U.S. secretaries of state should have looked back to the final months of
World War II, when U.S. policymakers were similarly resistant to
accepting a world in which spheres of influence remained a central
feature of geopolitics. Competing views on the issue lay at the core of
a debate between two top Soviet experts in the U.S. government. On
February 4, 1945, President Franklin Roosevelt met with Soviet leader
Joseph Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at Yalta. At
Roosevelt\'s side was his translator and principal adviser on the Soviet
Union, Charles Bohlen. Just that morning, Bohlen had opened an urgent
private missive from his close colleague George Kennan in Moscow. Kennan
correctly forecast that the Soviet Union would attempt to maintain
control of as much of Europe as it could. The question was what the
United States should do about that. Kennan asked, \"Why could we not
make a decent and definitive compromise with it\--divide Europe frankly
into spheres of influence\--keep ourselves out of the Russian sphere and
keep the Russians out of ours?\" Bohlen was appalled. \"Utterly
impossible,\" he erupted in response. \"Foreign policy of that kind
cannot be made in a democracy.\" Reflecting on this moment later, Bohlen
explained: \"The American people, who had fought a long, hard war,
deserved at least an attempt to work out a better world.\" Between 1945
and 1947, Bohlen worked alongside other leading figures in the Roosevelt
and then the Truman administration to realize their \"one world\"
vision, in which the allies who had fought together to defeat the Nazis
would remain allied in creating a new global order. But he ultimately
resigned himself to the world as it was\--in short, Kennan had been
right. \"Instead of unity among the great powers on the major issues of
world reconstruction\--both political and economic\--after the war,
there is complete disunity between the Soviet Union and the satellites
on one side and the rest of the world on the other,\" Bohlen
acknowledged in the summer of 1947 in a memo to Secretary of State
George Marshall. \"There are, in short, two worlds instead of one.\"
When he finally came to share Kennan\'s diagnosis, Bohlen did not shrink
from the implications. His memo to Marshall concluded: Faced with this
disagreeable fact, however much we may deplore it, the United States in
the interest of its own well-being and security and those of the free
non-Soviet world must ... draw \[the non-Soviet world\] closer together
politically, economically, financially, and, in the last analysis,
militarily in order to be in a position to deal effectively with the
consolidated Soviet area. This conviction became a pillar of the United
States\' strategy for the coming decades, and it rested on the
acceptance of spheres of influence. There would be areas that would be
subjected to Soviet domination, with often terrible consequences, but
the best course for the United States was to bolster those powers on the
periphery of this Soviet sphere while reinforcing the strength and unity
of its own sphere. For the four decades that followed, the United States
and the Soviet Union engaged in the great-power competition that we know
as the Cold War. In the Soviet sphere, the captive nations of Eastern
Europe remained under the boot of an \"evil empire.\" American
presidents faced repeated crises in which they had to choose between
sending troops into Soviet-dominated nations to support freedom fighters
seeking to exercise rights that the American creed declares universal
and standing by as those freedom fighters were slaughtered or
suppressed. Without exception, U.S. presidents chose to watch instead of
intervene: consider Dwight Eisenhower when Hungarians rose up in 1956
and Lyndon Johnson during the Prague Spring of 1968 (or, after the Cold
War, George W. Bush when Russian troops attacked Georgia in 2008 and
Barack Obama when Russian special forces seized Crimea). Why? Each had
internalized an unacceptable yet undeniable truth: that, as U.S.
President Ronald Reagan once explained in a joint statement with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, \"a nuclear war cannot be won and must never
be fought.\" This bit of Cold War history should serve as a reminder: a
nation that is simultaneously idealistic and realistic will always
struggle to reconcile rationales and rationalizations of purpose, on the
one hand, with realities of power, on the other. The result, in the
foreign policy analyst Fareed Zakaria\'s apt summary, has been \"the
rhetoric of transformation but the reality of accommodation.\" Even at
the height of U.S. power, accommodation meant accepting the ugly fact of
a Soviet sphere of influence. TECTONIC SHIFTS After nearly half a
century of competition, when the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union
disappeared, in 1991, the United States was left economically,
militarily, and geopolitically dominant. In the first two decades of the
post-Cold War era, U.S. defense spending exceeded the defense budgets of
the next ten nations combined (five of them U.S. treaty allies).
Operationally, that meant that, as Secretary of Defense James Mattis\'s
2018 National Defense Strategy put it, the United States \"enjoyed
uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain. We could
generally deploy our forces when we wanted, assemble them where we
wanted, and operate how we wanted.\" The United States and its allies
could welcome new members into NATO, applying to them its Article 5
security guarantee, without thinking about the risks, since the alliance
faced no real threat. In that world, strategy in essence consisted of
overwhelming challenges with resources. But that was then. The tectonic
shift in the balance of power that occurred in the first two decades of
the twenty-first century was as dramatic as any shift the United States
has witnessed over an equivalent period in its 244 years. To paraphrase
Vaclav Havel, then the president of Czechoslovakia, it has happened so
fast, we have not yet had time to be astonished. The U.S. share of
global GDP\--nearly one-half in 1950\--has gone from one-quarter in 1991
to one-seventh today. (Although GDP is not everything, it does form the
substructure of power in relations among nations.) **[And as the United
States\' relative power has declined, the menu of feasible options for
policymakers has shrunk]{.underline}**. Consider, for example, the U.S.
response to China\'s Belt and Road Initiative. With currency reserves of
almost \$3 trillion, China can invest \$1.3 trillion in infrastructure
linking most of Eurasia to a China-centered order. When Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States would increase its
own investments in the Indo-Pacific in response, he was able to come up
with just \$113 million in new investments. China has, of course, been
the chief beneficiary of this transformation. In the past generation,
its GDP has soared: from 20 percent of the U.S. level in 1991 to 120
percent today (measured by purchasing power parity, the metric that both
the CIA and the International Monetary Fund use to compare national
economies). Although China faces many internal challenges, there are
more reasons to expect this basic economic trend to continue than to bet
that it will stop soon. With four times as many citizens as the United
States, and if Chinese workers become as productive as Portuguese
workers are today (that is, around half as productive as Americans),
China will see its GDP rise to double that of the United States. **[In
Asia, the economic balance of power has tilted especially dramatically
in China\'s favor]{.underline}**. As the world\'s largest exporter and
second-largest importer, China is the top trading partner of every other
major East Asian country, including U.S. allies. (And as an aggressive
practitioner of economic statecraft, Beijing does not hesitate to use
the leverage this provides, squeezing countries such as the Philippines
and South Korea when they resist Chinese demands.) **[Globally, China is
also rapidly becoming a peer competitor of the United States in advanced
technologies]{.underline}**. Today, of the 20 largest information
technology companies, nine are Chinese. Four years ago, when Google, the
global leader in artificial intelligence (AI), the most significant
advanced technology, assessed its competition, Chinese companies ranked
alongside European companies. Now, that state of affairs is barely
visible in the rearview mirror: Chinese companies lead in many areas of
applied AI, including surveillance, facial and voice recognition, and
financial technology. **[China\'s military spending and capabilities
have surged]{.underline}**, as well. A quarter century ago, its defense
budget was one-25th that of the United States; now, it is one-third and
on a path to parity. And whereas the U.S. defense budget is spread
across global commitments, many of them in Europe and the Middle East,
China\'s budget is focused on East Asia. Accordingly, in specific
military scenarios involving a conflict over Taiwan or in the South
China Sea, China may have already taken the lead. Short of actual war,
the best tests of relative military capabilities are war games. In 2019,
Robert Work, a former U.S. deputy secretary of defense, and David
Ochmanek, one of the Defense Department\'s key defense planners, offered
a public summary of the results from a series of classified recent war
games. Their bottom line, in Ochmanek\'s words: \"When we fight Russia
and China, \'blue\' \[the United States\] gets its ass handed to it.\"
As The New York Times summarized, \"In 18 of the last 18 Pentagon war
games involving China in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. lost.\" Russia is a
different matter. Whatever President Vladimir Putin might want, Russia
will never again be his father\'s Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union
dissolved, the resulting Russian state was left with less than half the
GDP and half the population and saw its borders rolled back to the days
before Catherine the Great. **[Yet Russia remains a nuclear superpower
with an arsenal that is functionally equivalent to that of the United
States; it has a defense industry that produces weapons the world is
eager to buy (as India and Turkey have demonstrated in the past year);
and it boasts military forces that can fight and win\--as they have
demonstrated repeatedly in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, and
Syria]{.underline}**. On a continent where most of the other nations
imagine that war has become obsolete, and maintain military forces more
for ceremonial than combat operations, military prowess may now be
Russia\'s major comparative advantage. BACK TO BASICS **[The claim that
spheres of influence had been consigned to the dustbin of history
assumed that other nations would simply take their assigned places in a
U.S.-led order]{.underline}**. **[In retrospect, that assumption seems
worse than naive]{.underline}**. Yet because many U.S. analysts and
policymakers still cling to images of China and Russia formed during
this bygone era, their views about what the United States should and
should not do continues to reflect a world that has vanished. Over the
course of centuries of geopolitical competition, policymakers and
theorists developed a set of core concepts to help clarify the
complexities of relations among states, including spheres of influence,
balances of power, and alliances. These concepts must be adapted to take
account of specific conditions in the twenty-first century. Yet they
remain the sturdiest building blocks available for understanding and
constructing international order. Where the equilibrium of forces
between one state and another shifts to the point where the first
becomes predominant, the resulting new balance of power casts a shadow
that becomes, in effect, a \"sphere of influence.\" That specific term
entered the vocabulary of diplomacy in the early nineteenth century, but
the concept is as old as international relations itself. (As Thucydides
noted, after the defeat of the Persians in the fifth century BC, Sparta
demanded that Athens not rebuild the walls around its city-state to
leave itself vulnerable.) Traditionally, great powers have demanded a
degree of deference from lesser powers on their borders and in adjacent
seas, and they have expected other great powers to respect that fact.
Recent actions by China and Russia in their respective neighborhoods are
just the most recent examples of that tradition. Spheres of influence
also extend beyond geography. When the United States led the world in
the creation of the Internet, and the hardware and software that
empowered it, the United States enjoyed what Michael Hayden, a former
director of the National Security Agency, later called a \"golden age of
electronic surveillance.\" Since most countries were unaware of the
surveillance capabilities revealed by the former NSA contractor Edward
Snowden, the United States had an unparalleled ability to exploit
technology to listen to, track, and even influence them. But
post-Snowden, many states are resisting the current U.S. campaign to
prevent them from buying their 5G wireless infrastructure from the
Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. As the leader of a country
currently considering the choice recently put it, Washington is trying
to persuade other countries not to buy Chinese hardware because it will
make it easier for China to spy and instead to buy American hardware,
which would make it easier for the United States to spy. A REALISTIC
RECKONING **[From the perspective of American interests and values, the
consequences of increases in China\'s and Russia\'s power relative to
that of the United States are not good]{.underline}**. As great powers,
China and Russia can use their power to suppress protesters\' freedom in
Hong Kong or block Ukrainian membership in NATO. The South China Sea is
likely to become more like the Caribbean than the Mediterranean\--that
is, China\'s neighbors in Southeast Asia will be as beholden to China as
Latin Americans have been to their hemispheric hegemon. Ukraine will
have to get over the loss of Crimea as countries in Russia\'s \"near
abroad\" learn to be both more fearful of and more deferential to the
Kremlin. For many other nations and individuals around the world who
have found shelter under the American security umbrella and found
inspiration in a vision of an American-led international order that
safeguards core liberties, the consequences will be tragic. Recent
events in Syria offer a preview of what\'s to come. As the Arab Spring
erupted in late 2010 and 2011, Obama famously declared that Syrian
leader Bashar al-Assad \"must go.\" But Putin had other ideas, and he
was willing to act on them. He demonstrated that a nation Obama had
dismissed as a \"regional power\" could use its military forces to defy
the United States and help the Syrian leader consolidate his control.
This has been a horror for Syrians, and the millions of displaced people
have had a major impact on neighboring countries and Europe. But did
Obama, or, later, President Donald Trump, conclude that this outcome was
so costly that it would be better to send large numbers of U.S. troops
to fight and perhaps die in Syria? Can Americans sleep soundly in a
world in which Putin and Assad now smile when they ask visitors who is
gone and who is still standing? U.S. inaction speaks for itself. Sadly,
Americans will come to accept such outcomes as good enough\--at least
for the foreseeable future. Like Assad\'s atrocities, Russia\'s
absorption of Crimea and China\'s militarization of the South China Sea
are now facts on the ground that no one will contest militarily.
**[Acknowledging that other powers have spheres of influence does not,
of course, mean that the United States can do nothing]{.underline}**. It
is a reflection of the recent overmilitarization of U.S. foreign policy
that restraint in the use of military force is often equated with
acquiescence. Washington has other ways in which it can shape other
countries\' calculations of costs and benefits: through the condemnation
of unacceptable actions; the denial of legal status; the imposition of
economic sanctions on countries, companies, and individuals; and support
for local resisters. But such tools can rarely decisively alter a
decision another power has made when interests it sees as vital are at
stake. And it is worth remembering how often a refusal to recognize and
accept realities on the ground in the shadow of other powers has led to
major U.S. policy failures. From General Douglas MacArthur\'s rush to
the Chinese border during the Korean War (which triggered Chinese
intervention and a bloody, inconclusive war) to George W. Bush\'s
insistence that NATO offer membership to Georgia and Ukraine (which led
to Georgian overconfidence, ending in the country\'s partial
dismemberment by Russia), a stubborn disregard of brute facts has been
counterproductive. THE MUSEUM OF RETIRED INTERESTS When it comes to
doing what it can, Washington should focus above all on its alliances
and partnerships. If China is destined to be \"the biggest player in the
history of the world,\" as the longtime Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew
once claimed, the United States must work to assemble allied powers who
together will constitute a correlation of forces to which China will
have to adjust. This logic is most evident in the economic arena. Before
the Trump administration ended U.S. participation in the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, that trade agreement promised to bring together countries
accounting for 40 percent of global GDP under a common set of rules on
everything from tariffs to state-owned enterprises to labor and
environmental standards\--providing a counterweight to Chinese economic
might that could have made Beijing a rule-taker rather than a
rule-maker. Thanks to the efforts of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
the TPP is now a reality\--but without the United States. If American
policymakers could find a way to allow strategic interests to trump
politics, the United States could rejoin the TPP. If that new TPP were
combined with the parallel trade agreement between the United States and
the European Union that was being negotiated at the end of the Obama
administration, nearly 70 percent of the world\'s GDP could be on one
side of the balance, versus China\'s approximately 20 percent on the
other. In the military arena, the same logic applies, but with more
complexity. Washington will need partners\--but partners that bring more
in assets than they introduce in risks. Unfortunately, few of the United
States\' current allies meet this standard. The U.S. alliance system
should be subjected to a zero-based analysis: every current ally and
partner, from Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand to Latvia, Saudi
Arabia, and Turkey, should be considered in terms of what it is doing to
enhance U.S. security and well-being, and with what risks and costs.
Alliances are not forever. Historically, when conditions have changed,
particularly when a focal enemy has disappeared or balances of power
have shifted dramatically, so, too, have other relationships among
nations. Most Americans today have forgotten an era in which NATO had a
counterpart in Asia, SEATO (the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization), and
even an analogue in the Middle East, CENTO (the Central Treaty
Organization); both of those are now artifacts in the museum of retired
national interests. As Kennan noted, \"There is more respect to be won
... by a resolute and courageous liquidation of unsound positions than
by the most stubborn pursuit of extravagant or unpromising objectives.\"
To understand the risks entailed in the inheritance of current U.S.
alliances, consider two scenarios U.S. defense planners worry about
today. If, watching China\'s suppression of protests in Hong Kong,
Taiwan should make a dramatic move toward independence that leads China
to react violently, would the United States go to war with China to
preserve Taiwan\'s status? Should it? On the European front, if in
response to an uprising of ethnic Russian workers in Riga\'s shipyards,
the Latvian government cracked down on ethnic Russians and sparked
Russia\'s annexation of a swath of Latvia\--Crimea 2.0\--would NATO
launch an immediate military response, in accordance with its Article 5
guarantee? Should it? If the answer to any of those questions is not a
straightforward yes\--and it is not\--then the time has come for an
alliance-focused version of the stress tests for banks used after the
2008 financial crisis. **[Such an approach is all the more important
given the realities of nuclear weapons in this new world]{.underline}**.
**[Both China and Russia have reliable second-strike nuclear
capabilities\--that is, the ability to withstand an initial nuclear
attack and conduct a retaliatory strike that could destroy the United
States]{.underline}**. Accordingly, not only is nuclear war not a viable
option; even a **[conventional war that could escalate to nuclear war
risks catastrophe]{.underline}**. Competition must thus be tempered by
caution, constraints, and careful calculations in risk taking. **[For a
nation that has accumulated a long list of entanglements with nations
that may have, or may imagine they have, a blank check from Washington,
this creates a big problem]{.underline}**. **[The line between
reassuring an ally and emboldening its leadership to act recklessly is a
fine one]{.underline}**. **[If the balance of military power in a
conventional war over Taiwan or the Baltics has shifted decisively in
China\'s and Russia\'s favor, current U.S. commitments are not
sustainable]{.underline}**. **[The gap between those commitments and the
United States\' actual military capabilities is a classic case of
overstretch]{.underline}**. What a zero-based assessment would mean for
the current alliance system, and for U.S. relations with each of more
than 50 treaty allies and partners, should emerge as a result of an
analysis of the evidence. But it would likely lead the United States to
**[shed some allies]{.underline}**, **[double down on
others]{.underline}** whose assets are as important for U.S. security as
U.S. assets are for them, and radically revise the terms of each
commitment to make obligations and restraints as prominent as
reassurances and guarantees. This process would also enhance the
credibility of the commitments that the United States chose to renew.
While the veterans of the Cold War rightly claim that NATO has been the
greatest alliance in the history of the world, neither Trump nor Obama
before him was convinced. Tellingly, American military commanders
doubted that the North Atlantic Council would authorize a military
response to the Russian annexation of Crimea or that the U.S. government
would be able to make a decision about how to respond before the event
was over. **[Rethinking the United States\' commitments to its allies
would enhance American security and make these same pacts
stronger]{.underline}**. PRESENT AT THE (RE-)CREATION Strategy is the
purposeful alignment of means and ends. Among the many ways in which a
strategy fails, the two most common are mismatch\--when the means an
actor can organize and sustain are insufficient to achieve the stated
ends\--and vision blindness, when an actor is mesmerized by an ideal but
unachievable end. The United States\' twenty-first-century wars in the
Middle East offer vivid examples of both. **[Going forward, U.S.
policymakers will have to abandon unattainable aspirations for the
worlds they dreamed of and accept the fact that spheres of influence
will remain a central feature of geopolitics]{.underline}**. That
acceptance will inevitably be a protracted, confusing, and wrenching
process. Yet it could also bring a wave of strategic creativity\--an
opportunity for nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of the
conceptual arsenal of U.S. national security. The basic view of the
United States\' role in the world held by most of today\'s
foreign-policy makers was imprinted in the quarter century that followed
the U.S. victory in the Cold War. That world is now gone. The
consequences are as profound as those that Americans confronted in the
late 1940s. Accordingly, it is worth remembering how long it took
individuals now revered as \"wise men\" to understand the world they
faced. Nearly five years passed between Kennan\'s \"Long Telegram,\" an
early warning of Cold War competition, and the policy paper NSC-68,
which finally laid out a comprehensive strategy. The confusion that
reigns in the U.S. foreign policy community today should thus not be a
cause for alarm. If it took the great strategists of the Cold War nearly
five years to forge a basic approach, it would be beyond hubris to
expect this generation to do better.

Fifty years ago this week, former U.S. President Richard Nixon flew to
China, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in relations between the
two countries. Much has changed since that visit, not always for the
better. [Despite]{.underline} a flurry of [diplomatic activity over the
past year]{.underline}, **[U.S.-China ties remain tense]{.underline}**.
Discussions in Alaska and Tianjin yielded few, if any, breakthroughs.
While friendlier in tone, the recent summit between Chinese President Xi
Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden led only to agreements to hold yet
more talks, albeit on important issues such as strategic stability. The
lone bilateral bright spot has been some cooperation on climate.

Since the summit, the Biden administration announced its diplomatic
boycott of the Beijing Olympics and added more Chinese companies to its
trade restriction list while Congress passed a bill aimed at countering
China's forced labor abuses in Xinjiang. [The two sides' antagonistic
stances on issues related to **security**]{.underline}, economics,
**[tech]{.underline}**nology, **[and ideology have largely
crystalized]{.underline}**, [leaving little space for]{.underline} the
[adjustments]{.underline} that could relieve simmering tensions. Below,
Paul Haenle and Sam Bresnick analyze how the two countries got here and
how they can move forward.

WHY ARE THE TWO SIDES STUCK?

Former U.S. President Donald Trump ushered in a more confrontational era
in U.S.-China relations, and Biden has largely maintained his
predecessor's approach to Beijing, albeit with a more equanimous tone
and embrace of multilateralism. [The U.S]{.underline}. government [has
for decades been concerned by China's mercantilism, rapid military
modernization, and illiberal approach to human rights]{.underline}, but
it had held out hope that China might liberalize through increasingly
robust contact with the rest of the world. That has not happened, and
the United States and others have lost patience with
[China's]{.underline} state [capitalist system]{.underline},
[militarization of the]{.underline} [S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [and increasingly authoritarian
governance]{.underline}.

But **[Beijing is not backing down]{.underline}**. Despite facing
pronounced international pushback during the pandemic, [Xi has become
even more confident in China's economic system]{.underline}, [governance
model]{.underline}, [and approach to international affairs]{.underline}.
"**[Time and momentum are on China's side]{.underline}**," [he
argued]{.underline} last year at a high-level meeting, though many
analysts accuse the party of overconfidence. At the same time, Chinese
officials are increasingly looking askance at their U.S. counterparts.
Many appear to believe that the United States, though still a formidable
power, is in the early stages of an inevitable decline. Just as China
resumes its rightful place atop the hierarchy of Asian nations,
Beijing's thinking goes, the United States' unresolved racial justice
issues, income inequality, and political polarization will catalyze an
irreversible diminution of U.S. power in Asia and across the globe.

Yet [the **history of technological revolutions** counsels **against**
alarmism]{.underline}. Extrapolating from current technological trends
is problematic, both because [technologies often **do not live up to
their promise**, and because technologies often have **countervailing**
or **conditional effects** that can **temper** their **negative
consequences**]{.underline}. Thus, [the fear that **emerging
technologies** will necessarily cause **sudden** and **spectacular
changes** to international politics should be treated with
**caution**]{.underline}. There are at least two reasons to be
circumspect. First, [very **few** technologies fundamentally reshape the
dynamics of international conflict.]{.underline} Historically, [most
technological innovations have amounted to **incremental
advancements,**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} some have **[disappeared
into irrelevance]{.underline}** despite widespread hype about their
promise. For example, [the introduction of **chemical
weapons**]{.underline} [was widely expected to immediately change the
nature of warfare]{.underline} and deterrence after the British army
first used poison gas on the battlefield during World War I. [Yet
chemical weapons quickly turned out to be less **practical**, easier to
**counter**, and **less effective**]{.underline} than conventional
high-explosives in inflicting damage and disrupting enemy operations.6
Other technologies have become important only after advancements in
other areas allowed them to reach their full potential: until armies
developed tactics for effectively employing firearms, for instance,
these weapons had little effect on the balance of power. And [even when
technologies do have significant strategic consequences, they often take
**decades to emerge**]{.underline}, as the invention of airplanes and
tanks illustrates. In short, [it is easy to **exaggerate** the strategic
effects of nascent technologies]{.underline}.7 Second, even if today's
emerging technologies are poised to drive important changes in the
international system, they are likely to have variegated and even
contradictory effects. Technologies may be destabilising under some
conditions, but stabilising in others. Furthermore, [other factors are
likely to **mediate** the effects of **new technologies** on the
international system, including **geography**, the **distribution of
material power, military strategy**, **domestic** and **organisational
politics**, and social and cultural variables, to name **only a
few**]{.underline}.8 Consequently, [the strategic effects of new
technologies often **defy** simple classification.]{.underline} Indeed,
more than 70 years after [nuclear weapons]{.underline} emerged as a new
technology, their [consequences for stability **continue** to be

The startling trend highlights a paradox. Even [as China and the U.S.
race for leadership in]{.underline} what they view as a strategically
important [tech]{.underline}nology, **[researchers on both sides appear
to see benefits in]{.underline}** sharing expertise and **[working
together]{.underline}**.

"What's clear is that the amount of [collaboration between the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China has gone
up]{.underline}** dramatically, and it has gone up much more than
collaborations between any two other countries," says Raymond Perrault,
Distinguished Computer Scientist at SRI International in Menlo Park and
co-chair of the AI Index Steering Committee.

To some extent, the surge in U.S.-China research simply reflects the
fact that both nations have poured vast resources into artificial
intelligence and produce huge amounts of research. On top of that, many
Chinese researchers were trained in the United States and retain close
professional ties to their American colleagues.

But [the practice is consistent with patterns observed during previous
tech]{.underline}nological [revolutions]{.underline} in textiles, steel,
and chemical engineering. Research by Jeffrey Ding, a postdoctoral
fellow at Stanford HAI, has shown that the full economic impact of
historic tech advances stemmed less from which nation pioneered a
technology than from which ones were best at applying it across a broad
range of industries. That dispersion of technology requires sharing
information across industries as well as borders, much as the United
States catapulted applied British advances in steel machinery to develop
manufacturing approaches that catapulted it to economic dominance.

That said, **[the collaboration in AI]{.underline}** [comes at a time of
growing friction between the U]{.underline}nited [States and
China]{.underline} [over trade, human rights, and strategic power in the
Pacific Rim]{.underline}. Former President Donald Trump villainized
China over its trade practices, and President Joe Biden imposed a

In March 2016, DeepMind's AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, who at the time was
the best human Go player in the world. It represented one of those
defining technological moments like IBM's Deep Blue beating chess
champion Garry Kasparov, or even IBM Watson beating the world's greatest
Jeopardy! champions in 2011. Yet **[these victories, as mind-blowing as
they seemed to be, were more about training algorithms and using
brute-force computational strength than any real
intelligence]{.underline}**. Former MIT robotics professor Rodney
Brooks, who was one of the founders of iRobot and later Rethink
Robotics, reminded us at the TechCrunch Robotics Session at MIT last
week that **[training an algorithm to play a difficult strategy game
isn't intelligence, at least as we think about it with
humans]{.underline}**. He explained that [as strong as AlphaGo was at
its given task, it actually couldn't do anything else but play Go on a
standard 19 x 19 board]{.underline}. He relayed a story that while
speaking to the DeepMind team in London recently, he asked them what
would have happened if they had changed the size of the board to 29 x
29, and the AlphaGo team admitted to him that had there been even a
slight change to the size of the board, "we would have been dead." "I
think people see how well \[an algorithm\] performs at one task and they
think it can do all the things around that, and it can't," Brooks
explained. Brute-force intelligence As Kasparov pointed out in an
interview with Devin Coldewey at TechCrunch Disrupt in May, [it's one
thing to design a computer to play chess at Grand Master level, but it's
another to call it intelligence in the pure sense]{.underline}. **[It's
simply throwing computer power at a problem and letting a machine do
what it does best]{.underline}**. "**[In chess, machines dominate the
game because of the brute force of calculation and they \[could\] crunch
chess once the databases got big enough and hardware got fast enough and
algorithms got smart enough, but there are still many things that humans
understand]{.underline}**. **[Machines don't have
understanding]{.underline}**. **[They don't recognize strategical
patterns]{.underline}**. **[Machines don't have purpose]{.underline}**,"
Kasparov explained. Gil Pratt, CEO at the Toyota Institute, a group
inside Toyota working on artificial intelligence projects including
household robots and autonomous cars, was interviewed at the TechCrunch
Robotics Session, said that the fear we are hearing about from a wide
range of people, including Elon [Musk, who most recently called AI "an
existential threat to humanity," could stem from science-fiction
dystopian descriptions of artificial intelligence run amok]{.underline}.
"The deep learning systems we have, which is what sort of spurred all
this stuff, are remarkable in how well we do given the particular tasks
that we give them, but they are actually quite narrow and brittle in
their scope. So I think it's important to keep in context how good these
systems are, and actually how bad they are too, and how long we have to
go until these systems actually pose that kind of a threat \[that Elon
Musk and others talk about\]." Brooks said in his TechCrunch Sessions:
**[Robotics talk that there is a tendency for us to assume that if the
algorithm can do x, it must be as smart as humans]{.underline}**.
"**[Here's the reason that people --- including Elon --- make this
mistake]{.underline}**. [When we see a person performing a task very
well, we understand the competence \[involved\]]{.underline}. And [I
think they apply the same model to machine learning]{.underline}," he
said. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg also criticized Musk's comments,
calling them "pretty irresponsible," in a Facebook Live broadcast on
Sunday. Zuckerberg believes AI will ultimately improve our lives. Musk
shot back later that Zuckerberg had a "limited understanding" of AI.
(And on and on it goes.) It's worth noting, however, that Musk isn't
alone in this thinking. Physicist Stephen Hawking and philosopher Nick
**[Bostrom]{.underline}** also have expressed reservations about the
potential impact of AI on humankind --- but [chances are they are
talking about a more generalized artificial intelligence being studied
in labs at the likes of Facebook AI Research, DeepMind and Maluuba,
rather than the more narrow AI we are seeing today]{.underline}. Brooks
pointed out that **[many of these detractors don't actually work in AI,
and suggested they don't understand just how difficult it is to solve
each problem]{.underline}**. "There are quite a few people out there who
say that AI is an existential threat --- Stephen Hawking, \[Martin
Rees\], the Astronomer Royal of Great Britain...a few other people ---
and **[they share a common thread in that they don't work in AI
themselves]{.underline}**." Brooks went onto say, "**[For those of us
who do work in AI, we understand how hard it is to get anything to
actually work through product level]{.underline}**." AI could be a
misnomer [Part of the problem stems from the fact that we are calling it
"artificial intelligence."]{.underline} **[It is not really like human
intelligence at all]{.underline}**, which Merriam Webster defines as
"the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying
situations." Pascal Kaufmann, founder at Starmind, a startup that wants
to help companies use collective human intelligence to find solutions to
business problems, has been studying neuroscience for the past 15 years.
He says the human brain and the computer operate differently and **[it's
a mistake to compare the two]{.underline}**. "[The analogy that the
brain is like a computer is a dangerous one, and blocks the progress of
AI]{.underline}," he says. Further, Kaufmann believes we won't advance
our understanding of human intelligence if we think of it in
technological terms. "[It is a misconception that \[algorithms\] works
like a human brain]{.underline}. [People fall in love with algorithms
and think that you can describe the brain with algorithms and I think
that's wrong]{.underline}," he said. When things go wrong **[There are
in fact many cases of AI algorithms not being quite as smart as we might
think]{.underline}**. [One infamous example of AI out of control was the
**Microsoft Tay chatbot**, created by the Microsoft AI team last
year]{.underline}. **[It took less than a day for the bot to learn to be
racist]{.underline}**. Experts say that it could happen to any AI system
when bad examples are presented to it. In the case of Tay, it was
manipulated by racist and other offensive language, and since [it had
been taught to "learn" and mirror that behavior, it soon ran out of the
researchers' control]{.underline}. A widely reported study conducted by
researchers at Cornell University and the University of Wyoming found
that **[it was fairly easy to fool algorithms that had been trained to
identify pictures]{.underline}**. [The researchers found that when
presented with what looked like "scrambled nonsense" to humans,
algorithms would identify it as an everyday object like "a school
bus."]{.underline} What's not well understood, according to an MIT Tech
Review article on the same research project, is why the algorithm can be
fooled in the way the researchers found. What we know is that humans
have learned to recognize whether something is a picture or nonsense,
and **[algorithms analyzing pixels can apparently be subject to some
manipulation]{.underline}**. Self-driving cars are even more complicated
because there are things that humans understand when approaching certain
situations that would be difficult to teach to a machine. In a long blog
post on autonomous cars that Rodney Brooks wrote in January, he brings
up a number of such situations, including how an autonomous car might
approach a stop sign at a cross walk in a city neighborhood with an
adult and child standing at the corner chatting. The algorithm would
probably be tuned to wait for the pedestrians to cross, but what if they
had no intention of crossing because they were waiting for a school bus?
A human driver could signal to the pedestrians to go, and they in turn
could wave the car on, but a driverless car could potentially be stuck
there endlessly waiting for the pair to cross because they have no
understanding of these uniquely human signals, he wrote. **[Each of
these examples show just how far we have to go with artificial
intelligence algorithms]{.underline}**. Should researchers ever become
more successful at developing generalized AI, this could change, but for
now **[there are things that humans can do easily that are much more
difficult to teach an algorithm, precisely because we are not limited in
our learning to a set of defined tasks]{.underline}**.
