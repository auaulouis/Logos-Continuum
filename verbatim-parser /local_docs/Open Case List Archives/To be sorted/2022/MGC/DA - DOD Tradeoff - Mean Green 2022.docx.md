COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION TO OVERHAUL U.S.-TAIWAN POLICY",

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob
Menendez (D-N.J.) and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced they
have introduced the bipartisan [Taiwan Policy Act]{.underline} of 2022.
The new legislation, which comes in the wake of last week's threats by
Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe's that China will "not hesitate to
start a war" and "smash to smithereens" Taiwan, [represents the most
comprehensive restructuring of U.S. policy towards Taiwan
since]{.underline} the Taiwan Relations Act of [1979]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} bipartisan [proposal expands U.S. efforts to promote
the security of Taiwan, ensures regional stability, and
deters]{.underline} further People's Republic of [China]{.underline}
(PRC) aggression against Taiwan. The legislation also imposes steep
costs on the PRC for hostile action against Taiwan by setting up a broad
economic sanctions regime. Specifically, [the]{.underline} Taiwan Policy
[Act]{.underline} of 2022 [creates a new initiative to bolster Taiwan's
defense capabilities]{.underline}, providing almost \$4.5 billion in
security assistance over the next four years. The bill also [bolsters
support for Taiwan's democratic government]{.underline}; provides
additional support for Taiwan's participation in international
organizations and in multilateral trade architecture; takes concrete
steps to counter PRC's aggressive coercion and influence campaigns;
creates a Taiwan Fellowship Program; [and designates Taiwan as a Major
Non-NATO Ally]{.underline}. Under U.S. law, a Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA)
status designation is [a **powerful symbol** that provides our closest
global partners with additional benefits in the areas of defense trade
and **security cooperation**]{.underline}. "[As Beijing continues to
seek to coerce and isolate Taiwan there should be no doubt or ambiguity
about the depth and strength of our determination]{.underline} to stand
with the people of Taiwan and their democracy," said Chairman Menendez.
"The Taiwan Policy Act of 2022 represents a seminal statement of the
United States' absolute commitment to stand with Taiwan and all those
who share our interests and our values in the Indo-Pacific in the face
of Beijing's military, economic, and diplomatic threats and bullying.
[The United States and our partners have a **critical window of
opportunity** to reinvigorate our diplomatic strategy to assure
cross-Strait stability and security and to work with Taipei to modernize
their military]{.underline}; embed them in the region's economic
architecture; combat Beijing's political influence and misinformation
campaigns; and develop deeper ties between our two peoples. I thank
Senator Graham for working with me on this landmark legislation [to send
a clear message to Beijing not to make the same mistakes with Taiwan
that]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has [made in
Ukraine]{.underline}." "I'm very pleased to be working with Senator
Menendez to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. Our bill is the
largest expansion of the military and economic relationship between our
two countries in decades," said Senator Graham. "When it comes to
Taiwan, our response should be that we are for democracy and against
communist aggression. We live in dangerous times. [China is sizing up
America and our commitment to Taiwan. The danger will only grow worse if
we show weakness in the face of Chinese threats and aggression toward
Taiwan]{.underline}. I'm hopeful we will receive large bipartisan
support for our legislation and that the Biden Administration will sign
on in support."

Pentagon's Biggest Problem",

Fourth, [we need to spend a higher fraction of our defense budget on
dealing with China in Asia, **limiting** our ability to pursue
**dominance in other theaters.**]{.underline} This is because [we should
spend more than merely a bare plausible minimum on China]{.underline},
particularly [ensuring our forces are able to prevail in the Pentagon's
"pacing scenario"---Taiwan. The **stakes** of a war in the world's most
important region between the globe's two superpowers are **too great and
the uncertainty**]{.underline} of how such a great power war would
unfold **[too profound]{.underline}**. Accordingly, [we should spend
enough on dealing with China to be very confident we could successfully
deny Beijing the ability to subordinate a U.S. ally or
Taiwan]{.underline}. In practical terms, this means we should hedge by
constructing both long-range strike capabilities less vulnerable to
Chinese preemption and resilient forward-deployed forces, not only to
build redundancy into our plans but also to impose dilemmas on Beijing's
planning and galvanize allied efforts. The upshot of this is that a
greater portion of any defense spending increases should go to Asia than
many realize, constraining our ability to pursue multi-theater
dominance. Fifth, we also need to acknowledge that [there are **no easy
routes** to restoring global military dominance.]{.underline} The
reality is that [**military investments** in today's environment **are
less multipurpose** or fungible **than some contend**]{.underline}.
Fundamentally, [we are not preparing for]{.underline}, say, simultaneous
[wars against]{.underline} 1990s [Iraq and North Korea]{.underline},
over whom our armed forces would dominate, swinging forces such as
bombers, tankers, and carriers as needed between the conflicts to
address whatever deficiencies might arise. Rather, [we are dealing with
great powers. In this context, our **military investments are much more
often zero-sum---they do trade off against each other**]{.underline}.
[This is partially because of]{.underline} probable
[attrition]{.underline}. If we are to be prudent in planning for a war
with China or Russia, [we must assume that our forces would
take]{.underline} significant [losses]{.underline}, including in the key
war-winning capabilities needed to prevail and where our scarcity is
most acute. Vital systems like B-2 stealth bombers, attack submarines,
satellites, and possibly even aircraft carriers would be lost and
critical munitions like long-range anti-ship missiles and land-attack
air-launched missiles expended in considerable numbers. Such losses
would, if we did not have adequate stocks of replacements, make us
highly vulnerable in a second---let alone third---theater, possibly for
years given the timelines required for replenishing these forces. It is
also because [even]{.underline} those [forces that do survive are more
likely to be fixed in a given region]{.underline} or for a particular
conflict, **[limiting their flexibility.]{.underline}** This is at root
because **[a war with a China or Russia would be a much different
affair]{.underline}** than, say, defeating the Iraqi military in 2003.
[Fighting a great power would]{.underline} almost certainly [be much
tougher and take a considerably longer time]{.underline} in its critical
phases---much more a matter of a hard slog simply to prevail in the
conventional military contest than a quick shock and awe campaign. In
such a context, [we would not want to have to remove critical forces
from one unfinished fight to go to deal with another
conflict]{.underline}. This is a very real dynamic: Germany decided to
pull forces from the Western Front in summer 1914 to deal with Russia,
and this may have made the difference between victory and
stalemate---indeed, ultimately Germany's defeat. Furthermore[, forces
like attack submarines and surface vessels may not be physically able to
transition between theaters]{.underline} in the relevant timeframes. [If
critical fights happen in concurrent timeframes]{.underline}, as was the
case in 1914 and again in the Second World War, [key systems may not be
able to move fast enough]{.underline} between theaters. And the transit
of any forces might well be inhibited by the actions of our opponents,
further limiting our ability to swing them between theaters. The upshot
of this is that, in order to be able to fight two concurrent major power
wars, we would need to buy much more than just one set of major
war-winning capabilities. This means a much greater expense is required
to deal with the potential for concurrent conflicts with both China and
Russia, let alone other threats like Iran and North Korea.

-- Analysis.\"

[The 'China Threat]{.underline} '[emerging]{.underline} in 2018 in
comprehensive and diverse manifestations [poses an **existential
crisis** challenging]{.underline} [not only the continuance
of]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as
the global **unipolar Superpower** but also targeted with intended
consequences of prompting the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to retreat into isolation within its
continental]{.underline} [confines]{.underline}. The United States has
long ignored the China Threat to the detriment of United States own
national security but also to the security of US Allies and strategic
partners. The acid test of a nations' strategic greatness lies not only
in checkmating a threat in existence to its national security but also
being vigilant to a 'Threat in the Making', as I would put it. The
United States is guilty of the latter in relation to China. China has
reached this stage of posing a potent existential challenge to the
United States mainly due to United States own acts of strategic omission
and commission. United States misreading of China's long range
intentions has not only facilitated the emergence of a China Threat to
United States but also United States permissive attitudes on China
facilitated to create two 'rogue nuclear weapons state' of Pakistan and
North Korea as its proxy cats-paws against US Allies and strategic
partners. China is unlikely to succeed in achieving 'strategic
equivalence' that it seeks with the United States in the foreseeable
future nor are the Major Powers of the world, including Japan and India,
likely to accede 'American Exceptionalism' to China despite its
burgeoning military power. This for the simple reason that I have been
stressing in my writings for two decades and that is China has no
Natural Allies like the United States. For detailed analysis on the
subject, kindly read my Book, "China-India Military Confrontation: 21st
Century Perspectives" (2015) Chapter 13 'China's Giant Leap for
Superpower Status in 21st Century: Geopolitical Implications'. However,
China will in the 21st Century with great persistence, and unmindful of
the prevailing reality, that China is besieged today from both within
and without, China will continue to challenge United States global
predominance and specifically Indo Pacific predominance with greater
potency. [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has belatedly woken upto the reality that what
they attempted to market globally for decades that China can be co-opted
as a responsible stakeholder in global security and stability was a
**mirage**]{.underline}. [Long years of]{.underline} United States
'China **[Hedging]{.underline}** [Strategy']{.underline}
[and]{.underline} '**[Risk Aversion]{.underline}** Strategy' [made China
only more **recalcitrant** and fed Chinese]{.underline}
**[misperceptions]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [global power is on
the decline.]{.underline} United States policy formulations of this
decade of a 'Strategic Pivot to Asia Pacific' and the recent emphasis on
Indo Pacific Security Blueprint are seemingly belated but welcome steps
to checkmate China's unrestrained flexing of its military muscle as
evident in the South China Sea. Chinese President **[Xi]{.underline}**
Jinping's [call on Chinese Armed Forces to prepare for an **all- out
war** are not **defensive**]{.underline} [calls by a besieged nation but
like **Hitlerian Germany**]{.underline}, [these are offensive calls of a
**revisionist power**]{.underline}. [Annexation of Taiwan by use of
military force seems to be **China's aim** today]{.underline}. [This has
a larger aim of challenging]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**resolve** and **determination**]{.underline}
[to maintain its Superpower status.]{.underline} China has placed the
United States on the horns of a strategic dilemma where
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[will be damned if it does not militarily intervene to defend Taiwan and
if it does so it risks a **full-fledged war with China.**]{.underline}
China is gambling on the United States shying away from the latter
option. Right from the turnover of the 19th Century till today no major
power, not even Nazi Germany, has dared to challenge the United States
predominance, geopolitically and strategically, as China is now engaged
in doing so. Even at the height of the Cold War 1945-91 when the United
States and the Former Soviet Union were involved in a bitter ideological
struggle one did not witness the unfolding of the type of China's 'Grand
Strategy Blueprint' decades in the making and operationalising, to
initially unravel United States security architecture in Asia Pacific,
and graduated now to a more vividly clear reality in 2019 that China is
on the avowed path of emerging as the 'sole challenger 'of United States
predominance and exceptionalism. That China could geopolitically and
strategically engage in the execution of such a blueprint unchallenged
arose fundamentally from United States flawed policy decisions spread
over many US Administrations. Such flawed US policy decisions sprung
from misconceived American readings of China's long range strategic
intentions and short-term American geopolitical expediency subjugating
and distorting United States strategic vision of the 'China Threat' to
United States national security. The United States 'original sin' in
relation to the latent China Threat to US national security can be
placed on shoulders of US President Truman who ignored General
MacArthur's dire warnings on China and petulantly dismissed General
MacArthur from the command of UN Forces in Korea. If Japan today after
decades since 1945 continues as the United States most enduring and
steadfast Ally, it has a lot to do with General MacArthur's visionary
zeal. The second most serious sin in relation to flawed US policy
decisions was inflicted by US President Richard Nixon in 1972 egged by
his Sinophiles Secretary of States Henry Kissinger. To spite the Former
USSR the United States in 1972 endowed an unwarranted international
legitimacy on China despite its disruptive credentials and thereafter
followed as to what could be termed as a China Appeasement policy. The
third sin was committed at the turn of the Millennium when US President
Bush in his messianic zeal to tame President Saddam's Iraq left untended
both Afghanistan and more significantly Asia Pacific security. China
made full use of the decade ending 2010 for its exponential military
power expansion and with emphasis on a well-calibrated buildup of
Chinese naval power for 'naval operations in distant seas'. China's
latest strategic-economic enterprises of **[O]{.underline}**ne
**[B]{.underline}**elt **[O]{.underline}**ne **[R]{.underline}**oad
[and]{.underline} Maritime **[Silk Route]{.underline}** [are nothing but

WASHINGTON --- The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration has
[[accelerated]{.underline}]{.mark} its [ef[forts to reshape Taiwan's
defense system]{.mark}s as it projects a more robust American military
presence in the region [to try to deter]{.mark}]{.underline} a potential
attack by [[the Chinese military]{.underline},]{.mark} current and
former U.S. officials say. Russia's war in Ukraine has made American and
Taiwanese officials acutely aware that an autocrat can order an invasion
of a neighboring territory at any moment. But it has also shown how a
small military can hold out against a seemingly powerful foe. [U.S.
officials are taking lessons learned from arming Ukraine to work with
Taiwan in molding a stronger force that could repel]{.underline} a
seaborne invasion by [China]{.underline}, which has one of the world's
largest militaries. [The aim is to turn Taiwan into]{.underline} what
some officials call a "porcupine"--- [a territory bristling with
armaments]{.underline} and other forms of U.S.-led support [that appears
too painful to attack]{.underline}. Taiwan has long had missiles that
can hit China. But the [American-made weapons that it has recently
bought]{.underline} --- mobile rocket platforms, F-16 fighter jets and
antiship projectiles --- [are better suited for repelling an invading
force.]{.underline} Some military analysts say Taiwan might buy sea
mines and armed drones later. And as it has in Ukraine, the U.S.
government could also supply intelligence to enhance the lethality of
the weapons, even if it refrains from sending troops. American
[officials have been]{.underline} quietly [pressing]{.underline} their
[Taiwanese counterparts to buy weapons suitable for asymmetric
warfare]{.underline}, a conflict in which a smaller military uses mobile
systems to conduct lethal strikes on a much bigger force, U.S. and
Taiwanese officials say. [Washington increasingly uses the presence of
its military and those of allies as deterrence.]{.underline} The
Pentagon has begun divulging more details about the sailings of American
warships through the Taiwan Strait --- 30 since the start of 2020. And
U.S. officials praise partner nations like Australia, Britain, Canada
and France when their warships transit through the strait.

U.S. President Joe [Biden's]{.underline} inaugural [trip to Asia
provides an important milestone to assess the **direction and
effectiveness of American policy**]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific ---
a region identified by Republican and Democratic administrations alike
as holding a key to American prosperity and security. The Asia tour came
on the heels of the president hosting Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) leaders in Washington and comprised stops in Seoul and
Tokyo for bilateral meetings and participation in the second Quad
leaders' meeting. [This full-court diplomatic engagement was crucial,
given the importance of the objectives at stake: buttressing the
rules-based order across Eurasia; deepening strategic relations with and
between the United States' Asian allies]{.underline}; and launching the
economic track of the administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. [Mission
critical for the presidential visit was to **reassure the region that
the United States will remain committed** to its Indo-Pacific tilt, even
**as it weathers**]{.underline} the worst crisis Europe has suffered in
seven decades in the wake of Russia's invasion of
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. In visiting two Asian democratic allies ---
Japan and South Korea --- that have proactively partaken in the economic
sanctions campaign to deter and punish Russian aggression, the
[Biden]{.underline} administration has [sent an eloquent message about
the indivisibility of the rules-based order]{.underline}. In other
words, unchecked military aggression and economic coercion weaken peace
and stability everywhere, and the United States is uniquely placed to
mobilize allies across Europe and Asia to meet the challenge. BILATERALS
AND MINILATERALS [Biden's trip was timely as both South Korea and Japan
are each expanding their strategic horizons in ways that complement U.S.
interests in the region]{.underline}. South Korean President Yoon
Suk-yeol, only 11 days in office when he hosted Biden, has vowed to move
from the narrower focus of the previous Moon administration on
inter-Korean relations to embrace a broader regional and global role for
South Korea in technology and supply chains, climate, and health
security, and other fields. [Yoon's more skeptical view of China is
behind his desire to step up cooperation with the Quad and to coordinate
with the United States on economic security measures]{.underline}
(investment screening and export controls, among others). Hence, the
joint leaders' announcement highlighted the promise of a comprehensive
strategic alliance that leverages the U.S.-South Koreapartnership beyond
the Korean Peninsula.

Priority",
https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/06/amid-ukraine-war-us-signals-indo-pacific-vital-priority\]

[While]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline} war [continues to
dominate]{.underline} policymakers' attention, the [Biden]{.underline}
administration has [engaged in]{.underline} a series of [diplomatic
initiatives with allies]{.underline} and partners [across the
Indo-Pacific r]{.underline}egion over the course of the last two months.
The message is clear: [Washington sees the Indo-Pacific as the world's
**principal geostrategic region**]{.underline}, with a host of
challenges to meet --- like competition with China and climate change
--- and opportunities to seize, particularly related to technology and
the economy. USIP's Mirna Galic, Brian Harding, Tamanna Salikuddin and
Vikram Singh analyze Washington's Indo-Pacific diplomacy, U.S.-India
relations amid differences over the Russia-Ukraine war, China's
engagement in the Pacific Islands region and the role of economics in
the administration's regional strategy. [In the last two months
alone,]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration has [held
ministerial talks with India and]{.underline} a summit of [ASEAN
leaders]{.underline} in Washington, and President Biden [went to South
Korea and Japan and participated in a summit of \"Quad\"
leaders]{.underline}, among other high-level meetings. What is the
administration seeking to accomplish through these talks and meetings,
and how is it balancing this focus on Asia with the ongoing conflict in
eastern Europe? Galic: Th[e president's visit to the region and the
recent regional diplomacy both there and in Washington are all in
support of the administration's desire to **reorient U.S. foreign
policy**]{.underline} to the reality that [the Indo-Pacific is the
**emerging center of gravity** of the international system.]{.underline}
[Not only is it home to]{.underline} a great power competitor,
[China]{.underline}, which the administration sees as [the "most
serious, long-term" challenger]{.underline} to the international order[,
but it is also expected to be the driver of global economic and
technological growth in the decades to come]{.underline}. The war in
[Ukraine]{.underline} has hampered the administration's desire to focus
full throttle on the Indo-Pacific region, but it has also [reaffirmed
the importance of the region]{.underline} beyond its borders. This was
demonstrated not only by Chinese support for Russia, but also by the
assistance of regional partners like Australia, Japan and South Korea,
among others, in the imposition of punishing sanctions on Russia and the
provision of support to Ukraine. It is precisely [a focus
on]{.underline} these and [other partners in the region]{.underline}
that [forms the core of the Biden administration\'s Indo-Pacific
Strategy]{.underline} and its efforts to "more firmly anchor the United
States in the Indo-Pacific." Perhaps more remarkably than that **[the
United States remains focused on the Indo-Pacific even with the danger
posed by Russia]{.underline}**, is that Europe too is not far behind,
despite bearing the brunt of the current conflict. Australia, Japan, New
Zealand and South Korea have been invited to attend the NATO Summit in
Madrid later this month, where the alliance will reveal its new
Strategic Concept, which is expected to address China in addition to
Russia.

**Doubling down on European defense trades off with deterring China**

**Wertheim 3/3/2022**

\[Stephen, senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Europe is showing that it
could lead its own defense",
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/03/europe-defense-nato-ukraine-war/\]

Providing temporary reinforcements is the right decision today in the
face of Russia's bald aggression. But [the United States should **resist
the inclination to revive its role as the military protector of
Europe**]{.underline}, especially since Europe is awakening to its
responsibilities. Britain is sending troops to the Baltic states and
Poland. France is pushing "strategic autonomy" for the European Union.
And days after halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline supplying natural gas
from Russia, Germany reversed a long-standing ban on providing military
assistance and sent weapons to Ukraine. Germany also vowed to spend more
than 2 percent of its economy on defense, finally committing to meet
NATO's target. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared his country, and
Europe, to have reached a "historic turning point." Both Americans and
Europeans would benefit if Scholz's words prove true. In the coming
years[, European states should move to take the lead in their collective
defense]{.underline}, and the United States should do everything
possible to encourage them. To stake the defense of Europe on the United
States, over the next decade and beyond, would be to answer Putin's rash
gamble with a slow-moving gamble of our own. It might seem as though the
United States will remain able and willing to protect all of NATO's 28
European countries far into the future. After all, America has
orchestrated Europe's defense for the past eight decades. Yet it did so
under two markedly different conditions. During World War II and the
Cold War, the United States sought to stop totalitarian powers from
conquering the region. An Axis or Soviet takeover of Europe would have
closed off the entire continent to liberal, American-style interaction
and influence, and put the Western Hemisphere on the defensive. After
the Cold War, however, as the Soviet threat collapsed, the United States
recommitted to Europe not because the stakes were high but arguably
because they were low. Threats were so negligible that it seemed U.S.
leadership could keep things that way through modest exertion --- and
spread democracy to boot. Expanding NATO eastward, American officials
convinced themselves that what had been a military alliance was more
comparable to a political club, one that need not become an adversary of
Russia. Russia's assault on Ukraine ends that chapter and begins a new
one. The prospect of further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe cannot
be dismissed as negligible, as it was in the 1990s or 2000s. At the same
time[, Russia poses far less a threat to overrun Europe and threaten
American security or prosperity than the Soviet Union did.]{.underline}
After all, the Russian economy is roughly one-fifth the size of that of
the European Union, and that was before the severe sanctions of the past
week. Although Russia has built a formidable military, one that enables
it to launch wars like that in Ukraine, [NATO's European members
collectively outspend Russia on defense.]{.underline} During the Cold
War, by contrast, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact boasted land forces
superior in number to those of NATO (including the U.S. share), and the
gap between its economic output and that of Western Europe was several
times smaller than Russia's shortfall today. In the security environment
now emerging, with Russia menacing Eastern Europe, the United States is
set to face major costs and the ultimate risk: great-power war between
nuclear peers. Yet [the threat Russia poses remains one that Europeans
could handle themselves]{.underline}, with America acting as a supporter
rather than the leader. The United States remains a superpower. [Why
shouldn't it be the main counterweight in Europe to Moscow]{.underline}?
There are two reasons both the United States and Europe would be better
off if it declined this role. One lies in **[Beijing]{.underline}**, and
the other in Washington. [The United States has already identified China
as its primary rival, embarking on "strategic competition" with the
world's number-two power. Taking on China and Russia at once would be
**unwise and** likely **impossible**]{.underline}. True, the Pentagon
has previously planned to fight two wars at once, but those wars were
envisioned as "regional" conflicts against small states like Iran, Iraq
or North Korea. In practice, [the United States had difficulty
prosecuting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan simultaneously. China and
Russia represent challenges of a far **greater magnitude**]{.underline},
which explains why the Pentagon abandoned its two-war standard in 2018,
even as its budget has grown. [**If the United States doubles down** on
Europe]{.underline}an security [while leading the charge in Asia, **it
may either fall short in both** places]{.underline} or default on its
commitments in Europe just when they come due.

cybersecurity, data-governance and sharing issues, interoperability with
allies, and issues associated with integrating the service's networks
have all been cited as challenges with recognizing the ambitious promise
of JADC2's approach]{.underline}. Some have also highlighted that all-
encompassing ambition as a challenge as well. The Hudson Institute's
Bryan Clark and Dan Patt argue that "the urgency of today's threats and
the opportunities emerging from new technologies demand that Pentagon
leaders flip JADC2's focus from what the US military services want to
what warfighters need."51 To be sure, grand ambition is not necessarily
something to be avoided in AI development and integration programs.

Hackers Probe, NATO Has No Clear Cyberwar Strategy",

It has built up a vast early warning network, placing tens of thousands
of "implants" --- sensors that can also be used to insert malware ---
into networks around the world. But [NATO is only beginning to
explore]{.underline} what it delicately [calls "active
defense]{.underline}," and says it is not focused on offensive
cyberweapons. The Russians have no such compunctions. But it is unclear
what Russian hackers hope to achieve here in the Baltics, other than to
make the point, as they did in 2007 when they brought Estonia to an
electronic halt, that they can get into any system, anytime. "Whatever
the Russians have in mind --- mostly intimidation --- it usually fails,"
said Estonia's president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who grew up in New
Jersey before coming here to turn this small NATO country into a pioneer
in introducing new web-based technology for governing a nation. The 2007
attacks backfired, he noted, because they drove Estonians far more
solidly into the European and NATO camps. In Sweden and Finland, neutral
nations in the Cold War, the politics are more complex. As the NATO
exercise began in Finland last week, the Finnish foreign minister was in
Moscow, meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. The more
Sweden and Finland turn to NATO, the more their networks, their news
sites and their government ministries come under cyberattack. As Adm.
John Richardson, the chief of United States naval operations, said at an
event at the Council on Foreign Relations in May, "The fact [is it's a
pretty hot war in the cyber domain]{.underline} going on right now." A
hot war, but a kind [that suits Russia well: It is part of]{.underline}
what military strategists call "[gray zone" combat]{.underline}. For Mr.
Putin, [cyberespionage and cyberattacks keep NATO]{.underline} and its
partners [off balance. They are enormously **difficult and expensive to
defend against**,]{.underline} and, at least for now, they have operated
below the line that is likely to prompt a military or economic response.
"It stays below the radar," Martin Libicki of the RAND Corporation told
a conference sponsored this month by the NATO cyber center here,
officially known as the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence. For the Russians, Mr. Libicki said, [cyberespionage and
weaponry are part of a larger strategy of information
warfare]{.underline} and a blitz of propaganda that makes sorting out
fact from fiction --- say, the causes of the Malaysia Airlines crash in
Ukraine --- all the more difficult. But the attacks also remind the
smaller nations here of their vulnerability, even if Russia's troops
stay on their side of the border. So far, [NATO has found few effective
means of deterring attacks]{.underline}. "[The biggest
problem]{.underline} in cyber [remains deterrence]{.underline}," said
Mr. Ilves, the Estonian president, who has made the issue of avoiding
cyber conflict one of the main themes of his time in office. "We have
been talking about the need to deal with it within NATO for years now."

It's likely that the combined efforts of Microsoft, the U.S., and many
other countries and companies to ramp up cyber defenses both in and
outside of Ukraine has undoubtedly helped curb the damage caused by
these efforts. But if Russia really had on hand a stockpile of
previously undetected vulnerabilities and sophisticated malware designed
to exploit them, these [lines of defense]{.underline} simply [would not
be enough to prevent]{.underline} some significant [damage and
disruption. Updating critical infrastructure]{.underline} networks and

MODERNIZATION AND READINESS: A ZERO SUM GAME?",
https://warontherocks.com/2013/07/force-modernization-and-readiness-a-zero-sum-game/\]

Having made the decision not to size the military for large-scale,
protracted ground combat, [policymakers are attempting to prioritize
modernization and readiness at the expense of personnel. There
are]{.underline}, however, [worrying signs that readiness is being
sacrificed]{.underline}, and that [budgetary pressure will result
in]{.underline} the very thing we wish to avoid: [a hollow
military]{.underline}, which will make it impossible to project real
power. [There is an inherent tension between]{.underline} three pillars
of defense spending: [personnel, modernization and readiness. **Finite
resources make it impossible to avoid tradeoffs**]{.underline} among the
three. Thus[, planners must balance between the competing needs of
each.]{.underline} By reducing Army and Marine ground forces by 108,000,
policymakers have decided not to size the force for long-term,
protracted ground combat operations. Not only do policymakers appear to
have lost their appetite for such campaigns, planners have justified the
decision with the not unreasonable assertion that raising manpower will
be easier and faster than, say, designing and building an aircraft
carrier, tank or fighter. Moreover, a decade of combat operations has
left the force with used and abused equipment that badly needs refitting
and replacing. But even as the Department reduces active duty end
strength, personnel costs continue to rise. Personnel costs mostly
appear in two different accounts within DoD's budget: personnel and
operations and maintenance (O&M). The personnel account is basically
military compensation and consists of active duty pay and other cash
benefits such as housing and food allowances, special pay and bonuses.
O&M includes the many non-cash benefits like healthcare, childcare
services, subsidized food and clothing (commissaries and exchanges), and
fitness and recreation. Then, there are the deferred benefits for
pensions and healthcare for retirees. For 2013, DoD requested \$346
billion for operations and support (O&S), which is simply the sum of
personnel and O&M. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that
despite end strength reductions of five percent, O&S costs will rise to
\$373 billion in 2017. Since 2001, personnel costs in the base budget
have increased by nearly 90 percent or about 30 percent above inflation,
while the number of military personnel has increased by only about three
percent. Additionally, the O&M costs per service member increased from
\$55,000 to \$105,000 between 1980 and 2001. The CBO projects it will be
\$161,000 in 2016. The main drivers of this cost growth are military
compensation and health care. Military healthcare costs rose over 170
percent from 2001-2012, from \$19 billion to \$53 billion. The Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimates that if DoD spending
continues to rise at roughly the rate of inflation, [personnel
costs]{.underline} will consume the entire DoD budget by 2039. These
costs [are crowding out the ability to invest in modernization and
readiness of the force]{.underline}, hollowing the budget from within
and weakening the defense dollar. The Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) projects that even though the defense
topline in 2021 will be \$100 billion larger than previous drawdowns, it
will only buy an active force that is 34 percent smaller than the force
in 1978. CSIS also estimates that in order to maintain the traditional
budget figure of 32 percent for modernization, an additional 455,000
active duty troops will need to be cut. [The nature of sequestration in
the early years prioritizes modernization over readiness]{.underline}.
Major acquisition programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,
littoral combat ship, Virginia-class submarine, the SSBN(X) and other
programs take their ten percent lumps, but such cuts are minor hiccups
for these multi-year programs. After all, what difference does one less
F-35 mean in 2012? On the other hand, a ten percent cut to the services'
operations accounts has immediate and real impacts. The Air Force is
cutting 44,000 flying hours and grounding C-17 squadrons and the Navy is
delaying critical refueling and maintenance for the USS Abraham Lincoln
aircraft carrier. Army brigades will fail to meet readiness standards
for deployment. **[Modernization and readiness appear to be locked in a
zero sum game]{.underline}**. What good is maximum readiness if the
force is using broken and obsolete equipment? Conversely, how will the
force use the next generation of weapons to their maximum potential if
there's not enough money to train with them? In order to relieve some of
the downward pressure on both, personnel must enter the equation;
however, reducing end strength will only work up to a certain point.
Policymakers must confront the rising costs of the All Volunteer Force
if they're to have a military capable of answering their frequent phone
calls.

A review of the resourcing processes and trends in recent (since fiscal

system is not well structured]{.underline} to account for basic AIA
expenditures. We were able to arrive at an aggregate level of the direct
Army costs associated with AIA for the period 1995-2001 (and make
estimates until 2005). Since 1995, the [direct costs have
fluctuated]{.underline} largely in the \$400-\$5 00 million range
annually. [The AIA resource management problem is compounded by the lack
of both a definitive list of activities and a mechanism that links
unofficial AIA categories with official Army and DoD resourcing
categories]{.underline}. In addition, the Army is not properly
accounting for many personnel costs related to security cooperation and,
in some cases, is missing an opportunity to increase the amount of
administrative costs charged directly to the customer. [As a result of
the disjointed nature]{.underline} of AIA programming and budgeting[,
HQDA is currently incapable of capturing]{.underline} the many [hidden
costs]{.underline} associated with AIA. [The situation precludes HQDA
from making **fully informed policy and resource decisions with regard

the [existing security cooperation planning process is exceedingly
complex, involving a multitude of actors, problematic incentive systems,
incomplete information exchange, and no reliable measures of

visibility]{.underline} into the process. [The drivers and
demanders]{.underline} of AIA [tend to have an incomplete understanding
of the **resourcing problems and the tradeoffs involved** in making AIA
choices]{.underline}. In turn, HQDA (the supplier of AIA resources) has
an incomplete understanding of the benefits of AIA, and the Army\'s own
resourcing tools are not easily amenable to an in-depth understanding of
the resources it commits to AIA. Fundamentally, demand for AIA is
predicated upon the amount of AIA supply provided by the Department of
the Army, as opposed to the latter being the product of policy,
strategy, and resource guidance. Indeed, [incrementalism and continuity,

and]{.underline}]{.mark}, increasingly, [the economic, diplomatic,
military, and technological [power to do it,]{.mark}\"]{.underline} he
said. \"[[Beijing\'s vision would move us away from the universal values
that have sustained so much of the world\'s progress over the past 75

for the administration to marshal its resources, friends and allies to
push back on increasing Chinese assertiveness around the world. But he
made it clear that the U.S. doesn\'t seek to change China\'s political
system, just offer a tested alternative. \"This is not about forcing
countries to choose, it\'s about giving them a choice,\" he said.
However, he also acknowledged that [the U.S. has limited ability to
directly influence China\'s intentions and ambitions and will instead
focus on shaping the strategic environment around China]{.underline}.
\"We can\'t rely on Beijing to change its trajectory,\" Blinken said in
the speech at George Washington University. \"[So [we will shape the
strategic environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open
and inclusive international system]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" And Blinken
acknowledged [that t[he fates of U.S. and China \"are
linked]{.mark}]{.underline},\" and the two countries will need to work
together on a number of global issues now and in the future, and
\"that\'s why this is one of the most complex and consequential
relationships of any that we have in the world today.\" The speech
followed President Joe Biden\'s visits to South Korea and Japan,
concluded just this week, where China loomed large in discussions.
During the trip, he made the surprising remark that the United States
would act militarily to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of an
invasion by China, which regards the island as a renegade province. The
administration was quick to insist Mr. Biden was not changing American
policy, and Blinken on Thursday restated that the U.S. has not changed
its position. Washington, he said, still holds to its \"One China\"
policy, which recognizes Beijing but allows for unofficial links with
and arms sales to Taipei. Blinken argued [that [the global response to
Putin\'s invasion of Ukraine is a template for confronting China\'s
efforts ]{.mark}]{.underline}to mold a new and unpredictable world order
to replace the rules and institutions that have guided relations between
states since the end of World War II. [China]{.underline}, Blinken
suggested, has [benefited greatly from that international order but is
now trying to subvert it]{.underline} under the leadership of President
Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. \"[Rather than using its
power to reinforce and revitalize the laws]{.underline}, agreements,
principles, and institutions that enabled its success, so other
countries can benefit from them, too[, Beijing is undermining
it,\"]{.underline} Blinken said. \"Under President
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}, the ruling Chinese Communist Party [[has
become more repressive at home and more aggressive
abroad]{.mark}.]{.underline}\" Investment in domestic U.S.
infrastructure and technology along with stepping up diplomatic outreach
to potentially vulnerable countries are other elements of the policy are
key to the U.S. approach, Blinken said. In the latest manifestation of
[[China\'s push to expand]{.underline}]{.mark} its reach that [[has
drawn concern from the U.S. and other democracies]{.underline}]{.mark},
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday began an eight-nation tour
of Pacific islands during which Beijing hopes to strike a sweeping
agreement that covers everything from security to fisheries. Wang opened
his tour in the Solomon Islands, which last month signed a security
cooperation pact with China that some fear could lead to a Chinese
military presence there. The agreement was finalized shortly after the
Biden administration announced it would open a U.S. embassy in the
Solomons as part of its efforts to engage in the greater Indo-Pacific
region. The Biden administration has largely kept in place
confrontational policies toward China adopted by its predecessor in
response to Chinese actions in its western Xinjiang region, Hong Kong,
Tibet and the South China Sea.

What a difference two decades make. In the early years of this century,
the world appeared to be moving toward a single, seamless order under
U.S. leadership. **[Today the world is fragmenting, and authoritarian
challengers, led by China and Russia, are chipping away at American
influence in East Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle
East]{.underline}**. In its 2002 National Security Strategy, the George
W. Bush administration envisioned the end of great-power rivalries.
**[In 2020, the question is how great powers can navigate their
rivalries without stumbling into war]{.underline}**. Writing in Foreign
Affairs ("The New Spheres of Influence," March/April 2020), Graham
Allison offers a road map for this new environment: the United States
should accept the return of "spheres of influence" and effectively let
China and Russia dominate swaths of their respective geopolitical
neighborhoods. Doing so, Allison contends, is actually in keeping with
the United States' best diplomatic traditions, considering that
Washington tolerated a Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe
during the Cold War. Reviving that tradition is necessary, simply
because the United States no longer has the military and economic
dominance to deny China and Russia their geopolitical due. And it is
desirable, because mutually accepted spheres of influence can promote
stability and peace in a more rivalrous world. [Allison's argument is
alluring but wrong]{.underline}. In truth, [the United States has
resisted the creation of rival spheres of influence for most of its
history, even as it has worked assiduously to build its
own]{.underline}. **[[Ceding ground to China and Russia today would be
not a recipe for stability but a blueprint for coercion and conflict,
and it would weaken the United States' geopolitical hand]{.mark}
vis-à-vis its rivals]{.underline}**. **[Nor is a return to spheres of
influence foreordained---[Washington still has the power to prevent
Beijing and Moscow from dominating their regions]{.mark}, so long as it
rejects Allison's advice to cut loose its vulnerable frontline
allies]{.underline}**. [[A tougher, more competitive world is
unavoidable]{.underline}. **[A far more dangerous world, divided into
competing superpower fiefdoms, is not]{.underline}**.]{.mark} AN
AMERICAN TRADITION Spheres of influence have been common throughout
history, but Americans have never been quite comfortable with them. In
fact, much of U.S. foreign policy dating back to independence has
consisted of efforts to prevent rival powers from establishing such
domains. In the nineteenth century, U.S. leaders rejected the idea that
any European power should have a sphere of influence in North America or
the Western Hemisphere at large. They maneuvered---often quite
ruthlessly---to evict European powers from these areas. At the turn of
the twentieth century, the United States took this regional policy
global. [The so-called Open Door policy aimed to dissuade foreign powers
from carving up China, and later all of East Asia, into exclusive
spheres]{.underline}. [Washington joined World War I in part to prevent
Germany from becoming the dominant European power]{.underline}. A
generation later, the United States fought to deny Japan a sphere of
influence in the Pacific and prevent Hitler from establishing primacy
over the entire Old World. During and after World War II, Washington
also engaged in quieter diplomatic and economic efforts to accelerate
the dissolution of the British Empire. [Even during the Cold War,
Americans never fully accepted Soviet control over eastern
Europe]{.underline}. The Truman and Eisenhower administrations sought to
roll back the Iron Curtain through ideological warfare and covert
action; later administrations expanded trade and diplomatic ties with
Warsaw Pact states as a subtler way of undermining Kremlin control. The
Reagan administration overtly and covertly supported political movements
that were challenging the Kremlin's authority from within. And when
Washington had a chance to peacefully destroy the Soviet sphere of
influence after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it did, supporting German
unification and the expansion of NATO. **[Opposition to spheres of
influence, in other words, is a part of U.S. diplomatic
DNA]{.underline}**. The reason for this, Charles Edel and I argued in
2018, is that [spheres of influence clash with fundamental tenets of
U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. Among them is the United States'
approach to security, which holds that safeguarding the country's vital
interests and physical well-being requires preventing rival powers from
establishing a foothold in the Western Hemisphere or dominating
strategically important regions overseas. Likewise, **[the United
States' emphasis on promoting liberty and free trade translates to a
concern that spheres of influence---particularly those dominated by
authoritarian powers---would impede the spread of U.S. values and allow
hostile powers to block American trade and investment]{.underline}**.
Finally, spheres of influence do not mesh well with American
exceptionalism---the notion that the United States should transcend the
old, corrupt ways of balance-of-power diplomacy and establish a more
humane, democratic system of international relations. Of course, that
intellectual tradition did not stop the United States from building its
own sphere of influence in Latin America from the early nineteenth
century onward, nor did it prevent it from drawing large chunks of
Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East into a global sphere of influence
after World War II. Yet [the same tradition has led t[he United
States]{.mark} to [run its sphere of influence far more progressively
than past great powers, which is why far more countries have sought to
join that sphere than to leave i]{.mark}t]{.underline}. [And since
**hypocrisy is another venerable tradition in global affairs**, it is
not surprising that Americans would establish their own, relatively
enlightened sphere of influence while denying the legitimacy of everyone
else's]{.underline}. That endeavor reached its zenith in the post--Cold
War era, when the [collapse of the Soviet bloc made it possible to
envision a world in which **Washington's sphere of influence---also
known as the liberal international order---was the only game in
town**]{.underline}. **[The United States maintained a world-beating
military that could intervene around the globe; preserved and expanded a
global alliance structure as a check on aggression; and sought to
integrate potential challengers, namely Beijing and Moscow, into a
U.S.-led system]{.underline}**. It was a remarkably ambitious project,
as Allison rightly notes, but it was the culmination of, rather than a
departure from, a diplomatic tradition reaching back two centuries. GIVE
THEM AN INCH... The post--Cold War moment is over, and the prospect of a
divided world has returned. [Russia is projecting power in the Middle
East and staking a claim to dominance in its "near abroad."]{.underline}
[China is seeking primacy in the western Pacific and Southeast Asia and
using its diplomatic and economic influence to draw countries around the
world more tightly into its orbit]{.underline}. [Both have developed the
tools needed to coerce their neighbors and keep U.S. forces at
bay]{.underline}. Allison is one of several analysts who have recently
advanced the argument that the United States should make a virtue of
necessity---that it should accept Russian and Chinese spheres of
influence, encompassing some portion of eastern Europe and the western
Pacific, as the price of stability and peace. The logic is twofold:
first, to create a cleaner separation between contending parties by
clearly marking where one's influence ends and the other's begins; and
second, to reduce the chances of conflict by giving rising or resurgent
powers a safe zone along their borders. In theory, this seems like a
reasonable way of preventing competition from turning into outright
conflict, especially given that countries such as Taiwan and the Baltic
states lie thousands of miles from the United States but on the
doorsteps of its rivals. Yet in reality, [a spheres-of-influence world
would bring more peril than safety]{.underline}. **[Russia's and China's
spheres of influence would inevitably be domains of coercion and
authoritarianism]{.underline}**. [Both countries are run by illiberal,
autocratic regimes; their leaders see democratic values as profoundly
threatening to their political survival]{.underline}. **[If Moscow and
Beijing dominated their respective neighborhoods, they would naturally
seek to undermine democratic governments that resist their control---as
China is already doing in Taiwan and as Russia is doing in Ukraine---or
that challenge, through their very existence, the legitimacy of
authoritarian rule]{.underline}**. **[The practical consequence of
acceding to authoritarian spheres of influence would be to intensify the
crisis of democracy]{.underline}** that afflicts the world today. **[The
United States would suffer economically]{.underline}**, too. [China, in
particular, is a mercantilist power already working to turn Asian
economies toward Beijing and could one day put the United States at a
severe disadvantage on the world's most economically dynamic
continent]{.underline}. Washington should not concede a Chinese sphere
of influence unless it is also willing to compromise the "Open Door"
principles that have animated its statecraft for over a century. Such
costs might be acceptable in exchange for peace and security. But
[spheres of influence during the Cold War did not prevent the Soviets
from repeatedly testing American redlines in Berlin, causing high-stakes
crises in which nuclear war was a real possibility]{.underline}. [Nor
did those spheres prevent the two sides from competing sharply, and
sometimes violently, throughout the "Third World."]{.underline}
Throughout history, spheres-of-influence settlements, from the Thirty
Years' Peace between Athens and Sparta to the Peace of Amiens between
the United Kingdom and Napoleonic France have often ended, sooner or
later, in war. **[The idea that spheres of influence are a formula for
peace rests on assumptions that often go unexamined: that revisionist
powers are driven primarily by insecurity, that their grievances are
limited and can be easily satisfied, that the truly vital interests of
competing powers do not conflict, and that creative statecraft can
therefore fashion an enduring, mutually acceptable
equilibrium]{.underline}**. [The trouble is that these premises don't
always hold]{.underline}. **[Ideology and the quest for greatness---not
simply insecurity---often drive great powers]{.underline}**. **[Rising
states are continually tempted to renegotiate previous bargains once
they have the power to do so]{.underline}**. **[Offering concessions to
a revisionist state may simply convince it that the existing order is
fragile and can be tested further]{.underline}**. **[Conceding a sphere
of influence to a great-power challenger might not produce stability but
simply give that challenger a better position from which to realize its
ambitions]{.underline}**. Consider the situation in the western Pacific.
[The most minimal Chinese sphere of influence would surely include
Taiwan]{.underline}. [Yet if Taiwan became a platform for Chinese
military capabilities, the defense of other U.S. allies in the region,
such as Japan and the Philippines, would become vastly more
difficult]{.underline}. **[Nor would such a concession likely satisfy
Chinese ambitions]{.underline}**. A growing body of literature by
scholars such as Toshi Yoshihara, James Holmes, Liza Tobin, and
Elizabeth Economy suggests that **[China desires at the very least to
push the United States beyond the chain of islands running from Japan to
Taiwan to the Philippines. Even a limited Chinese sphere in the western
Pacific would serve as a springboard to this larger
objective]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, **[the United States will have
sacrificed a number of critical advantages by pulling
out]{.underline}**. A free Taiwan offers proof that Chinese culture and
democracy are not incompatible; subjugating Taiwan would also allow
Beijing to remove this ideological threat. Worse still, [the United
States would lose the edge that comes from being the only great power
without significant security hazards near its borders]{.underline}. [It
was only after the United States achieved dominance in the Western
Hemisphere that it could project power globally]{.underline}. **[Russia
and China, by contrast, still have to deal with U.S. allies, partners,
and military presences in their own backyards---a circumstance that
diverts resources they might otherwise use to pursue more distant
ambitions and compete with the United States at a truly global
scale]{.underline}**. MEASURES OF POWER Fortunately, **[new spheres of
influence are avoidable]{.underline}**. **[Russia is a formidable player
because of its willingness to take risks and pursue asymmetric
strategies; but Moscow will not rebuild a meaningful sphere of influence
so long as the United States opposes that ambition]{.underline}**. In
Europe, Russia is still dramatically outmatched. Admittedly, on NATO's
eastern flank, geography and the local balance of power favor Moscow;
but even there, the alliance has been strengthening its capabilities for
several years. Studies by the RAND Corporation show that with the right
troop deployments, [NATO could establish a credible---and
affordable---deterrent to Russian aggression without posing any
offensive threat]{.underline}. Russia, meanwhile, has struggled even to
pull Ukraine back into its orbit: although Russian-backed separatists
are waging a bloody war in the eastern part of the country, and Moscow
has annexed Crimea, western Ukraine has gravitated toward Europe and the
United States since 2014. [And although Russia can wield some influence
in the Middle East, it can emerge as the region's primary outside power
only if the United States abandons its role there]{.underline}. The
extent of China's power makes the situation in the western Pacific more
difficult. Yet **[Beijing will have trouble dominating the region in the
same way that the United States came to dominate the
Caribbean]{.underline}**. **[China's neighbors are not
pushovers]{.underline}**. Many have the diplomatic and military support
of the United States, and some, such as Japan, are major powers in their
own right. [What is more, China must project military power across large
bodies of water if it is to establish authority in the region, and to do
so is inherently difficult]{.underline}. [It will be all the more
difficult if U.S. regional allies invest in the capabilities needed to
inflict high costs on any assault and if Washington refines its
capabilities and concepts for countering Chinese
aggression]{.underline}. The regional military balance will not ever
revert to what it was in 1996, when Washington could face down Beijing's
attempts to intimidate Taiwan by sailing two carrier strike groups into
the waters off China's coast; but with the right investments and
strategies, the United States and its allies can lengthen the odds of
Chinese regional dominance. Perhaps in recognition of this fact, China
is also using information operations, economic blandishments, and other
forms of political meddling to weaken the region's resistance to its
power. Yet [some countries are already working to reduce their
vulnerability to economic and political coercion]{.underline}. Australia
has undertaken a major campaign to highlight malign Chinese influence;
Japan is actively seeking to limit its dependence on supply chains that
run through China. Washington may have done more by itself than China
has done to undermine U.S. economic power in the region, through its
withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and its
tardiness in developing alternatives, together with its allies, to
Chinese technology, investment, and lending. These policy errors are
damaging, but they are still within the United States' power to correct.
DON\'T GIVE UP YET [The prospects for maintaining favorable regional
balances of power are far better than the skeptics assume]{.underline}.
**[What is essential, however, is that Washington not erode those
balances by severing ties with vulnerable allies and partners on the
frontlines]{.underline}**. Allison suggests that doing so might be
necessary to bring U.S. capabilities in line with commitments and reduce
friction with rising powers. Yet the effect of abandoning the Baltic
allies or breaking the ambiguous commitment to Taiwan would be to make
it impossible for those countries to ward off Chinese or Russian
influence and to demoralize other U.S. allies around them. Washington
would be paving the way for just the authoritarian spheres of influence
it should---and can---avoid. The United States has a distinguished
record of breaking down authoritarian spheres of influence, first in its
own hemisphere and then beyond. **[It should not now make the historic
blunder of throwing that achievement away for an illusory promise of
stability or as a premature concession to a darker future that need not
come to pass]{.underline}**.

[This isn't the same thing as saying]{.underline} that a
Chinese-American [war won\'t happen. Conflict tends to occur when one
party decides]{.underline} that [war]{.underline}, or actions risking
war, [is preferable to]{.underline} living with [the status quo or
backing down]{.underline} in a crisis. [That could happen all too
easily.]{.underline} If China concludes that Taiwan is distancing itself
too far from the mainland politically, as the balance of power shifts in
Beijing\'s favor militarily, then it might decide that war is better
than letting the dream of reunification slip away. If Chinese leaders
worry that their domestic legitimacy is slipping, they might behave more
belligerently in a crisis, for fear that war is less dangerous than
humiliation. [Beijing might]{.underline} even [gamble that the U.S.
would stay out of a short, sharp war with Japan over the Senkaku Islands
or the Philippines over Scarborough Shoal, and that]{.underline} gamble
[might not pay off.]{.underline} But [in any of these cases, Beijing
would be making a **deliberate choice**]{.underline} to seek key
objectives through the use of coercion or force, with the knowledge that
a larger conflict is a real possibility. If a U.S.-China war results
from such a choice, [it could hardly be called an accident.]{.underline}
Why does this matter? Because it bears on the best way of avoiding war
in the Pacific. Establishing memorandums of understanding on how
military forces operating in close proximity should conduct themselves,
creating mechanisms for communication in a crisis, and other steps to
encourage de-escalation is helpful. [What is critical]{.underline},
however, [is maintaining the military balance of power, and the
**perception of U.S. commitment**, that makes it **less likely** that
**Chinese leaders**]{.underline} could **[imagine a war]{.underline}**
in the region [**going their way**.]{.underline} That is a huge and
urgent task. It involves not just spending money but devising
operational concepts and new capabilities, such as autonomous systems
and artificial intelligence, that make it prohibitively difficult for
China to project power. [It requires **strengthening U.S. alliances**
that have atrophied or]{.underline} been [damaged]{.underline} during
the administration of President Donald Trump. That agenda may seem
daunting, given how badly the situation in the Western Pacific has
eroded. Yet Americans shouldn\'t fool themselves into thinking that just
managing crises and mitigating misperception --- as important as those
objectives are --- offer a cheaper way to preserve the peace.

**Roy 2019**

\[Denny, Senior Fellow at the East--West Center, "Assertive China:
Irredentism or Expansionism?", Survival, Vol. 61, No. 1\]

[What is driving Chinese behaviour]{.underline}? **[Beijing's
explanation of its own foreign policy draws a sharp distinction between
China's general external orientation and the specific case of
territorial-sovereignty issues]{.underline}**. **[According to the
Communist Party, China is fundamentally a peace-loving,
defence-oriented, non-expansionist country that is harmless in most
situations]{.underline}**. [Since the early 1990s, Chinese officials,
media and scholars have consistently made the case for Chinese
exceptionalism]{.underline}: that for cultural and historical reasons,
China is a 'principled' country that eschews the usual great-power
avarice, and therefore the world need not fear that a strong China will
bully weaker countries. In Xi's own words, 'No matter how strong its
economy grows, China will never seek hegemony, expansion or sphere of
influence.'8 This has become a mantra from Xi and other senior Chinese
leaders. A similar formulation -- one that has often been repeated by
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang -- is 'we will not take or occupy an inch of
others' land'.9 **[At the same time, however, China is uncompromising
and resolute to the point of being willing to use military force when it
comes to asserting Chinese control over territory the country claims for
its own]{.underline}**. [In one of many speeches in which he recommitted
to opposing 'acts and tricks to separate the country', Xi warned that
'The Chinese people ... have the spirit of fighting the bloody battle
against our enemies to the bitter end.']{.underline}10 **[The recovery
of lost national territory has been a major theme of modern Chinese
history, and the Communist Party has staked its own legitimacy on how
successfully it accomplishes this goal]{.underline}**. Since the 1980s,
[the regime has strongly promoted the notion of China as a victim of
foreign predation prior to Mao Zedong's establishment of the People's
Republic in 1949 in order to mobilise public support for the government
and its policies]{.underline}.11 **[Party officials place 'lost'
territory in the context of what they call the 'Century of Humiliation'
by emphasising that foreigners invaded these areas during times when
China was too weak to defend itself]{.underline}**. Accordingly, **[the
Communist Party is obligated to distinguish itself from unworthy
governments of the past by re-establishing Beijing's control over
Chinese-claimed territories]{.underline}**. In recent years, **[Beijing
has introduced the idea that China's 'rejuvenation' cannot occur without
the recovery of lost Chinese territory]{.underline}**.12 [This principle
is most often applied to Taiwan]{.underline}. The political unification
of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland has long been deemed a 'core
interest' of the party, a designation that signals its highest level of
commitment -- and a willingness to go to war if necessary. Thus, a
Chinese diplomat posted to the Chinese embassy in Washington DC
responded to the suggestion that US ships might visit Taiwan by saying,
'The day that a U.S. Navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that
our People's Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force.'13
Compared with the Taiwan issue, Beijing's commitment to securing
uncontested ownership of uninhabited maritime territories in the East
and South China seas, or the Indian-occupied region of Arunachal
Pradesh, is less insistent.14 Nevertheless, [Chinese behaviour over the
past couple of decades suggests Beijing intends to solidify rather than
bargain away its claim over most of the South China Sea]{.underline}.15
**[The trend is toward China's hardening of even its non-core
claims]{.underline}**. [Focusing on irredentism as the driver of the
foreign policies most worrisome to China's neighbours allows the
communist regime to claim that its pugnacious and uncooperative posture
in its near abroad is not typical of how great-power China will conduct
its foreign relations]{.underline}. This approach is well suited to
Beijing's purposes: it conveys to China's neighbours that they cannot
prevail in any territorial disputes with China, but that otherwise they
have nothing to fear. As Xi put it in June 2018, 'We cannot lose even
one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors. What is other
people's, we do not want at all.'16 The expansionist explanation [An
alternative explanation for assertive Chinese behaviour on the country's
periphery -- one that Beijing explicitly denies -- is that China is
growing more expansionist as its relative power increases]{.underline}.
**[It is demanding more because it can]{.underline}**. Typical great
powers strive to establish a sphere of influence, regardless of whether
they have grounds for irredentist claims. They are usually dissatisfied
if their influence over the international system falls short of their
perceived relative power.17 Seen in this way, **[assertive Chinese
behaviour is not necessarily limited to the special case of disputed
territory]{.underline}**. [This raises the possibility that China's
determination to prevail in these disputes, through the use of military
force if necessary, might also manifest itself in future Chinese
strategic disagreements with regional countries that do not involve
Chinese sovereignty claims]{.underline}. **[The essential features of a
sphere of influence are control and exclusivity: the dominant country
enjoys privileges in a geographic region outside of its recognised
borders that other states do not enjoy]{.underline}**. [These privileges
serve the dominant country's economic or security interests, or
both]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has tried to make
itself the sole great power in its own hemisphere. The 1823 Monroe
Doctrine warned Europe against further colonisation of the New World.
The Roosevelt Corollary in 1904 asserted the right of the US government
to resolve legitimate European complaints in Latin America, and
afterward American forces frequently intervened in the hemisphere in
support of US interests. During the first half of the twentieth century,
an upstart Japan acquired an economic hinterland in eastern Asia,
administered by colonial or puppet governments, to provide the Japanese
home islands with resources and markets. After the Second World War, the
Soviet Union sought to establish a political and military buffer zone in
Eastern Europe. Moscow organised the Warsaw Pact in 1955 out of a fear
of a resurgent West Germany allied with the United States and the other
Western European countries. Determined to maintain satellite governments
in the region, the Soviet government sent military forces to quell
dissent against the ruling regimes in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia
in 1968. Similarly, **[Beijing demands exclusive control, mainly based
on ownership rights, over areas on the Chinese periphery for both
economic and security reasons]{.underline}**. [The Chinese government
insists that other states must not take resources from Chinese-claimed
areas in the South China Sea]{.underline}. [Hence the annual fishing
ban, the expulsion of non-Chinese fishing boats and the harassment of
survey ships making preparations to drill for hydrocarbons]{.underline}.
Additionally, Beijing's complaints about US military surveillance and
the US Navy's 'freedom of navigation' patrols make clear that the
Chinese want to create a zone near China's borders in which US military
activity is constrained and subject to veto by Beijing. Much depends on
whether outside observers accept China's own characterisation of its
foreign policy as having limited aims, or whether the country is
perceived as having much broader goals. A policy motivated by
irredentism has limited aims by definition, because the set of
geographic areas over which China can make a reasonable claim of
sovereignty is finite. A policy of expansionism, on the other hand, is
potentially open-ended in its aspirations. **[Beijing's arguments have,
in fact, established a foothold internationally]{.underline}**. Some
analysts say China's behaviour in its near abroad is reasonable and
should not alarm foreign governments. Rob **[Green]{.underline}** has
argued that China 'feels entitled to defend its interests in its own
backyard, especially when history is on its side regarding the disputed
islands in the East and South China Seas'. In particular, he describes
China's East China Sea ADIZ as a 'long-delayed response, under severe
provocation from the US and Japan, to the Japanese ADIZ', adding that
'The US, Russia, UK and France have had their own unilaterally declared
zones for years.'18 Similarly, Richard **[Turcsanyi]{.underline}** sees
**[Chinese 'assertiveness' in the South China Sea as a defensive
reaction to acts by other governments]{.underline}**, such as the
Philippines' attempts to bolster its position on Second Thomas Shoal and
Scarborough Shoal, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, and
Washington's announced policy of 'pivoting' or 'rebalancing' to Asia.19
Gavin **[Choo]{.underline}** has argued that assertive Chinese behaviour
is less threatening if the presumed motivation for it is irredentism. He
says an understanding of the deep-seated Chinese sense of entitlement to
regional leadership and historical grievance over the loss of this
position leads to a 'more benign interpretation of Beijing's foreign
policy'.20 Some observers contend that Chinese policies toward the
disputed territories are not a harbinger of expansionism. 'One should be
cautious about generalizing from these maritime disputes to Chinese
foreign policy writ large', writes Alastair Iain
**[Johnston]{.underline}**.21 Likewise, Kyle **[Haynes]{.underline}**
asserts that: there is little indication that Chinese leaders harbor
territorial ambitions beyond what was claimed in the immediate
post-World War II period ... The more aggressive pursuit of longstanding
claims does not necessarily portend new, more expansive claims down the
road.22 Although some critics accused him of being anti-China, Malcolm
Turnbull said during his premiership of Australia that in the context of
international security, 'We do not describe China as a threat' because
'we do not see any hostile intent from China'.23 Mark
**[Valencia]{.underline}** characterises Chinese claims in the South
China Sea not as a manifestation of China's will to power, but rather as
a product of nationalism combined with a sense of historical
victimisation. 'China has publicly positioned its sovereignty and claims
in the South China Sea as a matter of national dignity and redemption
for its "century of humiliation"', he writes. Consequently, the Chinese
government 'need\[s\] to accommodate' the demands of a nationalistic
Chinese public 'to maintain legitimacy', making it 'very difficult for
China's leadership to back down'. Valencia concludes that US challenges
to Chinese claims in the South China Sea are 'ill-advised and even
dangerous'.24 Similarly, Charles **[Glaser]{.underline}** argues that
China is willing to fight to take 'disputed' territory such as Taiwan
and the South China Sea islands but not for the territory of US allies
'when the status quo is crystal clear', implying that the main driver of
Chinese behaviour is irredentism and not a desire for a sphere of
influence. Aside from the areas where China claims sovereignty, 'there
is actually little reason to believe that \[China\] has or will develop
grand territorial ambitions in its region or beyond', says Glaser.25
Doug **[Bandow]{.underline}** argues the United States should avoid
confronting China over Beijing's South China Sea claims because 'the
existing territorial and juridical order was established at a time of
Chinese isolation and weakness'. He claims that Chinese actions are
motivated by national pride, and that acquiescence to Chinese claims
would have insignificant negative strategic impact on US interests.26
Similarly, Erwin **[Blaauw]{.underline}** sees no intrinsic Chinese
aspiration to control its external strategic environment. 'In the end,'
he writes, 'the over-arching driving factor behind foreign policy in
China, and the common denominator to most of China's global activities,
is China's own domestic economic development. China does not view itself
as a superpower or a hegemon.'27 Ambrose
**[Evans-Pritchard]{.underline}** seems to buy the Communist Party's
historical and cultural arguments, writing that 'The Chinese have no
recent history of sweeping territorial expansion (except Tibet) ...
\[T\]he Confucian ethic will over time incline China to a quest for
global as well as national concord.'28 A critique of the irredentist
paradigm **[Beijing's irredentist paradigm rests on three key
propositions: that China is an exceptional great power with limited
aims; that China is belligerent and uncompromising only over the
territory it now claims as rightfully its own, but nothing beyond; and
that China will never seek hegemony or a sphere of
influence]{.underline}**. For the purposes of accurately assessing
Chinese intentions and crafting appropriate policy responses,
**[accepting this paradigm is deeply problematic]{.underline}**, for
several reasons. [**It lends undue credence to Chinese propaganda**
While the official Chinese narrative offers a plausible explanation for
China's combative behaviour, it does not necessarily follow that the
country will not be assertive in other areas]{.underline}. To make the
point bluntly, **[if an adversary says 'I will kill your neighbour, but
I will not kill you', and then kills your neighbour, this does not prove
that you are safe, only that your adversary is capable of
murder]{.underline}**. [**It lowers the costs of aggression for China
and could mitigate the effects of the security dilemma** Many theorists,
including defensive realists, argue that the security dilemma acts as a
powerful disincentive against a state taking strong, unilateral action
to enhance control over its external environment]{.underline}. Other
states might interpret that action as indicative of aggressive
intentions and therefore see it as threatening, causing them to take
counteractions. As a result, the state that acted first might find that
it has effectually decreased rather than increased its own security.29
[This dynamic could be attenuated, however, if a state found a way to
cloak strong, even aggressive external action in a rationale that
limited the alarm caused to other states]{.underline}. [In such a
circumstance, even a closeted revisionist]{.underline}30 [state could
pay a discounted price, in the form of relatively weak counteraction by
its neighbours, for moves that would ordinarily galvanise more
determined and multilateral opposition]{.underline}. [**It legitimises
questionable Chinese territorial claims** The territorial holdings and
borders of a state tend to fluctuate through history]{.underline}. These
fluctuations are greater in the case of a large state with a long
history. The principle that a state should today control every bit of
territory it claims to have controlled at some time in the past is naive
and unrealistic. Many of today's states have 'lost' territory, yet do
not demand its return under the threat of military action. As Frank
Ching points out, [**China has been much more of a beneficiary than a
victim of expansionism**: 'China grew by subjugating neighbouring
peoples,' he writes, 'such as those who lived in what's now called
Xinjiang, whose very name -- "new territory" -- confirms the fact that
it didn't use to be part of China.']{.underline}31 **[The willingness of
the Chinese government to resort to violence to defend its territorial
claims is out of proportion to the strength of many of these
claims]{.underline}**. [In particular, the country's claim over almost
the entire South China Sea based on 'historical usage' by Chinese
mariners is patently absurd, analogous to the United States claiming
ownership of the Pacific Ocean between the US west coast and the
Hawaiian islands]{.underline}. This claim, along with China's occupation
of features within the EEZ of the Philippines, and its insistence that
Chinese-held rocks, shoals and sandbars in the Spratly group are
entitled to the rights legally bestowed on 'islands', have all been
invalidated by the arbitration process provided for in the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea, of which Beijing is a signatory. [China could
make a reasonably good case for some of its other claims if it chose to
respect the accepted process that is already in pl]{.underline}ace.
Other countries should encourage China to take full advantage of the
applicable international laws and institutions to seek redress for its
grievances. Acquiescing in any way to the idea that China has the right
to settle its political disputes with its smaller neighbours through
coercion or brute force is a moral and political failure, with negative
long-term consequences for the project of civilising international
affairs. [**It allows China to practise a form of extortion against
other states** All governments recognise that the notion of defending
national territory under threat of being seized by foreigners has a
powerful mobilising effect on public opinion]{.underline}. [The
territorial disputes involving China tap into deep historical
wellsprings of wounded national pride]{.underline}. Consequently, China
benefits from a mass-public version of the 'madman theory',32 whereby
the Chinese public is beyond thinking rationally about this issue, and
the Chinese government unable to resist citizens' demands for fear of
being overthrown, meaning that other countries must accommodate Chinese
claims. [Many have warned that foreign governments should avoid making
policies that inflame **Chinese nationalism**]{.underline}.33 **[It is
questionable, however, whether nationalistic public opinion really
drives Chinese behaviour with regard to the disputed
territories]{.underline}**. **[To at least some extent, the reverse is
true]{.underline}**.34 [Moreover, Beijing has frequently facilitated
demonstrations of public outrage against foreigners and then used this
outrage as leverage in China's foreign relations]{.underline}.35 Other
governments make Beijing's problems their own when they honour the
communist regime's need to satisfy the demands of a nationalistic
Chinese public. **[They reward Beijing for bad behaviour -- for its
playing up of territorial disputes in domestic propaganda, sometimes
with unintended results, and its intentional cultivation of visible
public anger as a means of signalling to foreigners that the Chinese
government has no room to retreat or compromise]{.underline}**. **[It
could incentivise China to raise new irredentist claims in the
future]{.underline}** Beyond the territory now encompassed or claimed by
the People's Republic, there are additional territories over which China
might claim some form of historical association. The late historian
Ramesh Chandra Majumdar observed, 'It is characteristic of China that if
a region once acknowledged her nominal suzerainty even for a short
period, she should regard it as a part of her empire forever and would
automatically revive her claim over it even after a thousand years
whenever there was a chance of enforcing it.'36 Chinese claims have
evolved, or more properly expanded, in keeping with its evolution from a
poor, revolution-wracked underachiever into an emerging great power. The
Republic of China cartographers who first drew a nine-dashed line on a
map of the South China Sea in 1946 intended it to delineate
Chinese-claimed islands, but not the surrounding ocean. The People's
Republic's 1958 'Declaration on the Territorial Sea' claimed ownership
of South China Sea islands and the territorial waters around them, but
recognised that they were separated from the Chinese mainland by 'high
seas'. [The Chinese government did not begin to assert that it had
'historic rights' to all the resources contained within the nine-dashed
line until 1998]{.underline}.37 Similarly, [China's claims in the East
China Sea are of recent vintage]{.underline}. [A 1953 edition of the
People's Daily noted that the 'Senkaku' (not Diaoyu) islands belonged to
the Ryukyu archipelago, then and now Japanese territory]{.underline}. An
atlas published by a government-owned press in 1958 depicted the
Senkakus as part of Japan.38 A possible future target is strategically
important Okinawa. In 2013, Chinese commentators with government
connections publicly questioned Japan's ownership of the Ryukyu islands,
which include Okinawa and its many US military bases. Separate articles
making this point appeared in the Communist Party-run People's Daily and
Global Times, as well as a magazine affiliated with China's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.39 Additionally, Chinese PLA General Luo Yuan said in a
media interview in 2013 that the islands were part of the Chinese
tributary system as early as 1372, and that Japan stole them in 1872
during a period of relative Chinese weakness. In making this argument,
Luo added the Ryukyus to the list of territories lost during the Century
of Humiliation alongside Taiwan. 'We can say with certainty', Luo
concluded, 'that the Ryukyus do not belong to Japan.'40 **[A
sphere-of-influence mentality China's irredentist claims cover an area
so vast that it is already tantamount to a sphere of
influence]{.underline}**. [On China's lengthy eastern coast, for
example, the disputed land and maritime territories form a seamless
geographic region beginning with the Yellow Sea in the north and
continuing southward through the East China Sea, Taiwan and the Taiwan
Strait, and the upper and lower halves of the South China Sea,
apparently stretching as far south as the Natuna islands]{.underline}.
Chinese officials have repeatedly said that they would continue to allow
commercial shipping through major sea lanes in these areas, and it is
possible that Beijing would make additional concessions to individual
rival claimants that accepted its standing invitation to settle claims
through bilateral negotiations. But China would nonetheless retain the
unequalled privilege of setting the rules for the activities of other
states in this zone. Moreover, **[China has shown itself to have a
sphere-of-influence mentality that is independent of its irredentist
claims]{.underline}**. On occasion, [Chinese senior officials have
revealed that they see China as deserving of deference from 'smaller
countries']{.underline}. **[This attitude is apparent in Beijing's
demands that its neighbours grant privileges to China]{.underline}**.41
The Yellow Sea, for example, is the site of a dispute between China and
South Korea over overlapping EEZs. China has exhibited domineering
behaviour in this area that has less to do with any sovereignty dispute
than with a sense of entitlement due to China's status as a larger
country. The South Korean coastguard has frequently clashed with Chinese
fishermen in areas of the Yellow Sea that are unambiguously under
Seoul's administration. Chinese boats approached by South Korean
coastguard vessels have frequently tried to ram them and repel boarding
officers with pipes, iron bars, knives and hammers. Between 2008 and
2016, Seoul reported that Chinese fishermen had killed two of its
coastguardsmen and injured 73.42 In 2010, Washington announced a US
aircraft carrier would join US-- South Korean naval exercises in
response to North Korea's sinking of the South Korean navy vessel
Cheonan. Chinese media unleashed a storm of opposition to what it termed
US 'gunboat diplomacy'. The basis of this opposition was not a
territorial-sovereignty claim, but rather the lack of deference shown by
the United States to China's desire that a US aircraft carrier not be
present in the region. 'The decision should be made with consideration
given to China's wishes', said one Chinese commentator. 'It's a matter
of the dignity of a big country', said another.43 A few years later, a
worsening North Korean missile threat prompted Seoul to consider
deploying the US-made Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
anti-missile system. Beijing strenuously objected, even though China
itself has a similar system in Shandong province to protect the country
from North Korean missiles.44 Beijing argued that THAAD could slightly
compromise China's nuclear second-strike capability by using its
powerful radar to track Chinese missile launches. The US government said
China's stated concerns were unfounded and invited China to send a
delegation for a technical briefing, but the Chinese side refused. When
Seoul made the decision in 2016 to deploy THAAD, China responded with
several months of economic punishment that ended only when Beijing
extracted three important concessions from South Korean President Moon
Jae-in about limiting further US--South Korea security cooperation. In
this case, China insisted that a marginal Chinese security concern
outweighed the compelling security concern of its smaller neighbour, and
that Seoul's insubordination justified harsh Chinese retaliation. [While
Beijing criticises the US military for conducting patrols and
surveillance in the western Pacific rim, Beijing simultaneously claims
the right to carry out its own patrols near neighbouring
Japan]{.underline}. For example, in July 2017, a PLA Navy surveillance
ship sailed through Japanese territorial waters between the main islands
of Honshu and Hokkaido. When Japan publicised the incident, the Chinese
government said, 'Japan has ulterior motives with its accusations and
hyping up of the situation.'45 That same month, after Japan complained
about six Chinese bombers flying over the Miyako Strait that separates
the Japanese islands of Miyako and Okinawa (but that does not lie within
Japanese territorial airspace), China's defence ministry released a
statement saying, 'The relevant side should not make a fuss about
nothing or over-interpret, it will be fine once they get used to it.'46
Beijing has gone so far as to demand that Japan stop scrambling aircraft
to observe Chinese planes and ships operating near its territory --
something every country with an air force does routinely, including
China. On one occasion in 2015, a Chinese defence-ministry spokesman
said Japan's 'following of, surveillance and interference with Chinese
ships and aircraft' was 'threatening \[their\] safety'. He called on
Japan to 'stop behavior that hampers Chinese freedom of flight'.47 The
statement was blatantly hypocritical considering the crash between the
Chinese fighter aircraft and the American P-3 in 2001, and the multiple
cases of Chinese vessels ramming foreign ships. [Elsewhere, **Beijing
does not refrain from leveraging its strong economic position to
influence other countries' views on important political issues in which
China has an interest**]{.underline}. Phnom Penh's effort to support
Beijing by blocking Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
criticism of China's South China Sea claims, for example, is well
known.48 Cambodia has also helped China to achieve its aim of reducing
the US military presence in the region. [It cancelled military exercises
with the United States and Australia in 2017, and it sent home a US Navy
Seabee construction unit that had been providing humanitarian assistance
for nine years]{.underline}.49 [As elsewhere, the Chinese have
demonstrated a hankering for exclusivity and control in
Cambodia]{.underline}. \* \* \* [To the extent that Beijing is
successful in promoting the perception that its assertive foreign and
military policies are motivated by legitimate national grievances and
overwhelming public pressure, China's neighbours are more likely to see
the country's policies as reasonable, its aims as strictly limited and
its profile as that of an exceptionally benevolent great
power]{.underline}. **[Given that there are reasonable grounds for
suspecting that China is a revisionist state disguised as a status quo
state, and that it would still desire a sphere of influence even in the
absence of any territorial disputes, this may be a strategic
miscalculation]{.underline}**. **[International-relations theory offers
two competing models of inter-state conflict: the deterrence model and
the spiral model]{.underline}**.50 [The two models **prescribe nearly
opposite policy responses to an assertive state**, depending on the
diagnosis of its root motivations]{.underline}. [The deterrence model
treats assertive states as expansionist and sees their primary goal as
grabbing territory, resources and power]{.underline}. In this view,
**[appeasement will only encourage further expansionism]{.underline}**.
**[The proper response by threatened states is to signal resolute
resistance as early as possible: the assertive state will be harder to
defeat the more resources it gains control of]{.underline}**. [The
spiral model, on the other hand, sees conflict as a tragic
misunderstanding. In this model, the assertive state perceives itself as
fundamentally insecure, and its seeming bellicosity is driven by an
impulse to protect itself]{.underline}. Other states are advised to make
themselves appear less threatening to pacify the assertive state and
alleviate the risk of conflict, in particular by making unilateral
concessions demonstrating a decrease in both their intent and ability to
harm the assertive state. [China's neighbours face a choice between
acquiescing to Beijing's territorial demands and trusting in its
assurances that China is a harmless giant, or standing firm against what
may be viewed as unreasonable Chinese demands stemming from an appetite
for power limited only by opportunity and feasibility]{.underline}. In
making this decision, they would be wise to remember that **[other
historical great powers did not rely on claims of recovering 'territory
left behind by our ancestors' to establish the Monroe Doctrine, the
Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and the Warsaw
Pact]{.underline}**. **[Wrapping the country's policies in a cloak of
irredentism may serve China's interests well, but could be diverting
attention away from the threat of Chinese encroachment]{.underline}**.

[The sources of Chinese conduct While novel in certain respects, the
policies now being pursued by Xi Jinping are a response to the same
forces, and to a similar blend of ambition and anxiety, as those that
shaped the policies of his predecessors]{.underline}. Indeed, [rather
than being a radical departure from the past, Xi's approach is actually
a lineal descendant of the one put in place under Deng in the early
1990s]{.underline}. Before turning to a brief description of current
Chinese strategy and the process through which it evolved, it is
important to identify the underlying factors that have been central in
shaping it. Three, in particular, stand out. Geopolitics Like virtually
every other fast-rising power in history (including the United States),
**[China seeks to reshape the international environment, starting with
its immediate neighbourhood, in ways that better reflect its strength
and serve its interests]{.underline}**. [The nation's rulers want to
secure China's 'place in the sun': they aim to alter geographical
boundaries, institutional structures, rules, norms and hierarchies of
prestige that were put in place when their country was relatively weak,
and which they therefore regard as illegitimate and, in certain
respects, threatening]{.underline}. History [China is not just any
rising power; it is a nation with a long and proud history as the
leading centre of East Asian civilisation and a more recent, inglorious
experience of domination and humiliation at the hands of foreign
intruders]{.underline}. **[China's leaders see their country as not
merely rising, but rather returning to a position of regional
pre-eminence that it once held and which they (and many of their people)
regard as natural and appropriate]{.underline}**. Regime **[China is
ruled by a one-party authoritarian regime that is determined at all
costs to retain its exclusive grip on political power, and which feels
itself to be constantly under threat from enemies, foreign and
domestic]{.underline}**. **[These facts have a profound impact on every
aspect of policy, internal and external]{.underline}**. A democratic
China would no doubt have its differences with other countries,
including the United States. But **[the illiberal character of the
current regime shapes how it perceives threats, and how it defines its
interests and goes about pursuing them]{.underline}**. **[CCP leaders
believe that the United States and its liberal-democratic allies are
implacably opposed to them on ideological grounds and that the US, in
particular, seeks not only to encircle and contain China but to
undermine its current regime by promoting 'splitism' (that is,
separatist movements in Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan) and 'peaceful
evolution' (that is, the spread of liberal-democratic beliefs among the
Chinese population)]{.underline}**.24 Warding off these threats requires
that Beijing exert greater control over events around China's periphery
and in the international system as a whole, while continuously refining
its capabilities for domestic surveillance and repression. In addition
to coercion, the regime has sought to guard against ideological
subversion and to bolster domestic political support; it has done this
by managing the national economy in ways intended to sustain growth and
employment, and by promulgating a distinctive, state-manufactured form
of popular nationalism. [China's pervasive (and still expanding) system
of domestic propaganda and 'patriotic education' emphasises the wrongs
done to China by foreign powers during the 'century of humiliation' and
the essential (and as yet unfinished) role of the CCP in righting those
wrongs]{.underline}. Together with the promise of continuing
improvements in living standards, **[nationalism is the primary prop on
which the regime relies for its legitimacy]{.underline}**. In recent
years **[Beijing has also made increasing use of crises and
confrontations over issues of history, territorial control and national
pride to mobilise popular sentiment and deflect the frustrations of the
Chinese people outwards, toward alleged foreign enemies, including Japan
and the United States]{.underline}**. Especially if economic growth
falters, [militant nationalism and 'standing up' to foreign enemies are
likely to become increasingly important parts of the CCP's strategy for
retaining its hold on power]{.underline}. Insecure about their own
legitimacy, China's rulers believe that the stronger their country
appears abroad, the stronger the regime will be at home.

Third, [the best way of promoting liberal values]{.underline} over the
long run [is to sustain a broader international system in which
**democracies**, rather than hostile autocracies, are **geopolitically
dominant**]{.underline} \-- even if that requires working with friendly
authoritarians in the short run. When Woodrow Wilson spoke of making the
world safe for democracy during World War I, he was not calling for a
crusade to spread democracy across the globe. He was arguing that
America must stop authoritarian regimes \-- in that case, the Kaiser's
Germany \-- from becoming geopolitically dominant in a way that would
ultimately make it difficult for democracies anywhere to thrive.
Likewise, during the Cold War, the U.S. regularly cut deals with
friendly dictators in China, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the service
of containing communism, and thereby preserving an international system
in which liberal values could survive and flourish. [Today, the **single
most important thing** the U.S. can do to enhance the long-term
prospects for the spread of democracy is to prevent Russia and China
from overturning]{.underline} \-- or even severely disrupting \-- [the
stable and broadly liberal international system]{.underline} it has long
worked to construct. [To the extent that Washington can keep China from
becoming the supreme power in East Asia]{.underline}, to the extent it
can [stop Moscow from restoring its lost sphere of
influence]{.underline} in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
[it can **create the ideological and geopolitical space** for liberal
values to flourish]{.underline} \-- even if doing so requires
cooperating with questionable regimes in Bangkok, Singapore and Warsaw
along the way.
