### Perm Do Both

#### Military assistance [does not]{.underline} trade off with State Department involvement

**Early 11**, Lt Col, USAF (Billie, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," *Air War College*,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf>)//BB

When the three indicators of militarization are applied to DOD's
security assistance efforts, results indicate that [the United States
relies **heavily** on DOD to pursue foreign policy objectives, but **not
at the expense** of State Department responsibilities. DOD uses security
cooperation to build relationships with partner nations and respond to
humanitarian efforts, and uses security assistance as a flexible tool to
build the capacity of foreign military forces so they can respond to
threats in their regions before conditions require a greater US military
response]{.underline}. Whenever possible, [DOD proactively shapes the
global security environment promoting US interests. DOD has the option
to use its new Section 1206 authority to respond to urgent and emerging
threats based on regional command priorities, or to influence
longer-term State Department programs in support of country
requirements]{.underline}. Also, [DOD's considerable force presence and
commander influence can sway security assistance decisions favorably
toward US interests. However, the State Department maintains a **high
degree of direct involvement** and oversight in all security assistance
decisions]{.underline}.

### Perm Do CP

#### Security cooperation includes the DOS

TIMES" <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589722.pdf>

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among
Defense, State, USAID, and other agencies]{.underline} as needed.

#### State [controls]{.underline} security cooperation -- all DOD SC is carried out through embassies under [direct]{.underline} supervision of State

assistance**

[Who Conducts Security Cooperation]{.underline}

The following paragraphs describe the key participants and stakeholders
for planning and

managing SC activities at both the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels.

Strategic / National Level

The National Security Council (NSC) generally provides the initial
guidance and translation of national-level decisions pertaining to FID,
SA, and SC. The Department of [State]{.underline} (DoS) [is]{.underline}
generally [the lead]{.underline} government [agency for U.S.
international affairs]{.underline}. The Secretary of State advises the
President in forming foreign policy, including the national FID effort.
The DoS assists the NSC in building national FID related policies and
priorities, and is the lead government agency to carry out these
policies. [The DoS Policy Planning Staff, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs]{.underline} ([PM)]{.underline}, and the new Bureau of Conflict
and Stabilization Operations (CSO) [are the most involved with
interagency planning for]{.underline} FID, [SA, and SC.]{.underline} The
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security is
the principal advisor and focal point for SA matters within DoS; control
and coordination of SA extends from this office to the Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. At the national
level, the PM is the principal channel of liaison between DoS and DoD.
Generally, [DoS directs the overall U.S. Government]{.underline} (USG)
[SA program and DoD executes via SC programs and
activities]{.underline}.

DoD Directive 5132.03, Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security
Cooperation, dated October 24, 2008, establishes DoD policy and assigns
responsibilities under the GEF, which provides SC guidance to the GCCs,
and titles 10 and 22 of the United States Code (USC), and statutory
authorities, executive orders, and policies relating to the
administration of SC, including SA programs authorized by the FAA and
AECA, as amended. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy USD(P)
serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of
Defense on all SC matters. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Global
Security Affairs) establishes SA policy and supervises SA programs
through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Secretaries
of the Military Departments (MILDEPs) coordinate on SC policy guidance,
campaign plans, and allocate resources to achieve SC objectives. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) provides implementation
guidance for U.S. military plans and programs and provides the Secretary
of Defense with military advice concerning SC.15

Operational and Tactical Level

The Director, DSCA, under the authority, direction, and control of the
USD(P), directs,

administers, and provides DoD-wide guidance to the DoD Components and
DoD representatives

to U.S. missions, for the execution of DoD SC programs for which DSCA
has responsibility.

Other security SC programs are managed by other Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the

GCCs, or MILDEPs. Specifically, GCCs develop campaign plans to conduct
SC programs and

activities in accordance with the GEF, and complete campaign plan and
campaign support plan

assessments.16

[The U.S. diplomatic mission to a host nation includes representatives
of all U.S. departments and agencies physically present in a
country]{.underline}. [The President gives the Chief of
Mission]{.underline} (COM), normally **[an ambassador]{.underline}**,
[full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of
**all** USG executive branch employees in country]{.underline}. The COM
has authority over all USG executive branch employees within the mission
and host country except for employees under the command of a U.S.
military commander (Title 22, USC, Section 3927).17 [The Senior Defense
Official]{.underline} (SDO) or Defense Attaché (DATT) [is the principal
DoD official in a U.S. embassy]{.underline}, as designated by the
Secretary of Defense. The SDO or DATT is the COM's principal military
advisor on defense and national security issues, the senior
diplomatically accredited DoD military officer assigned to a diplomatic
mission, and the single point of contact for all DoD matters involving
the embassy or DoD elements assigned to or working from the embassy. In
addition to being the diplomatically accredited DATT, [the SDO is the
chief of the Security Cooperation Organization]{.underline} (SCO)
[within the Country Team. The SCO includes all DoD elements located in a
foreign country with assigned responsibilities for carrying out SA and
SC management functions]{.underline} under titles 22 and 10 USC. SCOs
typically include military assistance advisory groups, military missions
and groups, offices of defense and military cooperation, liaison groups,
and defense attaché personnel designated to perform security
assistance/cooperation functions.18

#### Substantial security cooperation is funded and controlled by State

Lieutenant Colonel Toney **Filostrat and** Lieutenant Colonel Elizabeth
A. **Medina,** United States Army, **12** -- paper written for the

Program ("SMART TOOLS: Integrating Security Cooperation and Foreign
Assistance in a Period of Constrained Resources"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA568436.pdf> **SC = Security
Cooperation. SA = Security Assistance. FID = Foreign Internal Defense
assistance**

[Significant portions of U.S. military security cooperation are funded
as foreign assistance activities managed by the Department of
State]{.underline}, and appropriated by Congress. With the amount of
funding in the Defense appropriations bills, [it's not common knowledge
that these military programs are funded under DoS budget
authorities]{.underline}. The State Department has always taken its lead
role on foreign assistance seriously, as a significant foreign policy
tool. Over the past ten years, DoS focused on substantial internal
reforms including foreign assistance planning and implementation. The
U.S. government struggles to prepare for a future of persistent conflict
and budget constraints. It is important to solidify reforms and
institutionalize the integrating actions planned in the Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review and the 3D Planning Framework to
implement effective and efficient foreign assistance activities.

### No Solvency -- generic

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

### No Solvency\-\--Risk Aversion/Resources

#### Risk aversion and understaffing decimates solvency

**David**, Acosta and Krohley **21**, Colonel Arnel P. David is a US
Army strategist assigned to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. First
Sergeant Sean A. Acosta is a civil affairs noncommissioned officer, and
was the US Army's 2018 NCO of the year. Dr. Nicholas Krohley is the
principal of FrontLine Advisory. ("GETTING COMPETITION WRONG: THE US
MILITARY'S LOOMING FAILURE," *Modern War Institute*,
<https://mwi.usma.edu/getting-competition-wrong-the-us-militarys-looming-failure/>)//BB

At present, [we are engaged in global competition with China
(and]{.underline}, to a much lesser extent, [Russia]{.underline}). We
are engaged in a regional contest with Iran. Global jihadist networks
remain a potent threat. That said, we do ourselves a devastating
disservice when we approach the rest of the world on the basis of its
utility in these contests. American policy in Ukraine is downstream of
our rivalry with Russia. The same is true for our engagement in Iraq
with respect to Iran, and across much of the Global South vis-à-vis
China. We instrumentalize bilateral relationships with smaller powers in
pursuit of advantage against our rivals, while neglecting the local
details that define the strategic landscape. This instrumentalization is
readily apparent to those on the receiving end, provoking cynicism and
frustration from Kyiv to Baghdad and beyond. Ultimately, it is
exploitative and self-defeating---just as it was during the Cold War,
when this same mentality led us to disaster from Vietnam to Nicaragua.
[The new great game will be won or lost based, above all else, on
contextual understanding, partnerships, and alliances]{.underline}. It
is not America's responsibility to solve intractable problems in distant
lands. However, we absolutely must understand said problems (as we have
demonstrably failed to do over the past twenty years), so that we might
manage our entanglements and the expenditure of finite resources.
[Across much of the globe, this task falls to the US
**military**]{.underline}. [The Department of State is **understaffed**,
and **isolated** from ground truth by]{.underline} crippling **[risk
aversion]{.underline}**. The intelligence community's priorities lie
elsewhere. From sub-Saharan Africa to the South China Sea, [the military
is]{.underline} often [our **principal point** of contact with contested
terrain]{.underline}.

#### The military doesn't suffer from the same resource shortages that the State Department does 

**Serafino 8**, Coordinator and International Affairs Specialist at CRS
(Nina, "The Department of Defense Role in Foreign Assistance:
Background, Major Issues, and Options for Congress," Congressional
Research Service, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA493001.pdf>)//BB

[In addition to its regional advantage, DOD enjoys two other advantages:
**greater planning and execution capabilities**, and substantially
**greater budgetary resources**. DOD can muster more \[hu\]manpower than
any other agency]{.underline}. [While U.S. military personnel may be
stretched in wartime, there still exist substantial reserves of
personnel that can be tapped to plan and carry out activities. The
combatant commands enjoy considerably more personnel than do individual
embassies, and their personnel are oriented toward planning activities,
whereas State Department personnel are oriented toward collecting
information and furthering U.S. policy through diplomacy, such as
person-to-person contact]{.underline}. Despite waging a war in Iraq,
CENTCOM created a new Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa (CJT-HOA)
of roughly 2,000 U.S. military personnel (the number fluctuates
regularly) to plan and carry out efforts in the Horn of Africa that
include much foreign assistance activity. In Iraq, DOD temporarily
provided military personnel to fill about 100 State Department PRT
posts, until the State Department could contract persons with the needed
expertise to fill them.

### No Solvency\-\--Political Backlash

#### Diplomatic assistance causes [political backlash]{.underline}\-\--that wrecks solvency

**Kralev 20**, Executive Director @ WIDA, The Washington International
Diplomatic Academy (WIDA) is an independent organization that provides
practical professional training in diplomacy and international affairs
--- both in person and online --- to students, recent graduates and
professionals in government, NGOs and the private sector (Nicholas, "Why
Politicians Don't Trust Diplomats," Washington International Diplomatic
Academy,
<https://diplomaticacademy.us/2020/06/14/kralev-why-politicians-dont-trust-diplomats/)//BB>

[So politicians' lack of trust in the Foreign Service is based on
perceptions that are largely divorced from reality]{.underline}. Like
most Americans, [they know very little about our diplomats]{.underline}.
In a challenge to such a conclusion, previous administrations have often
pointed to entrusting a few senior Foreign Service officers, including
William J. Burns and Thomas R. Pickering, with top State Department
posts as an example of the respective president's reliance on
professionals. That may speak of these officers' capabilities, but it
doesn't make up for sidelining or ignoring the service as an
institution. At least Bush and Obama understood that having held a
prominent position under an administration of the other party is also a
part of a career diplomat's job. For example, Bush appointed R. Nicholas
Burns ambassador to NATO and later undersecretary of state, even though
Burns had been State Department spokesman under Clinton. And Obama
appointed Victoria Nuland an assistant secretary of state despite her
earlier role as a close adviser to Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.
In contrast, Trump has retaliated against officers who held key
positions during the Obama administration. [Politicians' **decades-long
distrust** of the Foreign Service has significantly undermined the
authority of the **professionals and ultimately weakened U.S. diplomacy
globally**]{.underline}. [The very real danger that there won't be
enough properly trained diplomats to **restore America's clout in the
future worries us**]{.underline} at the independent Washington
International Diplomatic Academy. So much so that, although we were set
up to offer short-term courses, we've decided to start a one-year
post-graduate practical training program for people who aspire to become
diplomats --- the first such effort outside government. Our instructors,
all former senior Foreign Service officers, have a lot to teach.

### No Solvency\-\--Trust

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

**Ebitz 19**, graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation National
Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the
U.S. Marine Corps War College (Amy, "The use of military diplomacy in
great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### The DoD is best for improving strong relationships with host countries

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[Our relationships provide us with a reservoir of strength. They allow
us to operate by, with, and through our allies and partners to meet
shared security challenges]{.underline}. The degree of partnership
should not be measured by the quantity of security cooperation programs,
but rather by their quality. [The Department of Defense has learned from
large-scale assistance programs that for lasting impact, a comprehensive
engagement plan involves more than training and equipping. Importantly,
we are building a culture of **learning and adaptation**, drawing on
lessons from program successes, as well as, from programs that did not
have the desired impact. We are building a learning agenda and
integrating it into decision processes, and measure program impact in a
way that assesses real change, rather than counting our own inputs into
programs as successes in themselves]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} seek
to [learn]{.underline} lessons and avoid the fallacy of sunk costs [by
ruthlessly prioritizing programs that are strategic, and setting
appropriate expectations for programs that provide more of a tactical
advantage. Through this approach, we can unlock the **comparative
advantages our allies and partners** bring as we **collectively work**
together to meet our shared objectives]{.underline}.
