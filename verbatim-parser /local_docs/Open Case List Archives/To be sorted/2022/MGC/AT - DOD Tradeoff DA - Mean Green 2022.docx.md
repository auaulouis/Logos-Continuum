**Biden not focused on Asia -- Ukraine proves**

President Joe [Biden]{.underline} [set out to]{.underline} finally
[complete the "pivot to Asia]{.underline}," a long-sought adjustment of
U.S. foreign policy to better reflect the rise of America's most
significant military and economic competitor: China. [But
Russia's]{.underline} brutal [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} has [made
that]{.underline} vexing [move even **more complicated**]{.underline}.
China's government has vacillated between full embrace and more measured
responses as Russian President Vladimir Putin prosecutes his war, making
the decisions for Biden far more layered. Biden and China's Xi Jinping
are scheduled to speak by phone on Friday, a conversation that the White
House says will center on "managing the competition between our two
countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of
mutual concern." [The Biden administration is left **needing to focus
east and west** at the same time]{.underline}, balancing not simply
economic imperatives but military ones as well. **["It's difficult. It's
expensive]{.underline}**," Kurt Campbell, the coordinator for
Indo-Pacific Affairs on the White House National Security Council, said
during a recent forum of maintaining a high-level U.S. focus in two
regions. "But it's also essential, and I believe we're entering a period
where that's what will be required of the United States and of this
generation of Americans." [**Biden has been deeply invested** in
rallying NATO and Western allies to respond to Russia]{.underline} with
crippling sanctions, supplying an overmatched Ukraine military [with
**\$2 billion in military assistance**]{.underline} --- including \$800
million in new aid announced Wednesday --- and addressing a growing
humanitarian crisis. Eastern flank NATO allies, including Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, have made clear to the Biden
administration that they want the U.S. to increase its military presence
in the region and do more to address the worst humanitarian crisis in
Europe since World War II. More than 3 million Ukrainian refugees have
fled their country in recent weeks. Though [the war in Ukraine has
**dominated Biden's focus** of late]{.underline}, White House officials
insist they haven't lost sight of China --- and are watching intently to
see how Xi decides to play his hand.

WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - [The]{.underline} U.S.
[House]{.underline} of Representatives Armed Services Committee on
Wednesday [backed a proposal to increase spending for the Department of
Defense]{.underline} by \$37 billion [on top of the]{.underline} record
[\$773 billion proposed by]{.underline} President Joe

already backed a \$45 billion increase in its version of the bill. The
two chambers will decide the ultimate level when they meet in conference
on the bill at an undecided date. The vote in favor of the \$37 billion
amendment to the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was
42-17, as more than a dozen Democrats joined Republicans in favor of
higher spending. The amendment included \$2.5 billion to help pay higher
fuel costs, \$550 million for Ukraine, funding for five ships, eight
Boeing Co-made (BA.N)F-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, five Lockheed
Martin Co-made (LMT.N) C-130 Hercules planes, and about \$1 billion for
four Patriot missile units. [Biden requested a record peacetime national
defense budget]{.underline} of \$813 billion which earmarked \$773
billion for the Pentagon. About \$40 billion of Biden\'s national
defense budget is set aside for other national security-related programs
at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other
agencies. read more Biden\'s budget requested a 4.6% pay raise for
troops and the largest research and development budget in history, as
Russian aggression in Ukraine spurs demands for more military spending.

After months of all-consuming attention on Russia\'s war in Ukraine \--
a conflict that has summoned Cold War comparisons and revitalized
alliances built last century \-- Biden\'s debut visit to Asia is an
opportunity to renew what he views as this century\'s challenge:
Confronting a rising China through a system of renewed economic and
military partnerships. \"We think this trip is going to put on full
display President Biden\'s Indo-Pacific strategy and that it will show
in living color that [the United States can at once lead the world in
responding to]{.underline} Russia\'s war in [Ukraine, and]{.underline}
at the same time [chart a course for effective]{.underline}, principled
American [leadership]{.underline} and engagement [in]{.underline} a
region that will define much of the future of the 21st century,\"
national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters a day ahead of
Biden\'s departure for [Asia]{.underline}. Sullivan discounted the
suggestion that the President and his team were distracted from their
Asia initiatives by the crisis in Ukraine. \"[We]{.underline} actually
[**don\'t regard this as a tension** between investing time, energy and
attention in Europe and time, energy and attention in the Indo-Pacific.
We regard this as **mutually reinforcing**,\"]{.underline} he said,
adding: \"For us, [there is a certain level of **integration and** a
**symbiosis** in the strategy we are pursuing in Europe and the strategy
we\'re pursuing in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} and President
[Biden\'s]{.underline} unique [capacity]{.underline} to actually
[**stitch those two together**, is]{.underline}, I think, [going to be a
hallmark of his foreign policy]{.underline} presidency.\" Even as Biden
turns his attention to Asia, the crisis in Ukraine remains his
administration\'s dominant foreign policy focus. Before he departs
Thursday, Biden will meet at the White House with the leaders of Finland
and Sweden, who filed emergency applications this week to join NATO
following Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.

with China," vol. 44\]

[The return of **great power rivalry** has been the defining feature of
the 21st century]{.underline}. Since the beginning of the new
millennium, China and Russia have openly defied the United States and
upset the stability of the liberal international order. Both China and
Russia share physical and material attributes possessed by the United
States that are traditionally required for great power status: land
mass, a sea portal, a large population, and technology to field and
develop a competitive military capability. Most scholars and
policymakers agree that China presents the largest challenge to US
interests and the US-led liberal international order. Economic and
military growth in China has been astounding, surpassing Russian
expansion. [China's outward extension is **not**]{.underline} primarily
[resource-based]{.underline} as is Russia's but multidimensional, posing
a structural challenge to US military and economic dominance. Much ink
has been spilled over the nature of US-China rivalry and whether the two
great powers are destined for war. [**Structural factors** figure
prominently when predicting US-China relations. A famous]{.underline}
deadly [**Greek trap** describes how the fear of a **hegemonic power**
sparks **catastrophic war** with a rising power]{.underline}. In the
History of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides writes, "What made war
inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this
caused in Sparta." 1 [Thucydides' statement has been]{.underline} widely
[adopted as a **metaphor** for the dangers associated with great-power
transition]{.underline}. Both A.F.K. Organski's power transition theory
and Robert Gilpin's realism see great-power wars as most likely to occur
when a rising challenger is about to surpass a declining hegemonic
power. 2 Today, the Thucydides Trap is highly relevant insofar as we
have a clear incumbent power, the United States, and according to many
measures of great powerhood, a clear rising power---China---with
military, manufacturing, and commercial, and corporate power. However[,
the analogy **mismatches** international **hierarchy** and **regime
type**. In classical times]{.underline}, the incumbent land power,
[Sparta, was the **authoritarian** power who **feared the rise** of the
**democratic** maritime power]{.underline}, Athens.3 [This
**incongruity** is not even the biggest problem]{.underline} with the
analogy. In order [for the Thucydides Trap to apply, China would have to
**significantly narrow** the **power gap** with the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. While [China has]{.underline} caught up with
the United States in important respects, it has [**not caught up** with
the **U**nited **S**tates in]{.underline} terms of [the logic and
networks that **inform dominance** in the **key economic** and
**security areas**]{.underline} [required for power
transition]{.underline}.4 [Apart from the]{.underline} obvious
[**inhibiting factors** of **nuclear weapons** and **economic
interdependence**, the **U**nited **S**tates and China are **nowhere
close** to]{.underline} the power parity likely to spark [a major power
war]{.underline} between them. The Thucydides Trap is a powerful analogy
for bellicose dynamics between a hegemonic power and a rising power, but
[in the **near term**, war between the **U**nited **S**tates and
China]{.underline} for the reasons proposed in the Thucydidean analogy
[is **highly unlikely**]{.underline}.

**No US-China war**

First and foremost, any [military conflict]{.underline} between the two
[would quickly turn **nuc**lear]{.underline}. The US thus finds itself
in the same situation that it was in vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. Taiwan
could easily become this century's tripwire, just as the "Fulda Gap" in
Germany was during the Cold War. But the same dynamic of "[**m**utual
**a**ssured **d**estruction"]{.underline} that limited US-Soviet
conflict **[applies to the US and China]{.underline}**. And [the
international community would do everything]{.underline} in its power
[to ensure]{.underline} that a potential [**nuc**lear conflict did not
materialize,]{.underline} [given]{.underline} that [the
consequences]{.underline} would be fundamentally transnational and --
unlike climate change -- immediate. A **[US-China conflict
would]{.underline}** almost certainly **[take the form of a proxy war,
rather than a major-power confrontation]{.underline}**.
[Each]{.underline} superpower [might take a different side in a domestic
conflict]{.underline} in a country such as Pakistan, Venezuela, Iran, or
North Korea, [and deploy]{.underline} some combination of [economic,
cyber, and diplomatic instruments]{.underline}. We have seen this type
of conflict many times before: from Vietnam to Bosnia, the US faced
surrogates rather than its principal foe. Second, it is important to
remember that, historically, **[China plays a long game]{.underline}**.
Although Chinese military power has grown dramatically, [it]{.underline}
still [lags behind the US on almost every measure that
matters]{.underline}. And while China is investing heavily in
[asymmetric equalizers]{.underline} (long-range anti-ship and hypersonic
missiles, military applications of cyber, and more), it [will not
match]{.underline} the [US]{.underline} in [conventional
means]{.underline} such as aircraft and large ships [for decades, if
ever.]{.underline} A [head-to-head conflict]{.underline} with the US
[would]{.underline} thus [be **too dangerous for China** to countenance
at its current stage of development]{.underline}. If such a conflict did
occur, China would have few options but to let the nuclear genie out of
the bottle. In thinking about baseline scenarios, therefore, we should
give less weight to any scenario in which the Chinese consciously
precipitate a military confrontation with America. The US military,
however, tends to plan for worst-case scenarios and is currently focused
on a potential direct conflict with China -- a fixation with overtones
of the US-Soviet dynamic. This raises the risk of being blindsided by
other threats. Time and again since the Korean War, asymmetric threats
have proven the most problematic to national security. Building a force
that can handle the worst-case scenario does not guarantee success
across the spectrum of warfare. The third reason to think that a
Sino-American conflict can be avoided is that [China is already chalking
up victories in the]{.underline} global [soft-power war]{.underline}.
Notwithstanding accusations that COVID-19 escaped from a virology lab in
Wuhan, [China]{.underline} has [emerged from the pandemic
looking]{.underline} much [better than the US]{.underline}. And
[with]{.underline} its [**B**elt and **R**oad
**I**nitiative]{.underline} to finance infrastructure development around
the world, [it]{.underline} has [aggressively stepped into the void left
by US retrenchment]{.underline} during Donald Trump's four-year
presidency. **[China's leaders]{.underline}** may very well **[look at
the]{.underline}** current [**s**tatus **quo** **and
conclude**]{.underline} that **[they are on the right]{.underline}**
strategic **[path]{.underline}**. Finally, **[China and the US are
deeply intertwined economically]{.underline}**. Despite Trump's trade
war, Sino-American bilateral trade in 2020 was around \$650 billion, and
[China was America's largest trade partner]{.underline}. The two
countries' [supply-chain linkages are vast]{.underline}, and [China
holds more than \$1 trillion in US Treasuries]{.underline}, most of
[which it cannot easily unload]{.underline}, lest it reduce their value
and incur massive losses.

**[China Not Revisionist]{.underline}**

**Multiple years of empirical research disprove [Chinese
revisionism]{.underline}**

**Jalil 19** (Ghazala; 4-3-2019; Research fellow at the Institute of
Strategic Studies at Islamabad; "China's Rise: Offensive or Defensive
Realism";
<http://issi.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3-SS_Ghazala_Yasmin_Jalil_No-1_2019.pdf>;
SML)

The test of the offensive realism theory would be to determine whether
China displays the revisionist tendencies, acts aggressively towards its
neighbours and shows power maximising behaviour. In sum, it would entail
determining whether China displays revisionist tendencies or acts like a
status quo power. Under Mao (1949-1976), China had the policy of
overturning all the imperialist regimes in Asia and the world. During
this period, China actively supported revolutions in many developing
countries that it considered imperialist or saw them as imperialist
proxies. This threatened China's neighbouring states especially the US
allies.28 China essentially wanted to export its socialist ideology to
other states. During this time, China's policy can be described as
operating under the principles of offensive realism. At the same time,
during this era, China was operating with limited capabilities in an
international environment characterised by bipolarity. It was operating
within an environment where global politics was driven by the intense
Cold War rivalry of the two great powers ─ the US and the former Soviet
Union.29 However, [since the 1970s China's policies have shown less
revisionist tendencies. The country has increasingly become a state that
is embracing **defensive realism**.]{.underline} One thread of this
evidence is that [China has toned-down its revolutionary rhetoric. It
is]{.underline} also [not supporting insurgencies]{.underline} in other
countries. The second thread of evidence is that [since the late 1970s
China has increasingly pursued a cooperative security approach in its
relations with regional neighbours and in the international arena. By
and large, China has tried to forge **friendly relations**]{.underline}
with its neighbours. It [includes ameliorating relations with states
like India]{.underline} which is traditionally a rival. Their relations
did become strained in 2017 when there was a standoff between the Indian
and the Chinese forces on the Doklam plateau. Dhoklam is a territory
claimed both by Bhutan (aligned with India) and China. However,
Indo-China relations improved as the two [countries held an informal
summit in China in April 2018.]{.underline}30 [The two countries even
held a joint military exercise]{.underline} in December 2018, [called
Hand-in-Hand.]{.underline}31 Over the years, China has also managed to
resolve border issues with so many neighbouring states. It has [settled
border disputes with]{.underline} countries like [Myanmar, Nepal and
Pakistan]{.underline} initially [and recently with Russia]{.underline},
bordering the Central Asian States [and Vietnam.]{.underline}32
Moreover, China has territorial disputes with India and Japan but it has
never made these disputes a hurdle in forging friendly ties with these
two countries. Avery Goldstein dubs it a neo-Bismarckian grand strategy
of China whereby it is pursuing its interests by reassuring those who
may feel threatened and may form anti-China alliances.33 This, in his
opinion, has resulted in a security environment that is conducive for
China as well as for the region as a whole. [Another
indication]{.underline} that China does not show aggressive behaviour in
its policies [is that China has **increasingly engaged and integrated
with the international community**.]{.underline} Over the past 30 years,
China has amply demonstrated this by its increasing membership of
international organisations and institutions as well as membership of
treaties since the 1980s. China has increasingly participated in the
regional multilateral institutions over the years. [In the last few
decades, East Asia has seen a number of regional institutions being
formed. Foremost among those are]{.underline} the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation ([APEC]{.underline}); the ASEAN Regional Forum
([ARF]{.underline}); ASEAN plus 3 [and the East Asia Summit. China is
part of most of these multilateral institutions as well as an active
member of the]{.underline} Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
([SCO]{.underline}). China was also a key player in the sixparty-talks
in getting North Korea to halt and roll back its nuclear and missile
programmes. On the global front, China sought participation in global
institutions like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). [China is also
playing a very active role in the UN.]{.underline} According to one
figure, [China's membership of international governmental organisations
doubled (from 21 to 52) during the years 1977-1997.]{.underline} In the
same time period, its membership of International Non-Governmental
Organisations (INGOs) increased from mere 71 to an impressive 1,163.34
Similarly, according to another account, China signed less than 30 per
cent of the arms control accords it was eligible to join in the 1970s
compared to 80 per cent by mid-1990s. 35 [China has actively taken part
in the treaties of the nuclear non-proliferation regime as well as those
of aimed at non-proliferation of biological and chemical
weapons.]{.underline} It has also become a part of the voluntary
non-proliferation groups like the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in 2004
and exercises strict export control policies. Since 2004, China has also
shown interest in joining the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
This is an indicator of China's willingness to participate in
international institutes and regimes, increasing comfort towards norms
of interdependent behaviour among states. It has also exhibited the
desire to somewhat shape the rules of the game for regional cooperation.
This is definitely an indication of its tendency towards the status quo.
It also advances China's national interests and helps dispel concerns
about its increasing economic and military power.36 This is also an
indicator that China is willing to work in the existing
Western-dominated systems of international institution and regimes
rather than challenge the system or seek to break it up. Moreover, China
consciously pursued a good neighbour policy. The pursuit of good
relations with its neighbour is the foundation of its strategy for
economic development. It has the dual benefit of attracting foreign
trade and investment while, at the same time, it reassures its
neighbours that it does not present a threat for them. Deng Xiaoping
laid two paths for China's foreign policy in 1990 ─ anti-hegemonism and
establishment of a new multi-polar international order of politics and
economics. This meant that China adopted a policy of active defence of
China's interest ─ of minding its own business and be neither a leader
nor a challenger but a participant or co-builder of the westerns
international order.37 This remains the foundation of China's foreign
policy today. [Many analysts,]{.underline} however, [argue that
participation in]{.underline} the international [institutions is not an
adequate indicator]{.underline} but compliance with the norms, rules and
goals of these institutions is a better indicator of whether a country
is a status quo state or not. [Along these lines,]{.underline} Alastair
[Johnston considers China's compliance with]{.underline} five [global
normative regimes:]{.underline} these include sovereignty, free trade,
non-proliferation and arms control, national self determination and
human rights.38 [As far as sovereignty is concerned]{.underline} he
writes: "Today [China is one of the strongest defenders of a more
traditional absolutist concept]{.underline} (of sovereignty)."39
Similarly, free trade is another international norm that is seen as an
indicator of status quo behaviour. China has moved to support the norms
of global free trade. China's [membership of WTO]{.underline} in 2001
[is a testament to its support for free trade.]{.underline} China's
[tariff rates have declined from over 40 per cent in 1992 to less than
20 per cent in 1997.]{.underline}40 In 2015, the tariff rate was 3.4 per
cent.41 China has gradually embraced global capitalist institutions and
system. In the Belt and Road Forum that China held in May 2017, hosting
30 world leaders, it released a communiqué, which was signed by all 30
world leaders present on the occasion that emphasised the need to "build
an open economy, ensure free and inclusive trade (and) oppose all forms
of protectionism."42 However, the ongoing trade war with the US has
forced China to increase its tariffs. Since 2017, the US had imposed
three rounds of tariff on the Chinese products worth US\$250 billion.
China has retaliated by imposing US\$110 billion on the US goods.
Beijing has accused the US of starting the "largest trade war in
economic history." 43 This damages the global free trade regime. [China
has gone even a step further and initiated projects like the China
Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is envisaged as a journey
towards economic regionalisation.]{.underline} The CPEC is a framework
of regional connectivity which is expected to be beneficial for China
and Pakistan as well as the regional states like India, Iran,
Afghanistan and Central Asia. Its primary aim is to promote geographical
linkages and improve infrastructure connectivity. It would also result
in a higher flow of trade and businesses in the region.44 Its ultimate
aim is to have a well-connected region, promote harmony and accelerate
economic development. This is also a [clear indication that **China is
focused on economic development and regionalisation instead of
displaying aggressive hegemonic behaviour**. As far as China's
non-proliferation record is concerned, it has a fair record, with no
blatant violations of international nuclear non-proliferation
norms.]{.underline} The prevailing concerns mostly centred on the
transfer of missile technology and components to Pakistan in the 1980s
and early 1990s. However, China has not signed the 1987 MTCR, so it does
not amount to any violations of China's treaty obligations. On the
positive side, in 1996, China signed the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty
(CTBT), which a major nuclear non-proliferation proponent like the US
has not done till date.45 It has been cooperating with the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and has installed four new
International Monitoring System (IMS) stations, bringing the total
number of certified stations in China, to five. Furthermore, it is also
a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) since the time that
it was signed. Moreover, along with Russia, China has long been trying
to get a treaty negotiated to ban the stationing of offensive weapons in
outer-space. For nearly two decades, now there have been the Chinese and
Russian efforts to negotiate a treaty for Prevention of an Arms Race in
Outer Space (PAROS). Many proposals have been put forward including the
two Chinese working papers and a joint China-Russia working paper in the
Conference on Disarmament (CD). However, PAROS remains blocked due to
the US refusal to negotiate any such treaty because it goes against its
missile defence and space plans.46 [China has]{.underline} also [played
a stabilising role in the North Korean nuclear issue. It acted as a
lynchpin in hosting and conducting the six-party talks, which were meant
to solve the North Korean nuclear issue.]{.underline} Even after the
breakdown of the six-party talks in 2009 and the recent high tensions on
the Korean Peninsula in 2017 with the US, China played the role of a
stabiliser, urging both sides to show restraint and emphasising that war
was not an option for any country. China has, thus, helped strengthen
the international nuclear non-proliferation norms. Also, China's growing
soft power47 or its "charm offensive" in Southeast Asia and elsewhere is
another indicator that it is not an aggressive, power maximising state.
Its economic progress has been accompanied by its increasing cultural
and diplomatic influence around the globe. Its growing soft power is not
only evident in Southeast Asia but also in Beijing's economic
partnerships in Latin America and Africa.48 The fact that China is able
to attract and appeal the states in the region through its soft power is
an indicator that its neighbours are increasingly viewing China as less
of a threat. However, this has stirred the concerns of waning the US
influence in the region. In many parts of Asia, Africa and the Latin
America, the "Beijing Consensus" which advocates a mix of authoritarian
government and market economy, is overtaking the "Washington Consensus"
of market economics and democratic government which was popular in the
past.49 With signs that the US is placing emphasis on hard power under
President Donald Trump, China seems to be positioning itself as a
champion of globalisation and economic integration. It seems to be
placing an emphasis on soft power. [**Taiwan**]{.underline} issue [is
one instance where China's policies are viewed by the West as a
non-status quo. However, the issue can be seen in terms of a **security
dilemma between the US and China**. In the last few decades, America
continued selling advanced weapons to Taiwan, mainland China considers
these developments to encourage Taiwan's independence and a threat to
its interests.]{.underline} According to Yiwei Wang, "on the Taiwan
issue, [America's logic is that peace comes from "balance of power."
China has time and again protested the matter of arms sales to Taiwan
with the US but to no avail. China sees these moves as an effort to
change the distribution of power in the region. In turn, China has
threatened Taiwan against moves for independence and deployed missiles
on the mainland as well. Consequently, this makes the US suspicious of
China's revisionist intentions towards Taiwan -- locking the two powers
in a **security dilemma**.]{.underline} Another area where China has
been accused of displaying revisionist tendencies is in the South China
Sea. The dispute centres on territorial claims over two island chains
the Paracels and the Spratlys and surrounding oceans. The area provides
valuable trade passage and fishing ground, as well as holds hydrocarbon
resources ranging from 25,000 Mboe to 260,000 Mboe.51 China, Vietnam,
the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims.
The dispute has existed for centuries but things got tense in the last
few years. China has been island-building since 2014 and has also
increased naval patrols. It can be argued that China's actions are
defensive in nature. The US has had increased interference in the area.
Under the garb of "freedom of navigation" operations, the US sent planes
and ships in the disputed area to keep access to key shipping and air
routes.52 In February 2017, the US deployed the aircraft carrier, Carl
Vinson, strike force to the South China Sea under the garb of "freedom
of navigation."53 Another week-long US and British Naval exercise took
place in January 2019.54 These are meant to send a signal to China to
rescind claims over the disputed area. [These exercises have angered
China. **China does not have expansionist or hegemonic designs in the
S**outh **C**hina **S**ea. It claims over the two island chains are not
something new.]{.underline} Beijing has adjusted its strategy to
safeguard its interests, as it becomes increasingly powerful. However, a
military conflict over the dispute is not an option. Moreover, the US
influence over other claimants of the territory complicates matters for
China. This has resulted in China acting more assertively in the South
China Sea in order to defend its interests. In fact, the US would act
more aggressively if any country was to interfere in matters close to
its borders. Overall, from the above analysis, it can be summarised that
China has so far behaved more as a status quo power rather than as an
aggressive revisionist power[.]{.underline} This is apparent in China's
engagement with its neighbours, its participation in the regional and
international institutions, it is in compliance with most of the
international norms as well as its emphasis on projecting its soft
power. The claims of Mearsheimer's offensive realism are in contrast
with Waltz's defensive realism on several points. While Mearsheimer
claims that great powers act aggressively and aim to gain so much power
that they are the ultimate hegemons in the system, Waltz's defensive
realism sees the states as acting defensively to maintain rather than
upset the balance of power. For Waltz, the [states are primarily
concerned with maintaining "their position in the
system."]{.underline}55 Defensive realists argue that [offence-defence
balance favours the defence.]{.underline} 56 [Therefore, a robust
defence and careful balancing should deter any aggressive impulses from
great powers.]{.underline} Defensive realism argues that great powers
are concerned with maintaining the status quo rather than maximising
their power because often the [**cost of expansion outweighs the
benefits**.]{.underline} Defensive realism sees security dilemmas as a
problem where an increase in the power of one state increases the
insecurity of the other causing the latter to increase its power. Under
the conditions of defensive realism, great powers would try to alleviate
any security dilemmas rather than exacerbate it. China's current policy
seems to be firmly rooted in defensive realism. Its policy seems to be
aimed at maintaining the balance of power rather than upsetting it. As
the earlier section has argued, China is not a revisionist power but a
status quo one. The analysts like Shiping Tang are convinced that
China's security strategy flows out of its realisation of the security
dilemma whereby the [Chinese leaders have understood that an aggressive
expansionist strategy would just lead to **counterbalancing
alliances**.]{.underline} "This recognition has led China to adopt a
defensive realism-rooted security strategy emphasising moderation,
self-restraint and security cooperation."57 Moreover, China's military
modernisation, its Taiwan policy and its increased policies in the South
China Sea also make more sense if seen through the lens of defensive
realism. China's Taiwan policy may be more geared towards preventing
redistribution of power in the region. Since the US is providing arms
assistance to Taiwan, China may be averse to the US aiding Taiwan's
independence ─ the latter issue is one where China has made clear that
independence is not acceptable to China. Similarly, there is good
evidence that China's military modernisation programmes and training
exercises since the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1996 are aimed partially at
dealing with the issue of the Taiwanese separation.58 On the question of
whether China is balancing against the US, Johnston says, "There seems
to be little doubt that China's military modernisation programme since
the mid-1990s has been aimed in large measure at developing capabilities
to deter or slow the application of the US military power in the
region."59 It would then seem that China is not concerned with gaining
power or projecting its powers but with balancing against a predominance
of the US power in the region. [**China has not shown any signs of
hegemonic behaviour** as a lot of Western analysts feared]{.underline}.
Instead of guided by offensive realism, China's policies seem to be
guided by defensive realism where it is concerned with survival and with
maintaining its position in the system. Just as the US fears China's
hegemonic rise, China also fears the increase of the US influence in the
region and its talk of containing China. China's policy may change in
the future to display hegemonic tendencies. However, at present,
**[there is not much evidence to support the theory of offensive
realism.]{.underline}**

History does not repeat itself. With the exception of general platitudes
about the permanence of international tension and the sporadic
recurrence of violent conflict, statements about historical patterns and
cycles of warfare can at best lead to historiographical confirmation
bias and, at worst, can prejudice policymakers into taking
counterproductive and unnecessary escalatory measures.\[1\] [Diplomats,
intelligence professionals, and politicians must tread with care when
approaching history and any patterns that emerge from it, especially
when trying to draw parallels with present-day events.]{.underline}
[History and policy are ultimately about
particulars]{.underline}---particular interests, particular leaders,
particular decisions, and particular crises. [Specific policies matter
and can go a long way towards avoiding war altogether or minimizing its
impact should it occur.]{.underline} History and policy are ultimately
about particulars---particular interests, particular leaders, particular
decisions, and particular crises. Simplifications aside, a close study
of history does have its merits. To borrow a phrase attributed to Mark
Twain, history may not repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes. [While
the circumstances that cause state and sub-state groups to engage in
open conflict are unique, the geographical, ethnic, and cultural
conditions leading to tensions among these groups remain at least
semi-permanent]{.underline}. The challenge before policymakers is to
accurately assess present realities, many of which have historical
precedents, and act within the small but undeniable window of choice
these realities offer. Recently, [few issues have received as much
attention as Sino-U.S. relations]{.underline}, and none have invited so
many historical parallels. [Phrases like "Senkaku Paradox" and
"Thucydides Trap" are common parlance among young strategists and
military leaders.\[]{.underline}2\] Comparisons with the pre-World War I
Anglo-German rivalry or Athenian-Spartan relations before the
Peloponnesian wars abound. These analogies fit into a specific version
of the realist outlook on international affairs. [According to these
theories, sovereign states exist in perpetual latent
conflict]{.underline}---a war of all against all---in an anarchic global
environment. In the end, they must rely only upon themselves and the
acquisition of power to achieve security. [In this framework, status-quo
hegemons find themselves in unavoidable conflict with hegemonic
challengers]{.underline}. It violates the presumed axioms of realism for
two hegemonic superpowers to coexist peacefully.
[Conflict]{.underline}---both cold and hot---[is
preordained]{.underline}. [Yet the preceding reflects only one
particular strand of realist analysis]{.underline}. **[It is possible to
adopt a more open-ended outlook on historical development while
acknowledging the semi-structural elements that govern international
issues.]{.underline}** [As states pursue their national
interests]{.underline}---a fundamental principle of
realism---[opportunities arise not only for de-escalation of tension but
even cooperation on particular matters]{.underline}. Indeed, [if the
international situation is suitable for it, cooperation between rivals
can make the most strategic sense]{.underline}. The Helsinki Accords and
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I/II) treaties at the highpoint of
the Cold War, as well as the collaboration between U.S. and Iranian
negotiators during the talks that eventually led to the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action, demonstrate the potential for cooperation
between apparently hostile countries. [Assessing bilateral relations
between the U.S. and China today suggests areas where cooperation is
possible]{.underline}.\[3\] A future [Sino-U.S. war is far from
inevitable]{.underline}, at least if leaders manage relations delicately
and with sufficient mutual appreciation for each other's unique history,
culture, and strategic ambitions. Strategists cannot emphasize the point
enough: China is not Sparta or Germany; the U.S. is not England or
Athens. Each has a horizon for interpreting international relations that
are unique to it, and American policymakers must make a genuine effort
to understand the Chinese outlook. [Beijing holds a number of nightmare
scenarios coloring their strategic worldview, and U.S. policymakers
should keep this in mind if they want to avoid rhetoric and actions that
could inadvertently trigger Chinese fears of escalation.]{.underline}
Strategic Nightmare Scenario #1: Strategic Encirclement In his
influential assessment of China's history, Henry Kissinger claims
China's greatest geopolitical fear is [strategic
encirclement]{.underline}---that a single hegemonic rival or an alliance
of multiple weaker ones will surround its vast territory and work to
destabilize its periphery.\[4\] This [fear is strongly rooted in
geography and history.]{.underline} In terms of security, geography has
not been kind to China. [Twelve different countries share its
borders]{.underline}, and many of them have a history of aggressive
action and outright cruelty toward the Middle Kingdom. What is more,
[several maritime powers lie within a few hundred miles of its
coastline]{.underline}. [Fate has positioned China precariously,
explaining in no small measure the mistrust that has characterized its
diplomacy]{.underline}. While China has often been regionally ascendant,
it has always remained keenly aware that national tragedy or
embarrassment are close-at-hand if these surrounding nations were to
band together against it. China's Belt and Road (Shutterstock) [China's
two most significant geopolitical initiatives]{.underline} over the last
decade [confirm this lesson.]{.underline} For China, The [Belt and Road
Initiative serves primarily as a peaceful way to buy influence with many
countries on its western periphery]{.underline}. For instance, many
[Central Asian countries have secured sizeable funding for
infrastructure projects in the Belt and Road]{.underline}. Likewise, the
[maritime aspects of Belt and Road aim to construct a logistical basis
for sea routes whose accessibility does not rely upon the goodwill of
China's island neighbors.]{.underline} Furthermore, China's [gradual
militarization of the South and East China seas suggests an effort to
secure its eastern and southern maritime flanks]{.underline}.
Considering this element of China's strategic horizon, the **[Belt and
Road as well as the militarization of the South and East China Seas take
on a new meaning. They are attempts to avoid the strategic disaster
encirclement entails by creating a Eurasian sphere of influence less
susceptible to maritime embargo or land-based intrusion.]{.underline}**
For China, The Belt and Road Initiative serves primarily as a peaceful
way to buy influence with many countries on its western periphery. It
[is thus not surprising these initiatives are experiencing significant
push-back from several rivals in China's neighborhood who fear that
their room for maneuver in the region will diminish.]{.underline} Among
these encircling states, three stand out: Russia, Japan, and the United
States.\[5\] [All have complicated economic relations with China
today]{.underline}, with points of tension coexisting with cooperation
on many fronts. [All have engaged in military conflict with China at
some point]{.underline} in its history, and **[Beijing holds them
primarily responsible for orchestrating its "century of
humiliation."\[]{.underline}**6\] Although currently not a potent
military superpower, [Japan's proximity perpetually stokes memories of
its brutal occupation of Manchuria and illustrates the real and present
dangers of domestic political instability and military
weakness]{.underline}.\[7\] Shinzo [Abe's efforts to remilitarize
the]{.underline} island [nation]{.underline} of Japan [have]{.underline}
understandably [provoked consternation on the continent.]{.underline}
These [efforts are one of the motivating forces behind]{.underline} the
Belt and Road and the [militarization of the South and East China
Seas.]{.underline} **[The tit-for-tat steps of military buildup on both
sides risk feeding into narratives that make de-escalation
difficult]{.underline}**.\[8\] Russia, on the other hand, currently
enjoys relatively stable and cooperative ties with Beijing. But such was
not always the case and may not be in the future. Talk of a budding
alliance between the two powers ignores the severe headwinds around the
corner.\[9\] Both view the Eurasian landmass as their backyard, and both
seek to develop stronger economic and military ties with Central Asian
nations. Russian initiatives tied to the Eurasian Economic Union, whose
objectives include creating a single market for goods, services,
capital, and labor, as well as promoting deeper integration of the
post-Soviet space, collide with China's own visions for the future of
the Eurasian landmass. In the short term, China and Russia are engaged
in a high level of cooperation aiming to integrate the two
projects.\[10\] However, the long-term prospects of cooperation are less
bright. If either party begins to perceive any asymmetry in influence,
an increasingly hostile and mutually suspicious attitude will inevitably
emerge, especially if their common enemy, the United States, follows
through with President Trump's desire to withdraw entirely from the
region.\[11\] A hostile Russia on China's borders would create a
situation reminiscent of the 1970s, when the U.S. was able to exploit
the discord to its own advantage. Looking into the future, it seems
localized great power competition between Russia and China, without the
U.S. as a participant, could benefit the U.S. significantly more in an
area that matters very little to American vital interests. Perceptions
of Strategic Encirclement (OrientalReview.org) Currently, [the chances
of a complete U.S. withdrawal from the region appear slim]{.underline}.
**[In fact, the American presence only seems to be growing, with Beijing
perceiving the U.S. as the most likely contender to carry out this
nightmare strategic scenario.]{.underline}** Therefore, the
[pervasiveness of America's imprint along its entire periphery strikes
an emotional chord with the Chinese leadership]{.underline}.\[12\]
[American troops and strategic partnerships]{.underline} in South Korea,
Japan, Afghanistan, Taiwan, Australia, India, and the Philippines, [not
to mention recent efforts to gain influence among the Central Asian
countries]{.underline} critical to the Belt and Road, [represent a
textbook case of hegemonic strategic encirclement that understandably
worries Beijing.]{.underline} One area of controversy rarely mentioned
in the American press is the war in Afghanistan. Despite America's
perception of the region as the heart of the so-called War on Terror,
China's perspective on this war differs considerably. Not only does
Afghanistan share a border with China, but more importantly, strong
cultural ties link Afghanistan to China's most restive region,
Xinjiang.\[13\] China initially supported the coalition effort to
overthrow the Taliban---which has, Beijing believes, trained and
provided refuge for Uighur separatists in Xinjiang---and promotes
initiatives aimed at stabilizing the troubled country.\[14\] But a
growing cohort in the Chinese leadership fears the conflict is morphing
into a new arena for "Great Game" competition. The Chinese believe this
transformed conflict risks leading to more instability on its periphery,
not less.\[15\] Because China believes instability in Afghanistan means
instability in Xinjiang, the Chinese leadership could perceive this
conflict in one of two ways. In the first, China views this instability
as a headache inadvertently caused by the U.S. presence. China will have
to dedicate substantial resources---both military and financial---to
dealing with a problem that it sees as indirectly rooted in a U.S.
military presence. In the second, China could suspect a deliberate U.S.
hand in stoking instability in Xinjiang. As implausible as this
suspicion may be, Washington cannot ignore Chinese perceptions of the
nineteen-year conflict. [The U.S. must come to terms with the reality
that it may be inadvertently feeding Chinese fears of strategic
encirclement]{.underline}. Strategic Nightmare Scenario #2: Domestic
Chaos Understanding how Beijing behaves on the international stage also
requires a deep appreciation of its complex domestic conditions. What
often strikes western observers as an unnecessary violation of human
rights represents, for the Chinese leadership, not only a matter of
regime survival but also, more importantly, a matter of averting
national catastrophe. Memories of the bloody civil war between 1927 and
1949---in which as many as 3 million people died---still haunt many
Chinese. Illustrative of this lesson in more recent history are the 1989
Tiananmen Square anti-government protests. Western observers believed
these protests were a prelude to the full democratization of the Chinese
mainland. So the eventual government crackdown on the
demonstrations---leading to the deaths of thousands and the arrests of
even more---struck democratic societies as exceptionally cruel. For many
Westerners, Tiananmen symbolized the promise of China, what it could be
if only the current communist regime decided to make necessary political
and economic reforms. Protesters in Tiananmen Square, 2 Jun 1989 (CNN)
As Kissinger astutely observes, understanding the political and
historical context of Tiananmen shows that this event symbolizes
something much darker for the Chinese leadership. In the lead-up to the
unexpected death of Hu Yaobang, whose funeral was the trigger for the
Tiananmen protests, Deng Xiaoping's political reforms and economic
restructuring were beginning to expose latent fissures within Chinese
society. While many in the West marveled at surging Chinese economic
growth, the tens of thousands of students sent abroad, and the
incredible changes in the standard of living inside the country, there
emerged significant indications that new, potentially destabilizing
currents were churning within. On the economic side, attempts to make
prices reflect real costs inevitably led to price increases, at least in
the short term, which in turn led to a run to buy up goods before prices
went even higher. This rush created a vicious cycle of hoarding and
higher inflation. Also, to recast the command economy on the model of
the European system, Deng Xiaoping dismantled many central institutions
and streamlined the bureaucracy.\[16\] Reforms thus enraged many
established interests. As Kissinger points out, "The relative success of
economic reform produced constituencies at the core of the later
discontent. And the government would face declining loyalty from the
political cadres whose jobs the reforms threatened."\[17\]
Significantly, many of the Tiananmen protesters were not of the
liberal-democratic mindset, but disgruntled communists whom
liberal-democratic reforms had hit hard.\[18\] On a cultural level,
economic reform had raised Chinese expectations on standard of living
and personal liberties, while simultaneously creating tensions and
inequities that many Chinese believed could only be resolved by a more
open and participatory political system. Discontent was thus growing on
all sides of the political spectrum. At the same time, in the far west
of the country, Tibetans and the Uiygur Muslim minority in Xinjiang were
beginning to agitate. For the communist leadership and Deng Xiaoping in
particular, the ubiquitous protests stirred the historical Chinese fear
of chaos. Regardless of the stated goals of the demonstrators, they
recalled both the civil war and the bloody Cultural Revolution.\[19\]
Deng carried out the eventual crackdown reluctantly. In his mind, it was
a necessary measure to avoid national disaster.\[20\] Presently, Beijing
appears more confident domestically and internationally. Over the last
two decades, China has enjoyed sustained growth rates well above those
of Western democracies and has managed to weather the storms of an
international financial crisis in 2008-2009 and a trade war with the
U.S. with only a relatively minor effect on its overall growth.
Standards of living continue to rise and poverty rates are the lowest
they have ever been.\[21\] At the parade for the 70th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China on October 1, 2019, this self-assurance was
clearly on display, as enormous crowds gathered to admire the
overwhelming might of a nation resurrected from the dustbin of history.
Nevertheless, as Matthew Goodman, Elizabeth Economy, and other
commentators have suggested, all of this optimism masks a much bleaker
reality for the Chinese leadership.\[22\] The regime's legitimacy has
come to rely almost entirely on its ability to continue to deliver high
levels of economic growth, something that will become increasingly
difficult as its population ages and the economy becomes more
consumer-driven. Industrial production growth slowed to a 17-year low in
August of 2019, and anecdotal evidence suggests that ordinary Chinese
are starting to feel the effects of slower wage growth and higher
prices.\[23\] Furthermore, many respected Chinese economists are calling
attention to the fact that government efforts to spur growth in the face
of these obstacles are less and less effective.\[24\] The marginal
efficiency of capital, measured by the incremental capital-output ratio
(ICOR), is declining sharply since it takes more and more units of
investment to generate one additional unit of growth.\[25\] All of this
could potentially spell disaster for a financial system already racked
with increasing debt and a forecasted growing disproportion between
retirees and workers. Confrontation between the U.S. and China?
(Shutterstock) It will be necessary for Chinese leadership to cultivate
other sources of legitimacy over the coming years if these economic
trends continue. U.S. policymakers should be sensitive to these
necessities and not overreact to any rhetoric that aims primarily at
shifting the basis of legitimacy within China, even if it strikes an
ostensibly anti-western or nationalistic tone outside of China. Xi
Jinping's position may require at least three levels of communication,
one with other world leaders, one within the Communist Party, and
another that serves primarily to protect domestic stability and the
regime's standing within China. Historical perspective shows that, in
China, a weak regime means increasing domestic instability. It also
shows this instability can take on a life of its own, leading to civil
war, mass-murder, and vulnerability to foreign interference in its
affairs. Beijing will do everything in its power to avoid this scenario,
so leaders in Washington must be realistic about what it can expect from
the Chinese leadership in the years ahead. Historical perspective shows
that, in China, a weak regime means increasing domestic instability. An
Uncertain Future [Current Sino-U.S. relations are a complicated
affair,]{.underline} and though strategists should never rely on history
to provide an accurate picture of future developments, it can be a
useful, albeit incomplete, guide to the particular concerns, interests,
and strategic outlook of their Chinese counterparts. China's two
strategic nightmare scenarios outlined above are deeply rooted in its
history, culture, and geography. [They by no means explain all of its
domestic and international behavior, but they can provide context for
much of its rhetoric and many of its geostrategic
initiatives.]{.underline} **[If the U.S. wants to elude the maelstrom of
unavoidable war over relatively small strategic stakes, it would do well
to avoid measures that feed China's fears about these
scenarios.]{.underline}** Although [Washington]{.underline} should not
be naïve in its dealings with Beijing, it **[should also make a
deliberate effort to adjust its rhetoric to appease these legitimate
concerns.]{.underline}** Above all, [it should demonstrate that its
economic and military endeavors in China's neighborhood intend, not to
actualize some sort of strategic strangulation, but to serve Asia's
long-term interests by providing stability and prosperity to a region
that, without a U.S. presence, would be much more dangerous for
everyone.]{.underline} [The U.S. should be more honest about the fact
that its future prosperity depends largely upon China's
success.]{.underline} What is more, Washington should make clear that,
while it does stand for human rights and the gradual reform of China's
political institutions, it understands that given China's domestic
conditions, these reforms cannot be made overnight. Perhaps the most
challenging consequence of a non-repetitive history is that the future
is mostly undetermined, a mystery revealed only by the unfolding of
particular events. [This uncertainty puts the onus of decision and
responsibility squarely on the shoulders of political, diplomatic, and
military leadership, who must navigate this challenging terrain with
incomplete knowledge of its features.]{.underline} **[A Sino-U.S. war is
not preordained, nor is it an impossibility]{.underline}**. If it ever
does happen, **[it will be the result of the particular choices, words,
and deeds of particular leaders, not a pattern embedded in the structure
of history.]{.underline}**
