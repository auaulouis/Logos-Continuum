**[Isacoff 15]{.underline}** (Jonathan, Associate Professor of Political
Science and the Chair of Environmental Studies @ Gonzaga, "Why IR Needs
Deweyan Pragmatism," Perspectives on Political Science, Vol. 44, No. 1,
2015, pg. 26-33)

The well-known RCT scholars Shepsle and Bonchek humorously note that
while it might not be "rocket science," the study of politics should be
scientific.46 Others, especially postmodernist critics, argue against
the notion of political science and IR as science. A Deweyan pragmatist
approach would suggest that this debate is not useful. By that, I mean
that **[[what IR is]{.mark} or [is not is not nearly as important as
what it achieves]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So the question should not be
whether IR is scientific, but rather, how scientific does it need to be
to get the job done? To this, there are many answers, but I suggest a
line of reasoning: the scientific method in the most general sense is
useful in helping to explain how and why, all else equal, causal
processes work. Put differently, **[[if we want to know]{.mark} how and
[why]{.mark} some [states go to war]{.mark} and others do not, [it would
be more useful]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the sense of **[[getting]{.mark} logically [coherent]{.mark},
[empirically verifiable answers]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[to analyze
historical cases]{.mark} systematically]{.underline}** than it would be
to consult with a shaman or use a crystal ball to obtain an answer.
**[This is not say that there is not an important role for [textual
interpretation]{.mark} in the process of studying war and other
international phenomena]{.underline}**. Indeed, I elsewhere argue that
interpretation of historical texts is crucial to making valid claims
about wars.47 **[But]{.underline}** the main point here is that
**[interpretation [is a means]{.mark} toward an end]{.underline}**,
namely, the process of coping with the world via human experience.
**[Toward that end, interpretation is]{.underline}** necessary and
useful, but it is **[[not the end]{.mark} itself]{.underline}**. A
second point is that **[there is clearly a pragmatic and justifiable
need for certain types of quantitative methods]{.underline}**, namely,
statistics, though not necessarily formal models, in some segments of
IR. Taking a simple example for illustrative purposes, if one wished to
study the effect of speed limits on motor vehicle fatalities, the use of
aggregate data statistically analyzed would be far superior to standing
on the corner waiting for an accident to observe or reading several
diary accounts of individual accidents. **[The key point]{.underline}**
here, however**, [is not that]{.underline}** statistical **[methods are
inherently better, or more "rigorous"]{.underline}** than any other type
of method. Rather, **[the use of statistically analyzed data to find
answers to problems]{.underline}** of highway fatalities **[creates
knowledge that if properly applied, would alleviate "concrete human
woes,"]{.underline}** which is to say it would help to save lives. That
is pragmatic political science.48 What Is a Problem?
**[[Many]{.underline}]{.mark}** political scientists **[[believe
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the idea of having **[[a "problem
orientation]{.mark}"]{.underline}** for the field. For example, Atul
Kohli asserts that there is a strong consensus among leading experts
"that comparative politics is very much a problem-driven field of
study." "What motivates the best comparative politics research are
puzzles of real-world significance," writes Kohli, in "The Role of
Theory in Comparative Politics: A Symposium."49 Similarly, Ian Shapiro,
**[responding to the question of what would be [a better
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}** than RCT **[asks]{.underline}** the
question: "**[What is the phenomenon to be explained?]{.underline}**...
**[The formulation of alternative explanations]{.underline}**, in other
words, **[[should be]{.mark} a [problem-driven]{.mark}
activity]{.underline}**."50 This is clearly consistent with Deweyan
pragmatism; in fact, it is inherently pragmatist. "A Deweyan pragmatic
approach to political inquiry," writes Maurice Meilleur, "would
transform political science from a discipline, based on a set of
methods, into a profession, based on a set of problems."51 But what,
more specifically, is a "problem orientation?" First, it is clear that
Kohli and his colleagues mean an empirically driven problem orientation.
That is, the study of **[[politics should be driven by empirical, not
theoretical or methodological problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Careful
not to push this point too far, a Deweyan pragmatist would suggest that
**[[theorization]{.mark} is]{.underline}** an
**[important]{.underline}** activity, **[but it [must not lose its link
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** problems of human experience, which is to say
**[[empirical problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, Kohli and
**[others advocating]{.underline}** an empirically driven **[problem
orientation have little to say about how to identify and value
problems]{.underline}**. After all, there is a limitless supply of
political problems only a fraction of which can be studied. In response,
I would argue that **[some problems are more significant to the
detection and response to human suffering and thus more deserving of
study, than others]{.underline}**. This is itself a tricky ethical
problem, for who is to say what is or is not a "real problem?" One
reader of this manuscript suggested that "What is really going on here,
when one scratches the analytical surface, is not that IR theorists
aren\'t discussing problems; it\'s that they are discussing problems
that the author does not feel are worthy of attention. But why should we
accept that the author\'s "problems" are more important or privileged?
Why does the author get to decide what a "real" problem is?" This is a
good question but it is a misreading of the argument. **[Nowhere
does]{.underline}** Dewey or **[this]{.underline}** author **[imply that
any individual could or should decide or dictate which problems matter
and which do not]{.underline}**. To the contrary, **[the question of
"who decides" is]{.underline}** a **[public]{.underline}** deliberation
problem, a subject Dewey addressed exhaustively in his classic The
Public and Its Problems.52 According to Dewey, **[problems are the
direct outcome of a public\'s determination of its common
good]{.underline}**. A full analysis of how this works, or in some
cases, fails to work in practice is beyond the scope of this article.
But it is important to note that there is no argument here for the
privileging of one private individual\'s notion of what constitutions
"real problem" versus that of another. That is for the public to decide.
Human Woe and Issues That Matter The final point to be made about
reconstruction stems directly from the previous discussion: **[some
problems matter more than others with regard to the alleviation of
concrete human suffering. Which issues matter]{.underline}** the
**[most]{.underline}** in our world? Ultimately, per Dewey\'s political
philosophy touched on above, **[that is for the public to
decide]{.underline}**. Assuming that there ever could be a "common
good," we can hypothesize that **[people might choose to focus
on]{.underline}** issues that affect them daily, **[issues such as
climate change]{.underline}**, poverty, health care, education, racism,
and sexism, as well as **[war and peace]{.underline}**, all issues
**[that are of grave importance to humanity]{.underline}**. IR,
especially in its American form, with its disproportionate emphasis on
global security and great power war, has given scant attention to too
many other issues, and when attention is given to the "lesser" topics,
they are relegated to sub-sub-specializations within the discipline,
"Gender and IR," for instance. More problematic from the standpoint of
pragmatism, **[[the approach-driven wing]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
discipline **[[is more concerned with which paradigm has scored more
points]{.mark} in the epic contest for paradigmatic supremacy [than
with]{.mark} the matter of [how the world]{.mark} could or [should
respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** to climate change or why hundreds of
million of children lack basic nutrition and medical care. **[[The
interpretivist]{.mark}/linguistic [wing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in
contrast, **[[is more concerned with how texts are interpreted]{.mark}
in graduate seminars than with the fact that children in inner cities
cannot even read a text at all]{.underline}.**53
**[[Many]{.underline}]{.mark}** IR scholars are still fighting over
whether and to what extent "unit-level variables" should be taken into
consideration in understanding international politics (and if so,
whether one might still rightly be accepted in the club of realism).54
Others **[are trying to [demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}** that IR
constructivism is really "**[[liberalism in
disguise]{.underline}]{.mark}**."55 **[[This is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
not a stab at "why realism is (yet again) wrong." It is **[a critique of
[the self-definitionally obsessed, paradigm-driven
culture]{.mark}]{.underline}** of academic IR. I would not go so far as
to claim that there are no scholars who study everyday politics; many
clearly do.56 Rather, the problem is that that **[[the incentive]{.mark}
structure [to contribute to]{.mark} the "big [debates]{.mark}" of the
discipline]{.underline}**, namely, those **[[at the paradigmatic
level]{.mark}, is a project that [drifts]{.mark} ever afar [from]{.mark}
the [problems of "concrete human woe]{.mark}" that affect]{.underline}**
the other **[millions]{.underline}** of people who happen not to have
graduate degrees in IR.

Imagery can enact powerful effects, since political actors are almost
always pressed to take action when confronted with images of atrocity
and human suffering resultant from wars, famines and natural disasters.
Usually, humanitarian emergencies are conveyed through media
representations, which indicate the important role of images in
producing emergency situations as (global) events (Benthall 1993;
Campbell 2003b; Lisle 2009; Moeller 1999; Postman 1987). Debbie Lisle
(2009: 148) maintains that, \'we see that the objects, issues and events
we usually study \[. . .\] do not even exist without the media \[.. .\]
to express them'. As a consequence, visual images have political and
ethical consequences as a result of their role in shaping private and
public ways of seeing (Bleiker. Kay 2007). This is because how people
come to know, think about and respond to developments in the world is
deeply entangled with how these developments are made visible to them.
Visual representations participate in the processes of how people
situate themselves in space and time, because seeing involves
accumulating and ordering information in order to be able to construct
knowledge of people, places and events. For example, the remembrance of
such events as the Vietnam War, the terrorist attacks of 11 September
2001 or the torture in Abu Ghraib prison cannot be separated from the
ways in which these events have been represented in films, TV and
photography (Bleiker 2009; Campbell/Shapiro 2007; Moller2007). The
visibility of these events can help to set the conditions for specific
forms of political action. The current war in Afghanistan serves as an
example of this. Another is the nexus of hunger images and relief
operations. Vision and visuality thus become part and parcel of
political dynamics, also revealing the ethical dimension of imagery, as
it affects the ways in which people interact with each other. However,
**[[particular representations do not automatically lead to particular
responses as,]{.underline}]{.mark}** for instance, **[[proponents of
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** so-called **[[\'CNN effect' would

**[explicitly [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as he calls it,
**[[the]{.mark} \'visual [determinism\' of
images]{.mark},]{.underline}** which dominates political and public
opinion. Referring to findings based on public surveys, he argues that
the **[[formation of opinion]{.underline}]{.mark}**s by individuals
**[[depends not on images but on]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[idiosyncratic]{.mark} predispositions and
[values]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see also, Domke et al. 2002; Perlmutter

### L: No Prior Questions---1AR

#### No prior questions

**[Jackson]{.underline}**, professor of IR -- American University,
**['15]{.underline}** (Patrick Thaddeus, "Must International Studies Be
a Science?" *Millennium - Journal of International Studies* vol. 43, no.
3, p. 942-965, June)

These **[[diverse method]{.mark}ologie[s]{.mark} [have different
approaches to causation]{.mark}, to case [comparison, and]{.mark} to
[explanation]{.mark} in general; those differences]{.underline}**, in
turn, **[mean]{.underline}** that **[[different]{.underline}]{.mark}**
scientific **[[method]{.mark}ologie[s]{.mark} [generate
different]{.mark} kinds of [valid claims]{.mark} with different
epistemic statuses, and should not be regarded as poor approximations to
or deficient forms of one another.]{.underline}** While neopositivists
look for cross-case covariation as the truest mark of causation,
critical realists look for dispositional causal powers, analyticists
apply ideal-typical models to disclose the specific features of
individual cases, and reflexive scholars ground their claims in their
own social locations. There is no reason why this plurality has to lead
to relativism, but neither should it be misunderstood as creating a
simple, homogenous account of the world; translation challenges persist,
and **[the result of a pluralist science is a variety of warranted
knowledge-claims.]{.underline}**22

But for all of this internal diversity, there are important
commonalities among these varieties of scientific methodology that serve
to distinguish them, as a group, from other forms of knowing. Following
Max Weber, we might characterise all four of these scientific
methodologies as aiming at a 'thoughtful ordering of empirical
actuality',23 or, to put it another way, as participating in a form of
knowing that emphasises systematic claims, public criticism intended to
improve those claims, and a specific kind of 'worldliness' that excludes
references to divine commands and magical forces. This is not to say
that a claim has to achieve some specific level of systematicity,
publicity, and/or worldliness in order to be regarded as 'scientific';
the commonality I am highlighting here is not a candidate for a
demarcation criterion that would allow us to distinguish science from
non-science in any kind of definitive fashion.24 Instead, I am
suggesting that in the space marked out by these methodologies,
questions about a claim's systematicity, its susceptibility to public
criticism, and its worldliness are in some sense appropriate questions
to ask. In effect, to regard ourselves as being engaged in scientific
inquiry is to invite these questions, and to submit our claims to
evaluation in terms of these criteria.

The kind of knowledge that is supposed to be produced by efforts to be
as systematic, public, and worldly as one can be is knowledge of a
particular kind: factual, propositional knowledge, or what we might call
'knowing-that'.25 This is the kind of knowing that Wittgenstein had in
mind when he suggested, in the opening sections of the Tractatus, that
the world 'is all that is the case...the totality of facts, not of
things'.26 It is what Aristotle called epistemic knowing: 'universal,
invariable, context-independent' and 'based on general analytical
rationality'.27 It prizes relative impersonality in connecting claims to
their warrants, in that the validity of a claim is not subject to
idiosyncratic impressions but is instead articulated in a way that is
understood as generally established.28 In Weber's formulation, the goal
of this kind of knowing is to produce a set of factual claims that even
someone who did not share our values would find compelling.29

Here again it is important to note that this is not some kind of
absolute standard that these methodologies necessarily meet. **[It is
unclear to me that we ever have perfectly impersonal knowledge, or that
any claim whatsoever achieves anything like universal generality. But
this is not the point.]{.underline}** Instead, the point is that
**[[epistemic claims advanced in the]{.mark} methodological
[mode]{.mark}s [of]{.mark} neopositivism, critical [realism]{.mark},
analyticism, and even reflexivity [are accompanied by standards of
validity that purport to be something other than an arbitrary]{.mark}
whim]{.underline}** binding only on the speaker. **[The logical
condition of possibility for]{.underline}** Sandra **[Harding's
suggestion that]{.underline}** the accumulated body of what we call
'**[scientific knowledge']{.underline}** **[is thoroughly marked by
cultural particularity and a colonial past]{.underline}**, and her call
for a 'strong objectivity' that brings previously marginalised
perspectives back into the conversation, **[is precisely the notion that
there is something illegitimate and untenable about this unacknowledged
partiality]{.underline}**.30 **[And the claim that some account of
things is Eurocentric or androcentric is no more and no less reliant on
similar definitions and procedures shared by a community of speaker and
audience than is the claim that dyadic democracy and war frequency are
inversely correlated]{.underline}**---and as such, **[the very form of
the claim]{.underline}** **[opens the possibility of questioning just
how impersonally, epistemically valid it is. 'Epistemically valid for
me/for us' does not make any sense, because [the very idea of epistemic
knowing implies validity independent of any conceptual
scheme]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[even if]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[vocabulary]{.underline}** within which the
claim is made **[is itself local and contingent.]{.underline}**31

### L: Realism Good/True---2AC

#### Realism is the most [ethical]{.underline} paradigm---it accepts the [inherent insecurity]{.underline} of the nuclear age as a [precondition]{.underline} for genuine hospitality. Rejecting the nation-state lapses into liberal interventionism and [global nuclear civil war]{.underline}.

**[Lundborg, 19]{.underline}**---Swedish Defence University (Tom, "The
ethics of neorealism: Waltz and the time of international life,"
European Journal of International Relations, Volume: 25 issue: 1,
page(s): 229-249, dml)

Conditioned by the trace, **[survival is]{.underline}** thus
**[inseparable from]{.underline}** finitude and **[the constant threat
of [erasure]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1976: 167). According to
Derrida (1984b: 65, emphasis added): 'it belongs to the trace to erase
itself, to elude that which might maintain it in presence'. In this way,
the trace also points to the elusiveness of life, and to the fact that
nothing can ever guarantee the infinite existence of anything. It tells
us that **[life is nothing but a 'play of traces', which lacks an
absolute origin and is inherently mortal]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1984a:
15). **[This]{.underline}** play of traces brings us back to Hägglund's
notion of the 'time of life', which **[[highlights the]{.mark} central
[importance of]{.mark} temporal [finitude for grasping]{.mark} the
general conditions of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As he puts it: 'This
radical finitude of survival is not a lack of being that is desirable to
overcome. Rather, **[the finitude of survival opens the chance for
everything that is desired and the threat of everything that is
feared]{.underline}**' (Hägglund, 2008: 1--2). There is, then, an
important 'double bind' to the tracing of time. On the one hand, it is
because nothing is infinite, immortal or present in itself that new life
can emerge. On the other hand, the lack of self-presence means that life
can never be immune to alteration, contamination and death. **[In order
for anything to live, it must consequently be mortal and open to
unpredictable change]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1976: 143). Even if an
infinite and immortal life, free from dangers, might seem desirable, it
would be a self-refuting desire since it implies desiring the end of the
possibility to desire anything at all. More precisely, it would be the
same as desiring the end of the continuous flow of time that allows new
life to emerge while exposing everything that lives to the threat of
coming to an end. Immortality cancels out the time of mortal life and
renders survival obsolete. Counterintuitively, Hägglund (2008: 32--33)
thus notes, mortality can be seen as the 'best' or most desirable, while
immortality is the 'worst' or least desirable. **[While [this]{.mark}
may seem like a rejection of life, it is, in fact, an affirmation of
life. It positively [affirms the chance to live]{.mark} precisely [on
the condition that inherent]{.mark} in any movement of survival [is the
risk of]{.mark} life coming to [an end. Refusing this]{.mark} risk
[would be]{.mark} the same as [refusing to live]{.mark}, since to live
is to negotiate the relationship between life and death.]{.underline}**
Temporal finitude is significant, moreover, not only for grasping the
general conditions of life, but for explaining why **[any act of
survival must encounter the uncertainty of the future]{.underline}**.
Returning to Waltz for a moment, **[it is precisely [this]{.mark}
uncertainty that [makes it impossible to know if today's friend will
stay a friend or]{.mark} suddenly [turn into an
enemy]{.mark}]{.underline}**: 'In the absence of an external authority,
a state cannot be sure that today's friend will not be tomorrow's
enemy', writes Waltz (2000: 10). **[[If we]{.mark} were able to [acquire
full knowledge]{.mark} of if and when a friend becomes an
enemy]{.underline}**, we would bring the future under our control.
However, then the future would no longer be a genuinely open future, in
which the chance of survival is inseparable from finitude and mortality.
**[[Survival would]{.mark} then [lose its value]{.mark} and become
redundant as [life turns into]{.mark} nothing but [a calculable
formula]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So, what are the implications of
Derrida's notion of survival and his critique of the 'calculable' for
our understanding of 'ethics'? First of all, it means that **[[ethics
cannot be]{.mark} translated into [static]{.mark} ethical
ideals]{.underline}**. As Derrida has elaborated on in relation to a
wide array of issues, including justice, responsibility, hospitality,
friendship and the gift, **[ethics]{.underline}** rather **[depends on
maintaining openness to the perpetual coming of the
future]{.underline}**. This openness means that **[none of these issues
can ever be linked to something pure, uncontaminated and incorruptible
that is immune to unexpected alterations.]{.underline}** To take one
specific example, hospitality is, for Derrida, crucial for thinking
about ethics (see Derrida, 2000). This is because an **[act of
hospitality suggests that the self does not simply exist in pure
isolation of what lies 'outside' the self, but must always negotiate its
relation with]{.underline}** the non-self, that is, **[the
other]{.underline}**. Ethics is, for this reason, inseparable from
hospitality since both terms highlight the necessity of relating to and
opening up space for others. At the same time, **[[hospitality cannot
be]{.mark} 'absolute' or '[pure' in]{.mark} the sense of [conforming to
a static]{.mark} metaphysical [ideal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
Derrida, **[not only would [such]{.mark} an ideal [be impossible to
achieve]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Kantian sense11, **[it would be
essentially [undesirable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is because **[the
very aspiration towards a pure metaphysical ideal would have as its aim
the closure of the uncertainty that makes the self--other encounter
possible in the first place. The welcoming of strangers must therefore
always involve a chance as well as a threat: the chance of some sort of
positive and friendly transformation, and the threat that the other
turns into an enemy doing harm to the host]{.underline}** (Derrida,
2000: 15; Hägglund, 2008: 103--105). The only way to eliminate the
potential threat inherent in any act of hospitality would be to make the
self completely immune to the other. Such immunity, however, would close
down the self--other encounter before it could happen at all. Derrida
(2003: 129) thus rhetorically asks: The visit might actually be very
dangerous, and we must not ignore this fact, but would a hospitality
without risk, a hospitality backed by certain assurances, a hospitality
protected by an immune system against the wholly other, be true
hospitality? Derrida's point here is that **[hospitality categorically
cannot correspond to something pure, like a universal ideal situation
beyond violence]{.underline}**. This is because **[without the threat of
violence, the very act of welcoming the other would not be possible in
the first place]{.underline}**. In order for this act to be 'possible',
it must simultaneously be 'impossible', in the pure metaphysical sense
(see also Bulley, 2017: 12; Vaughan-Williams, 2007: 121). **[While
ethics is often linked to a seemingly self-evident desire to reach an
absolute metaphysical ideal, [Derrida]{.mark}'s philosophy contests the
desirability of such ideals altogether and [offers]{.mark} a stark
[warning against any attempt to immunize the 'good' from the
'bad']{.mark}, 'peace' from 'violence', 'friends' from 'enemies', and so
on]{.underline}**. This is why, in Derrida's view, **[there has to be a
violent or non-ethical opening of ethics]{.underline}** (Derrida, 1976:
140; 1978: 128). **[To desire the closure of this opening would be the
same as desiring the elimination of that which makes any ethics possible
at all: its exposure to the uncertainty of the future, and the
indestructible threat that inheres in all encounters with
others]{.underline}**. Rather than linking ethics to a desire for the
purely good, **[[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Derridean sense
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore **[[tied to an affirmation
of]{.mark} the [uncertainty]{.mark} of the future, which opens up to the
'good' as well as the 'bad'.]{.underline}** The ethics of neorealism
**[[Derrida's]{.mark} notion of]{.underline}** the violent opening of
**[[ethics fits]{.mark} remarkably well [with]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
two core assumptions of Waltz's theory of international politics:
**[[the anarchic]{.mark} structure of the international political
[system and]{.mark} states' [desire to survive]{.mark} within this
system]{.underline}**. On this basis, it can be argued that **[there
is]{.underline}**, indeed, **[an ethics of neorealism]{.underline}**. It
is found in the 'Waltzian baseline' rather than in attempts to use that
baseline to establish law-like patterns of behaviour.12 To grasp the
ethics of neorealism, **[it is]{.underline}** therefore **[necessary to
shift focus]{.underline}** from causal laws and testable hypotheses,
**[to the structural conditions that shape and affect the behaviour of
states in a non-deterministic manner]{.underline}**.13 Hence, **[the
'structure']{.underline}** in Waltz's theory has **[to be grasped as an
open structure that leaves ample room for chance and
contingency]{.underline}**. Crucially, **[if we could know for certain
what states will do on the basis of either the structure of the system
or some predetermined motives of the subjects within the
system]{.underline}**, the uncertainty of international life would
disappear and **[the 'politics' of international politics would lose its
meaning]{.underline}**.14 Rather than trying to rectify the lack of
certainty by creating a stronger sense of certainty, **[it
is]{.underline}** therefore **[imperative to affirm the uncertainties
created by the system. It is important]{.underline}**, moreover, **[to
oppose the distinction between ethical desirability and political
possibility, since the reproduction of this distinction blocks from view
the conditions of international life that make ethical thinking and
action possible in the first place.]{.underline}** Positivist social
science and liberal interpretations of Kant are thus, very crudely put,
the main obstacles to grasping the ethics of international life. In
resisting both moves, **[neo[realism does not]{.mark} seek to [close
down]{.mark} the violent opening of [ethics]{.mark} inherent in the
structure of anarchy]{.underline}**, for example, **[[by
formulating]{.mark} metaphysical [ideals informing states how they
should act or how they ought to be]{.mark}come [friends rather than
enemies]{.mark}. There can be no absolute friendship between states, and
[no state can]{.mark} ever [offer absolute hospitality]{.mark} to
another state. At the heart of every inter-state relation, there is
mistrust, uncertainty and incalculability. To positively affirm the
latter is not to say that uncertainty or incalculability is good per se.
Rather, it implies that they are seen as basic and irrefutable
conditions of international life, which, consequently, are not even
desirable to overcome]{.underline}**. Hence, it also implies that as
long as there is international life, there must be 'the ominous shadow
of the future \[that\] continues to cast its pall over interacting
states' (Waltz, 2000: 39). Crucially, Waltz's reference to
**[this]{.underline}** shadow **[should not be read as an expression of
determinism. It expresses rather an affirmation of uncertainty: the
'uncertainty of each about the other's future intentions and
actions']{.underline}** (Waltz, 1979: 105). **[In order to give
friendship in international politics a chance]{.underline}**, so to
speak, **[the possibility that a friend suddenly becomes an enemy must
never be eliminated. Attempts to create absolute trust in inter-state
relations are therefore not only impossible to achieve in the practical
sense, but essentially undesirable]{.underline}**.15 Along similar
lines, Derrida explains how **[friendship is possible only if one
remains open to the deception of the other, since it is precisely the
unconditional openness to whatever may happen in the encounter between
self and other that makes it possible to develop any sort of friendship
in the first place]{.underline}** (Derrida, 2005: 219). Even if we were
to accept Alexander Wendt's (1999) distinction between different
'cultures of anarchy', some of which are more 'friendly' than others,
**[[it is not self-evident that]{.mark} a culture in which
[friendship]{.mark} is prioritized [over enmity is]{.mark} actually a
[better]{.mark} one]{.underline}**. This is because in order to exclude
the possibility that a friend may suddenly become an enemy, one must
first eliminate the time of international life that makes the
self--other encounter possible in the first place. For the same reason,
the key message of democratic peace theory --- that all states should
become democracies in order to minimize or eliminate the possibility of
wars --- is not only practically impossible, but also ethically
undesirable. It is impossible to verify because there is no democracy
that is immune to corruptibility (Waltz, 2000: 10), but, in addition to
that, it can be seen as undesirable since **[the notion that all states
must conform to the same universal ideal cancels out their freedom to
act, to take moral responsibility and so on]{.underline}**. The
undesirability of **[[a system that eradicates]{.mark} violence,
[borders]{.mark} and discrimination]{.underline}** is further underlined
by Waltz (1979: 111--114) in his discussion of the 'virtues of anarchy'.
Therein, he attacks the idea of transforming the international system
into a world government. Not only **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** such
a transformation **['[be]{.mark} an invitation to prepare for
[world]{.mark} civil [war']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Waltz, 1979: 112),
**[but it would take away the constitutive violence at the heart of
inter-state relations in the structure of anarchy.]{.underline}**
**[[The]{.mark} constant [possibility of war]{.mark} in the
international system [means]{.mark} that [states will always be wary of
provoking others]{.mark} in the search for security]{.underline}**. As
he puts it: **[The constant possibility [that]{.mark} force will be used
limits manipulations, [moderates demands, and serves as an incentive for
the settlement of disputes]{.mark}. One who knows that pressing too hard
may lead to war has strong reason to consider whether possible gains are
worth the risks entailed]{.underline}**.... The possibility that
conflicts among nations may lead to long and costly wars has ...
sobering effects. (Waltz, 1979: 113--114) In this way, **[the conditions
of peace in the international system can be said to rest on the constant
possibility of war]{.underline}**. In making this point, Waltz argues
against moral universalism. Hence, unwittingly or otherwise, he also
opens up space for ethical negotiation by recognizing the finitude of
**[the political subject]{.underline}**, who **[is free to interact with
others only on the condition that self and other do not have to conform
to the 'same' universal ideal.]{.underline}** **[The subject is thus
able to take moral responsibility and ponder on how to make ethical
decisions, which, without difference and alterity, would turn into a
strictly formal procedure based on the 'mechanical application of
rules']{.underline}** (Zehfuss, 2009: 146). **[Responsibility and
ethical decisions are]{.underline}**, thus, **[made possible precisely
by the impossibility of predetermining what is the 'right' decision in
any given context]{.underline}**. As Derrida argues, **[irrespective of
how thorough the decision-making procedure is, and regardless of how
much knowledge is acquired before taking a decision]{.underline}**: the
instant of the decision, if there is to be a decision, must be
heterogeneous to this accumulation of knowledge. Otherwise, there is no
responsibility. In this sense only must the person taking the decision
not know everything. Even if one knows everything, **[the
decision]{.underline}**, if there is one, **[must advance toward a
future that is not known, that cannot be anticipated]{.underline}**.
(Derrida, 2002b: 231) **[The impossibility of anchoring the decision in
rational calculation is]{.underline}**, in this sense, **[what creates
the chance for any decisions to be taken at all]{.underline}**. The
instant of the decision belongs, then, not to a fully present moment in
which the subject calculates the future consequences of the decision,
but to a future that is incalculable (see Derrida, 2002a). **[[It
is]{.mark} precisely [this]{.mark} [incalculability]{.mark}, and the
uncertainty of the future, [that]{.mark}]{.underline}** Waltz's
conception of **[[anarchy]{.mark} positively [affirms]{.mark}. Rather
than making the instant of the decision obsolete by transforming the
decision into a mere application of rules, anarchy makes the ethical
decision 'possible'.]{.underline}** Even if Waltz repeatedly claims that
the desire to survive is a purely pragmatic assumption made strictly for
the purpose of constructing an explanatory theory, it is not neutral or
innocent. First and foremost, Waltzian **[neorealism expresses an ethics
due to the way it affirms states' desire to survive by stipulating the
necessary conditions of their survival]{.underline}**. More precisely,
**[[it]{.mark} affirms the uncertainty of international life by refusing
to reduce the play of relations between states to a calculable formula
or a regulative ideal, and that rather [embraces chance]{.mark} and
contingency as central features of the anarchic system --- features that
make states simultaneously free and insecure]{.underline}**.16 In this
light, **[the primary significance]{.underline}** of Waltz's theory
**[is [not as]{.mark} an [explanatory]{.mark} theory, [but]{.mark} as a
theory [that]{.mark} affirms]{.underline}** the time of international
life, defined by **[the uncertainty of the future]{.underline}** and the
logic of the erasable mortal trace.17 **[It is this notion of the future
that [makes it possible for states]{.mark}, as finite political
subjects, not only to survive, but also [to]{.mark} try to take moral
responsibility and [make ethical decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Why
universal ethical ideals are both impossible and undesirable What are
the implications of my reading of Waltzian **[neorealism]{.underline}**
as an ethics? First of all, it **[contributes to a new understanding of
the difficulties inherent in any attempt to theorize what it might mean
to replace the structure of anarchy with an international or world
political order that is supposedly 'more' ethical]{.underline}**. If
ethics is inextricably interlinked with the structural conditions of
survival, then **[[any attempt to challenge]{.mark} neo[realism]{.mark}
from an 'ethical' perspective [must]{.mark} do so [by replacing
one]{.mark} structure of [survival with another]{.mark}, and there can
be [no guarantees]{.mark} that [the new structure will be less
violent]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} While this does not in any way
prevent such attempts from being made, it does highlight the risky
nature of trying to resolve problems of war and violence in
international politics on ethical terms. For example, **[the idea of
creating [a new]{.mark} form of political [community that
transcends]{.mark} the exclusionary borders of states may seem naturally
desirable]{.underline}** (e.g. Linklater, 1982). **[Yet, regardless of
how sophisticated theories become in terms of articulating the content
and meaning of such a community, there can be no guarantees that
[attempts]{.mark} to actualize it [will]{.mark} not [result in]{.mark}
even [more violence]{.mark}. There are no guarantees]{.underline}**, as
John Mearsheimer (1994: 44) puts it, **[that 'a [fascist discourse far
more violent]{.mark} than realism [will]{.mark} not [emerge]{.mark} as
the new hegemonic discourse'.]{.underline}** Moreover, it is important
to point out that the value of a neorealist ethics is not that it
provides a 'coherent ethical theory'. One interesting attempt to create
such a theory is found in Frost's (2009) Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom
and International Relations. For Frost, the point of developing a
coherent ethical theory is to demonstrate how international relations
can be grasped primarily in ethical terms, rather than as a struggle for
power and survival. His assumption is that 'to engage in international
relations at all ... is to make ethical claims for oneself and to
recognize the ethical standing of others' (Frost, 2009: 19). Frost links
his theory partly to the diverse practices that shape international
interactions, and partly to an 'ethical background theory which
justifies the whole set of rules which constitute the practice' (Frost,
2009: 27). While the background theory is based on an English
School-inspired notion of the anarchic system/society of states, the
practices added to it have the potential to shape international
relations in a direction that is ethically desirable. Arguing for and
against the ethical standing of our interlocutors, 'we construct and
reconstruct the social practices within which international relations
are conducted' (Frost, 2009: 94). The main goal of these practices,
according to Frost, should be nothing less than resolving the tensions
within the current international system between citizen rights and
global human rights (Frost, 2009: ch. 3). In contrast to cosmopolitan
theories, however, he argues that this goal is attainable within the
anarchic structure of the system, through the ethical adjustment of that
system (Frost, 2009: 113). This adjustment involves renegotiating the
relationship between citizen rights and human rights through practice.
Frost (2009: 173) writes: 'Participants in global civil society and the
society of states need to take their own values seriously and need to
attempt to make them real for everybody everywhere'. **[According to
Frost,]{.underline}** **[the segregating borders of states are thus
meant to persist, while the violent forms of exclusion]{.underline}**
that these borders enable **[are to gradually fall away through the
aspiration of [a common]{.mark} goal [that embraces everybody
everywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}**. From the perspective of my reading of
a neorealist ethics, however, **[the notion of a common universal goal
underpinning Frost's ethical theory [is]{.mark} not only impossible, but
also [undesirable]{.mark}. This is [not because the ideal]{.mark} itself
[is 'bad']{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather, it is because **[[it
is]{.mark} precisely [the absence of a]{.mark} common [goal beyond
segregating borders that makes ethic]{.mark}al negotiation
[possible]{.mark} in the first place.]{.underline}** **[As soon as such
an ideal has been formulated, and the guidelines for how to attain it
have been articulated, the incalculable future in which the encounter
between self and other is allowed to play out is cancelled
out]{.underline}**. As previously noted, **[while this encounter might
result in more or less violence, it is the uncertainty of the future
that makes the encounter possible in the first place.]{.underline}**
Frost's **[attempt to formulate a universal ethical ideal that embraces
everyone everywhere while, at the same time, retaining
the]{.underline}** segregating borders of the **[international system is
thus problematic]{.underline}**. The primary reason for this, then, is
that in articulating a universal ethical ideal, his theory works to
undermine the conditions of international life. In brief, what Frost
fails to recognize is that **[what makes international ethics possible
is also what makes impossible the aspiration of a universal ethical
ideal that is applicable to everybody everywhere]{.underline}** --- like
that of a perfect alignment of citizen rights and human rights.
**[Rather than seeking to resolve these tensions, the tensions should be
kept alive. Only in this way can we, moreover, maintain a distinctly
international ethics without reverting to a 'global
ethics']{.underline}**. For **[the latter]{.underline}** to make any
sense, it **[has to be based on ideals that transcend]{.underline}** the
**[borders]{.underline}** of states, whether those ideals are linked to
a specific goal or just to a general attitude of openness to political
negotiation and contestation (Hutchings, 2010: 215). **[Irrespective of
what precisely they are supposed to entail, the ideals associated with a
global ethics become problematic as soon as the attempt is made to
transform difference and the plurality of wills into one and the same
will]{.underline}**. It is problematic for the same reason that
philosophical attempts to create a new metaphysics that is supposed to
resolve the violence of metaphysics. **[Such attempts can only have as
their aim the ultimate destruction of the very possibility of
philosophical thought]{.underline}** and writing,
**[which]{.underline}**, per definition, **[are metaphysical and
therefore violent]{.underline}** (see Derrida, 1978). The temporal
horizon of neorealism **[To argue against the desirability of universal
ethical ideals is]{.underline}**, essentially, **[to recognize the
importance of finitude for thinking about international
ethics]{.underline}**. Waltz's neorealist **[conception of international
anarchy and of the desire of states to survive therein offers one way of
affirming this notion of international ethics. This is not to
say]{.underline}**, however, **[that international
anarchy]{.underline}** in Waltz's theory **[should be seen as a perfect
ideal that all politics and ethics must aspire to
maintain]{.underline}**. In order for my deconstructive approach to the
ethics of neorealism to make any sense, **[the international must also
be seen as something finite and deconstructible, rather than as an end
in itself]{.underline}**. To think of the finitude of the international,
**[we do not have to look for something that 'transcends' or comes
'after' the international, like a world government or cosmopolitan
community]{.underline}**.18 **[[We]{.mark} only [have to]{.mark} focus
on the principles that]{.underline}**, according to Waltz, **[are meant
to [keep]{.mark} the international order [alive]{.mark}: the structure
of [anarchy]{.mark} and states' desire to survive]{.underline}**. While
these are mutually dependent, **[they]{.underline}** also **[point to a
situation in which the struggle to stay alive might threaten the system
in which this struggle takes place]{.underline}**. To illustrate this
point, **[consider]{.underline}** the issue of **[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**, which Waltz controversially saw as a possible
method of creating a more peaceful international order (see Waltz,
1990b). For Waltz, **[[only if]{.mark} nuclear [catastrophe
remains]{.mark} a [real]{.mark} possibility [will states need to]{.mark}
actively [deter the]{.mark} nuclear [threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**.19
Thus, **[nuclear deterrence 'works' only if nuclear war remains a
constant possibility, hence only insofar as the problem of nuclear war
is not permanently resolved]{.underline}** (Waltz, 1990b: 743--744).
**[[What creates]{.mark} the possibility of [nuclear war
constitutes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in this sense, **[[the conditions
of]{.mark} international security and [peace. What makes]{.mark} the
prospect of nuclear war different from other wars is]{.underline}**, of
course, **[the planetary scale on which its effects are likely to be
felt]{.underline}**. As such, **[it poses a threat]{.underline}** not
only to individual states, but also **[to the entire system of
states]{.underline}**. On this point, there is another parallel to be
drawn between Waltz and Derrida, for whom **[[apocalyptic
discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}** on nuclear war are interesting because
they highlight 'the absolute effacement of any possible trace' (Derrida,
1984c: 28). Hence, these discourses **[[raise the stakes]{.mark} of
survival [even further by pointing to the finitude of everything that
lives]{.mark}, as well as to all those attempts at keeping the
apocalypse at bay, deferring it through deterrence]{.underline}** and so
on (Derrida, 1984d: 29). Understood as a global threat to the entire
international order, nuclear war highlights the temporal horizon of the
whole neorealist project as conceived by Waltz. This is the horizon of
the horizon, or the structure of the structure, which gives meaning to
the 'international' as a finite as opposed to infinite category shaping
the behaviour of states. **[Rather than simply reaffirming a static
world-view, which perpetually reproduces itself in a circular
fashion]{.underline}**, Waltz puts forward a notion of **[the
international]{.underline}** that **[is both finite and mortal. The
international continues to live on]{.underline}** in this sense, **[but
only on the condition that it is exposed to the threat of coming to an
end]{.underline}**. Other examples of how the international system may
come to an end relate to the increased impact of global capital and
global warming. While these are often depicted as typical examples of
transnational phenomena, they nevertheless emanate from a system in
which states are free to make sovereign decisions, for example, on how
to deregulate the emissions of pollutants and financial markets.
**[Individual states are]{.underline}** thus **[free to actively
contribute to setting in motion processes that might put an end to the
system that conditions their survival]{.underline}**. In this way,
**[there is a self-destructive potential built into the system, which
threatens to make it collapse from within and on its own
terms]{.underline}** (see also Frost, 2009: 163--168). Crucially, the
self-destructive potential of international politics does not contradict
Waltz's theory. After all, he argues that **[the system shapes, not
determines, state behaviour]{.underline}**. He recognizes that **[as
long as states interact within an anarchic structure, they are
simultaneously free and insecure]{.underline}**. This freedom and
insecurity mean that **[survival in international politics can never
become a predictable science that is able to 'remove the uncertainty of
politics']{.underline}** (Waltz, 1990a: 37). **[Sometimes, the struggle
to survive does more harm than good to the ones seeking to survive.
Sometimes, this struggle may even set in motion processes the effects of
which will be felt on a planetary scale, provoking an irreversible decay
of the entire system of sovereign states.]{.underline}** Conclusion The
ethics of neorealism, as argued in this article, stems from the mutual
interaction of the two core themes of Waltz's theory: **[the structure
of anarchy and states' desire to survive]{.underline}**. Together, they
**[affirm]{.underline}** Derrida's notion of **[the violent opening of
ethics: the opening to a future that makes new life possible while
exposing everything that lives to finitude and the threat of erasure.
Ethics and violence are]{.underline}**, thus, **[inextricably
interlinked, which means that any attempt to immunize the former from
the latter is untenable. Before any moral obligations, and before any
normative commitments, the ethics of neorealism addresses the more
fundamental problem of what it means for states to live and be free in a
system that guarantees nothing]{.underline}**. In this way, Waltzian
**[neorealism articulates the basic conditions of international life,
which all attempts to theorize international ethics]{.underline}**,
either by remaining 'within' the international system or by arguing in
favour of its transcendence, **[must come to terms with]{.underline}**.
One of the main challenges that springs from my reading of the ethics of
neorealism relates to how **[[universal ethical ideals]{.mark} not only
become impossible to achieve in the practical sense, but are also
fundamentally undesirable]{.underline}**. They are undesirable because
**[the desire to fulfil them [undermines the conditions that
make]{.mark} international [life possible]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline}**. On this basis, a whole range of **[attempts to
theorize the meaning and implications of international ethics,
which]{.underline}** in various ways **[hold on to the notion of ethical
ideals beyond the violence of inter-state relations within an anarchic
structure, become untenable]{.underline}**. This even includes classical
realism and the thought of Morgenthau, whose sharp distinction between
ethical desirability and political possibility dissolves in light of the
neorealist ethics presented in this article. According to this notion of
ethics, then, **[the desirable cannot be placed beyond political
possibility since it essentially is political
possibility]{.underline}**: the possibility of whatever happens in the
interaction among states in the structure of anarchy. As was pointed out
in the penultimate section of this article, there is also a temporal
horizon of neorealism. This horizon is best illustrated by the threat of
**[[nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[highlights the possible
end of the entire]{.underline}** international political **[system. The
threat of nuclear war demonstrates why this system, just like the state,
ought to be seen as a finite as opposed to infinite category. Stressing
the finitude of the system [means that there is no metaphysical
truth]{.mark}, moral or otherwise, [to which it]{.mark} either [can or
should conform. It]{.mark} also [means that there is always space, and
time, for]{.mark} an ongoing ethical-political
[negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While the latter might very well
include efforts to produce a 'lesser violence', its main force is that
of a perpetual coming of the future. **[As long as this future is
allowed to play out, there is]{.underline}**, I believe, **[reason to be
optimistic: optimistic not about the possible fulfilment of universal
ethical ideals, but about the future itself, and whatever it holds for
international life]{.underline}**.

### L: Realism Good/True---1AR 

#### Realism [is not]{.underline} interventionism 

John J. **[Mearsheimer]{.underline}**, 20**[18]{.underline}**, Prof of
Poli Sci @ UChi, The Great Delusion LIBERAL DREAMS AND INTERNATIONAL
REALITIES, Yale University Press, e book page 220-221

**[[Most]{.mark} students of international politics [associate realism
with]{.mark} rivalry and [conflict]{.mark}. This, of course, is one
reason realism is so unpopular in liberal societies]{.underline}**.2 It
is also disliked because realists consider war a legitimate tool of
statecraft that can be employed to either maintain the balance of power
or shift it in an advantageous way. Advocates of realpolitik downplay
the prospects for cooperation among states, moreover, because they think
countries have to provide for their own security, given that they
operate in a world with no higher authority to protect them. To maximize
their survival prospects, those states have little choice but to compete
for power, which can be a ruthless and bloody business. Realism does not
inspire a hopeful outlook for the future.

Nevertheless, **[[realists are generally less warlike than
liberals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who have a strong inclination to use
force to promote international peace, even while they dismiss the
argument that war is a legitimate instrument of statecraft. This point
is illustrated by Valerie Morkevičius's observation, in her comparison
of the two bodies of theory, that **[most realists opposed the U.S.
invasion of Iraq in 2003, while America's three most prominent just war
theorists (Jean Elshtain, James Turner Johnson, and Michael Walzer)
"viewed the war more positively." She concludes that "conventional
wisdom holds that realists support the recourse to war more than just
war theorists. I argue that the opposite is true: [just war theory
produces a more bellicose orientation than
realism]{.mark}."]{.underline}**3

**[Many [realists]{.mark} actually [believe that if states acted
according to balance-of-power logic, there would be hardly any
wars]{.mark} between the great powers]{.underline}**. These "defensive
realists" maintain that the structure of **[[the international system
usually punishes aggressors]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and that the push
toward war usually comes from domestic political forces. [Great
powers]{.mark}, in other words, most often [go to war for non-realist
reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This perspective is nicely captured in
the title of Charles Glaser's important article "Realists as
Optimists."4 Other prominent defensive realists include Jack Snyder,
Stephen Van Evera, and even Kenneth Waltz, who is sometimes mistakenly
said to argue that international anarchy causes states to act
aggressively to gain power.5 Two other realists, Sebastian Rosato and
John Schuessler, advocate a realist foreign policy for the United States
that they describe as a "recipe for security without war."6

The historian Marc **[Trachtenberg, who looks at the world from the
perspective of a defensive realist, explicitly argues that following the
dictates of realism leads to a relatively peaceful world]{.underline}**,
while acting according to what he calls "impractical idealism" leads to
endless trouble. His reading of history tells him that "**[serious
trouble developed only when states failed to act in a way that made
sense in power-political terms." [Conflict occurs when states "squander
\[power]{.mark}\] on moralistic, imperialistic, or ideological
enterprises." Realism, he maintains, is "at heart a theory of
peace]{.underline}**, and it is important that it be recognized as
such." In brief, "power is not unstable."7

I do not share this sanguine understanding of realism. The structure of
the international system often forces great powers to engage in intense
security competition and sometimes initiate wars. International politics
is a nasty and brutish business, and not just because misguided liberal
ideas or other malevolent domestic political forces influence states'
foreign policies. Great powers occasionally start wars for sound realist
reasons.

Still, **[[even if states act according to]{.mark} my [harsher version
of realism, they are likely to fight fewer international wars]{.mark}
than if they follow liberal principles. There are three reasons why even
hard-nosed offensive realists like me are less likely to advocate war
than liberals.]{.underline}** First, because **[great powers operating
[under realist dictates]{.mark} are principally concerned with
maximizing their share of global power, [there are]{.mark} only a
[limited]{.mark} number of [regions where they should be willing to
risk]{.mark} a [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Those places include the
great power's own neighborhood and distant areas that are either home to
another great power or the site of a critically important resource. For
the United States, three regions outside the Western Hemisphere are of
vital strategic importance today: Europe and East Asia, because that is
where the other great powers are located; and the Persian Gulf, because
it is the main source of an exceptionally important resource, oil.

This means the United States should not fight wars in Africa, Central
Asia, or areas of the Middle East that lie outside the Persian Gulf.
During the Cold War, for example, realists maintained that American
policymakers should avoid wars in the "Third World" or "Developing
World" because it was populated with minor powers that were of little
strategic significance.8 **[Almost every realist opposed the Vietnam
War, because Vietnam's fate held little strategic consequence for the
global balance of power]{.underline}**.9

Liberals, on the other hand, tend to think of every area of the world as
a potential battlefield, because they are committed to protecting human
rights everywhere and spreading liberal democracy far and wide. They
would naturally prefer to achieve these goals peacefully, but they are
usually willing to countenance using military force if necessary. In
short, while realists place strict limits on where they are willing to
employ force, liberals have no such limits. For them, vital interests
are everywhere.

Second, **[[realists are inclined to be cautious about using
force]{.mark} or even the threat of force because they recognize that
balance-of-power [logic will compel other states to contain
aggressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even if they are liberal democracies.
Of course, balancing does not always work, which is why wars sometimes
occur. Great powers are especially vigilant about their security, and
when they feel threatened, they invariably take measures to protect
themselves. This wariness explains why Russian leaders have stubbornly
opposed NATO enlargement since the mid-1990s and why most American
realists opposed it as well. **[Liberals, however, tend to dismiss
balance-of-power logic as irrelevant in the twenty-first century. This
kind of thinking helps to make liberals less restrained than realists
about using military force]{.underline}**.

By revisiting the conceptions of Carl von Clausewitz and Thomas
Schelling, two central, yet distinctive, strategists, I have showed that
**[[strategic studies]{.mark} helps [transcend]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}**
**[[rationalism/constructivism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
materialism/idealist, **[[problem-solving/critical
theorizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[dichotomies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[and]{.mark} [bridges]{.mark} [gaps]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see also
Vennesson 2017). While reason certainly plays a central role in
strategic studies, **[[the field is not dogmatically rationalist]{.mark}
and combines material and nonmaterial factors]{.underline}**. **[The
quest for [emancipation]{.mark} is not only compatible with,
but]{.underline}** often **[[necessitates]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[the logics of strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[These dimensions
have never been hidden or suppressed (except perhaps in critical
security accounts): they have always been constitutive of strategic
studies]{.underline}**.

Although these dichotomies prove to be misleading, it does not mean that
nothing has been learned by engaging with them. One lesson is that it is
important to distinguish strategic studies from related, but distinct,
bodies of thought. These dichotomies miss the mark in part because
**[[strategic studies is]{.underline}]{.mark}** at times
**[[conflated]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[with]{.mark}
weapon-systems-centered operational research]{.underline}**, system
analysis, **[or even]{.underline}** Kenneth Waltz's
**[[neorealism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Such [reductionist
perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[lead to a distorted view of the
field as a whole]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Critical security advocates
are, nevertheless, correct that "hectic empiricism" and the permanent
quest of the new fad has been a cause of strategic studies decline.
Critics are also right to remind students of strategy that references to
strategic thinkers such as Carl von Clausewitz or Thomas Schelling
cannot remain shallow and ritualistic. While they should not become the
exclusive focus of the field, conceptual and epistemological questions
about strategy are important and deserve careful consideration (see for
example Nordin and Öberg 2015).

**[[Breaking out of the conceptual jails]{.mark} in which strategy has
been incarcerated [makes it easier]{.mark} for students of security and
IR [to reappropriate strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, one of the oldest
and central forms of practice and knowledge surrounding international
security. **[It offers]{.underline}** a distinctive conception of the
very nature of world politics and, more specifically, **[a theory of
political action in international relations]{.underline}**. While I can
only sketch a research agenda here, several promising dimensions \[are
noteworthy.\] ~~stand out~~. First, **[[strategic thinking provides a
versatile]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[not military-focused, [view]{.mark}
of security: it has a core---the threat and use of organized force for
political ends---but it can go well beyond]{.underline}**. This is
because **[strategic thinking can be]{.underline}** (and has been)
**[used [to analyze any]{.mark} security [issue]{.mark}]{.underline}**
when actors interacting in a conflicting environment are involved and
use a range of coercive means. Second, **[[strategic studies is
politics]{.mark} and polities-centered, [not
state-centric]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[any kind of political
community]{.underline}**, large or small, **[can develop strategic
actions]{.underline}**. Political communities' political ends provide
guiding parameters that are connected to diverse means in myriad ways.
Third, [**[strategy is global]{.underline}**, **[not
Western-centric]{.underline}**, **[in its roots and
manifestations]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Vennesson 2017). Fourth,
**[strategy is about real reason, how security actors actually think and
feel, not rationalism]{.underline}**. Fifth, it is social-materialist:
it recognizes the reciprocal determination of technology and society.
Finally, **[[strategic thinking can make emancipations possible through
problem-solving]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Showing that **[[strategic studies is not]{.mark} intrinsically
rationalist]{.underline}**, materialist, **[and
[acritical]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[facilitates the intellectual
reacquisition of, and critical reengagement with, strategic
thought]{.underline}**. **[The examination of [strategic thought reveals
a rich repository]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[of insights,
concepts]{.mark}, precedents, [and categories]{.mark} profoundly [well
suited to probe]{.mark} current [situations]{.mark} and needs [in world
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead of dealing with strategic
thinking at arm's length, security and IR specialists can embrace a vast
reservoir of ideas, concepts, and mechanisms available for theory
building. **[Strategic thinking provides an intricate set of
information, knowledge, and concepts, which are partially universal and
transhistorical and partially contextual historically and
culturally]{.underline}**. This information crystalizes in the
discourses of strategic thinkers and in the actions of strategists.
Security and IR **[[scholars]{.mark} [can]{.mark} profitably
[revisit]{.mark} this vast reservoir of [concepts]{.mark} and mechanisms
forged by strategists and strategic theorists and borrow [and]{.mark}
[reformulate them]{.mark} to serve their purpose]{.underline}**.
**[[Examples include polarity]{.mark}, escalation, grammar of war,
[freedom of action]{.mark}, [stability]{.mark}, indirect approach,
threat that leaves something to chance, [and political-strategic
expectation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Moreover, **[by focusing on how states use their material resources,
strategic perspectives offer a promising path to reconceptualizing
power]{.underline}** (Biddle 2004; Seybert and Katzenstein 2018). They
notably suggest that capability is not primarily a matter of material
resources but how potential capacities are actualized in creative ways.
Viewed through these lenses, **[the concept of power itself requires
more disaggregate treatment, as it is inherently multidimensional and
not easily fungible across specific tasks and geopolitical
contexts]{.underline}**. Strategic perspectives also suggest a careful
examination of differences in the ways in which strategic actors
actualize and employ their potential capacities. In addition, the
strategic understanding of world politics emphasizes the logics of the
situation and their interlocking features---including the tactics of the
actors involved---and downplays preconditions, antecedents, or
previously existing causes. It recognizes that **[international
interactions have logics of their own and tend to take off and become
independent from the conditions of their genesis]{.underline}**. It
seeks to explore what these critical events or processes are made of. In
that sense, strategic thinking is indispensable for approaching what
Lucia Seybert and Peter Katzenstein call "protean power"---that is, "the
effect of improvisational and innovative responses to uncertainty that
arise from actors' creativity and agility in response to uncertainty"
(Seybert and Katzenstein 2018, 4).

Finally, **[going beyond conventional dichotomies helps reconnect
practical and social scientific knowledge]{.underline}** (Desch 2019).
**[[Strategic thought]{.mark} is a central form of enriched practical
knowledge about conflict, and international relations]{.underline}**
more broadly, **[which [finds its source over centuries of practical
self-reflection]{.mark} and judgement]{.underline}**. **[[Emptying
strategy out of security theories]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policies
**[that do not involve military force, [such as]{.mark} poverty, famine,
political [oppression]{.mark}, and environmental
degradation]{.underline}**--- to name but a
few---**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** proving
**[[unwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[as well as
unsustainable]{.underline}**. **[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}** security
**[[issues]{.mark} might not directly implicate military power, but
they]{.underline}** often **[[involve]{.mark} a set of]{.underline}**
mental and physical **[[operations to]{.mark} calculate,
[prepare]{.mark}, and conduct finalized collective [action in a
conflictual environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### L: A2 "AI"---2AC

#### AI is a [real threat]{.underline}, but [empirics prove]{.underline} that [norms]{.underline} solve\-\--legal apparatuses are [key]{.underline}

**[Maas 19]{.underline}**, Matthijs\-\--Faculty of Law, Centre for
International Law, Conflict and Crisis, University of Copenhagen,
Copenhagen, Denmark; Center for the Governance of AI, Future of Humanity
Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK ("How viable is
international arms control for military artificial intelligence? Three
lessons from nuclear weapons," Contemporary Security Policy, vol 40, no
3, 2019)

More often, **[[norms]{.mark}---implicitly the "nuclear
taboo]{.underline}**" against the (first) use of nuclear weapons
(Carranza, 2018), **[and explicitly the norms encoded by international
legal instruments, including the]{.underline}** Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (**[NPT]{.underline}**) **[and
the]{.underline}** Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty
(**[CTBT)---appear to have served as a factor in [constrain]{.mark}ing
[nuclear proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though such norm
enforcement is not without challenge (Knopf, 2018). Nonetheless, these
global legal instruments can function, in part because they can provide
shared normative frameworks that disseminate and promote
non-proliferation norms, -interests and -identities at the
domestic-political level, tipping the balance of domestic contestation
towards coalitions seeking non-proliferation. While one might expect
such effects of "norms capture" to be stronger in liberal societies than
in non-liberal ones, some scholars have suggested that even in the
latter case, state elites who are not accountable to their own publics
simply come to internalize the normative characterization of a
successful state as one that abides by its treaty commitments (Rublee,
Bertsch, & Wiarda, 2009, p. 222), or at the very least, have incentives
for compliance with international non-proliferation norms, to foster a
reputation for reliability in the eyes of other states (Williamson,
2003, p. 81). Moreover, **[global international
regimes]{.underline}**---defined by Krasner (1982) as "**[sets of
implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision-making
procedures around which actors' expectations converge in a given area of
international relations]{.underline}**" (p. 2)---**[can serve as
Schelling Points around which global society can coordinate multilateral
collective sanctions or rewards]{.underline}** (Müller & Schmidt, 2010).

To what extent have non-proliferation norms driven nuclear restraint? Of
course, it can be hard to disentangle causal connections between
membership in normative (legal) instruments such as the NPT and nuclear
restraint, since such behavior could reflect existing policy preferences
by the states. Some reviews of the nuclear (non-)proliferation records
have suggested that "NPT membership and the NPT regime\'s norms have
modest or marginal impacts on nuclear proliferation" (Jo & Gartzke,
2007, p. 185), though others found that, when accounting for states' ex
ante treaty commitment preferences, state ratification of the NPT treaty
regime was "robustly associated with a lower likelihood of pursuing
nuclear weapons" (Fuhrmann & Lupu, 2016, p. 530).

Intriguingly, while public norms seem to be able to strengthen the hands
of (non-)proliferation coalitions, they do not seem to reliably shift
state policymaking where these coalitions do not already exist in
sufficient strength. For instance, in 1994 Ukraine chose to join the NPT
and renounce its nuclear arsenal in spite of respectable Ukrainian
public support for retaining the weapons (Sagan, 1996, p. 80).
Conversely, in 1999 the U.S. Senate rejected the CTBT in the face of
widespread U.S. public support.

As with all history, it can be hard to distill unambiguous causal
chains; yet surveys of the distinct state rationales for nuclear
proliferation and of --non-proliferation or the abandonment of ongoing
nuclear programs (Garnett, 2012; Sagan, 1996, 2011; Solingen, 1994; van
der Meer, 2011, 2014), suggests that, far from proliferation cascades
fueled by security and strategic concerns, a far wider array of motives
shaped these decision-making processes, with elements of all three
models---security, domestic politics, and norms---playing different
roles amongst different states, and often contributing to a decision to
forego or abandon nuclear proliferation. For instance, Solingen has
charted the role of ascendant liberalizing coalitions, in countries such
as Taiwan, South Korea, and Argentina, in shifting towards nuclear
restraint, because of the favorable impact of this decision on
international trade, aid, technology and investment opportunities, as
well as to reduce perceived wasteful budgets for such military programs
(Solingen, 1994). The broad history of nuclear restraint suggests that,
far from a foregone conclusion, arms races involving strategically
appealing technologies can be slowed, channeled, or stopped. This
suggests that halting, managing or containing military AI arms races is
viable---and hints at a range of considerations for doing so.

In the first place, it suggests that security concerns are conducive but
not decisive to arms races, and that a limited number of "first-mover"
major powers may share an interest in supporting global legal regimes
aimed at the non-proliferation of certain forms of military AI, such as
cyber warfare systems, which might otherwise empower conventionally
weaker (or non-state) rivals. Given that this group of "leading" states
is initially small, bilateral agreements may suffice; however, the
unevenly shared stakes in the technology may render eventual
multilateral negotiations more difficult (cf. Picker, 2001).

In the second place, **[the [domestic-politics]{.mark} model [suggests
that strengthening]{.mark} the hand of [domestic coalitions
pursuing]{.mark} the [non-proliferation of AI]{.mark} weapons [is one
path]{.mark}way [towards shifting]{.mark} state decision-making [away
from]{.mark} pursuing more [problematic]{.mark} categories of [military
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even in the face of clear national security
interests. Of course, one caveat here concerns the fact that military AI
may have far broader appeal than nuclear weapons did, such that it is
harder to find domestic coalitions that are clearly opposed to its
development in all cases. For instance, the strategic benefits of
developing nuclear weapons are almost solely military and relatively
discrete---a half-finished nuclear weapon is not even half as useful as
a finished one, and the road from starting a nuclear program towards
developing, not just a working weapon or small arsenal, but a credibly
survivable and deliverable deterrent is long and potentially less useful
(because more provocative to well-armed adversaries) than not initiating
a nuclear breakout to begin with. In contrast, the benefits of pursuing
military AI might be more linear and gradual, with intermediate advances
in subfields (e.g., image recognition or drone swarming command and
control) enabling not just immediate application to battlefield roles,
but also economically productive spin-offs to civilian applications.
These features, combined with the comparatively lower reputational
costs, may make some forms of military AI more palatable. But not all.
Exceptions may be found in high-performance adversarial contexts (such
as cyber warfare or aerial warfare) where AI systems or platforms end up
directly engaging with each other. In such cases, as Payne (2018a) has
argued, "marginal quality might prove totally decisive" because "other
things being equal, we can expect higher-quality AI to comprehensively
defeat inferior rivals" (p. 24). In such domains, the incentives for
parties to independently develop "second-rate" military AI capabilities
might be lower. Conversely, where AI systems do not have to "fight their
like" directly (e.g., logistics; facial recognition), second-best AI
systems still offer military advantage, and could proliferate widely
(Horowitz, 2018a, 2018b). This suggests that **[the precise appeal of
military AI systems to different parties may be more complex---which
offers openings for tailored engagement with domestic
coalitions]{.underline}**.

Thirdly, **[[the "norms"-model suggests that]{.mark}, while
policy-makers may pursue the [development of AI]{.mark} in general
because of its "symbolic" value as a marker of global scientific
leadership, this [may not transfer to]{.mark} the development of AI for
[military purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, **[the degree to
which military AI confers status may be mixed]{.underline}**: Pursuing
openly autonomous "killer robots" may indeed remain unappealing for
states. For instance, over the past years, global surveys of public
opinion show that in most countries (excepting India), majorities oppose
the deployment of autonomous weapons (Open Roboethics Initiative, 2015;
Roff, 2017). An opposition appears to be on the rise: an even more
recent survey by Ipsos showed an increase in global opposition (from 56%
to 61%) since 2017 (IPSOS, 2019). At the same time, other surveys have
shown that public opposition to these weapons can be very
context-dependent, and drops off if their usage is framed as being
defensive and aimed at reducing casualties amongst friendly troops
(Horowitz, 2016; West, 2018). In another U.S. survey, Americans
generally expressed mixed support for the United States investing more
in AI military capabilities, but also for the United States to cooperate
with China to avoid the dangers of an AI arms race (Zhang & Dafoe, 2019,
pp. 26--30).

Moreover, **[[advocacy efforts might]{.mark} well be able to
[shift]{.mark} these [public norms on military AI further---and]{.mark}
thereby [alter the]{.mark} reputational [penalties and rewards of
deploying new systems or for complying with]{.mark} restrictive [global
regulation]{.mark}, respectively]{.underline}**. Indeed, it is important
to recognize the considerable efforts that have been put into making
"killer robots" normatively unpalatable, notably by movements such as
the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of 89 NGOs from 50
countries (cf. Joshi, 2019). In fall 2018, both the European Parliament
as well as United Nations Secretary General António Guterres called for
bans on autonomous weapons (European Parliament, 2018; Guterres, 2018);
and at present at least two dozen states are pursuing such a legally
binding ban---although states such as the United States, United Kingdom,
and Russia still explicitly oppose such an initiative (Joshi, 2019).
Even if such public advocacy efforts have not (yet) produced a ban on
autonomous weapons, this does not mean they have not already influenced
the normative space around military AI.

However, to what extent will a specific opprobrium on the---important,
but narrow---category of autonomous weapons transfer to other types of
military AI? Indeed, beyond "killer robots," it is unclear to what
extent states will face a meaningful or strong "military AI taboo" with
the same strength as the "nuclear taboo." After all, the latter norm was
possible and potent, because nuclear weapons are a "single" technology
with a single discrete, publicly visible and viscerally horrifying use
mode. This created a natural and unambiguous "red line" in usage, not to
be crossed. Conversely, **[[the deployment and use of AI]{.mark} in many
(non-kinetic) military applications [is already a
fact]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such that this Rubicon has been crossed.
Moreover, **[the [tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark} moreover very
[heterogeneous]{.mark}, such that whereas [visceral
applications]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., "killer robots") **[[may
generate public opprobrium]{.mark} and restrictive activism, [more
diffuse or less kinetic ones]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., logistics
systems; capabilities to track missile submarines) **[[may
not]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[It would therefore be advisable that
organizations pursuing bans of the technology, consider the degree to
which framings of "killer robots" continue to correspond to developments
in military AI, including other usages which are potentially unethical,
unsafe, or destabilizing]{.underline}**.

Finally, while public norms or activism against military AI may
strengthen domestic political coalitions already opposed to these
weapons, they alone are not always able to sway policymakers in the
first place. **[[A key route lies]{.mark} therefore [in shaping
policymakers' norms]{.mark} (and indirectly the domestic political
landscapes). [This relies on]{.mark} the [(top-down]{.mark})
norm-shaping [influence]{.mark} exerted b[y global legal instruments and
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but also on the (bottom-up)
institutionalization of norms by "elite entrepreneurship in norm change"
(Lantis, 2018), and specifically through "epistemic communities" of
expert groups.

Throwing the Baby Out with the Bathwater? **[Chan warns that the
discourse on Thucydides's Trap and power transition can create a
self-fulfilling prophecy. If leaders believe in Thucydides's Trap and
act accordingly, it may create the anticipated conditions that make war
more likely.]{.underline}** **[Talking and thinking in terms of
Thucydides's Trap will influence the state's construction of its
identity as well as its definition of interests and
preferences]{.underline}**. The discourse is harmful because it
encourages 'othering' the opponent and contributes to confrontation.
Should we, then, throw out the proposition that war is more likely when
the system is undergoing a power transition? It might be worthwhile to
go back to what Thucydides's Trap refers to: "the severe structural
stress caused when a rising power threatens to upend a ruling one. In
such conditions, not just extraordinary, unexpected events, but even
ordinary flashpoints of foreign affairs, can trigger large-scale
conflict."\[112\] **[[Instead of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy,
this]{.mark} statement [should induce caution from]{.mark} leaders in
[Beijing and Washington]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Understanding the
danger of war is the first step to avoid]{.mark} being trapped in
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Like Chan, **[Allison seeks to
offer]{.underline}** "a set of **[principles]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** strategic **[options]{.underline}** **[for those
seeking to escape Thucydides's Trap]{.underline}** and avoid World War
III."\[113\] Obviously, **[historical analogies cannot completely
capture an ongoing]{.underline}** event. Allison himself cautions
against "facile analogizing" and emphasizes that "the differences matter
at least as much as the similarities."\[114\] **[The purpose of
analogizing Thucydides's Trap is not to shoehorn China and the United
States into the roles of Athens and Sparta]{.underline}** respectively,
as Chan suggests (17-18), **[but to underscore the enduring feature of
international politics throughout the ages]{.underline}**. **[The
dynamics of conflict highlighted by Thucydides remain]{.underline}** as
**[relevant]{.underline}** today as it was two thousand years ago.
**[Many scholars accuse structural theory of determinism]{.underline}**,
as Chan does, (14, 34), **[even though structuralists do not adopt it.
States can go to war for a variety of reasons]{.underline}**.
**[[Attempting to isolate a single cause for all wars is impossible.

out]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Properly understood, **[[Thucydides's Trap
cautions us to be prepared for the danger of war]{.mark} during a power
transition.]{.underline}** Overall, Chan's book provides a stronger
critique of power transition theory than of Thucydides's Trap. Students
of power shifts should take his argument seriously and avoid the
pitfalls he identifies. We should not, however, hastily dismiss the
warnings of Thucydides's Trap.

**[Taking seriously]{.underline}** the prospect of **[Chinese aggression

straightforward reading of China's aspirations based on scouring

like Paul Wolfowitz, Tony Blair, or Michael Ignatieff, anxious to spread
democracy, halt genocide and other humanitarian crises, and "end tyranny
in our world,"21 deterrence was too hesitant about such interventions.
And **[[for pacifist leftists]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and even a few
old hawks---**[[deterrence was]{.mark} a system of [terror]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**, one that could be discarded at the end of
history. They, therefore, called for abolishing nuclear weapons, the end
of using threats for security, and internationalizing security
responsibility. **[Deterrence was left with few friends]{.underline}**.¶
**[Its erstwhile friends should now consider returning]{.underline}**.
**[[Contrary to the]{.mark} arguments of the pacifist-inclined
[left]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a strategy of **[disarmament and
[conciliation is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[morally
irresponsible]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the face of Al Qaeda and its
like. Despite what the neo-conservatives and the liberal
interventionists had hoped, the high moral rhetoric of liberating Iraq
has yielded to a grimmer sense of the moral duties of considering
consequences, necessity, and proportion. We have relearned the truth of
the critiques of revolutionary France and of Woodrow Wilson---that
**[[even the honest pursuit of high-minded]{.mark} liberal [aspirations
can]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[yield death and
chaos]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[History has its own ways and means and
we should moderate our hope for its coming with a reverential fear of
its wrath]{.underline}**.¶ In between these two extremes,
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a security policy that
**[offers a way forward for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[that [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[not only
more effective because more tailored]{.underline}**, **[but
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[also [more moral]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It
is more moral because **[a deterrent posture would entail a strategy
that is more proportionate, more necessary, more responsive,
and]{.underline}**, ultimately, **[more just]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[[deterrence comports with]{.mark} the]{.underline}** **[fundamental
human [intuition]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[that [it
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** generally **[[only moral to fight when
attacked]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this it complies with the classical
conception of just war, which mandates that wars only be conducted when
one\'s cause is just, waged by a legitimate authority, motivated by a
right intent, fought with a real prospect of success, conducted
proportionately, and undertaken only as a last resort. Deterrence
satisfies these criteria. **[[It is a defensive strategy]{.mark} that
responds to invasions or attacks, and is therefore just]{.underline}**;
**[it sets out]{.underline}** relatively **[clear guidelines for when it
mandates that the government fight, and]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is
governed by legitimate authority]{.underline}**. It is driven by a
desire to protect, deter, and avenge, and is therefore motivated by
right intent; its realistic red lines and threats are backed up by the
awesome power of the United States, and therefore likely to succeed; and
it responds when attacked and asks from the rest of the international
community only respect for its marked out positions rather than
revolutionary transformation, and is therefore proportional.22 Finally,
**[by its nature it is [undertaken as a last resort rather than
preventively]{.mark}]{.underline}**.23 It was the fundamental moral
attractiveness of this position that continually frustrated both Soviet
efforts to decouple Europe from the American nuclear umbrella during the
Cold War and occasional American efforts to roll back the Soviet
empire.¶ But **[[theorizing]{.mark} about war and peace]{.underline}**
**[[cannot remain at]{.mark} the level of
[abstraction]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[It must
bear]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[moral [responsibility
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[actual consequence]{.underline}**]{.mark}
and the power of contingency, as Max Weber pointed out.24 **[And
[deterrence]{.mark}, defense by calculation,]{.underline}** **[[uniquely
satisfies the moral requirement]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that
[leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whatever their benevolent intentions,
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** basically **[[responsible for]{.mark} the
[consequences]{.mark} that contingency produces from their
actions]{.underline}**. **[This it does [by grounding]{.mark} a
nation\'s [security on its own credible
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**[---**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[on]{.underline}** either [**[changing the world through
force]{.underline}**, **[as]{.underline}**
**[neo-cons]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ervatives
[advocate]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[nor]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[by
[hoping]{.mark} that [a more peaceful world will emerge, as the left
proposes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Both of [**[these
extremes]{.underline}** **[ground security on radical
changes]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the way the world
operates]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**, therefore, necessarily
**[enmesh us in the rest of the world\'s affairs]{.underline}**, thereby
**[[exponentially expanding our vulnerability]{.mark} to all the
permutations that chance and contingency may produce]{.underline}**.
**[Deterrence]{.underline}**, rather, **[narrows our profile, and
thereby reduces our exposure to risk]{.underline}**.¶ **[[A deterrent
posture follows]{.underline}]{.mark}** John Quincy Adams' adage
[**[that]{.underline}** **[America should not]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[go [seek]{.mark}ing [monsters to destroy]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
the ancient dictum that a moral act is a proportional one.25 Perhaps the
greatest sin of the recent strategy is its disproportion, its confusion
of the necessary with the desirable. It may be desirable to "end
tyranny" and distribute the blessings of liberty worldwide, but its
desirability must be carefully balanced against the costs of its
enactment. If Iraq teaches us anything, it must be that a moral policy
is not only one guided by the best of intentions, but one that is
realistic.

### L: A2 "Miscalc"

#### Miscalc is a [useful frame]{.underline}\-\--it recognizes the [complexity]{.underline} of the international arena, which [solves the link]{.underline}

**[Nordmann]{.underline}**, Professor of Philosophy and History of
Science and Technoscience at Darmstadt Technical University,
**['18]{.underline}**

(Alfred, "Four Horsemen and a Rotten Apple. On the Technological
Rationality of Nuclear Security," in *Jahrbuch Technikphilosophie:
Arbeit und Spiel*, pg. 279 -- 294)

The apple is rotting. [[During]{.underline}]{.mark} the times of [[the
Cold War]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}]{.mark} [precarious
[equilibrium]{.mark}]{.underline} [of strategic threats had its own
working order]{.underline}. **[It [could be
trusted]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, in fact, **[had to be
trusted]{.underline}** in many ways. [The [weapons were]{.mark}
carefully **[monitored]{.mark}**]{.underline}, subject to permanent
surveillance from many points of view. [They were closely
watched]{.underline} through the eyes of one\'s own strategists,
technicians and engineers, military personnel, local opposition forces,
but also through the eyes of friends and foes, international agencies
and monitoring groups. [Everyone was attending to the
weapons]{.underline} [for different]{.underline}, [perhaps conflicting
reasons]{.underline}, and yet the many observations were maintained in a
relation of mutual support. The weapons themselves became fixated and
paralyzed at their center of attention.

[When the so-called **»four horsemen«**]{.underline} (Henry Kissinger,
George Shultz, William Perry, Sam Nunn) and political leaders like
Barack Obama have [called for a world without nuclear arms]{.underline},
[it is because they are worried about the **break-down of**]{.underline}
this **[working order]{.underline}**.24 [In their view, the
[current]{.mark} modes of [monitoring]{.mark},]{.underline}
proliferation, negotiation, [and sanctioning [represent a deviation
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the Cold War rationality [of deterrence with
its system of **[mutual checks and balances]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [[they call for]{.mark} **adequate ways of [controlling
material flows]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [of regulating
access]{.underline}, of instituting transparency and accountability.
**[[Their question is]{.mark} a [technical]{.mark}
question]{.underline}**: [[Given]{.mark} the half-life of
plutonium]{.underline} [and given the [volatility of]{.mark} systems of
[government]{.mark}]{.underline} in many parts of the world, [[how does
one institute]{.mark} a robust international system of
[arms-control]{.mark}?]{.underline} Thus, [they worry only
secondarily]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} the [weapons might get
into the wrong hands]{.underline}, politically speaking and in the short
term. [They pose **primarily** a question]{.underline} [from within a
technologically advanced]{.underline}, economically and politically
[robust knowledge society]{.underline} --- aside from the United States,
[who can be counted upon to reliably provide the necessary know-how in
the long term?]{.underline} Who can take responsibility for the
management of what was once and is no longer a denumerable, firmly
circumscribed set of nuclear things?

This point can be further developed by briefly considering three other
aspects of the current state of debate: First, as Christopher Daase has
pointed out, the extension into the future of the nuclear privilege of
weapon states in the NPT becomes questionable when this privilege no
longer serves to maintain a taboo in times of strategic conflict but
when it somewhat arrogantly declares whose hands are the good hands such
that they can be entrusted to carry out a managerial process. Inclusion
and exclusion can be justified more easily on the criterion of the
possession of nuclear weapons, it becomes contestable if the criterion
is the cultural competence of handling with due diligence and care a
dangerous and globally endangering commodity.25 Second, this may prove
to be the reason why some of the non-nuclear states like Norway,
Austria, Mexico are seizing the moment to claim that, if anyone, they
are best suited to frame the question or redefine the terms of the
debate. They wish to bring the humanitarian consequences to the fore and
thus the mishandling of the bomb, irrespective of a balance of power or
terror.26 Finally, [[when the question is]{.mark} one of
[maintaining]{.mark} or recreating [a safe working order **for a
dangerous tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline} [and when the arms race
is taking place between knowledge societies and their claims that the
technology is with them in good hands]{.underline}, [[the general
tech]{.mark}nical [capabilities]{.mark} of these societies [become
**increasingly important**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The responsibility of
diplomats and negotiators in the political and military sphere to create
conditions for global security is shifting to the maintenance, broadly
speaking, of a safety culture in civil society.

If this diagnosis is correct, the rules of the game have changed as has
the rationale for inclusion and exclusion in the club of nuclear-weapon
states, and the definition of the community of responsible actors.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} global [[challenge]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} defined [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} as
**[[preserving peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** or security in an age of
ideological conflict and competing national interests.
[I[nstead]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the challenge is one of **[tending to a
working order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} nuclear
[safety]{.mark}]{.underline} and safeguards[. [Issues of
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} and disarmament,
[transparency]{.underline} [[and **control**]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[appear]{.mark} in the collective consciousness]{.underline} [as
[analogous to]{.mark} the global threat of [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Both put]{.underline}]{.mark} [national
and stakeholder [interests **into a managerial
mode**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The Earth and the Bomb need to be
**handled with care**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[grounded in the]{.mark}
perhaps illusory [hope that]{.mark} in good hands]{.underline},
[with]{.mark} a technical mindset, [and [attunement **to**]{.mark} **the
[complexity]{.mark} of affairs**]{.underline}, [[the challenge can be
**met**]{.mark} and the danger **contained**.]{.underline}

Hazardous Waste

At this point [it may appear as if I wanted to recommend or **valorize
an engineering approach**]{.underline} [that **abstains from moral and
political judgement**]{.underline} but brings to the table the requisite
understanding for maintaining, modulating, recreating a working order or
technological system. **[This is not the case.]{.underline}** [I am
arguing merely that [one need to **take seriously**]{.mark} the
**different [modes of conceiving]{.mark} the [problems]{.mark}** that
are **in need of solution**]{.underline} --- [not only because the
definition of [a problem **entails a**]{.mark} **conception of its
[solution]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[reasoning processes]{.mark}
adequate to it**]{.underline}. **[If only for heuristic
purposes]{.underline}** [[we should attend to]{.mark} the implications
of [a shift]{.mark} from the logic of warfare and deterrence [to a
**logic of attunement and trust**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [attunement
to a working order and trust in the good hands of technical
expertise]{.underline}. In conclusion, here are some of these
implications, briefly stated.

First of all, [the [acquisition of]{.mark} working
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and the ability to]{.mark}
**maintain**]{.underline} [and [**modulate** a working
order]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[does nothing to justify technocratic
approaches o]{.mark}r to [en-throne]{.mark} the expertise of [managers
and engineers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As the case of the klu(d)ge served
to remind us, [deviations from strategic rationality]{.underline}
[coincide with deviations from top-down engineering or rational
design]{.underline}. [The situations in which working
knowledge]{.underline} [comes to the fore are **highly
ambivalent**,]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} [it is the challenge of
maintaining a rotten apple]{.underline} [or]{.underline} of
[managing]{.underline} material flows in [an ageing nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. [In these situations]{.underline}, [[rational
decision making is]{.mark} of the kind [where a]{.mark}]{.underline}
security [**[update]{.underline}** [is scheduled to the
o]{.underline}]{.mark}[perating [s]{.mark}ystem]{.underline} of a
computer [[and users wonder]{.mark} a bit nervously whether it is
**really such a good idea** to install the update.]{.underline} Not only
the [[r]{.mark}eaders]{.underline} of Charles Per-row\'s Normal
Accidents [will wonder [whether the]{.mark} security [update]{.mark}s
[might **increase**]{.mark} the **complexity**]{.underline}, perhaps
**[[instability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps
**[insecurity]{.underline}** [of the operating system]{.underline}.27
And of course, with the end of the Cold War, the operating system of
nuclear security has been changed, prompting us to ask anew what are the
conditions for stability and security.

### L: A2 "NATO"

#### Cooperation with NATO is necessary [now]{.underline} to prevent [existential risks]{.underline}\-\--threats are [real]{.underline}, but cooperation can help [mitigate risk]{.underline}

**[Kagan 22]{.underline}**, Robert\-\--Stephen & Barbara Friedman Senior
Fellow with the Project on International Order and Strategy in the
Foreign Policy program at Brookings Institute ("The Price of Hegemony:
Can America Learn to Use Its Power?" Foreign Affairs, vol 101, no 3,
2022,
https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/fora101&div=54&id=&page=)

Thankfully, that was not to be. But now that Putin has made his
mistakes, **[[the question is whether the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[will continue to make its own mistakes or]{.mark} whether Americans
will [learn]{.mark}, once again, [that it is better to contain
aggressive autocracies early]{.mark}]{.underline}**, before they have
built up a head of steam and the price of stopping them rises. The
challenge posed by Russia is neither unusual nor irrational. The rise
and fall of nations is the warp and woof of international relations.
National trajectories are changed by wars and the resulting
establishment of new power structures, by shifts in the global economy
that enrich some and impoverish others, and by beliefs and ideologies
that lead people to prefer one power over another. If there is any blame
to be cast on the United States for what is happening in Ukraine, it is
not that Washington deliberately extended its influence in eastern
Europe. It is that Washington failed to see that its influence had
already increased and to anticipate that actors dissatisfied with the
liberal order would look to overturn it.

F**[or the 70-plus years since World War II, the United States has
actively worked to keep revisionists at bay]{.underline}**. But many
Americans hoped that with the end of the Cold War, this task would be
finished and that their country could become a \"normal\" nation with
normal \-- which was to say, limited \-- global interests. But **[[the
global heg- emon cannot tiptoe off the stage]{.mark}, as much as it
might wish to. [It especially cannot retreat when there are still major
powers that]{.mark}, because of their history and sense of self, [cannot
give up old geopolitical ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}** \-- unless
Americans are prepared to live in a world shaped and defined by those
ambitions, as it was in the 1930s.

**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would be better]{.mark} served
[if it recognized]{.mark} both [its position]{.mark} in the world [and
its true interest in preserving the liberal world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the case of Russia, this would have
meant doing everything possible to integrate it into the liberal order
politically and economically while deterring it from attempting to
re-create its regional dominance by military means. **[The [commitment
to]{.mark} defend [nato]{.mark} allies [was never meant to preclude
helping others under attack]{.mark} in Europe, as the United States and
its allies did in the case of the Balkans]{.underline}** in the 1990s,
and the United States and its allies could have resisted military
efforts to control or seize land from Georgia and Ukraine. Imagine if
the United States and the democratic world had responded in 2008 or 2014
as they have responded to Russia\'s latest use of force, when Putin\'s
military was even weaker than it has proved to be now, even as they kept
extending an outstretched hand in case Moscow wanted to grasp it.
**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [ought to be]{.mark} following
the same policy toward China: make [clear]{.mark} that it is prepared to
live with a China that seeks to fulfill its ambitions economically,
politically, and culturally but [that it will respond]{.mark}
effectively [to any Chinese military action against its
neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[It is true that acting firmly in 2008 or 2014 would have meant
risking conflict. But [Washington is risking conflict
now]{.mark}]{.underline}**; Russia\'s ambitions have created an
inherently dangerous situation. It is better for the United States to
risk confrontation with belligerent powers when they are in the early
stages of ambition and expansion, not after they have already
consolidated substantial gains. Russia may possess a fearful nuclear
arsenal, but the risk of Moscow using it is not higher now than it would
have been in 2008 or 2014, if the West had intervened then. And it has
always been extraordinarily small: Putin was never going to obtain his
objectives by destroying himself and his country, along with much of the
rest of the world. If the United States and its allies \-- with their
combined economic, political, and military power \-- had collectively
resisted Russian expansionism from the beginning, Putin would have found
himself constantly unable to invade neighboring countries.

Unfortunately, **[it is very difficult for democracies to take action to
prevent a future crisis]{.underline}**. The risks of acting now are
always clear and often exaggerated, whereas distant threats are just
that: distant and so hard to calculate. **[[It always seems better to
hope for the best rather]{.mark} than try to [forestall the worst.
This]{.mark} common conundrum [becomes]{.mark} even more [debilitating
when Americans]{.mark} and their leaders [remain]{.mark} blissfully
[unconscious of the fact that they are part of a never-ending power
struggle]{.mark}, whether they wish to be or not]{.underline}**.

But **[[Americans should not lament the role]{.mark} they play in the
world. [The reason the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has often [found
itself entangled in Europe]{.mark}, after all, [is because what it
offers is genuinely attractive]{.mark} to much of the world \-- [and
certainly better]{.mark} when [compared with any]{.mark} realistic
[alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If Americans learn anything from
Russia\'s brutalization of Ukraine, it should be that there really are
worse things than U.S. hegemony.®

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? **[Taken literally, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}**. **[This suggests a rather low
threshold]{.underline}** for what counts as a global catastrophe. An
event causing just one death on each continent (say, from a jet-setting
assassin) could rate as a global catastrophe, because surely these
deaths would be catastrophic for the deceased and their loved ones.
**[However, in common usage, a global catastrophe would be catastrophic
for a significant portion of the globe]{.underline}**. Minimum
thresholds have variously been set around ten thousand to ten million
deaths or \$10 billion to \$10 trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković
2008), or death of one quarter of the human population (Atkinson 1999;
Hempsell 2004). **[Others have emphasized catastrophes that cause
long-term declines in the trajectory of human
civilization]{.underline}** (Beckstead 2013), **[that human civilization
does not recover from]{.underline}** (Maher and Baum 2013), **[that
drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline}** (**[Bostrom]{.underline}** 2002, **[using
the term "existential risk"), or that result in human
extinction]{.underline}** (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). **[A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that [some]{.mark}
[catastrophes]{.mark} [are vastly more important than
others]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to
recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983).
**[Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several
hundred million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but
humanity would presumably carry on. However, with nuclear
winter]{.underline}**, per Sagan, **[[humanity]{.mark} [could go
extinct]{.mark}. The loss would be not just an additional four billion
or so deaths, but the [loss of all future
generations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, **[the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
more]{.underline}**. **[Sagan estimated [500 trillion lives]{.mark},
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
[may]{.mark} even [be an underestimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
analysis here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the
human species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. **[An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an infinite length of time or instead
merely an astronomically large but finite length of time]{.underline}**
(see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, **[the stakes with
global catastrophes could be much larger than the loss of 500 trillion
lives. Debates about the infinite vs. the merely astronomical are of
theoretical interest]{.underline}** (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007),
**[but they have limited practical significance. This can be seen when
evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, [society should try 500 trillion times harder to
prevent]{.mark} a [global catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it should
[to save a person's life]{.mark}. Or, preventing one million deaths is
equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability of global
catastrophe. This suggests society should make extremely large
investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives.]{.underline}** Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
**[society should be willing to spend]{.underline}** at least that much
to prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to
spend at least **[\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the
probability of global catastrophe]{.underline}**. Thus **[while
reasonable disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much
to count future generations, even low-end positions suggest vast
resource allocations should be redirected to reducing GCR. This
conclusion is only strengthened when considering the astronomical size
of the stakes]{.underline}**, but the same point holds either way. The
bottom line is that, **[as long as something along the lines of the
standard riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used,
then even tiny GCR reductions merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause permanent
harm to global human civilization. The discussion thus far has assumed
that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is not
universally held]{.underline}**. **[People often value some people more
than others]{.underline}**, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. **[Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline}** who are distant in space, time, or social
relation, as well as the unborn members of future generations. **[This
debate is crucial]{.underline}** for all valuations of risk, including
GCR. Indeed, if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then
global catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably
have better things to do with our time than worry about them. **[[While
everyone has the right to their own views]{.mark} and
feelings]{.underline}**, we find that **[[the strongest arguments are
for the widely held position that all human lives should be valued
equally]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This position is succinctly stated in
the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848
Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident:
that all men and 3 women are created equal". **[Philosophers speak of an
agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere"]{.underline}** (Nagel 1986)
**[or a "veil of ignorance"]{.underline}** (Rawls 1971) **[in which each
person considers what is best for society irrespective of which member
of society they happen to be]{.underline}**. **[Such a perspective
suggests [valuing everyone equally]{.mark}, regardless of who they are
or where or when they live. This in turn [suggests a very high value for
reducing GCR]{.mark}, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}**

embraced poststructural critique but want to ground it in more positive
political foundations, while retaining a reluctance to return to the
positivist tendencies that implicitly underpin much of constructivist
research. The path that Daniel Levine has carved out is innovative,
sophisticated, and convincing. A superb scholarly achievement.

For Levine, **[the key challenge in]{.underline}** international
relations (**[IR]{.underline}**) scholarship **[is]{.underline}** what
he calls **["unchecked reification"]{.underline}**: **[the widespread
and dangerous process of forgetting "the distinction between theoretical
concepts and the real-world things they mean to describe]{.underline}**
or to which they refer" (p. 15). **[The [dangers are
real]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Levine stresses, **[[because IR deals with
some of the most difficult issues]{.mark}, from genocides to
war]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[Upholding one subjective position
without]{.mark} critical [scrutiny can]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus
**[[have far-reaching consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Following
Theodor Adorno---who is the key theoretical influence on this
book---Levine takes a post-positive position and assumes that the world
cannot be known outside of our human perceptions and the values that are
inevitably intertwined with them. His ultimate goal is to overcome
reification, or, to be more precise, to recognize it as an inevitable
aspect of thought so that its dangerous consequences can be mitigated.

**[Levine]{.underline}** proceeds in three stages: First he reviews
several decades of IR theories to resurrect critical moments when
scholars displayed an acute awareness of the dangers of reification. He
refreshingly breaks down distinctions between conventional and
progressive scholarship, for he **[detects self-reflective and critical
moments in]{.underline}** scholars that are usually associated with
**[straightforward positivist positions]{.underline}** (such as E.H.
Carr, Hans Morgenthau, or Graham Allison). But Levine also shows how
these moments of self-reflexivity never lasted long and were driven out
by the compulsion to offer systematic and scientific knowledge.

The second stage of Levine\'s inquiry **[outlines why]{.underline}** IR
scholars regularly closed down critique. Here, he points to a range of
factors and phenomena, from peer review processes to the speed at which
academics are meant to publish. And here too, he eschews conventional
wisdom, showing that work conducted in the wake of the third debate,
**[while explicitly post-positivist]{.underline}** and critiquing the
reifying tendencies of existing **[IR]{.underline}** **[scholarship,
often lacked critical self-awareness]{.underline}**. As a result, Levine
believes that many of the **[respective authors failed to appreciate
sufficiently that]{.underline}** "**[[reification is a consequence of
all thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**---including itself" (p. 68).

The third objective of Levine\'s book is also the most interesting one.
Here, he outlines the path toward what he calls "**[sustainable
critique]{.underline}**": a form of self-reflection that can counter the
dangers of reification. Critique, for him, is **[not just something that
is directed outwards, against particular theories or
theorists]{.underline}**. **[It is also inward-oriented, ongoing, and
sensitive to the "limitations of thought itself"]{.underline}** (p. 12).

The challenges that such a sustainable critique faces are formidable.
Two stand out: First, if the natural tendency to forget the origins and
values of our concepts are as strong as Levine and other Adorno-inspired
theorists believe they are, then how can we actually recognize our own
reifying tendencies? Are we not all inevitably and subconsciously caught
in a web of meanings from which we cannot escape? Second, if one
constantly questions one\'s own perspective, does one not fall into a
relativism that loses the ability to establish the kind of stable
foundations that are necessary for political action? Adorno has, of
course, been critiqued as relentlessly negative, even by his
second-generation Frankfurt School successors (from Jürgen Habermas to
his IR interpreters, such as Andrew Linklater and Ken Booth).

The response that Levine has to these two sets of legitimate criticisms
are, in my view, both convincing and useful at a practical level. **[He
starts off with depicting reification not as a flaw that is meant to be
expunged, but as an a priori condition for scholarship]{.underline}**.
The challenge then is not to let it go unchecked.

**[[Methodological pluralism lies at the heart of]{.mark} Levine\'s
[sustainable critique]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He borrows from what
Adorno calls a "constellation": an attempt to juxtapose, rather than
integrate, different perspectives. It is in this spirit that Levine
advocates **[[multiple methods to understand the same event or
phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[He writes of the need to validate
"multiple and mutually incompatible ways of seeing"]{.underline}** (p.
63, see also pp. 101--102). In this model, **[[a scholar
oscillates]{.mark} back and forth [between different methods and
paradigms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[trying to understand]{.mark} the
event in question from [multiple perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[No single method can]{.mark} ever [adequately represent the
event]{.mark} or should gain the upper hand]{.underline}**. **[But [each
should]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in a way, **[[recognize and capture
details]{.mark} or perspectives that the [others
cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p. 102). **[In practical terms, [this
means combining]{.mark} a range of [methods]{.mark} even
when]{.underline}**---**[or, rather, [precisely
when]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[they are deemed
incompatible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[They can range from
poststructual deconstruction to the tools pioneered and championed
by]{.underline}** **[positivist social sciences]{.underline}**.

**[[The benefit of]{.mark} such]{.underline}** a **[[methodological
polyphony]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[is not just the opportunity to
bring out nuances and new perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Once
the false hope of a smooth synthesis has been abandoned, the very
incompatibility of the respective perspectives can then be used to
identify the reifying tendencies in each of them]{.underline}**. For
Levine, this is how **[[reification may be "checked at the
source"]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and]{.underline}** this is how **[a
"critically reflexive moment might thus be rendered
sustainable"]{.underline}** (p. 103). It is in this sense that
**[Levine\'s approach is not really post-foundational
but]{.underline}**, rather, **[an attempt to "balance foundationalisms
against one another"]{.underline}** (p. 14). There are strong parallels
here with arguments advanced by assemblage thinking and complexity
theory---links that could have been explored in more detail.

# Alt

### Alt: Alt Fails---2AC (Realism)

#### The alt can't overcome realist preferences -- if it does, that's [worse]{.underline}.

**[Colatrella, 20]{.underline}**---associate adjunct professor of
government and sociology at the University of Maryland University
College (Steven, "Solidarity or Human Rights? National Sovereignty and
Citizenship in the Twenty-First Century," *Bringing the Nation Back In:
Cosmopolitanism, Nationalism, and the Struggle to Define a New
Politics*, Chapter 2, pg 34-38, dml)

**[When one is seen by others to be only a human being,
without]{.underline}** any of the **[social, political or cultural
characteristics]{.underline}** that make one fully human, **[the result
may be compassion and charity but it may also be just as
likely]{.underline}** be seen as **[an invitation to further
abuse]{.underline}**. "**[Bare life]{.underline}**," as Arendt and
Agamben term it, **[cannot be the basis for human
dignity]{.underline}**.

For **[human [rights still require states]{.mark} to enforce them, just
not the same state that is repressing or violating them]{.underline}**.
But **[the [enforcement]{.mark} of rights [by]{.mark}]{.underline}**
external states or by **["[the international community" means
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Immanuel Kant warned that **[peace could not
come from forcing a single state that refused to accept even a positive
value or policy of [the world]{.mark} community to get in line, since
that is not peace but war]{.underline}** (Kant). Machiavelli warned that
**[republics [need a plurality]{.mark} of republics, able [to
criticize]{.mark} each other, [encourage]{.mark} each other to [best
practices, engage in competition. When all]{.mark} republics [fall under
a single]{.mark} central [power]{.mark}---even a collective one---[we
find an empire]{.mark}, not a republic. A condition in which the world
community was unanimous and forced a recalcitrant state into accepting
policies it and its citizens had not approved would be analogous to
empire]{.underline}**, to **[[that]{.mark} world polity]{.underline}**
that Arendt likewise warned **[[would not result in]{.mark} a
[stronger]{.mark} enforcement of [rights, but in the greatest threat to
them]{.mark}, and one [without external recourse]{.mark} for
redress]{.underline}** (Arendt 298).

Nor are these abstract problems. Mark Mazower has painstakingly shown
that the entire conception of international law has always been based on
the "standard of civilization" in which certain states were within such
a standard, and so legitimized to enforce their conception of
international law, while other peoples and states and communities were
outside of it, and so vulnerable to having the will of others imposed
upon them (Mazower 70). In short, **[colonialism, neocolonialism,
and]{.underline}** the current regime of **[human rights are closely
linked, and it is no accident that [the]{.mark} countries that find
themselves [targets of]{.mark} humanitarian [interventions under the
"responsibility to protect" are]{.mark} ones that are [not
within]{.mark} the current updated version of [the standard of
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**---that is to say, not allies of the
United States and often opposed to neoliberalism. Thus, even **[in
[shifting]{.mark} from the]{.underline}** older
**[[national]{.underline}]{.mark}** government's
**[responsibility]{.underline}** to its own citizens
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** a conception that **[the
[international]{.mark}]{.underline}** community has a
**[[responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** to protect human rights, we
find that **[we have [merely changed which fox is guarding the
chickens]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Human Rights and Global Citizenship

As a legalistic concept, human rights require a political authority to
define what they are legally. One of the most widely cited works on
human rights, Jack Donnelly's Universal Human Rights in Theory and
Practice fails from the start on this point with its key analogy: human
rights, like property rights, are a preexisting condition. This notion
has already been dismantled by Arendt as shown above. By contrast,
international relations theorists recognize that **[human rights must be
granted and recognized by global institutions, but the lack of a central
international authority makes this very difficult]{.underline}**. **[The
realist school]{.underline}** of international relations (Morgenthau;
Waltz) **[sees anarchy reigning in a state of nature in world politics,
making the protection of human rights well nigh
impossible]{.underline}**. The so-called English School of International
Relations sees an international society as precarious, in which
**[norms, though real, are enforced by national states that see
adherence to such norms as]{.underline}** advantageous for maintaining
the international society and **[in the interest of the individual
states in question]{.underline}** (Bull). These theories are united in
that they see international organizations as instruments for carrying
out what has already been agreed to by national states. Neither position
posits a global polity as existing, and many theorists in each camp
would see such a polity as undesirable.

Others are less pessimistic. **[[Constructivists]{.mark} view human
rights as a discourse that has achieved]{.underline}** a certain degree
of **[autonomy from institutional settings]{.underline}**, though the
geopolitical limits on the discourse remain (Risse; Ropp and Sikkinke
16). Some political theorists seek to found human rights solely on the
narrow basis of historical liberal theory, with all the baggage that
this involves---from class privilege and economic doctrine to the
policies of existing international organizations such as the IMF and
WTO, and with the historical affiliation with Anglo-American hegemonies
intact (Charvet and Nay). Samuel Moyn's demonstration of the Christian
roots of human rights merely shifts the instrument of human rights
formation from political constitutionalism to Christian ethos. In both
cases, however, **[the Western origin of the rights concept belies its
alleged universality]{.underline}**. Donnelly's influential work engages
in intellectual gymnastics to find a plausible basis for universal human
rights. But **[even this work [admits that]{.mark} despite all, [people
must live in determined polities]{.mark} or they would find themselves
in a Hobbesian state of nature, [and]{.mark} that in the end [states
have]{.mark} human rights [responsibilities only to their own]{.mark}
citizens and territorial residents]{.underline}** (Donnelly 30--32).

**[Clearly, only global citizenship could address all of these
difficulties]{.underline}**, and there has been considerable work done
on developing that idea. Robert Paehlke seeks the basis for global
citizenship in the movements to limit corporate depravity and U.S.
militarism worldwide, hoping ironically that the opposition to the
current global governance regime will provide that same regime with a
stronger basis for legitimacy (Paehlk 15, 200--02). Andrew Moravcsik
instead argues that democratic republican governments have often
accepted the limitations on sovereignty imposed by international human
rights regimes when the gains in reducing domestic political
uncertainty---the risk of having a domestic opposition reverse preferred
policies---outweigh that compromise (Moravcsik 217--52). **[Efforts at
conceptualizing a "[global democracy" are]{.mark} perpetually
[challenged by the lack of any global]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or even
international, or even European **[[demos]{.mark} or
people]{.underline}** (Held 220). Aristotle's criteria continue to
matter in the twenty-first century. **[It seems difficult to avoid the
conclusion that [even under the most global]{.mark} of human rights
[regimes, rights remain]{.mark} inextricably [tied to]{.mark} domestic
politics and [national governments]{.mark}. If there is a role for civil
society and popular social [movements]{.mark}, their [impact must
be]{.mark} primarily [at the national level]{.mark}, and be
[differentiated]{.mark} in that impact [in different countries]{.mark}
and political communities. [To be effective beyond national boundaries,
they must act in concrete ways in solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** with
brother and sister movements and struggles or **[[with]{.mark} efforts
to bring about analogous gains to those already won or being fought for
in each [other's national]{.mark} political
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This means that **[the struggles,
acts of solidarity, and discourses of movements from the
pre-globalization era]{.underline}**, especially from the immediately
preceding era of anti-colonial and analogous movements, **[are
surprisingly relevant]{.underline}** to addressing our problems today.

### Alt: Alt Fails---Rejection Bad

#### Wholesale rejection is [bad]{.underline}\-\--it makes ethical politics [impossible]{.underline} and reproduces violence

**[Abraham, 17]{.underline}**---Johns Hopkins University (Kavi Joseph,
"Making Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial
Thought," International Political Sociology (2017) 11, 221--238, dml)

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that **[those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with a number of possible
[responses]{.mark}: one is to [deem realism]{.mark}, in all its complex
and contradictory manifestations, [as]{.mark} a failed, unethical, and
[fundamentally racist/]{.mark}imperial project]{.underline}**. A second
response is to politically align against liberalism, while holding this
partnership at arm's length. **[A third response]{.underline}**, derived
from Ayoob's (2002) subaltern realism, **[is to work on an epistemic
register, selectively taking insights from realist traditions that help
better explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}**. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this **[[failing does not
delegitimize]{.mark} other [realist insights]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
What is important for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to
combine plausible realist insights with other categories that can grasp
the extent of global politics, including the dynamics of the
postcolonial experience, better. The final response is the one I
advance. To adopt a mode of argumentation concerned with **[building a
counter-imperial machine is to neither dismiss constituencies that
become caught up in imperial formations, nor merely to tactically align
with them; rather, establishing resonant connections among postcolonial
and realist lines of thought, [highlighting shared dispositions]{.mark}
to difference, is to [push]{.mark} the latter [toward]{.mark}
repositioning itself on [new ethical lines that limit]{.mark}
contemporary forms of [violence]{.mark}. To recover a minor position in
realism is [not to accept all realist positions]{.mark}, nor is it to
synthesize or convert any theoretical line into a coherent framework. It
is]{.underline}**, however, **[to amplify the shared spirituality that
informs both realist and postcolonial thinking, drawing constituencies
toward prudential rather than imperial defenses of difference. It is to
furnish current research agendas with an anti-imperial focus, to seek
the creative possibilities that may arise when divergent constituencies
meet, interfuse, and shift]{.underline}**. Thus, our response to
Morgenthau, as to other realists, is to cultivate the connections that
do exist, not for epistemic reasons but for a political project that
strengthens counter-imperial movements. Thinking from the Present By way
of conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that motivates
a theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial thinking. If
the ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of liberalism
and its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a return to
classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and above
postcolonial approaches. However, **[the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a counter-imperial machine]{.underline}**, to
cultivate a shared spirituality **[that can gather diverse and divergent
constituencies to confront dangerous practices]{.underline}**. In my
estimation, **[[countering an imperial machine that operates in complex
ways]{.mark} and at complex sites [requires]{.mark} a political strategy
as unwieldy and diffuse, [linking constituencies that we may otherwise
dismiss.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[That]{.mark} a tradition of
[realism]{.mark} regularly [circulates through halls of power]{.mark}
across the globe [should be reason not to reject]{.mark} righteously
[but]{.mark} rather [to leverage its authorized status. We can talk
about imperialism]{.mark}, knowledge production, [and race here, while
they]{.mark} can talk [about anarchy]{.mark}, power, and self-interest
[there---or we]{.mark} can theoretically work on the lines of thought
that reverberate among us]{.underline}**. To reiterate, building a
countermachine is not driven to "pragmatic" reconciliation or consensus
and, thus, remains distinct from the "eclecticism" of other plural
approaches popular in IR today. While the combinatory logic of
paradigmatic synthesis has its place, the connections between realist
and postcolonial thought articulated here are made in a far more
agonistic manner. Rather than produce something like a
"postcolonial-realism," **[this]{.underline}** argument **[involves
[push]{.mark}ing contemporary [realist scholarship toward new research
agendas]{.mark} and new forms of critique]{.underline}** that both
capture a spirit internal to its own traditions while confronting the
realities of contemporary global politics. It engages with minor
positions along the realist canon to orient today's realism away from
the logic of great power politics operating under anarchy toward an
understanding of how the logic of liberal order permits forms of
imperial intervention. Needless to say, **[drawing together realist and
postcolonial thought]{.underline}**, as this essay has done, **[can be
met with analytical skepticism and political hostility. A mode of
argumentation that refuses comparisons of theoretical cores or
non-truncated readings of select theorists strikes a note of analytical
evasion]{.underline}**. To this there is no defense---other than that
already discussed at length. On the other hand, if the expressly
political purpose of this work is accepted, **[the argument anticipates
strong political reservations: why align the project of postcolonial
theory with realism, an unethical tradition of militarism and
realpolitik?]{.underline}** To this I would respond that while a kind of
strategic essentialism has its place, **[[reducing "realists"]{.mark} to
a coherent body of thought not only obscures the complexity of their
thinking]{.underline}** (see never-ending interpretations of Machiavelli
as an example) **[but [reproduces the narrative]{.mark} of
transhistorical unity [that some]{.mark} realists [use to authorize
unethical]{.mark} policy [programs]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline}**. More critically, however, **[in embodying an
unproductive ahistoricism, it poses conventional realist categories of
anarchy, selfinterest, and military power as the political problem to
confront whereas the present historical context demands attunement to
how some of these drives]{.underline}** (militarism, national interest)
**[connect with discrete problems of liberalism and imperial
practices]{.underline}**. In fact, there are good reasons to think that
the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and Morton
2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR theory
is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of a US liberal
world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while realism may
have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must theorize
from the present. In doing so, we may find that **[[countering imperial
formations may benefit from resonances]{.mark}
established]{.underline}** not just **[[among]{.underline}]{.mark}**
postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and other "critical" theorists
but **[contemporary [realists]{.mark} who identify links between
liberalism and imperialism]{.underline}** (Walt 2013). Indeed, **[[if
realism]{.mark} as a policy program defending the national interest [is
entangled with]{.mark} current militaristic and [imperial interventions,
we should push the premise]{.mark} of this statement, [that difference
should be defended, in anti-imperial]{.mark} and prudential
[directions]{.mark}. Doing so may allow new openings to emerge in the
present sense of closure, new strategies to think and defend alternative
politics]{.underline}**. In this way, we may more fully embody
postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow critique or
brash conversion but rather attentive translation.
