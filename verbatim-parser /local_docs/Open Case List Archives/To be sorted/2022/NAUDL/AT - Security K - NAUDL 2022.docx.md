**AFF Answers**

Remember to F-STOP!

When answering the K remember you want to "F-STOP" the K. Always make
the following arguments:

**Framework** -- defend why your affirmative matters and the methodology
behind your affirmative

**Solvency** -- You need to make an argument that the Alternative does
not solve the affirmative

**Theory** -- You should have a theoretical objection to the K. If there
is also a counterplan/DA strategy in the round that should be
conditionality. If the K is being framed as a Floating PIK you also need
to defend against that.

**Offense** -- Have offensive reasons that your affirmative is good.
These function as disadvantages to the alternative

**Permutation** -- You should always perm the K. The best perms take the
language of the alternative and also advocate the affirmative. If you
cannot figure out how to write that language the next best idea is to
say: "perm do the plan and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the
alternative."

**[Framework -- Engage with the Real]{.underline}**

**Engaging with the physical is necessary to avoid reproducing the
status quo.**

However, [pointing]{.underline} this [out and deriding]{.underline}
market based [solutions doesn't get us very far.]{.underline} In fact,
[such a response]{.underline} to proposed market-based solutions [is
downright dangerous and irresponsible. The fact of the matter is
that]{.underline} 1) we currently live in a market based world, 2) there
is not, in the foreseeable future an alternative system on the horizon,
and 3), [above all, [we need to do something now]{.mark}. [We can't
afford to reject interventions simply because they don't meet our
ideal]{.mark} conceptions [of how things should be]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[We have to work with the world that is here, not the one that we would
like to be here.]{.underline}]{.mark} And here [[it's crucial to note
that]{.mark} pointing [this]{.mark} out [does not entail that we
shouldn't work for producing that other world]{.mark}. [It just means
that we have to grapple with the world that is actually]{.mark} there
[before us.]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶]{.mark} It pains me to write this
post because I remember, with great bitterness, the diatribes hardcore
Obama supporters leveled against legitimate leftist criticisms on the
grounds that these critics were completely unrealistic idealists who, in
their demand for "purity", were asking for "ponies and unicorns". This
rejoinder always seemed to ignore that words have power and that Obama,
through his profound power of rhetoric, had, at least the power to shift
public debates and frames, opening a path to making new forms of policy
and new priorities possible. The tragedy was that he didn't use that
power, though he has gotten better.

**[Solvency]{.underline}**

**Extend your affirmative plan here, tying an explanation into why the
judge should prefer your argument below. Consider the following
questions:**

- Why would your plan be better than the alternative method the negative
  proposes?

- Why is it important to solve for the affirmative?

- Does prioritizing conceptual violence over actual violence truly
  benefit anyone?

**[Offense]{.underline}**

**Strategic action is key -- the alternative only recreates the most
violent aspects of their impact claims. Only through urgent, real action
can we hope to solve any of their impacts.**

[[Although it seems attractive to focus]{.mark} on exclusionary concepts
that insist [on desecuritization]{.mark},]{.underline} privileged
referent objects, and the 'belief' that threats and vulnerabilities are
little more than social constructions (Grayson, 2003), all [[these
concepts work in theory but fail in practice]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
it may be true that national security paradigms can, and likely will,
continue to dominate issues that involve human security vulnerabilities
-- and even in some instances mistakenly confuse 'vulnerabilities' as
'threats' -- [there are distinct linkages between these security
concepts and applications.]{.underline} With regard to environmental
security, for example, Myers (1986: 251) recognized these linkages
nearly two decades ago: [[National security is not just about fighting
forces and weaponry]{.mark}. [It relates to]{.mark} watersheds,
croplands, [forests,]{.mark} genetic resources, [climate and other
factors that rarely figure in the minds of military experts]{.mark} and
political leaders, [but]{.mark} increasingly [deserve]{.mark}, in their
collectivity, [to rank alongside military approaches as crucial in a
nation's security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ultimately, we are far from what
O'Hanlon & Singer (2004) term a global intervention capability on behalf
of 'humanitarian transformation'. Granted, we now have the threat of
mass casualty terrorism anytime, anywhere -- and states and regions are
responding differently to this challenge. Yet, the global community
today also faces many of the same problems of the 1990s: civil wars,
faltering states, humanitarian crises. We are nowhere closer
toaddressing how best to solve these challenges, even as they affect
issues of environmental, human, national (and even 'embedded') security.
Recently, there have been a number of voices that have spoken out on
what the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty
has termed the 'responsibility to protect':10 the responsibility of some
agency or state (whether it be a superpower such as the United States or
an institution such as the United Nations) to enforce the principle of
security that sovereign states owe to their citizens. [Yet, [the
creation of a sense of urgency to act]{.mark} -- even on some issues
that may not have some impact for years or even decades to come -- [is
perhaps the only appropriate]{.mark} first [response]{.mark}. The real
cost of not investing in the right way and early enough in the places
where trends and effects are accelerating in the wrong direction is
likely to be decades and decades of economic and political frustration
-- and, potentially, military engagement.]{.underline}

**[Permutation]{.underline}**

1)  **The affirmative proposes that we perm: Doing both the aff plantext
    and negative alternative method.**

2)  **While our affirmative resolves material impacts, the negatives'
    method solves structural ones.**

3)  **Cross-apply Bryant 12 and prefer our framing of the round -- We
    have no choice but to engage with the material world.**
