## 2 AC -- NATO imperialism inevitable 

#### NATO Imperialism inevitable, U.S. controlled cyberspace is still comparatively better than Eastern iron fist. 

**Business Insider**, **2016**. (July 14). America's internet is
incredibly free compared to most countries. Business Insider.
https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-internet-is-incredibly-free-compared-to-most-countries-2016-7

One fact that surprised us --- [[given how much Americans talk about
censorship --- is how relatively little internet censorship there is in
the US.]{.underline}]{.mark} As in [[zero censorship
of]{.mark} ]{.underline}the important [[topics tracked by the free
expression watchdog]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Now not everyone has such a rosy assesment of US censorship.

Reporters Without Borders called the US [an Enemy of the
Internet ](http://12mars.rsf.org/2014-en/#slide2)in 2014, saying \"US
surveillance practices and decryption activities are a direct threat to
investigative journalists, especially those who work with sensitive
sources for whom confidentiality is paramount and who are already under
pressure.\"

[[Freedom House\'s 2015 report]{.underline}]{.mark}, released in October
last year[[, noted [some concerns about the
US](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2015/united-states),
like increasing pressure on private companies to install
backdoors]{.underline}]{.mark} and arrests for some people who filmed
police actions. 

[[Still, the US looks better than most of the world, ranking sixth out
of 65 countries, with [China coming in dead
last](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2015/china).]{.underline}]{.mark}

## 2 AC No link -- military race inevitable

#### The Cold War era came to an end in the late 1990s but Russian militaristic growth continues, race to the top persists regardless to action of the AFF.

Josh **Holder**, Scott **Reinhard**, and Michael **Schwirtz**, **2022**.
(Jan, 27.) 2022.)

A build-up of Russian forces near the border with Ukraine has raised
concerns among Western and Ukrainian officials that the Kremlin might be
preparing for significant military action, possibly an invasion. This
map, compiled by The New York Times, shows troops, tanks and heavy
artillery moving into positions that threaten to widen the conflict in
Ukraine's east and potentially open a new front on Ukraine's northern
border, closer to the capital, Kyiv. From there, they can also menace
the countries on NATO's eastern flank.

[[Russia currently has about 130,000 troops on the Ukraine
border]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Ukraine's military[[. U.S.
intelligence agencies have assessed that the Kremlin
has]{.underline}]{.mark} drawn up [[plans for a military operation
involving]{.underline}]{.mark} up to [[175,000
troops]{.underline}]{.mark} that could begin in the coming weeks. While
it is not clear whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has
decided to launch an attack --- and Moscow has said repeatedly in recent
weeks that it has no plans to do so --- analysts say the country is well
on its way toward constructing the architecture needed for a significant
military intervention in Ukraine.

Much of the buildup so far, according to officials and military
analysts, has involved troops and equipment that take time to deploy,
including tanks and heavy armor, some of which have traveled by train
from bases as far away as Siberia.

Before launching a significant military operation, Russia needs to
deploy reserve soldiers and logistical infrastructure, like field
hospitals, that until recently appeared to be missing from positions
near Ukraine, analysts say. But these elements along with additional
troops have been moving into some areas of Russian deployment, Ukrainian
and western officials say.

Much of the attention so far has been directed at the buildup of forces
near two breakaway provinces ineastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk,
where the Ukrainian military has been at war with Russian-backed
separatists since 2014. The separatist forces, which include Russian
troops and Ukrainian fighters opposed to Kyiv's rule, number about
30,000, according to an assessment by the Ukrainian military.

[[Since the start of 2021, Russia has moved an additional five battalion
tactical groups into the border area near Luhansk and Donetsk,
including]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[5,000 soldiers sent to reinforce
the 12,000]{.mark}]{.underline} or so [[stationed there
permanently]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Ukrainian authorities.

Just as significant, according to officials and military analysts, are
the forces massing north of Ukraine in areas such as Klintsy, at the
point where the Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian borders meet[[. Russia
has also begun ferrying troops, armor, fighter jets and advanced
antiaircraft systems into Belarus, a Russian ally and Ukraine's northern
neighbor]{.underline}]{.mark}, putting a growing force within range of
Kyiv. Russia's Defense Ministry says the buildup in Belarus is purely
for military exercises scheduled to begin Feb. 10. But, American
officials and NATO say these exercises could be a pretext for deploying
troops meant to threaten Ukraine and put NATO allies on edge.

## 2 AC Impact turn -- Tech Collaboration

#### NATO members are work collaboratively to invent new technology and methods to strengthen cybersecurity on a united front. 

**NATO**, **2022.** (Last updated March, 23.) NATO Cyber defense
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm

Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive
and coercive, and are becoming ever more frequent. [[NATO will continue
to adapt to the evolving cyber threat landscape. NATO and its Allies
rely on strong and resilient cyber defences to fulfil the Alliance's
core tasks of collective defence]{.underline}]{.mark}, crisis management
and cooperative security. The Alliance needs to be prepared to defend
its networks and operations against the growing sophistication of the
cyber threats it faces.

Cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective defence.

[[NATO Allies have affirmed that international law applies in
cyberspace.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[NATO\'s main focus in cyber defence is to protect its own networks,
operate in cyberspace (including through the Alliance's operations and
missions), help Allies to enhance their national resilience and provide
a platform for political consultation and collective
action.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In July 2016, Allies reaffirmed NATO's defensive mandate and recognised
cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as
effectively as it does in the air, on land and at sea.

Allies also made a Cyber Defence Pledge in July 2016 to enhance their
cyber defences, and have continued to bolster their national resilience
as a matter of priority.

NATO reinforces its cyber capabilities, including through education,
training and exercises.

[[Allies are committed to enhancing information-sharing and mutual
assistance in preventing, mitigating and recovering from cyber
attacks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are on standby 24 hours a day to assist
Allies, if requested and approved.

In February 2019, Allies endorsed a NATO guide that sets out a number of
tools to further strengthen NATO's ability to respond to significant
malicious cumulative cyber activities.

NATO is intensifying its cooperation with industry through the NATO
Industry Cyber Partnership.

At the 2021 NATO Summit in Brussels, Allies endorsed a new Comprehensive
Cyber Defence Policy, which supports NATO's core tasks and overall
deterrence and defence posture to enhance further the Alliance's
resilience.

[[Allies are promoting a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace, and
pursuing efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} by supporting international law and
voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. 

## 2 AC Impact turn -- U.S. cyber freedom

#### Americans are able to roam the cyberspace freely, the U.S. is determined to provide the same access to the rest of the world allowing suppressed groups to fight for their freedom. 

The **United States Agency for Global Media** Retrieved June 16, 2022,
from https://www.usagm.gov/office-internet-freedom/

[[Since 2002, USAGM has been involved in activities to circumvent
internet censorship by foreign governments]{.underline}]{.mark} in order
[[to distribute news content and better provide a forum for free
expression in closed societies.]{.underline}]{.mark} This portfolio has
since grown to be an increasingly critical component of the agency's
ability to fulfill its mission to "inform, engage, and connect people
around the world in support of freedom and democracy."   

USAGM has supported internet freedom projects through the Office of
Internet Freedom (formerly the Internet Anti-Censorship Division) and
the Open Technology Fund (OTF), USAGM's newest non-profit grantee.  The
USAGM's internet freedom program supports, per congressional
appropriations guidance, global internet freedom for the expansion of
unrestricted access to information on the internet.  [[Over the past
seven years, USAGM has invested more than \$100 million in projects to
promote internet freedom in the world's most restricted
environments.]{.underline}]{.mark}  Together, these programs have
supported the tools and systems necessary for USAGM networks to report
and disseminate content in information-restrictive markets, and for
USAGM audiences to receive and share content safely online.    

While previously OIF directly supported certain circumvention at-scale
projects, OTF now supports all the agency's internet freedom needs.
OIF's role is to maintain a strong partnership with OTF, to provide
oversight to ensure continued OTF compliance with relevant rules and
regulations in the execution of congressionally mandated use of internet
freedom funds for technology projects, ensure uninterrupted
circumvention services for USAGM entities and their training needs,
provide critical field-driven feedback loop, and manage the assessment
of particular OTF projects to inform USAGM strategy and oversight.   

## 2 AC No impact -- No nuclear war

#### Nuclear war unlikely, even Russia understandings this is the last resort. 

**Valenti**, **2022**. (Maggie, April 14). How Likely Is A Nuclear War
In Europe? Russian Officials Make Threats Amid Risk Of NATO Expansion.
International Business Times.
https://www.ibtimes.com/how-likely-nuclear-war-europe-russian-officials-make-threats-amid-risk-nato-expansion-3474683

Russian officials have taken a step towards [threatening nuclear
war](https://www.ibtimes.com/russia-warns-nuclear-deployment-if-sweden-finland-join-nato-3474026),
warning that if Sweden and Finland join NATO, Russia will place nuclear
weapons in the Baltic region.

[[Russian officials have previously stated that if Russia\'s existence
or territory is threatened, nuclear weapons are an
option.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Keeping nuclear weapons in the Baltic --- [specifically in
Russian-controlled Kaliningrad, which sits between Poland and
Lithuania](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaliningrad,+Kaliningrad+Oblast,+Russia/@54.6849238,20.4501385,13.83z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46e33d8d4b7c21a9:0x5050960016126ed3!8m2!3d54.7104264!4d20.4522144) --- as
Russian officials have recently threatened, would make it easier for
Russia to target Western countries.

[[However, threats like these are not uncommon from
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and nuclear weapons have previously been in
the region.

Sweden and Finland are near Baltic countries and have held onto
neutrality for a long time, but since have reconsidered their positions
after Russia invaded Ukraine. Finland also shares an 830-mile border
with Russia and currently around half of the world\'s nuclear weapons
are owned by Russia.

[[Despite the threats of nuclear war, events like the Cuban Missile
crisis, [North
Korea](https://www.ibtimes.com/north-koreas-tests-stir-nuclear-debate-south-3473751)n
aggression, and Russian threats, governments have not used nuclear
weapons during a war since World War II]{.underline}]{.mark}. IN 1945,
the U.S. dropped bombs on two Japanese cities, [[Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.underline}]{.mark}, in [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} first and
[[only time these weapons were used]{.mark}]{.underline} during a war.

Even with the recent heightening of Russian aggression, multiple people
have been quick to say that [[Russian President Vladimir Putin is
bluffing]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[that nuclear war is not in his best
interest.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[\"This threat of escalation . . . is cheap talk.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Putin is bluffing[[. He is]{.underline}]{.mark} deliberately [[allowing
the U.S. intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} community [[to discover data
about escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [[to scare us away from
helping Ukrainians win]{.underline}]{.mark},\" [Michael McFaul wrote in
an opinion column for the Washington
Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/13/west-help-ukraine-win-next-phase-russia/)

McFaul argues that the U.S. and Western allies are not doing more to
help Ukraine, including providing certain weapons out of fear of Russian
escalation. He believes they should be doing more to ensure Ukraine\'s
victory and should ignore Putin\'s threats.

[[\"Putin is angry and unhinged, but not
suicidal,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} he added.

NATO Secretary-General has [called Putin\'s threats of
escalation](https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-tells-putin-stop-nuclear-saber-rattling-amid-ukraine-war-2022-3) \"nuclear
saber-rattling.\"

[[\"Nuclear war can not be won and it could never be
fought,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} he said.

## 2 AC Answers to -- Economic impact

#### European countries are hesitant to increase military spending to support NATO's expansion agenda. 

**Dr. Roberts, 2020.** (Peter, professor at Emory University's
Goizueta Business SchoolNATO 2030: Difficult Times Ahead. (n.d.).
Rusi.Org.
<https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/nato-2030-difficult-times-ahead>

[[Across the Alliance, striking]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[balance is a
dilemma that can become divisive]{.underline}]{.mark}, as [[some members
step up to the fighting part of the requirement, whilst others focus on
the high-tech]{.underline}]{.mark} (but much safer) part.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} relative [[investments might be equal in
national treasure, but the difference in risk]{.underline}]{.mark} to
personnel [[will be significant.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Should the UK make unilateral decisions (for example on potentially
scrapping the Army's heavy-armoured capability), it will be tempting for
the government to argue that the additional capabilities of British
Carrier Strike capability, or large numbers of F35s, drones, or new
surveillance capabilities, along with a healthy research and development
financial allocation, outweigh the potential drawbacks from the removal
of tanks from its commitment to NATO's Order of Battle. The reality,
however, is that those new capabilities will not buy out that commitment
of a heavy armour formation in the land domain, specifically aimed at
countering Russian armoured strength. A NATO threat-based model of force
design and employment is realistic and desirable in the current
competition against Russia, but cannot be achieved unless member states
also adopt the same concept. A divergence in the philosophy of force
designs between member states and NATO will mean that the Alliance can
generate neither a capability-based force, nor one that matches the
threat, [leaving the organisation in a worse position than it is
already](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/12/05/commentary/world-commentary/trump-least-natos-problems/#.XuIFBS-ZOfU).

[[If Stoltenberg is serious about making these military changes, as well
as the political and economic ones, he will need to make a more
convincing argument to major contributors]{.underline}]{.mark} (the US,
France, the UK, and Germany) [[that their defence budgets and
procurement plans need to be NATO-centric]{.underline}]{.mark}, and not
merely where national defence plans conveniently coincide with NATO's.
[[The speed of development of these states is much faster than many
other Alliance member states can afford]{.underline}]{.mark}, or have
planned for. Yet more transformation might be needed, and there is the
risk of developing a three-speed NATO, with the staggering pace of US
military development, the slower pace of similar trends in the UK,
France and potentially Germany, and the more measured speed of other
Allies, which will be largely determined by broad national economic
trends and budget allocations.

## 2 AC Answers to - Cyber attack 

#### The U.S. is prepared for Russian cyber attacks. 

[**Blinken**, **2022**. (Antony J. Secretary of
State,](https://www.state.gov/biographies/antony-j-blinken/) May 10.)
Attribution of Russia's Malicious Cyber Activity Against Ukraine. United
States Department of State.
https://www.state.gov/attribution-of-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-against-ukraine/

The United States is joining with allies and partners to condemn
Russia's destructive cyber activities against Ukraine.  [[In the months
leading up to and after Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} illegal further
[[invasion]{.underline}]{.mark} began, [[Ukraine experienced a series of
disruptive cyber operations, including website defacements, distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and cyber attacks
to]{.underline}]{.mark} delete data from [[computers belonging to
government and private entities]{.mark}]{.underline} -- all part of the
Russian playbook.  For example, the United States has assessed
that Russian military cyber operators have deployed multiple families of
destructive wiper malware, including WhisperGate, on Ukrainian
Government and private sector networks.  These disruptive cyber
operations began in January 2022, prior to Russia's illegal further
invasion of Ukraine and have continued throughout the war.

Today, in support of the European Union and other partners, [[the United
States is sharing publicly its assessment that Russia launched cyber
attacks in late February against commercial satellite communications
networks to disrupt Ukrainian command]{.underline}]{.mark} and control
during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other
European countries.  The activity disabled very small aperture terminals
in Ukraine and across Europe.  This includes tens of thousands of
terminals outside of Ukraine that, among other things, support wind
turbines and provide Internet services to private citizens.

As nations committed to upholding the rules-based international order in
cyberspace, [[the United States and its allies and partners are taking
steps to defend against Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} irresponsible
[[actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The U.S. Government has developed new
mechanisms to help Ukraine identify cyber threats and
recover]{.underline}]{.mark} from cyber incidents. [[We have also
enhanced our support]{.underline}]{.mark} for Ukraine's digital
connectivity, including [[by providing satellite phones and data
terminals to Ukrainian government officials, essential service
providers, and critical infrastructure operators.]{.underline}]{.mark}
We praise Ukraine's efforts---both in and outside of government---to
defend against and recover from such activity, even as its country is
under physical attack.
