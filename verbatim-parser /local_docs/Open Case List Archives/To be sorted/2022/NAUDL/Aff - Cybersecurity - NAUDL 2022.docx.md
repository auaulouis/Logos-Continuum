## Cyber Security 

The goal of the affirmative is simple: Suggest a plan of action, show
how it will work, and why it is a good idea. If the affirmative's plan
is a good idea at the end of the round, then you will win. The more you
focus on the plan and why it is a bad idea, the more often you'll win
debates.

**Speaking Roles on the Affirmative:**

- **1^st^ Affirmative Speaker:** Your job is to introduce the
  affirmative case in the 1AC, and to keep the affirmative case (plan,
  solvency and at least one advantage) alive during the 1AR.

- **2^nd^ Affirmative Speaker:** Your job is answer negative attacks in
  the 2AC, adding any evidence the affirmative might need, then to make
  a closing statement explaining why the affirmative team should win in
  the 2AR. This should focus on why the plan is a good idea and how the
  advantages are more important than the disadvantages.

> **Goals of each speech:**

1.  **1AC:** Build your case: Inherency, The Plan, Solvency, and the
    Advantages.

2.  **2AC/1AR:** Respond to the negative's arguments and add new
    evidence if needed. You need to be winning at least Solvency and an
    Advantage after the 1AR to win the debate.

3.  **2AR:** The second affirmative speaker should give a closing
    argument all about why the plan is a good idea. Answer the second
    negative rebuttal (2NR) and tell the judge why the affirmative team
    should win.

Each Affirmative Case will have four main parts. You'll have to win each
piece in order to win a debate as the affirmative.

- **Inherency:** What is the problem, and why isn't it being fixed now?
  This usually identifies trends or specific barriers to the problem
  being fixed.

- **The Plan:** What is the affirmative going to do about it? This is a
  short description of action and should be written with care.

- **Solvency:** How will the plan work? Will it be too expensive? What
  paths are in place to allow this plan? Will it actually work?

- **Advantages:** What are the benefits of doing the plan, or the
  problems we can avoid by doing it? This is why we should care about
  the plan.

Your partner will have a chance to support your arguments and read more
evidence in the second affirmative constructive (2AC).

## TOpic Introduction

The cyber security affirmative offers that we increase cooperation with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in cyber security.
Currently the United States is a member of NATO, but has not made any
efforts to include them in U.S. cyber security efforts or tried to join
theirs. The United States is one of the strongest nations in the cyber
space but is not the most protected. With the growing cyber-attacks from
Russia, the U.S. needs to try to increase their security methods by
cooperation with NATO. NATO is working on a new program for cyber
protection and the U.S. should incorporate that in their own defenses.

The Biden Administration has made cyber security one of their top goals
for the United States, and the AFF argues that working with NATO would
fulfill that goal.

**\**

## Strategic Overview

The affirmative claims four advantages, although you are not required to
try and read all of these advantages in the AFF. You can pick and choose
which ones you like best or fit the debate better.

**COVID-19 Advantage:** The COVID-19 advantage argues that the impacts
seen from the pandemic, i.e. travel restrictions and most of our lives
being moved online, allows for hackers to more access and find more ways
attack individuals. Passing the AFF and improving our security in cyber
space will help mitigate those attacks.

**Russia Advantage:** Like what is explained in the majority of the AFF,
Russia is constantly attacking the United States. For the US to help
protect itself against any future Russian attacks that can cause more
damage than what has already been done, we need to increase our cyber
security.

**Civic-Engagement Advantage:** A lot of Americans do not trust the
election process because of the known Russian attacks during some
elections. POC communities are already disenfranchised from voting, even
before the Russian attacks, and the distrust in American election
process just makes those disparities worse.

**Social Media Misinformation Advantage:** Russia is planting fake news
and stories on social media. This is bad for the American people because
more than half of the population gets their news off social media, and
they are consuming false information. Improving American cyber security
would allow the government to better protect from news hacks.

When putting together your 2AC block, you'll want to follow the
structure you learned during flowing:

They say →\<Insert argument\>

That's not true because →\<Restate your argument or read a new card to
answer their argument\>

Prefer our argument because →\<Explain why your argument is better\>

Consider the following questions:

- Why is NATO the best option?

- Why can't the United States fortify their cyber space on their own?

- What are the implications of working with NATO?

- If the United States choose not to work with NATO what would happen?

- Are there some policies that should not be done because the
  consequences are so bad?

The negative team will respond to your arguments, using "on case"
responses. They'll also present some of their own. These "off case"
arguments are dangerous and you'll need to respond in order to win the
debate.

> In the Novice Packet, there are three "off case" positions:

- **Russia Disadvantage:** The answers to this DA are broken up into
  three parts. Non-unique, which just states that Russia will not
  increase aggression with or without the AFF. Then we have No-impacts,
  this tells us that a Russian would not be detrimental for the U.S. and
  would not cause damage. Then finally No-Link which explains that if a
  conflict were to arise with Russia it is not because of the AFF.

- **Imperialism Disadvantage:** To answer this DA, we use the same
  format as the one above. Non-unique for this argument is that NATO
  only gives help when asked and the US only supports itself. No-Impact
  tells us that our cyber security is supported by the government and
  there will be no war over cyber security concerns. This DA also
  presents an **Impact Turn,** this is a list of cards that turn the
  impact on to the NEG. It starts off with stating that the US has no
  cyber regulations which puts those who are against imperialism in the
  best position to fight digital imperialism online. Any other country
  filling the US gap if the AFF were not to pass would be worse for
  those efforts. Finally, we have No-link which is stating that the US
  only works with partners in cybersecurity, not to colonize.

- **China Disadvantage:** For the Non-unique these DA answers explain
  that NATO is already on the verge of collapse without the AFF. The
  No-impact says that even if NATO is stretched the AFF would stop a
  collapse and China is a threat in the way the NEG presents them to be.
  No-link is that the AFF does not trigger NEG impacts. It does not
  cause a strain and gives an **Alt-Cause.** Which is if anything is
  going to strain NATO it's their financing methods not the AFF.

- **Impact/Link Turn:** This is when you can turn these parts of your
  case back onto the other team. An Impact turn is turning the NEG's
  impacts back on them. Possibly stating that they make the impacts
  worst by not letting the AFF pass. A Link turn is saying that they
  link to the impacts better than the AFF. There is no Link turn in this
  particular case, but it is still just as valuable.

- **Alt-Cause:** This is called an alternative cause for why something
  is taking place, usually why the impacts could/are happening that is
  not the AFF. Even if the AFF causes the impacts there is a laundry
  list of other reasons that could also trigger those impacts and the
  blame cannot completely be put on the AFF. It just gives alternative
  reasons for why the impacts would happen.

## AFF

### Plan Text

#### The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in cyber security. 

### INHEERENCY

#### NATO and its allies depend heavily on a strong cyber defence

#### [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}]{.mark} **(NATO) March 23, 20**[[22]{.underline}]{.mark}**,** <https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm>

[[Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive
and coercive]{.underline},]{.mark} and are becoming ever more frequent.
NATO will continue to adapt to the evolving cyber threat landscape[[.
**NATO and its Allies rely on strong and resilient cyber defences to
fulfil the Alliance's core tasks of collective defence, crisis
management and cooperative security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Alliance
needs to be prepared to defend its networks and operations against the
growing sophistication of the cyber threats it faces. Cyber defence is
part of NATO's core task of collective defence. NATO Allies have
affirmed that international law applies in cyberspace. NATO\'s main
focus in cyber defence is to protect its own networks, operate in
cyberspace (including through the Alliance's operations and missions),
help Allies to enhance their national resilience and provide a platform
for political consultation and collective action. In July 2016, Allies
reaffirmed NATO's defensive mandate and recognised cyberspace as a
domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as
it does in the air, on land and at sea. [[Allies also made a Cyber
Defence Pledge in July 2016 to enhance their cyber defences, and have
continued to bolster their national resilience as a matter of
priority.]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO reinforces its cyber capabilities,
including through education, training and exercises. [[Allies are
committed to enhancing information-sharing and mutual assistance in
preventing, mitigating and recovering from cyber
attacks.]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are on
standby 24 hours a day to assist Allies, if requested and approved. At
the 2018 NATO Summit in Brussels, Allies agreed to set up a Cyberspace
Operations Centre as part of NATO's strengthened Command Structure. They
also agreed that NATO can draw on national cyber capabilities for
operations and missions. In February 2019, Allies endorsed a NATO guide
that sets out a number of tools to further strengthen NATO's ability to
respond to significant malicious cumulative cyber activities. NATO and
the European Union (EU) are cooperating through a Technical Arrangement
on Cyber Defence, which was signed in February 2016. In light of common
challenges, NATO and the EU are strengthening their cooperation on cyber
defence, notably in the areas of information exchange, training,
research and exercises. [[NATO is intensifying its cooperation with
industry through the NATO Industry Cyber
Partnership.]{.underline}]{.mark} At the 2021 NATO Summit in Brussels,
Allies endorsed a new Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy, which supports
NATO's core tasks and overall deterrence and defence posture to enhance
further the Alliance's resilience. Allies are using NATO as a platform
for political consultation, sharing concerns about malicious cyber
activities and exchanging national approaches and responses, as well as
considering possible collective responses. Allies are promoting a free,
open, peaceful and secure cyberspace, and pursuing efforts to enhance
stability and reduce the risk of conflict by supporting international
law and voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.

[[Developments in the cybersecurity operations of both NATO and the EU
have paralleled the growth of cybersecurity as a major policy concern to
the United States and other national governments.]{.underline}]{.mark}
The digital revolution has also changed the basic environment in which
governments operate, necessitating i n c r e a s i n g l e v e l s o f c
r o s s - b o r d e r interdependence and connectivity. [[European
countries have responded to the need to increase coordination and
cooperation through new initiatives at the national level and under the
auspices of NATO and the EU]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nevertheless, the
relationship between national capabilities and sovereignty, and the
authority of these two international organizations, remains unsettled[.
[The efforts of NATO and the EU to mainstream cybersecurity into
existing activities have thus far proven insufficient to fully address
the growing cyber threat landscape.]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO's
Development of Cross-border Cyber Defense Policy and Coordination NATO
forecasted today's cyber threat environment in 2010: "[[Cyber attacks
are becoming more frequent, more organized and more costly \[...\]; they
can reach a threshold that threatens national and Euro-Atlantic
prosperity, security and stability]{.underline}]{.mark}."6 NATO faces a
cyber threat landscape that abounds with hackers, hacktivists,
nation-states, and criminals. [[NATO itself has been targeted directly
by Russian hackers seeking information on its defensive posture against
Russia.7 Furthermore, the recent attack by Russia on the Ukrainian power
grid underscores the fact that Russian cyber attack capabilities are
very real]{.underline}]{.mark}.8 **[[NATO also faces the same types of
cyber breaches that affect businesses in America on a daily basis,
ranging from random criminal acts to infiltrate NATO's systems to those
of a more sophisticated, targeted nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Despite
preventive measures, cyber criminals around the world continue to gain
access to these networks, including those that are classified.9 In all,
the current threat environment embodies much more significant risks than
those first exemplified by the Russian cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007,
which initially prompted NATO to address the dangers of cyber warfare.

This brief is part of a project at the German Marshall Fund supported by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security> 

[[Malicious cyber activity has increased substantially over the past
years, ranging from ransomware and espionage to politically motivated
cyberattacks and sophisticated malware used in the war in
Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO allies must remain on high alert. The
changed nature of military conflict changes the defensive mission of
NATO, which faces capable opponents in cyberspace and raises the
question of how to create accountability when a hostile state fails to
observe globally agreed norms. The set of action for NATO for the next
five years evolves around how to impose costs and how to deny benefits
against malicious actors in cyberspace. [[What the war in Ukraine says
about cyber power is yet not entirely cleared from the fog of war. Many
aspects remain uncertain, but given the unpredictability of the Putin
regime, the risk of an escalation in hostile cyber exchanges between
Russia and NATO states remains high. What is clear is that, as of
February 24, 2022, we live in a different world in which the European
and global security orders have been shattered.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This brief first explores the challenge that cyber threats pose to NATO
allies and how the rapidly evolving cyber-threat landscape can alter the
international security environment. Secondly, it looks at developments
in cyber defense policy within NATO. Finally, the brief analyzes how
NATO needs to adapt to address cyber challenges, studying how allies
align their sovereign interests, capabilities, and cyber doctrines with
NATO operational requirements and strategic ambitions. [[NATO is set to
issue strategic documents in 2022 that will guide the next decade of its
military planning. This will certainly require more transatlantic
consultation on political-military matters with an emphasis on cyber
security and cyber defense.]{.underline}]{.mark} Cyber Challenge to
World and NATO Allies[[: **Malicious cyber activity has increased
substantially over the past years while the world has kept turning amid
the omnipresent pandemic**]{.underline}]{.mark} and now war in Ukraine.
States, non-state actors, [[and criminal groups compete and are
increasingly weaponizing sensitive information and infiltrating other
countries' networks to steal data, seed misinformation, or disrupt
critical infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack illustrated the vulnerability
of America's critical infrastructure to a security breach. Fuel
shortages and rising prices got people's attention. Data breaches have
more than doubled over the past decade**. Recent cyberattacks have
[exploited](https://fortune.com/2021/01/29/solarwinds-cybersecurity-zero-trust-national-security-supply-chain-risk-vendors-clean-network/)
the "trusted supplier" status of SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange,
among other companies, and raised concerns at the highest levels of
government and the private sector**. The stakes are only getting higher
as the internet of things makes everything more connected and we all
become more dependent on 5G-enabled technologies. What's being done to
prevent cyberattacks --- and is it enough?]{.underline}]{.mark} Last
month, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to begin developing
mandatory baseline security requirements for government agencies and the
companies that do business with them. The order states that the federal
government must collaborate with the private sector and with the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop and
implement a zero-trust model that "eliminates implicit trust in any one
element, node, or service and instead requires continuous verification"
from multiple sources.

[[Our network of cyber experts have a less-than-rosy take on the United
States\' ability to fend off cyber attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most of
them said the U.S. is either just as vulnerable to cyberattacks or even
more vulnerable today than it was five years ago. That assessment, from
a group of experts polled by The Cybersecurity 202, reflects [[a
half-decade during which government and industry have supercharged their
efforts to defend against devastating hacks from foreign governments and
criminals --- but the bad guys have upped their game even
more]{.underline}]{.mark}, most experts say. '\[We're\] less vulnerable
against the threats of five years ago. But [[I see no evidence that the
threat has stood still, and in fact, it is likely that it has grown at a
faster rate than our defenses," said Herb Lin, senior research scholar
for cyber policy and security at Stanford
University]{.underline}]{.mark}. "We become evermore vulnerable with
each passing day," warned Lauren Zabierek, executive director of the
Cyber Project at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center. "I don\'t
know where the bottom is." The breakdown, [[About 43 percent of
respondents]{.underline}]{.mark} to our Network experts poll [[said the
United States is more vulnerable to cyberattacks
now]{.underline}]{.mark}. About 38 percent said we're just as vulnerable
as we were five years ago. Just 19 percent of experts said the United
States is less vulnerable in cyberspace than five years ago. [[The
sobering results come as cyber executives and analysts are convening in
San Francisco for the RSA Conference, the largest annual
industry-focused cybersecurity gathering]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
being held in person for the first time since the start of the
coronavirus pandemic. The cyber industry has fared extremely well during
the past half-decade --- nearly doubling in value, according to some
estimates --- but it has also struggled to keep up with the dizzying
pace of attacks. More targets[:]{.underline} One key problem, according
to experts who said the United States is more vulnerable now: The nation
has become more reliant on technology during the past five years ---
significantly increasing the targets that hackers can aim at. And that
technology is often being built without security foremost in mind.
[["Cybersecurity is improving constantly, but the complexity of our
digital society may be outpacing our efforts to keep up," Mandiant
Threat Intelligence chief John Hultquist said]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Cyber and tech investor Niloofar Razi Howe: "We are more vulnerable
because of the dizzying pace we are adopting technology, engaging in
tech transformation, and adding devices without prioritizing
security."[[One particularly rich target has been a vast new array of
Internet-connected devices, such as refrigerators, thermostats and
cameras. These devices,]{.underline}]{.mark} commonly called the
"Internet of things" or "IoT" [[are notorious for relying on weak or
default passwords and being difficult to update with software patches
--- making them easy pickings for hackers.]{.underline}]{.mark}"Many of
these technologies have shortchanged their cybersecurity expenditures,
creating ever-increasing liabilities for everyone," said Sascha
Meinrath, founding director of X-Lab, a think tank at Penn State
focusing on the intersection of technologies and public policy."As the
cyber-strategist Biggie Smalls would have said, 'More IoT, More
Problems,' " quipped Peter Singer, a fellow at the New America think
tank. (Singer said the United States is equally vulnerable compared to
five years ago[[). Many experts blamed the United States' ongoing
vulnerability to hacking on the increased brazenness of U.S.
adversaries, especially Russia. Norma Krayem, a cyber policy expert at
Van Scoyoc Associates: "Russia\'s use of cyber tools against Ukraine has
clearly demonstrated to the world that it can fully disrupt key aspects
of critical infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Simple U.S. deterrence does not work,

[[Center for International Maritime Security]{.underline}]{.mark} **May

<https://cimsec.org/in-cyberspace-no-one-can-hear-you-bluff/>

[[General Paul Nakasone -- Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (USCC) and
Director, National Security Agency (NSA) -- asserts that "traditional
military deterrence is binary in regard to conflict and a deterrence
model...does not comport to cyberspace where much of the nefarious cyber
activity plays out non-stop in an ambiguous strategic gray
zone."]{.underline}]{.mark} **While this article is in agreement with
the "futility of totally deterring adversaries from operating in
cyberspace and instead actively disrupting those activities before they
can inflict damage," it takes the position of respectfully disagreeing
that traditional deterrence is binary and the rules of traditional
deterrence do not hold in cyberspace**[[. Deterrence centered around
domain denial is neither desirable nor sustainable. Hindering access to
cyberspace is not consistent with the enduring American values of
individual liberty, free expression, and free markets. This encumbered
access also runs counter to the U.S. national interest of protecting and
promoting internet freedom to support the free flow of information that
enhances international trade and commerce, fosters innovation, and
strengthens both national and international security; and the universal
right (global norm) of unfettered free access to and peaceful use of
cyberspace for all]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Restricting access to
cyberspace is also not practical considering the cost to operate in
cyberspace is modest, the barriers to entry low, and the ease of
operating negligible. Deterrence, the "prevention of action by either
the existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction and/or
belief that the costs of action outweigh the perceived benefits," is
more complicated and nuanced than a simple binary response of yes or
no**[[. Deterrence can create a delay or pause for transitory
maneuvering space to mitigate the effects of the threat action, or
better yet, take preemptive or preventive measures to disrupt
(neutralize) the threat action]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Deterrence, like
warfighting (war), involves universal and immutable "human nature" that
does not change over time or across nationality, demographic, culture,
geography, and domain. Rational actors choose to act or not to act based
on fundamental "fear, honor, and interest (Thucydides)" and are deterred
to act or not to act by real or perceived "capability, intent, and
credibility (deterrent triad)." Additionally, as Henry Kissinger once
noted, "deterrence is a product of capability, intent, and credibility
and not a sum...if any one of them is zero, deterrence fails."**
[[Washington accordingly must do more and do better to ensure each
factor succeeds as an aggregate deterrent triad for increased integrated
deterrence, decreased strategic risk, greater strategic alignment, and
lesser likelihood of conflict across all the interconnected and
contested domains.]{.underline}]{.mark} **Deterrence works best when it
is clear, coherent, uniform, and complementary across the fluid
competition continuum (steady state to crisis to conflict); expansive
instruments of national power (diplomatic, information, military,
economic, financial, intelligence, and law enforcement -- DIMEFIL); and
interconnected and contested domains (physical and nonphysical) for
strategic consistency, operational agility, and tactical flexibility.
Last year in an article titled "In Space, No One Can Hear You Bluff,"
this author made the policy case for a more active space deterrence to
better manage the growing threats to the vulnerable U.S. high-value
space assets. This article makes the same policy case now for a more
active cyber deterrence to better address the exigent factors of time,
space, and force in cyberspace.** [[An attack in cyberspace can come
from anyone, occur anywhere, and happen anytime with no warning to react
and no opportunity to respond -- an increasing real risk as the ongoing
Russian invasion of Ukraine persists and President Putin becomes more
impatient and desperate for victory while becoming at risk of
dangerously perceiving a shift in U.S. policy from conflict
containment]{.underline}]{.mark} (vertical and horizontal) [[to conflict
escalation, or worse, regime change.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### SOLVENCY

#### The United States should join forces with NATO to increase their own cyber security, they promised to 

[[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}]{.mark} (NATO), March
23, 20[[22]{.underline}]{.mark}
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm>?

To keep pace with the rapidly changing threat landscape and maintain
robust cyber defences, [[NATO adopted an enhanced policy and action
plan, which were endorsed by Allies at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales.
The 2014 policy established that cyber defence is part of the Alliance's
core task of collective defence, confirmed that international law
applies in cyberspace, set out the further development of NATO's and
Allies' capabilities, and intensified NATO's cooperation with
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, Allies
reaffirmed NATO's defensive mandate and recognised cyberspace as a
domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as
it does in the air, on land and at sea. As most crises and conflicts
today have a cyber dimension, treating cyberspace as a domain enables
NATO to better protect and conduct its operations and missions. [[At the
Warsaw Summit, Allies also pledged to strengthen and enhance the cyber
defences of national networks and infrastructures, as a matter of
priority.]{.mark}]{.underline} Together with the continuous adaptation
of NATO's cyber defence capabilities, this will reinforce the cyber
defence and overall resilience of the Alliance. At the 2021 NATO Summit
in Brussels, Allies endorsed a new Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy,
which supports NATO's three core tasks of collective defence, crisis
management and cooperative security, as well as its overall deterrence
and defence posture. NATO's defensive mandate was reaffirmed, and Allies
committed to employing the full range of capabilities to actively deter,
defend against and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats at all
times. Responses need to be continuous and draw on elements of the
entire NATO toolbox that include political, diplomatic and military
tools. Allies also recognised that the impact of significant malicious
cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be
considered as an armed attack. The nature of cyberspace requires a
comprehensive approach through unity of effort at the political,
military and technical levels. The 2021 policy and its corresponding
action plan will drive forward activities across these three levels.
Developing the NATO cyber defence capability The NATO Computer Incident
Response Capability (NCIRC), based at SHAPE in Mons, Belgium, protects
NATO's own networks by providing centralised and round-the-clock cyber
defence support. This capability evolves on a continual basis and
maintains pace with the rapidly changing threat and technology
environment. NATO has also established a Cyberspace Operations Centre in
Mons, Belgium. The Centre supports military commanders with situational
awareness to inform the Alliance's operations and missions. It also
coordinates NATO's operational activity in cyberspace, ensuring freedom
to act in this domain and making operations more resilient to cyber
threats. To facilitate an Alliance-wide common approach to cyber defence
capability development, NATO also defines targets for Allied countries'
implementation of national cyber defence capabilities via the NATO
Defence Planning Process. [[NATO helps Allies to enhance their national
cyber defences by facilitating information-sharing, exchange of best
practices and by conducting cyber defence exercises to develop national
expertise]{.underline}]{.mark} .

[[NATO has more of a history with cybersecurity than is widely known.
With its new strategy and continued investments, the Alliance seems to
want to expand its cybersecurity capabilities and responsibilities
dramatically]{.underline}]{.mark}. But NATO needs to avoid its Article 5
aspirations for cyberattacks and risks taking on too much cybersecurity
accountability NATO's New Tricks Looking back[[, 2010 seems to have been
dominated by reports on one security issue in particular: cyber threats.
The discovery of Stuxnet, the industry-sabotaging super worm that scared
politicians all over the world; tales of (Chinese) cyberespionage in
many variations; the growing sophistication of cybercriminals as
evidenced by their impressive scams;]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as
Wikileaks' release of US diplomatic cables and the subsequent actions of
the hacker group Anonymous all catapulted the cyber topic from the realm
of geeky experts and military strategists to a mainstream public fear.
Whether the damage inflicted by cyberattacks is becoming more frequent,
more organized, and more costly or if our perception has merely changed
is unimportant. [[The outcome is clear: cyberattacks are considered one
of the top security threats and have been anchored firmly in national
strategy documents all over the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given this
general mood, [[NATO's mention of cyberattacks as one of the primary
future security concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} in its new Strategic
Concept of November 2010 was widely applauded. But NATO was not just
following the common strategic trend: this reference in its new roadmap
marked the temporary culmination point of the Alliance's dealing with
the threat.

[[Despite a considerable arsenal of sophisticated offensive and
defensive cyber capabilities, American political and military systems
still struggle at times with inconsistent strategic communications and a
dogged credibility gap.]{.underline}]{.mark} **The new deterrent
framework in cyberspace must therefore focus more on communicating clear
intent and building enduring credibility through redlines, deterrent
language, and cross-domain options to impose further costs, deny added
benefits, encourage greater restraints, and control more the narratives.
Declaratory redlines make clear the unwanted risks, costs, and
consequences of specific actions. They are an important way to influence
an adversary's risk perception and rational calculus, lower the
likelihood of misunderstanding, and encourage restraint. They also
outline the conditions of and willingness to inflict unacceptable
retaliatory damage or destruction**[[. U.S. policymakers should
therefore "privately" reinforce to strategic
competitors]{.underline}]{.mark} **(and potential adversaries) the
deterrent public statements contained therein the 2018 National Cyber
Strategy (NCS), 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance
(INSSG), 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), and (anticipated)
forthcoming National Security Strategy (NSS).** [[U.S. law enforcement
officials should likewise continue to "publicly" warn cyber criminals of
egregious illicit cyber acts. In doing so, they should make it clear to
both state and non-state threat actors that any cyber attack or cyber
act that threatens U.S. national security interests, U.S. economic
prosperity, and U.S. political stability is unacceptable and will be met
with severe and disproportionate consequences for them. If they attack
or act, they should not expect a proportionate response. They should
expect prompt and devastating force that will cause retaliatory damages
much greater than what they intended to inflict. This clear warning
should have the effect of causing malicious cyber actors to think twice
before acting and consider that the real costs may be much greater than
any intended benefits.For cyber powers like China and Russia, it should
be made unequivocally clear that any cyber attack
on]{.underline}]{.mark} critical military space systems -- missile
warning, command and control of nuclear forces, and positioning,
navigation, and timing -- [[is an act of war and will be dealt with
accordingly]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Doing so interlocks the 2020
National Space Policy with the 2018 NCS, both of which acknowledge the
imperative of and calls for improvements to space cybersecurity. Like
any other increasingly digitized and networked critical infrastructure,
space-based and ground-based space systems and their communication links
are vulnerable to cyber attacks.**

*\*Note: Since the date this article was made the 2022 Strategic Concept
has been passed. Although this card is in future tense, in reality, it
is happening currently.*

This month [[in Madrid, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
will update its Strategic Concept, the principal document that guides
the alliance's political-military strategy and collective defense
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}. The war in Ukraine has put resilience
in the face of Russian aggression front and center, especially in the
cyber and information operation domains. Over the years, NATO has
digitized and enhanced its security platforms, emphasizing
interoperability of systems among its now 30 current member states[[. If
NATO is to become more resilient against advanced persistent threats,
hackers, and the maligned states that sponsor them, then the 2022
Strategic Concept must infuse multinational warfighting and deterrence
against hybrid threats with methods that facilitate access to data and
information sharing on its platforms and across multiple
domains]{.underline}]{.mark}, namely in air, cyber, information, land,
maritime, and space operations. [[The Strategic Concept is among NATO's
most important documents as it informs alliance planning, resource
allocation, and programming based on changes in the threat
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. But the document has not been updated
since 2010. The 2010 Strategic Concept, entitled "Active engagement,
Modern Defense," contained just one brief sentence about cyber attacks
and did not even mention China. It also stated that "Today, the
Euro-Atlantic area is at peace," even though Russia had invaded Georgia
two years before and the threat of a return to great power competition
loomed. To argue that a lot has happened between 2010 and 2022 would be
an understatement[[. Russia's annexation of Crimea and intervention in
the Donbas in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shattered any
illusions of a lasting peace with Russia.]{.mark} [China's territorial
ambitions, economic assertiveness, threats against Taiwan, and military
modernization threaten the rules-based order. Emerging technologies --
in the form of hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, quantum
computing, and machine learning -- have intensified great power
competition.]{.mark}]{.underline} The 2022 Strategic Concept should
highlight the essential role of technology in collective defense. To
build greater digital capacity while also emphasizing resilience, NATO
must adopt a new technological orientation on the military strategic
level of command, especially within **the Allied Command
Transformation** (ACT) in Norfolk, Virginia and the **Allied Command
Operations** (ACO) in Mons, Belgium. ACT leverages advanced technologies
for security and defense in capabilities, procedures, public-private
partnerships, civil-military relations, and at NATO's Centers of
Excellence. Led by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, ACO is
responsible for collective defense through direction, requirements,
planning, and execution at the strategic level. However[[, the Strategic
Concept 2022 should focus less on the emergence of new technologies and
more on how NATO's military and civilian personnel use
them.]{.underline}]{.mark} ACO and ACT must emphasize greater
accessibility to information and data for its multinational warfighters,
cyber operators, and civilian professionals[[. NATO must reach out to
experts in the private sector, academia, and non-governmental
organizations to harness ways to expand access and emphasize flexibility
in multi-domain operations. NATO can do this by providing more grants to
private sector partners and establish a new center of excellence on data
and information sharing.]{.mark}]{.underline} ACO and ACT should also
enable personnel and partners to readily access data and information in
DIMEL domains: diplomatic, information/cyber, military, economic, and
legal. This would expand the range of measures needed by ACT and ACO to
connect and correlate deterrence with evolving hybrid threats. To deter
hybrid threats across multiple domains, with enhanced access on
different digital platforms[[, NATO members should develop smarter and
lethal capabilities to confront threats from state and non-state actors.
This would allow ACT and ACO to prepare for any contingency and respond
to adversaries in battlefields and battlespaces.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The coronavirus pandemic further complicated the cyber-threat
landscape. In March 2020, attempts to mitigate the spread of the
coronavirus led to social distancing measures, travel restrictions, and
remote work. In a short span of time, IT security professionals had to
respond to the challenges of working from home, such as enterprise data
movements when employees accessed cloud-based apps via their home
internet, corporate software, videoconferencing, and file
sharing.]{.underline}]{.mark}[1](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote1_fhsuz62)  [[Even
if hardware and software solutions were in place to secure the

faced when moving their workplace out of the traditional office
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}.[2](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote2_j09lbjl)
According to the FireEye Mandiant Special Report: M-Trends
2021[[, the top five most targeted industries in 2020 were business and
professional services, retail and hospitality, finance, healthcare, and
high technology. The main methods used were extortion, ransom demands,
payment card theft, and illicit transfers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Direct
financial gain was the likely motive for 36% of intrusions, and an
additional 2% of intrusions were likely perpetrated to resell access. In
2021, data theft remained an important mission objective for threat
actors; in 32% of intrusions, adversaries stole
data.[3](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote3_jbmz5mx)Currently,
[[highly organized, technically proficient criminal syndicates comprise
the most significant cyber threat to allies. These groups try to steal
data or extort money through ransomware. In 2021, prominent ransomware
attacks struck Colonial Pipeline, the operator of the largest fuel
pipeline on the East Coast of the United StRates]{.underline}]{.mark};
[[JBS, the largest meat processing company in North America; and Coop, a

While it could take months or even years to remove the compromised
software and implement other remediation measures, and although the
costs to the U.S. government alone could be in the hundreds of millions
of
dollars,[^3^](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2021/06/28/the-economic-costs-of-cyber-risk/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-119213) the
breach was not as damaging as feared from an economic perspective,
because its primary purpose appears to have been espionage. The breach
did not cause large-scale business disruptions like those caused by
Russia's NotPetya attack on Ukraine in 2017. That malware spread around
the world, affecting tens of thousands of companies, costing some as
much as hundreds of millions of
dollars.[^4^](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2021/06/28/the-economic-costs-of-cyber-risk/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-119213)

[[The digital age has increased productivity and efficiency, but many
firms are struggling to manage the downside risks that accompany it. Too
many companies are prioritizing short-term growth and cost-cutting at
the expense of cybersecurity.]{.underline}]{.mark} As the SolarWinds
breach demonstrated, [[one company's cyber risk can have cascading
economic and national security implications.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Twenty years ago, after a wave of corporate scandals undermined public
confidence in the securities market, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, requiring greater corporate financial
disclosures.[^5^](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2021/06/28/the-economic-costs-of-cyber-risk/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-119213) The
law strengthened investor protections and confidence through better
accounting standards, improved internal controls and disclosure by
companies, and stronger external oversight. [[Poor cybersecurity is
today's systemic risk, and the potential impact is even greater. Unlike
the accounting malpractice and financial scandals of the 1990s and early
2000s that prompted congressional intervention, a single company with
deficient cybersecurity could inflict substantial harm on the U.S.
government, company shareholders (including retirees dependent on
pensions), the public, and critical national

Another set of threats comes in the form of belligerent state actors
that seek to steal sensitive data for espionage. [[In December 2020,
Russian intelligence services infiltrated the digital systems run by US
tech firm SolarWinds and inserted malware into its code. During the
company's next software update, the virus was inadvertently spread to
about 18,000 clients, including large corporations, the Pentagon, the
State Department, Homeland Security, the Treasury, and other US
government agencies. The hack went undetected for months before the
victims discovered vast amounts of their data had been
stolen]{.underline}]{.mark}.[5](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote5_7ky072m)There
are also politically motivated cyberattacks mandated by states that
interfere in democratic processes and political discourse[[. In
September 2020, the internal email system of Norway's parliament was
hacked]{.underline}]{.mark}.[6](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote6_h5str9j)  Ine
Eriksen Søreide, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway, underlined
the significance of the attack by calling it an important cyber incident
that affected the "most important democratic institution" of the
country.[7](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote7_kw1dijx) [ [Norwegian
authorities later identified Russia as the actor responsible for the
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}, marking the first time that Norwegian
authorities had made a political attribution to such an attack.Since the
beginning of this year, Ukraine's government has been hit by a series of
cyberattacks that defaced government websites and wiped out the data on
some government computers. In mid-January, hackers defaced about 70
Ukrainian websites, including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
Defense, Energy, Education, and Science, as well as the State Emergency
Service and the Ministry of Digital Transformation, whose e-governance
portal gives the Ukrainian public digital access to dozens of government
services. The hackers replaced the home pages of about a dozen sites
with a threatening message: "be afraid and expect worse."** **After a
couple of days, however, most of the sites were
restored.[8](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote8_fkr7g6e)  The

[[Nonetheless, Ramani noted the threat posed by Russia could become more
acute if it felt]{.underline}]{.mark} humiliated on the battlefield. In
particular, military setbacks in Ukraine around May 9 could pose some
danger. That's Russia's "Victory Day" --- the anniversary of Nazi
Germany's defeat by the Soviet Union in World War II.

["Putin has had a history of escalating unpredictability if he feels
that Russia is being humiliated in some way \... and if there are major
setbacks]{.mark}, especially on around the 9th \[of May\] [then there's
a risk of unbreakable action]{.mark}," he said. "But also there's a
logic of mutually assured destruction that hopefully will rein everybody
in."

[[Threatening nuclear attacks is part of Putin's "playbook," said
William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control at
the International Institute for Strategic Studies think
tank.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[["Putin enjoys using risks and he thinks he has a much more appetite
for risk than the West does," he told CNBC on Thursday. "He's trying to
use the old playbook of 'if I terrify you enough, you'll back down'," he
said.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[["Ultimately, if he uses nuclear weapons, even a demonstration strike,
this would turn Russia into a global pariah]{.underline}]{.mark},"
Alberque said. He advised Western leaders, "We just need to be able to
manage our risk and keep our nerve and not panic when he does something

With the Georgia Senate runoff elections set for Jan. 5, 2021, a
nationwide survey conducted post-election could provide insights about
voter perceptions of fairness in the U.S. election and trust in
democratic institutions[[. Researchers from a university consortium of
Northwestern, Harvard, Northeastern and Rutgers surveyed more than
24,000 individuals across the nation between Nov. 3 and 30. The survey
found that overall, 38% of Americans lack confidence in the fairness of
the 2020 presidential election. That number is especially high among
Republicans (64%) and Trump voters (69%) compared to Democrats (11%) and
Biden voters (8%).]{.mark} ["This level of distrust is not surprising,
given political rhetoric, but it certainly is concerning. Elections are
the foundation of our democracy and loss of faith in the process could
undermine the new administration's legitimacy and ability to get things
done," said James Druckman, the Payson S. Wild Professor of political
science in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern and
associate director of the University's Institute for Policy
Research]{.mark}]{.underline}. The survey showed large partisan gaps of
over 40 percentage points in public concern about mail-in fraud (85% of
Republicans and 38% of Democrats), inaccurate or biased vote counts (84%
of Republicans and 44% of Democrats) and illegal votes from non-citizens
(81% of Republicans and 34% of Democrats). [[To better understand the
reasons why some Americans distrust the election process, respondents
were asked about their level of concern regarding voter suppression,
intimidation, inaccurate or biased counts and
interference.]{.mark}]{.underline} The problem most people found
troubling was voter suppression (making it harder for certain groups to
vote), with over two-thirds of respondents (67%) saying they were
somewhat or very concerned about it[[. Voter intimidation was a concern

vote counts concerned 60% of Americans[[. Foreign country interference
was a concern for 59%, mail-in ballot fraud for 57%]{.underline}]{.mark}
and illegal votes from non-citizens was a concern for 52%. "These
numbers create a puzzle for the current Senate elections in Georgia,"
said Druckman. "For some, the concerns may de-mobilize but for others it
may be a mobilizing factor to get your vote in, especially to combat
concerns about suppression and intimidation." The three most polarizing
election process issues with partisan gaps of over 40 percentage points
had been heavily promoted by President Trump and received attention by
right wing media. These included mail-in fraud (reported as somewhat or
very concerning for 85% of Republicans but only 38% of Democrats),
inaccurate or biased vote counting (a concern for 84% of Republicans and
44% of Democrats) and illegal votes from non-citizens (a concern for 81%
of Republicans and 34% of Democrats). [[Partisan differences were lowest
with regard to foreign interference in the election (60% Republicans and
63% Democrats), voter intimidation (60% Republicans and 67% Democrats)
and voter suppression (63% or Republicans and 73% of Democrats). "The
results make clear that we have a long way to go to restore faith in our
electoral process," Druckman said.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The U.S. weak cyber security and constant attacks from Russia is the cause for growing election distrust

[[U.S. News]{.underline}]{.mark}, May 10, 20[[19]{.underline}]{.mark},
<https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2019-05-10/after-russian-election-interference-americans-are-losing-faith-in-elections>

[[As lawmakers, state elections officials and social media executives
work to limit intervention in the 2020 elections by Russia and other
foreign operatives, an unsettling truth is emerging. Vladimir Putin may
already be succeeding. The troubling disclosures of Russian meddling in
the 2016 campaign -- \"sweeping and systematic]{.underline}]{.mark},\"
special counsel Robert Mueller concluded in his report on the matter --
[[have policymakers on guard for what intelligence officials say is a
continuing campaign by Russia to influence American elections. But even
if voting machines in all jurisdictions are secured against hacking and
social media sites are scrubbed of fake stories posted by Russian bots,
the damage may already have been done, experts warn, as Americans\'
faith in the credibility of the nation\'s elections
falters.]{.underline}]{.mark}\"This is Vladimir Putin\'s game plan --
sow distrust, discord, disillusionment and division,\" Sen. Richard
Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, says about the Russian leader.
\"It\'s his playbook for all Western democracies -- not just us, but
Europe and around the world. We\'re open societies, we\'re vulnerable to
disinformation, and he regards himself as superior because he controls
the press,\" adds Blumenthal, one of the authors of bipartisan
legislation meant to improve election security. \"There\'s a real danger
to such distrust in the integrity of our election system that has
lasting damage,\" he warns. Allegations of uncounted -- or wrongly
counted -- ballots, voter suppression and other grievances tend to
emerge in every election. Most famously in recent history, the 2000
presidential race was effectively determined by the Supreme Court. But
the events of the past few years -- including frequent comments by
President Donald Trump questioning the integrity of a race he won --
have aggravated the distrust, pollsters and analysts say. [[An
NPR/Marist poll before last year\'s midterms found that nearly 2 in 4
voters do not believe elections are fair, and well over half said they
did not think all votes would be counted in November 2018. That compared
with a 2016 Gallup poll that found nearly two-thirds of Americans were
confident in the vote count.Marist polling over decades shows that
public faith in many institutions has plummeted, says Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, Miringoff says, in 1990, 62
percent of Americans said the media provided fair and accurate coverage
of campaigns, with 37 percent disagreeing. Now, the numbers are
virtually flipped, [[with an April Marist poll showing that 63 percent
of Americans don\'t trust the media for fair and accurate campaign
reporting, with 37 percent saying they do trust the media. The
diminished trust in institutions is worrisome, Miringoff says, since it
is those very institutions that inform the public of possible election
meddling and handle the consequences of a disputed
election.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### **POC voter turnout is already low, election fraud is another way to stop them from voting**

[[American Bar Association,]{.underline}]{.mark} June 25,

https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/why-minority-voters-have-a-lower-voter-turnout/

[[With ethnic and racial minority populations in the United States
rising, there is a growing population of voices that remain unaccounted
for. Though current legislation has been implemented to ensure fair and
impartial voting access, there is too much leeway given to state
governments in the voting system's execution. As a result, restrictions
in the election system have resulted in systematic discrimination toward
minority populations]{.underline}]{.mark}, making them ineligible to
vote. Voter ID laws have underlying racial biases and prevent minorities
from engaging in active democratic participation. These requirements
compel an individual to present his or her ID in order to cast a ballot
on Election Day. Obtaining an ID can be costly and requires an
individual's birth certificate, which may be burdensome. Proponents
advocate for the law under the guise of preventing voter fraud and
ensuring that only voter-eligible citizens partake in elections;
however, individuals who lack government-issued identification are more
likely to be younger, less educated, and impoverished, and---most
notably---nonwhite. An example of the inherent discrimination of voter
ID laws can be found in the implementation of Georgia's "exact match"
system. This program requires an individual's voting status to be
suspended if the name on their driver's license or Social Security
records does not exactly match the name they inputted on their voter
registration form. Of the 51,000 individuals that this law affected in
2018, 80 percent of them were African American. There is evidence that
the "exact match" law played a role in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial
election, as African American candidate Stacey Abrams lost by
approximately 55,000 votes. It is also far more difficult for members of
minority communities to be able to locate polling places on Election
Day. Only 5 percent of white survey respondents reported that they had
trouble finding polling locations, compared to 15 percent of African
American and 14 percent of Hispanic respondents. When deciding where to
place a polling station, election officials are required to assign each
precinct a designated station based on factors such as population,
accessibility, and location recognizability; locations may be changed at
the officials' discretion. [[Minorities have a lower voter turnout
compared to whites and, in many cases, this has resulted in
discriminatory polling place distributions. Disparities in polling
places can also be the result of a change in the majority of election
officials]{.underline}]{.mark};

[[Russia's propaganda and disinformation apparatus is extraordinarily
complex. Some outlets are fully state-run, some are merely state-funded,
and others are operated at arm's length by Putin-linked
oligarchs.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The system churns out conspiracy
theories and whataboutism to aid Moscow's
objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From the start of the all-out
invasion on February 24**[[, Russian disinformation has thumped on a
series of narratives: that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
posed a security risk to the Russian Federation; that Ukraine was run by
neo-Nazis; that Ukraine is responsible for slaughtering civilians on its
own territory.]{.mark}]{.underline} **Those narratives have,
unfortunately, been somewhat effective in discouraging a unified
response from NATO. They've influenced millions of Westerners and found
purchase with far-right and Russophilic politicians the world over.**
[[The most visible Western response to date has been the collective
taking offline of Russia Today, or RT, the state-run television
network]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet trying to ban Russian media is a
mug's game. Any outlets forbidden by law or suspended by the social
media giants would simply jump to the Russian-founded social media
platform Telegram, which abhors regulation. Rather than playing
whack-a-mole outlet by outlet, Ukraine's allies would be better off
exposing how these disinformation networks work**[[. Many of these
social media pages, self-styled think tanks, blogs and media outlets are
designed to look fully independent and authentic. Efforts by Twitter,

inconsistent.]{.underline}]{.mark} **Berlin-based, Moscow-run video

[[OVER THE PAST few years, online disinformation has taken evolutionary
leaps forward]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the Internet Research Agency
pumping out artificial outrage on social media and hackers leaking
documents---both real and fabricated---to suit their narrative. More
recently, [[Eastern Europe has faced a broad campaign that takes fake
news ops to yet another level: hacking legitimate news sites to plant
fake stories, then hurriedly amplifying them on social media before
they're taken down.]{.mark}]{.underline} On Wednesday, [[security firm
FireEye released a report on a disinformation-focused group it's calling
Ghostwriter. The propagandists have created and disseminated
disinformation since at least March 2017, with a focus on undermining
NATO and the US troops in Poland and the Baltics; they've posted fake
content on everything from social media to pro-Russian news
websites]{.underline}]{.mark}. In some cases, FireEye says, Ghostwriter
has deployed a bolder tactic: [[hacking the content management systems
of news websites to post their own stories. They then disseminate their
literal fake news]{.underline}]{.mark} with spoofed emails, social
media, and even op-eds the propagandists write on other sites that
accept user-generated content. [[That hacking
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark}, targeting media sites from Poland to
Lithuania, [[has spread false stories about US military aggression, NATO
soldiers spreading coronavirus, NATO planning a full-on invasion of
Belarus, and more.]{.underline}]{.mark} "They're spreading these stories
that NATO is a danger, that they resent the locals, that they're
infected, that they're car thieves," says John Hultquist, director of
intelligence at FireEye. "And they're pushing these stories out with a
variety of means, the most interesting of which is hacking local media
websites and planting them. These fictional stories are suddenly bona
fide by the sites that they're on, and then they go in and spread the
link to the story."FireEye itself did not conduct incident response
analyses on these incidents and concedes that it doesn\'t know exactly
how the hackers are stealing credentials that give them access to the
content management systems that allow posting and altering news stories.
Nor does it know who is behind the string of website compromises, or for
that matter the larger disinformation campaign that the fake stories are
a part of.

But the company's analysts have found that the news site compromises and
the online accounts used to spread links to those fabricated stories, as
well as the more traditional creation of fake news on social media,
blogs, and websites with an anti-US and anti-NATO bent, all tie back to
a distinct set of personas, indicating one unified disinformation
effort. [[FireEye's Hultquist points out that the campaign doesn't seem
financially motivated, indicating a political or state backer, and notes
that the focus on driving a wedge between NATO and citizens of Eastern
Europe hints at possible Russian involvement. Nor would it be the first
time that Russian hackers planted fake news stories; in 2017, US
intelligence agencies concluded that Russian hackers breached Qatar's
state news agency and planted a fake news story designed to embarrass
the country's leader and cause a rift with the US]{.underline}]{.mark},
though US intelligence never confirmed the Kremlin's involvement.\"We
can't concretely tie it to Russia at this time, but it's certainly in
line with their interests,\" Hultquist says of the Ghostwriter campaign.
\"It wouldn't be a surprise to me if this is where the evidence leads
us.\" Much of the disinformation has focused on Lithuania, as DefenseOne
reported late last year. In June 2018, for instance, the
English-language, Baltic-focused news site the Baltic Course published a
story claiming that a US Stryker armored vehicle had collided with a
Lithuanian child on a bicycle, killing the child \"on the spot.\" The
same day, the Baltic Course posted a notice to the site that \"hackers
posted this news about the deceased child, which is FAKE!!! We thank our
vigilant Lithuanian readers who reported on our Facebook page about fake
new on site. We strengthened security measures.\"A few months later, the
Lithuanian news site Kas Vyksta Kaune published a story stating that
\"NATO plans to invade Belarus,\" showing a map of how NATO forces in
Polish and Baltic countries would enter the neighboring country. Kas
Vyksta Kaune later acknowledged that the story was fake, and planted by
hackers. Someone had used a former employee's credentials to gain access
to the CMS. Then in September of last year[[, another fake story was
posted to the site about German NATO soldiers desecrating a Jewish
cemetery, including what FireEye describes as a photoshopped image of a
military vehicle with a German flag visible behind the
cemetery.]{.mark}]{.underline} More recently, the fake stories have
attempted to exploit fears of Covid-19. One story posted to both Kas
Vyksta Kaune and the English-language Baltic Times in January claimed
that the first Covid-19 case in Lithuania was a US soldier who was
hospitalized in critical condition, but only after he \"visited public
places and participated in city events with child and youth
participation,\" according to the Baltic Times version of the story. In
April and May of this year, the focus turned toward Poland: A fake story
was posted across several Polish news sites in which a US official
disparaged local Polish forces as disorganized and incompetent. This
time the campaign went even beyond news sites. A fake letter from a
Polish military official was posted to the Polish Military Academy
website, calling on the Polish military to cease military exercises with
the US, decrying the US \"occupation\" of Poland, and calling the
exercises an \"obvious provocation\" of Russia. The Polish government
quickly called out the letter as fake. FireEye\'s finding that all of
those operations to plant [[fake news were carried out by a single group
comes on the heels of a report from The New York Times that Russia\'s
military intelligence agency, the GRU, has been]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[coordinating the publication of disinformation on
sites]{.underline}]{.mark} like InfoRos, OneWorld.press, and
GlobalResearch.ca[[. US intelligence officials speaking to the Times
said that disinformation campaign, which included false reports that
Covid-19 originated in the US, was specifically the work of the GRU\'s
\"psychological warfare unit,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} known as Unit
54777.[[Given the GRU\'s role in meddling in the 2016 presidential
election, including its hack-and-leak operations against the Democratic
National Committee and the Clinton Campaign, any GRU role in more recent
disinformation raises fears that it may be targeting the 2020 election
as well.]{.underline}]{.mark} While FireEye has made no such claims that
the Ghostwriter news site compromises were the work of the GRU[[,
Hultquist argues that the incidents in Poland and the Baltics should
nonetheless serve as a warning. Even if false stories are spotted
quickly and taken down, they could have a significant temporary effect
on public opinion, he warns.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### More Americans are turning to social media for their news

Forbes, June 24, 2020,
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikevorhaus/2020/06/24/people-increasingly-turn-to-social-media-for-news/?sh=37284ed13bcc>

[[In these days of pandemic, protests, economic recession and angst
among the world's population a recently issued report shows that
consumers continue to shift away from traditional media sources for
their news and are moving more towards social media and messaging
services to find the news.]{.mark}]{.underline} Long gone are the days
of people getting most of their news from a local TV station, their
local newspaper or the national newscast from one of the networks. Over
15 years ago, we already saw the substantial decay of Americans using
traditional news sources and instead the Internet becoming a major
source of news, particularly for the 18 to 34 year old demographic. This
data comes from a study done for Carnegie Corporation in 2005. A
research group I led at the time was responsible for the study. Carnegie
Corporation is a major U.S. charitable foundation with a significant
interest in journalism and news. [[As newspapers have fallen
dramatically in usage, and the national newscasts have dropped in
ratings, the swing to new sources of information has accelerated
considerably. Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford
University has recently issued a report on the state of digital news
around the world.]{.mark}]{.underline} One of the very notable facts
coming out from the study is the heavy use of Instagram for news which
could soon possibly overtake Twitter. Instagram news consumers were 11%
of the social media population. Twitter was statistically tied at 12[[%.
Just as we found in 2005 for Carnegie Corporation, the shift away from
traditional news media sources is being led by the younger generation,
in this case people under 25 years old.]{.underline}]{.mark} Two-thirds
of that age cohort said they use Instagram for gathering news
information. The same age group reported that they were two times more
likely to look at news on social media apps. Facebook leads with 36% of
social media consumers using the social media giant for consuming news.
YouTube had 21% of social media users looking at news on the popular
video site. WhatsApp had 16% of consumers in that group and 12% used
Twitter. Facebook owns both Instagram and WhatsApp[[. In this time of
political and social upheavals, it is interesting to note that the
Reuters study (conducted by YouGov, a research agency) only found 14% of
people in the US trusted news on social media]{.underline}]{.mark}
compared to 22% in regard to news gathered from search engines. Also, as
further evidence of the power of social media in driving news to
consumers, social media as a news source, saw ongoing growth with news
consumers, unlike platforms such as all online sources combined, TV, and
print. When thinking about what we know about the news and where we get
our news, I reflect back on Will Rogers' famous quote: "All I know is
just what I read in the papers, and that\'s an alibi for my ignorance."

#### The impact is american facism, war and economic collapse

But [[there's another political regime]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
historical one, [[that may portend an even more dire future for the
U.S.: the Weimar Republic.]{.underline}]{.mark} The situation in Germany
in the 1920s and early 1930s was of course sui generis; in particular,
the country had experienced staggering traumas -- defeat in war,
internal revolution and hyperinflation -- while the country's commitment
to liberal democracy was weakly rooted in its culture. But as I read a
history of the doomed republic this past summer, [[I tallied no fewer
than five unnerving parallels with the current U.S. situation. First, in
both cases, a charismatic leader was able to unify right-wing extremists
around a political program to seize the state.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Second, a bald falsehood about how enemies inside the polity had
betrayed the country]{.underline}]{.mark} -- for the Nazis, the "stab in
the back," and for Trumpists, the Big Lie -- [[was a vital psychological
tool for radicalizing and mobilizing followers. Third, conventional
conservatives believed they could control and channel the charismatic
leader and rising extremism but were ultimately
routed]{.underline}]{.mark} by the forces they helped unleash. [[Fourth,
ideological opponents of this rising extremism squabbled among
themselves; they didn't take the threat seriously
enough]{.underline}]{.mark}, even though it was growing in plain sight;
and they focused on marginal issues that were too often red meat for the
extremists. (Today, think toppling statues.)To my mind, though, [[the
fifth parallel is the most disconcerting: the propagation of a "hardline
security doctrine."]{.underline}]{.mark} Here I've been influenced by
the research of Jonathan Leader Maynard, a young English scholar who is
emerging as one of the world's most brilliant thinkers on the links
between ideology, extremism and violence. In a forthcoming
book, Ideology and Mass Killing, Dr. Leader Maynard argues that
[[extremist right-wing ideologies generally don't arise from explicit
efforts to forge an authoritarian society, but from the radicalization
of a society's existing understandings of how it can stay safe and
secure in the face of alleged threats.Hardline conceptions of security
are "radicalized versions of familiar claims about threat, self-defence,
punishment, war, and duty]{.underline}]{.mark}," he writes[[. They are
the foundation on which regimes organize campaigns of violent
persecution and terror.]{.underline}]{.mark} People he calls
"hardliners" believe the world contains many "dangerous enemies that
frequently operate in and through purported 'civilian' groups."
Hardliners increasingly dominate Trumpist circles now.Dr. Leader Maynard
then makes a complementary argument: Once a hardline doctrine is widely
accepted within a political movement, it becomes an "infrastructure" of
ideas and incentives that can pressure even those who don't really
accept the doctrine into following its dictates. [[Fear of "true
believers" shifts the behaviour of the movement's moderates toward
extremism]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Sure enough, the experts I recently
consulted all spoke about how fear of crossing Mr. Trump's base --
including fear for their families' physical safety -- was forcing
otherwise sensible Republicans to fall into
line.]{.underline}]{.mark}The rapid propagation of hardline security
doctrines through a society, Dr. Leader Maynard says, typically occurs
in times of political and economic crisis. Even in the Weimar Republic,
the vote for the National Socialists was closely correlated with the
unemployment rate. The Nazis were in trouble (with their share of the
vote falling and the party beset by internal disputes) as late as 1927,
before the German economy started to contract. Then, of course, the
Depression hit. [[The United States today is in the midst of crisis --
caused by the pandemic, obviously -- but it could experience far worse
before long: perhaps a war with Russia, Iran or China, or a financial
crisis when economic bubbles caused by excessive liquidity
burst.]{.underline}]{.mark}

organizations, particularly regarding ransomware.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Last fall, ransomware attacks appeared to be at their highest, with
attacks against private companies happening on a routine basis, although
many of the attacks were not existential for the company involved or
didn't compromise major systems. (Anecdotally, in October 2021, multiple
forensic companies I work with reported that they were at capacity for
ransomware attacks and were unable to take on additional clients.) But
by the time of the invasion, ransomware attacks had significantly
dropped off, and those of us who work in the private cybersecurity
sector remarked quietly among ourselves that it was disconcertingly
quiet. It is unclear -- at least based on publicly available information
-- [[whether this is related to Russian state-sponsored and
state-affiliated hackers focusing their efforts on the war in Ukraine or
if there has been some other type of disruption in their operations,
perhaps due to efforts by the U.S. government to address ransomware
gangs.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### A sweeping Russian cyber attack is unlikely

Rob [[Kuznia et al]{.underline}]{.mark}, March 16,

school district. He also founded a class at the University of Southern
California..https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/russia-us-cyberattack-infrastructure-invs/index.html

To be sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the
websites of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the
invasion, and larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged
country of 43 million people. [[But the general consensus among the
nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN for this story is that while Russia
is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US, it is
not likely to do so.]{.mark}]{.underline} \"We do need to consider this
possibility as a low probability but high-impact scenario,\" said Paul
Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity
firm IntSights. [[The prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America
are low, experts say. For one, Putin understands that his country\'s
cyber capabilities, though formidable, are outmatched by those of the
United States, which is generally thought to be the most sophisticated
player in the domain.]{.mark}]{.underline} The federal Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency told [[CNN it hasn\'t yet received any
credible cyber threats resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, but it
emphasized that the energy sector has been bolstering its defenses in
recent years and is on high alert as it urgently prepares for any
attempted breach.]{.mark}]{.underline} Experts say Russia\'s ability to
conduct an impactful cyberattack in the US shouldn\'t be
underestimated.\"

[[How serious are the potential threats to critical infrastructure in
the United States from hostile cyber operations]{.underline}]{.mark},
and do you anticipate Russia targeting U.S. critical infrastructure?
There have been efforts across multiple administrations to raise
awareness of cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure, to share
threat information with companies that own or operate critical
infrastructure, and to improve private-public partnerships to further
harden and protect these companies[[. Most recently, on March 15, 2022,
the President signed into law the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical
Infrastructure Act of 2022 (within the Consolidated Appropriations Act),
which will require entities determined to be critical infrastructure to
report substantial cyber incidents within 72 hours and ransomware
payments within 24 hours to CISA.]{.underline}]{.mark} But it's unlikely
that it will have an impact any time soon -- the statute allows the CISA
director until September 2025 to establish implementing regulations. And
because passage of the bill was strongly criticized by the Department of
Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, there could be
significant interagency fighting about the scope and content of the
proposed rulemaking[[. Perhaps more importantly, in June 2021, after the
Colonial Pipeline ransomware attacks, President Biden warned Putin that
16 critical infrastructure sectors should be off-limits from
cyberattacks.]{.underline}]{.mark} Although it is not clear what the
Biden administration has planned or specifically warned in the event of
a critical infrastructure attack attributed to Russia[[, the
presidential notice clearly raises the stakes for Russia: Putin must
certainly expect that such attacks will have a significant response from
the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}. In that warning, however, the
administration took pains to differentiate between "destructive" hacks
and "conventional digital espionage operations carried out by
intelligence agencies worldwide." In March of this year, Deputy National
Security Advisor Anne Neuberger issued a public warning that the U.S.
government is observing "threat intelligence that the Russian government
is exploring options for potential cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure in the United States." One can imagine that what the U.S.
is observing is Russia conducting the very espionage activities that the
U.S. was careful to distinguish as not off limits, but whether the
Kremlin decides to exploit any vulnerabilities it has found or accesses
it has established is what matters[[. Regardless of President Biden's
warning, Putin certainly understands that there is a big difference
between hacking private email accounts of administration officials and
dumping the emails for an embarrassment campaign, compared to an attack
that impacts water, electricity, or communications systems in the United
States. Russia will always want the option to disable the critical
infrastructure in the United States -- much the same way other countries
proactively seek to understand weaknesses in their adversaries'
defenses. But I would be surprised if Putin were to take action against
U.S. critical infrastructure because of the potential for it to result
in significant escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether of the conflict
in Ukraine or more generally. So despite the necessary focus on
preparing for critical infrastructure cyber attacks, I would be more
concerned about attacks on private companies or further disinformation
campaigns.

#### 2) A large scale cyber attack is the only way America would engage in conflict

Zachary [[Wolf]{.underline}]{.mark}, March 22,

newsletter for CNN. He also serves as a senior writer for CNN Politics,

<https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/russian-cyberattacks-what-matters/index.html>

[[When is a cyberattack an act of war?]{.underline}]{.mark} I called
Tess Bridgeman, co-editor in chief of the website Just Security and a
former attorney in the Obama White House who is an expert on war powers
and international law. [[\"If a cyberattack causes significant death,
destruction or injury, of the same sort that you would see from a more
traditional attack using kinetic means, like bullets or
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}, you know, [[then you would call it a
\'use of force\' in international law,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} she said.
[[A cyberattack that targeted a dam or air traffic control towers might
rise to this level, but the government would try very hard to avoid
responding to a cyberattack with a military attack,]{.underline}]{.mark}
she said. The attacks on the US to date have fallen short of the
threshold to justify a military response. As the government seeks
countermeasures to respond, Bridgeman said, there\'s a good chance they
won\'t be publicly known[[.\"It may appear that the US is sitting by
idly, but I would be highly doubtful that that\'s the case,\" she said,
arguing that defensive actions might be more effective at de-escalating
the standoff. \"It\'s setting the example for what responsible state
behavior looks like.\"The threat of a military response is always there
for the worst cyberattacks, should they cost American lives. \"Our
policy, our declared policy is, if it\'s a big enough attack on us and
it hurts us, we will use the conventional weapons response,\" Richard
Clarke, who was a top adviser to President George W. Bush on
cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}, told CNN\'s Michael Smerconish
shortly after the war in Ukraine began.

#### Russia will not attack the US over cyber security concerns 

Zachary [[Wolf]{.underline}]{.mark}, March 22,

[[Most of these attacks are meant to be part of espionage campaigns or
to be meddlesome rather than deadly.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Clarke
argued that Russian attacks on US industries could be more devastating
than attacks on the government itself. He said the government doesn\'t
really know what would happen if the Amazon, Google and Microsoft cloud
systems went offline, for instance]{.underline}]{.mark}. \"I can tell
you if those clouds go down, the United States stops working, our
economy stops working, the phones stop working \-- we will find
ourselves pretty soon in the dark ages if the internet goes down,\" said
Clarke[[. It\'s not clear that Russia would want to provoke the US
specifically in a such a devastating way,]{.mark}]{.underline} or how
the US would respond. While its cyberattacks in Ukraine since the war
began have been less severe than some expected, according to a report by
Lyngass, Russia has targeted internet infrastructure in parts of the
country. There has been concern that cyberattacks in Ukraine could spill
over to nearby countries that are in NATO and could lead the
organization to invoke Article 5 of its charter \-- the principle that
an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. [[Could a
cyberattack trigger Article 5?]{.underline}]{.mark} A cyberattack could
absolutely trigger Article 5. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
made this clear in February just after Russia\'s invasion. \"An attack
on one will be regarded as an attack on all,\" Stoltenberg said at a
news conference when asked about a potential Russian cyberattack. But he
added [[that NATO would be very careful in assessing an attack and would
make sure a cyberattack on Ukraine \-- shutting off electricity, say \--
that accidentally spilled over into Poland or Romania is not construed
as an attack on those countries. He also said it\'s intentionally
unclear what kind of cyberattack would rise to the level of invoking
Article 5.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Miscalculations causing conflicts in cyber security is extremely unrealistic 

[[Council on Foreign Relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, May 20,
20**[[15]{.underline}]{.mark}**,**
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/preventing-conflict-cyberspace-triggered-miscalculation>

[[To remedy the risk of conflict stemming from ambiguity in cyberspace,
Brake recommends a series of preventive and mitigating policy
recommendations, including: Congress should pass legislation that
facilitates real-time information sharing within and between the private
and public sectors. The White House should issue warnings to adversaries
of the potential consequences of violating cyberspace
norms,]{.underline}]{.mark} **such as "adjustments to network traffic,
criminal sanctions, diplomatic condemnation, and U.S. Treasury
actions."** [[Congress should create a Department of State Bureau of
Internet and Cyberspace Affairs,]{.underline}]{.mark} **which would
demonstrate that the United States gives as much weight to diplomatic
policy options as it does military ones**[[. It should also make the
National Security Agency director a Senate-confirmed position eligible
for civilians. Missions other than intelligence should be shifted to
other appropriate entities, including U.S. Cyber Command and the
combatant commands. "When possible and appropriate, defense officials
should highlight U.S. involvement in offensive cyber operations against
states, terrorist groups, and other illicit actors to fortify the
credibility of U.S. retaliatory capacity among potential
adversaries."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Supply chain security is already improving to stop future attacks

**Ernie** [[Hayden]{.underline}]{.mark}**, November
20**[[18]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Ernest N. Hayden (Ernie), CISSP, GICSP

critical infrastructure protection/cybersecurity with
Verizon.**<https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-supply-chain-security-has-evolved-over-two-decades>

[[After a six-year wait, new emphasis on supply chain security arose
first with the U.S. National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security,
a bill signed by then-President Barack Obama. This strategy emphasized
that earlier efforts were still important, but that there needed to be a
new focus on cybersecurity in the supply chain. Later work in 2012 and
2015 continued to expand on the concept of physical and cyber supply
chain security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Such guidance included \"NIST IR
7622: Notional Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal
Information Systems,\" and \"NIST SP 800-161: Supply Chain Risk
Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and
Organizations.\" NIST IR 7622 offers some suggested guidelines and
\"\... repeatable and commercially reasonable supply chain assurance
methods \... and visibility throughout the supply chain.\" NIST SP
800-161 covers the concepts from NIST IR 7622, but it includes more
specific guidance for U.S. federal agencies to follow to identify,
assess and mitigate information and communications technology (ICT)
supply chain risks. In parallel with the release of NIST SP 800-161**[[,
the Utilities Telecom Council published cybersecurity supply chain
guidance specifically for electric utilities in its document \"Cyber
Supply Chain Risk Management for Utilities \-- Roadmap for
Implementation.\" This report offered ideas and approaches for electric
utilities to organize and approach cyber suppliers and minimize
cybersecurity risks.]{.mark}]{.underline} **This emphasis on supply
chain cybersecurity is not unique to the U.S. The European Union Agency
for Network and Information Security (ENISA) published its own overview
of ICT supply chain risks in August 2015. ENISA\'s summary of the
concern is well-stated:** [[Governments, corporations, organizations,
and consumers are increasingly reliant on ICT products and services, and
thus on the supply chains that deliver them. As a result of this
reliance threats to supply chains have attracted more attention,
including the threat of intentional tampering during
development,]{.underline}]{.mark} **distribution or operations, or the
threat of substitution with counterfeit (including cloned or
overproduced) components before or during delivery, and attacks against
the economy through the supply chain.**

#### Russia does not care about US cyber security, only Ukraine's

cybersecurity policy at The Fletcher School at Tufts University,
https://time.com/6153902/russia-major-cyber-attacks-invasion-ukraine/

[[In the relatively short and rapidly evolving history of cyber
conflict, perhaps nothing has been established with greater certainty
and more widely accepted than the idea that Russia has significant cyber
capabilities and isn't afraid to use them---especially on
Ukraine.]{.mark} [In 2015, Russian government hackers breached the
Ukrainian power grid, leading to widespread outages. In 2017, Russia
deployed the notorious NotPetya malware via Ukrainian accounting
software and the virus quickly spread across the globe costing
businesses billions of dollars in damage and
disruption]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the months that followed the
NotPetya attacks, many people speculated that Ukraine served as a sort
of "testing ground" for Russia's cyberwar capabilities and that those
capabilities were only growing in their sophistication and reach. [[As
tensions escalated between Russia and Ukraine, many people were
expecting the conflict to have significant cyber components---the United
States Department of Homeland Security even issued a warning to
businesses to be on high alert for Russian cyberattacks, as did the
U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre. What is surprising is that---so
far, at least---the devastating Russian cyberattacks everyone has been
expecting have yet to materialize.]{.mark}]{.underline} There's no
guarantee, of course, that a large-scale cyberattack on Ukraine's
electrical grid or global banks or anything else isn't just around the
corner. Russia has proven time and again that it has few compunctions
about targeting critical infrastructure and causing considerable
collateral damage through acts of cyber aggression. [[But as the
invasion continues with few signs of any sophisticated cyber conflict,
it seems less and less likely that Russia has significant cyber
capabilities in reserve, ready to deploy if needed. Instead, it begins
to look like Russia's much vaunted cyber capabilities have been
neglected in recent years, in favor of developing less expensive, less
effective cyber weapons that cause less widespread damage and are
considerably easier to contain and defend against.]{.underline}]{.mark}

# IMPERIALISM DA

### NON-UNIQUE

#### NATO only supports cyber security concerns for the Allies

[[Alongside Nato's multilateral efforts to tackle the cyberthreat,
individual allies are boosting their own cyber systems. We saw, for
example, how some nations, not least the UK, successfully used
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} within the Global Coalition to Defeat the
Islamic State (IS). It was able to suppress IS propaganda, disrupt their
recruitment of foreign fighters, and degrade their ability to
co-ordinate attacks[[. By strengthening their cyberdefence capabilities,
improving their legal and institutional frameworks, and increasing
resources---both people and money---devoted to confronting cyberthreats,
allies have reduced the vulnerability of their networks and
infrastructures.]{.mark}]{.underline} As a result, we are tackling
increasingly complex cyberthreats faster and more efficiently, and we
are all more aware of---and resilient to---attacks. This was
demonstrated last October, when authorities in the Netherlands, with the
help of British experts, foiled an attack by Russia on the Organisation
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague. We must remain
vigilant and prepared for whatever lies ahead of us in cyberspace[[. For
this, we must work ever more closely together and leverage our unique
network of allies, partner countries and
organisations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### The American private cyber sector is currently being supported by the FBI

Christopher [[Wray]{.underline}]{.mark}, March 22,
20[[22]{.underline}]{.mark}, speech by the Director of Federal Bureau of
Investigation,https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/fbi-partnering-with-private-sector-to-counter-the-cyber-threat-032222

But what I want to emphasize today is that we're not doing all this
alone. [[We learned important lessons from 9/11 and the ongoing fight
against terrorism and we've applied those lessons to everything else we
do. Just as we expanded our Joint Terrorism Task Forces to many more
cities after 9/11, we've now set up Cyber Task Forces in all of our 56
FBI Field Offices across the country, so, if you ever call for help,
you're going to get a whole team with specialized expertise to help you
and with jurisdiction to go after any cyber bad
actor.]{.underline}]{.mark} That's at every FBI field office. The
biggest difference between the model we built to fight terrorism and the
way we battle cyber threats is the importance of the private sector[[.
Private networks, whether they belong to a pipeline operator, some other
kind of victim, or an Internet service provider, are most often the
place we confront adversaries. We share information with the private
sector whenever we can through one-on-one outreach, though cyber threat
bulletins, and through our many partnerships,]{.mark}]{.underline} like
with the 627 Fortune-1000 companies who belong to DSAC, our Domestic
Security Alliance Council, and the more-than-70,000 professionals in our
InfraGard program---all of whom are focused on protecting critical U.S.
infrastructure. We may not always be able to tell you how we know what
we know, but we can get you what you need to protect yourself. Russia
will not attack over cyber security efforts by NATO

#### No nuke war over cyber security 

[[Center for European Policy Analysis,]{.underline}]{.mark} March 30,

https://cepa.org/russia-wont-play-the-cyber-card-yet/

[[The lingering threat of offensive cyber operations is one of Putin's
very last cards --- together with nukes. There is no rational reason
that Putin\'s Russia would play this without some reasonable prospect of
geopolitical gain.]{.underline}]{.mark} The use of cyber capabilities
exposes techniques and programs to potential enemies and opens up the
attacker to countermeasures[[. A failure would add to the disastrous
debacle of Russia's joint conventional military operations, and leave
the country with very little to demonstrate its supposed superpower
status beyond weapons of mass destruction.]{.mark} [Russia has reached
an operational stalemate in its invasion of Ukraine, but unleashing its
advanced cyber capabilities at this stage against Western targets will
not win the war. Such attacks will only increase the support for Ukraine
without bringing Russia any tangible battlefield advantage. It would
also open the Kremlin to counter-attack by Western cyber
agencies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[President Joe Biden has been presented with a menu of options for the
U.S. to carry out massive cyberattacks designed to disrupt Russia's
ability to sustain its military operations in

Western intelligence official and another person briefed on the matter
say no final decisions have been made, but they [[say U.S. intelligence
and military cyber warriors are proposing the use of American
cyberweapons on a scale never before contemplated. Among the options:
disrupting internet connectivity across Russia, shutting off electric
power, and tampering with railroad switches to hamper Russia's ability
to resupply its forces]{.underline}]{.mark}, three of the sources said.
[["You could do everything from slow the trains down to have them fall
off the tracks,"]{.mark}]{.underline} one person briefed on the matter
said. The sources said the options presented include pre-emptive
responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, irrespective of whether
Russian launches its own cyberattacks on the U.S. in retaliation for
sanctions. [[They said most of the potential cyberattacks under
consideration are designed to disrupt but not destroy, and therefore
fall short of an act of war by the United States against Russia. They
say the idea is to harm networks, not people.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Officials are debating the legal authorities under which the attacks
would take place --- whether they would be covert action or clandestine
military activity. Either way, the U.S. would not publicly acknowledge
carrying out the operations, the sources say. [[U.S. Cyber Command, the
National Security Agency, the CIA and other agencies would have a role
to play in the operations,]{.underline}]{.mark} the sources said. [["Our
response will be harsh and measured, but not so severe as to encourage
Putin to take more drastic steps,"]{.underline}]{.mark} one U.S.
official said.

### IMPACT TURN

\*These next few cards work together. Since the U.S. is the only country
with no cyber regulations they are the best option to fight imperialism
under. If the U.S. were to give up their spot in digital imperialism
another country, with stronger regulations, would take over making it
harder to fight against the system.

media published in the country is heavily censored and influenced by the
government. Both also shut down messaging apps from abroad, forcing
residents to use ones that have been made (and are likely controlled)
within the country, e.g. WeChat in China. Not only does WeChat have no
form of end-to-end encryption, the app also has backdoors that enable
third parties to access messages.]{.mark}]{.underline} Iran (10/11):

equipment that allows authorities to circumvent providers and
automatically block content the government has banned and reroute

promptly block access to the websites on the list maintained by the
federal government's informational system, which includes a regularly
updated list of officially banned sites.

#### China is not a real threat

[[CATO Institute]{.underline}]{.mark},May 18,

[[Policymakers increasingly view China's rapidly growing wealth as a
threat.]{.mark}]{.underline} China currently ranks second, or perhaps
even first, in the world in gross domestic product (although 78th in per
capita GDP), and the fear is that China will acquire military prowess
commensurate with its wealth and feel impelled to carry out undesirable
military adventures. [[However, even if it continues to rise, China does
not present much of a security threat to the United States. China does
not harbor Hitler‐​style ambitions of extensive conquest, and the Chinese
government depends on the world economy for development and the
consequent acquiescence of the Chinese people. Armed conflict would be
extremely---even overwhelmingly---costly to the
country]{.underline}]{.mark} and, in particular, to the regime in
charge. Indeed, there is a danger of making China into a threat by
treating it as such and by engaging in so‐​called balancing efforts
against it[[. Rather than rising to anything that could be conceived to
be "dominance," China could decline into substantial economic
stagnation. It faces many problems, including endemic (and perhaps
intractable) corruption, environmental devastation, slowing growth, a
rapidly aging population, enormous overproduction, increasing debt, and
restive minorities in its west and in Hong Kong]{.underline}]{.mark}. At
a time when it should be liberalizing its economy, Xi Jinping's China
increasingly restricts speech and privileges control by the antiquated
and kleptocratic Communist Party over economic growth. And entrenched
elites are well placed to block reform.

effort are questions of economic and financial capacity. [[Military
conflict and competition put great economic strain on a nation or power,

immense financial resources and standing. The alliance does not need to

## [AT: Demographics]{.underline}

#### Despite a demographic shift, the US must preserve democracy by strengthening its efforts against cyber threats -- this restores trust in the election process

**Rosenberg, 20 \--** Rosenberg, S. (2020, January 16). *How Putin won
the fight to undermine trust in U.S. elections*. Axios. Retrieved June
20, 2022, from
https://www.axios.com/2020/01/16/putin-russia-undermine-trust-us-elections

[If Russia\'s goal in meddling in U.S. elections has been to undermine
trust in the democratic process, **it has already won**]{.underline} ---
and the U.S. isn\'t even starting to take the sort of steps that might
reverse that outcome. Why it matters: [Free, fair, and trusted elections
are the cornerstone of the U.S.\'s claim to moral
authority]{.underline}. We\'re only beginning to fathom how badly
Vladimir Putin has wounded the American system. The big picture: [While
the U.S. government and industry has focused on defending against
cybersecurity threats to election processes and voting machines, Russia
has exploited our political divisions]{.underline} --- and a U.S.
president uninterested in stopping it --- to sow doubt in American
fundamentals. In the 2016 election, [Russian information operations,
modeled on previous interference in nations like Ukraine and the Baltic
states, hacked the Democratic candidate\'s campaign and relied on
professional manipulators, gullible Americans and bots to spread
propaganda]{.underline}. The operations, and Russia\'s responsibility
for them, have been widely confirmed by U.S. intelligence and
exhaustively documented by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence
Committee and the Mueller investigation. [\"The goal was to mess with
us, so that no matter who becomes president, the United States is harder
to govern, and that over the long run, [democracy becomes harder to
sustain](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/11/795599906/digital-threats-on-2020-elections)]{.underline},\"
media scholar Siva Vaidhyanathan told NPR. There were many calls for a
9/11-style response to the 2016 attack, but President Trump has viewed
efforts to investigate and defend against Russia\'s threat as direct
challenges to the legitimacy of his own election win. [After 2016,
Democrats argued that Putin succeeded in helping Trump to the White
House. Republicans
[argued](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/12/it-appears-putin-may-have-written-democrats-talking-points-impeachment/)
in turn that Democrats who continued to talk about Russian interference
were themselves helping Putin by undermining trust in
elections]{.underline}. The winner all around? Putin. Whether the
Russian operations actually swayed votes doesn\'t matter. That Americans
are fighting over the question does. What they\'re saying: A
C-SPAN/Ipsos survey last October found that barely half of Americans
believe the 2020 elections would be [conducted openly and
fairly](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/cspan-election-process).
It\'s not all Putin\'s fault. The reasons for the distrust go beyond
Russia\'s interference: Many Democrats feel that manipulative
redistricting and the Electoral College dilute the impact of their
votes, particularly those of urban and minority voters. The last two
times Republicans took the White House from Democrats, in 2016 and 2000,
they did so while losing the popular vote. Republicans, meanwhile, have
long argued that Democrats frequently engage in voter fraud, though
actual evidence of such crimes remains slim to nonexistent. What\'s
next: It may be too late to try to protect trust in U.S. elections and
time to start thinking about rebuilding it from the ground up. That
might be an impossible project for a Trump administration that has shown
little interest in it --- and that large parts of the electorate blame
for the problem. It would be a tough undertaking, too, for a potential
new Democratic administration in 2021, which would inevitably be blamed
by unhappy Trump voters for a range of misbehavior, real or imagined.
The bottom line: [Russia set off an information bomb in 2016 that cannot
be un-exploded. Putin\'s master strategy has been effective, and it\'s
extremely difficult to counter]{.underline}.

##  CyberAttacks Can Lead to War -- Deterrence 

#### Cyberattacks should be considered acts of war as they can result in mis/use of nuclear weapons. NATO cooperation will aid in deterrence

**Lonergan et al, 4/21 \--** Lonergan, E., & Yarhi-Milo, K. (2022, April
21). *Cyber signaling and nuclear deterrence: Implications for the
ukraine crisis*. War on the Rocks. Retrieved June 20, 2022, from
https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/cyber-signaling-and-nuclear-deterrence-implications-for-the-ukraine-crisis/

From its opening moments, the conflict in Ukraine has involved a nuclear
dimension. On Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin ominously
[warned](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russia-launches-attacks-ukraine-as-putin-warns-countries-who-interfere-consequences-you-have-never-seen)
of "consequences you have never seen" if other countries tried to get
involved in Ukraine --- an implied nuclear threat. Several days later,
[Putin announced that Russia's [nuclear
forces](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/us/politics/putin-nuclear-alert-biden-deescalation.html)
would be put on a "special combat readiness" status. More
[recently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/14/russia-baltic-nuclear-deployment-finland-sweden-nato/),
Dmitry Medvedev, a senior Russian official, warned that if Finland and
Sweden join NATO, "there can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status
for the Baltic."]{.underline} So far, the Biden administration has
attempted to
[dismiss](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/02/28/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-february-28-2022/)
Russia's announcement as irresponsible saber-rattling. But as Putin
continues issuing nuclear threats, policymakers are likely to feel
growing pressure to respond. In particular, they may be tempted to find
ways to signal to Russia to deter the use of nuclear weapons. One way
this might be done is through cyber operations. In fact, some cyber
experts are already calling for the United States to consider cyber
attacks for signaling purposes. For example,
[writing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/15/us-russia-cyber-attacks/)
in the Washington Post, [Dmitri Alperovitch and Samuel Charap call on
the Biden administration to consider a cyber "shock-and-awe
demonstration" in response to a major Russian cyber attack against the
West. They claim that such a response, which could include disrupting
the Internet throughout Russia, would signal U.S. resolve and help
prevent further escalation that they fear "**could result in nuclear
war**." However, conducting cyber operations to signal deterrence would,
paradoxically, increase [risks of
escalation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-07/biggest-cyber-risk-ukraine).
This risk is not just hypothetical, especially in light of Russia's
updated
[declaratory](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/06/02/new-russian-policy-allows-use-of-atomic-weapons-against-non-nuclear-strike/)
policy for the first use of nuclear weapons, which may include responses
to cyber attacks]{.underline}. Russia has reinforced this message during
the war in Ukraine. In early March, a hacking group affiliated with
Anonymous
[claimed](https://twitter.com/YourAnonTV/status/1498792639877074945)
that it had shut down the control center of Russia's space agency. While
denying that the attack took place, Russia nevertheless warned that a
cyber attack against its
[satellites](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-space-agency-head-says-satellite-hacking-would-justify-war-report-2022-03-02/)
would be a justification for
[war](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/02/russia-space-chief-hacking-satellites-war-00013211).
The Biden administration should clearly communicate that cyber
operations for nuclear signaling are out of bounds, just as it declared
restraint in other aspects of this conflict, like the deployment of
American troops to Ukraine. How Cyberspace Is Creating Nuclear Risks
Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
command and control. The practitioner community has largely focused on
U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. [Scholars, in turn, worry
about how cyber operations could have unintended escalatory
consequences. But less attention has been paid to another likely
scenario: the use of cyber operations for signaling purposes (operations
with visible effects that aim to convey a message to another state) in a
nuclear context. The ambiguity of cyber operations can sometimes be
useful for signaling --- but the same ambiguity can be dangerous during
a nuclear crisis.]{.underline} The problem is that civilian leaders in
particular, distinct from the military, are inclined to see cyber
attacks as effective signaling tools. [Cyber operations could have
nuclear implications, especially because modern nuclear command and
control systems, like those in Russia and the United States, are
becoming increasingly
[dependent](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/USNuclearModernization)
on digital infrastructure. Nuclear command, control, and communications
systems, which include early warning, information collection, and
communications capabilities, alert decision-makers to impending nuclear
strikes and also enable leaders to control decisions about nuclear use
(or non-use]{.underline}).

## [CyberSecurity key to solve algorithm problems]{.underline}

#### Algorithms are overloaded with fake information. The Russian Internet Research Agency has planted trolls who promote fake news since the 2016 election

**CITS, 18 --** Center for Information, Technology & Society. (2018,
August). *How is Fake News Spread? Bots, People like You, Trolls, and
Microtargeting*. Center for Information Technology and Society - UC
Santa Barbara. Retrieved June 20, 2022, from
https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/spread

Trolls and the Propagation of Fake News [Trolls]{.underline}, in this
context, are humans who hold accounts on social media platforms, more or
less for one purpose: To generate comments that argue with people,
insult and name-call other users and public figures, try to undermine
the credibility of ideas they don't like, and to intimidate individuals
who post those ideas. And they [support and advocate for fake news
stories that they're ideologically aligned with. They're often pretty
nasty in their comments. And that gets other, normal users, to be nasty,
too. The Russian Internet Research Agency---the one that produced a lot
of fake news to try to affect the US election---has been supporting
trolls, for years]{.underline}. [They had their own agents create social
media accounts long before the campaign season, who made their social
media profiles look like typical Americans:]{.underline} They chose
American names, put photos and descriptions of themselves (and their
fake families) online, and they liked things and joined discussion
groups. They issued innocuous messages for a time. They made friends and
followers. They more or less infiltrated American social media space and
lay low, until election season. [Then they rolled out the nastiness,
supported fake news, and fostered disbelief in real news stories. This
is all very well documented in Congressional investigations and
indictments handed down by Robert Mueller's investigation into possible
2016 election improprieties by Russia]{.underline} \[1\]. Not all trolls
are Russian plants. We have our own home-grown variety, too \[2\]. We
know less about them since what they do isn't illegal, and they haven't
been formally investigated.

## [AT Consensus issues]{.underline}

#### NATO has no issues reaching consensus and promotes democracy within itself

**Skaluba et al, 3/2 \--** Skaluba, C., & Rodihan, C. (2022, March 2).
*No consensus? no problem. why NATO is still effective.* Atlantic
Council. Retrieved June 20, 2022, from
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/no-consensus-no-problem-why-nato-is-still-effective/

Critics of the alliance (and even some supporters) [have interpreted
NATO's
unwillingness](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/474047-the-problems-plaguing-nato)
to militarily support Ukraine---especially during the most significant
challenge to the European security order since the Cold War---as an
indicator of its declining relevance, timidity, or its divisions. But
that overstates the importance of political consensus to NATO's value
and understates its role as an effective and flexible defensive
alliance. This is a role with potentially critical benefits for Ukraine.
First, it sets too high a bar for an alliance of thirty members with
aligned, but distinct, priorities. [Unanimity on every issue is
impossible, let alone one as complex as military support to Ukraine.
Debate and disagreement, as it should be for any democratic institution,
are built-in features of NATO---not bugs. In reality, it's astounding
how often NATO does reach consensus about [issues big and
small](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_185000.htm), creating an
unrealistic expectation that it always will. The opposite of consensus
is not failure. Suggesting otherwise turns any debate that doesn't end
harmoniously into an indictment of NATO, playing straight into Russian
propaganda]{.underline}. [Second, a belief that NATO's value is tied
primarily to achieving consensus on every issue misses the more mundane
(and important) ways it supports its allies and partners. Its [affinity
for
process](https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/praise-natos-dysfunctional-bureaucratic-tedium/)---particularly
its ability to build a common situational understanding among its
members---is an invaluable tool. Habits of consultation and information
sharing, buttressed by deep cooperation on operations, intelligence
sharing, defense planning, and interoperability, create the foundation
upon which any consensus is to be built]{.underline}. Even in the
absence of that agreement, the ability to collectively define threats
and jointly train to confront them is immensely valuable in its own
right. Third, these habits of cooperation give NATO members the
flexibility to act outside of the Alliance's frameworks. [While NATO
does much by consensus]{.underline}---such as its [missions in the
Baltic
states](https://lc.nato.int/operations/enhanced-forward-presence-efp)---[the
skills it helps members develop is central to enabling them to form
separate coalitions for action. This happened recently with [ample
success](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/part-3-future-anti-isis-coalition)
in taking on the Islamic State. Such flexibility should be a point in
NATO's favor, not evidence of its ineptitude.]{.underline} In the case
of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find more attractive
alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression outside of the
auspices of the Alliance. Up to and including its recent dialogue with
Russia, it has taken a host of consensus actions to support
Ukraine---from [condemning Kremlin
aggression](https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/praise-natos-dysfunctional-bureaucratic-tedium/)
and [standing up for
Kyiv](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_190292.htm)
politically to [reaffirming its open-door
policy](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_190666.htm) with an
expectation that Ukraine will eventually become a member. It might even
[share intelligence and develop training and advisory
programs](https://www.ft.com/content/1336c9be-f1c9-4545-9f85-3b07fcb746d6)
for the Ukrainian military. And while it won't find a consensus to
fight, it could provide the foundation for certain allies to support
Ukrainian forces in ways consistent with their national priorities
outside of NATO. In that case, NATO's enabling value to its members in
complicating Putin's cost-benefit assessment should be applauded. Last
week's NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working in
lockstep and finding political consensus in responding to preposterous
Russian demands. NATO should always strive for this degree of consensus.
But if and when this crisis intensifies, and Putin advances further into
Ukraine, expectations for NATO assistance will be raised, decisions
about how to respond will become more difficult, and consensus will be
more elusive. Despite the rhetoric we might hear in response, this is
not evidence of NATO's ineffectiveness---but rather a reflection of how
democratic institutions function. And even absent consensus, NATO can
still contribute invaluably to Ukraine's sovereignty.

[[As President Biden intensifies sanctions against Russia in response to
the invasion of Ukraine, experts warn that cyberattacks against public
and private targets in the United States are a possibility. The
Department of Homeland Security this week warned U.S. organizations to
be prepaBCred for a]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[cyberattack,]{.underline}]{.mark} though DHS Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas said there is no "specific credible cyber threat" against the
U.S. homeland. [[Officials in the U.K. issued a similar
warning]{.underline}]{.mark}. Government and banking sites in Ukraine
are believed to have already been hit by Russian digital attacks.
Exactly what form any hacks in the U.S. may take remains to be seen: CNN
reports that the [[FBI warned local governments and companies to be on
the watch for ransomware. Ransomware attacks, like the one that crippled
the Colonial Pipeline last year---causing sporadic gasoline
shortages---are typically launched by independent hackers in Russia
trying to make money, not by government agents. But ransomware groups
typically operate with some tacit approval from the regime of Vladimir
Putin, and the Russian government may be more tolerant of hacks on major
Western targets if tensions continue to ramp up.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Since so much infrastructure is tied to networked computers that can be
deliberately or unintentionally targeted by ransomware, such attacks in
the past have disrupted everything from the fuel pipeline to shipping to
schools and hospitals. [[Even attacks on Ukrainian targets could
unintentionally spread malware to computers in the U.S. and other
countries as happened with the NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017, which
chiefly targeted Ukrainian computers but caused havoc around the
world.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### [Russia is the U.S. biggest threat in cyber security]{.underline} 

[[The Heritage Foundation]{.underline}]{.mark},

<https://www.heritage.org/cybersecurity/heritage-explains/the-growing-threat-cyberattacks>

[[No threat facing America has grown as fast, or in a manner as
difficult to understand, as the danger from
cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the cyber threats to U.S.
interests are real, the digital sky is not falling. As such, the U.S.
must do more to secure its networks---but first, it must do no harm.
[[While prior Administrations have taken some steps to improve the
overall security of the nation's networks, it has not been enough. Add
to this the constantly changing threats and vulnerabilities in the cyber
domain, and the U.S. remains unprepared.]{.underline}]{.mark} There have
been several legislative fights over cyber bills. While some have
characterized these as partisan battles that have left America exposed
to a growing variety of cyber threats, this is not generally true. Many
cyber bills have had bipartisan support as well as bipartisan
opposition. The fight is not over a need for appropriate cyber
legislation; the fight is over how to define "appropriate." One of the
main points of contention is the degree to which federal regulatory
powers should play a role in cybersecurity. Many seem to think
reflexively that this 19th-century solution is the answer. Those with a
little more understanding of the dynamic and fast-moving nature of cyber
threats see regulation as far too slow and clumsy, and recognize that it
might actually hinder security by building a culture of mere compliance
with regulations and a false sense of security against enemies who are
agile, motivated, and clever. [[In terms of the threats the U.S. faces,
nation-state hackers are the most serious. Russia presents the most
sophisticated cyber threat, with China as a close second. The U.S. has
implicated Russia in efforts to hack U.S. political entities such as the
Democratic National Committee. Russian hackers are also believed to be
behind multiple cyberattacks that took down portions of Ukraine's
electric grid.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Cyberattacks and espionage are costly to the U.S. and global economy.
Cyber breaches are projected to cost the global economy \$2.1 trillion
by 2019, more than quadrupling the cost since 2015.]{.mark}]{.underline}
IBM's 2016 Cyber Security Intelligence Index says that health care,
financial services, and manufacturing are the top three sectors targeted
by hackers due to of the vast quantity of personal information and
potential monetary gain that exist in those fields[[. Multiple firms
project that by 2020, 30 billion devices will be connected to the
"Internet of things," a huge growth in devices that connects ever more
of daily life to the Web.]{.mark}]{.underline} The cyber-insurance
industry is already estimated to be worth well over \$3 billion, and
will provide a market mechanism for quantifying cyber risks and
encouraging companies to improve their security.

### INTERNAL LINKS

#### The U.S. is using cyber security to expand their foreign oversight

[[A simplistic analysis of the current situation of tensions between
privacy and security]{.underline}]{.mark} (the prevalent narrative in
media) [[will probably state the following: States are spying on
national and foreign citizens and the trend will only increase as they
acquire cheaper technologies, proportional to their military and
technological power.]{.underline}]{.mark} The private sector does it
too, but not with inherently bad intentions or political purposes. What
the private sector is concerned about is the "experience" of the user
and the maximum capture of their data and how to offer the best products
and services. Collateral damage, such as the abuse of Facebook data, by
companies like Cambridge Analytica, is the exception to the rule.[[2 As
for the people, they are not really concerned about their government
spying on them. They are somewhat concerned about private sector
surveillance, but they are willing to allow it, especially if that
enables them to enjoy "free" services or improve their overall
experience.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is despite the fact that privacy
awareness is gradually increasing and rules are slightly improving in
some regions, especially in Europe for example after the entering into
force of the General Data Protection Directive (GDPR), patching a broken
system of systemic privacy erosion and data extractivism.

#### The United States is imperialist already in cyber space, the AFF would make it worse

After tracing the doctrinal origins of the interpretation of "respect
for sovereignty" as a primary rule of international law, the subsequent
sections examine three broad trajectories among states' attitudes toward
the status of sovereignty in cyberspace under international law.
[[Before addressing the legal opinions of the growing number of states
that have endorsed the "sovereignty-as-rule" position, I investigate two
categories of states that, for political-ideological reasons, conceive
cyberspace in ways fundamentally irreconcilable with this emerging
consensus: "cyber imperialism," embodied by the U.S. and its closest
allies, and "cyber-Westphalia," as represented by China, Russia, and
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}.
