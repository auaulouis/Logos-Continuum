# China DA

**Summary:**

The China Disadvantage argues that currently, in the status quo, NATO is
reviewing its strategic priorities and realizing that China could pose a
bigger threat than they previously realized. China is advancing its
economy and modernizing its military at an extremely fast rate. We've
seen growth like this before with Russia, however, we ignored it and
allowed Russia to poke holes in the alliances. The DA argues that
learning from our mistakes sounds great and is exactly what NATO needs,
but the Affirmative will ruin that plan. By enacting the Affirmative,
necessary attention and resources is taken away from the new NATO
strategy to focus on China. Once that happens, China will continue to
grow and get stronger which ultimately poses a huge threat to NATO.
Chinese expansion will essentially scare other countries into making
moves for power and advancements, causing great power wars.

**Strategy Guide:**

This disadvantage is an example of a common debate argument called a
"trade-off" disadvantage. When arguing a "trade-off", you are saying
that by doing one thing, we sacrifice something else that was possibly
more important. In this case by doing the aff, we sacrifice or 'trade'
the new strategy of focusing resources on China.

When using this file, it's important to remember that after the 1nc, you
cannot just read straight down, card after card. You must listen and
flow the 2ac, so that you know what arguments are important for you to
emphasize and what cards to use in response. So once you listen to the
2ac, think about what they've said and search through the cards in the
'Extensions' and 'Answers' sections and decide which cards answer the
arguments best as well as extend your arguments efficiently.

**Argument Breakdown:**

Uniqueness: NATO is currently focusing on China because their power is
rising very fast

Link: The Affirmative plan takes necessary NATO focus away from China in
order to enact the plan

Internal Link: This trade off gives China more space to grow and plot
plans to divide NATO

Impact: Chinese expansion creates major wars

#### Uniqueness -- NATO's learning from its mistakes with Russia, shifting resources to focus on China in the newest strategy 

**Mahashie 21' (Abraham, [Defense Writer Washington Examiner,
06/15)]{.underline}**
<https://news.yahoo.com/nato-pivots-toward-china-seeks-181700482.html?fr=yhssrp_catchall>

**[[NATO's new strategic concept]{.underline}]{.mark}** will incorporate
the threat from China in a way that **[[seeks]{.mark} [to learn from
failures to counter Russia's influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, security
analysts told the Washington Examiner, noting China is watching Russia's
techniques to drive wedges and weaken the alliance. NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday that a 2010
alliance strategy document that spoke of Russia in terms of a "strategic
partnership" needs to be scrapped as Russia continues hybrid warfare on
the eastern flank. Likewise, **[[the new framework must
address]{.underline}]{.mark}** how the 30 countries should view **[[an
emerging threat posed by China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "**[[We need
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** engage with China, but we also need to
**[[take into account the challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russia or
**[[China poses to our alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Stoltenberg
told reporters on a Zoom call after the NATO ministerial wrapped up
Monday. **[[The warning is especially vital, considering how the
alliance failed to fend off Russian aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that created protracted conflicts in Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and
Armenia, some of whom aspired to greater proximity with Europe and
membership in the defense alliance. Russia's resulting military and
intelligence creep positioned assets within 200 miles of NATO shores.
Security experts say **[[China is watching to see how, or if, allies
will take a firmer stance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[Meanwhile]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[China uses its economic power
to better position itself militarily]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Europe.

#### Chinas technological advancements are unmatched and a growing suspicion to NATO

**NATO 21'**(06/14 National Atlantic Treaty Organization
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_185000.htm>)

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** does not compare to the direct threat
that Russia poses but **[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** nevertheless
**[[appeared on NATO's strategic radar as an economic great power with a
high-tech edge that Russia is unlikely to ever
match]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Chinese 5G network provider Huawei remains
a pertinent topic for NATO, as several European countries, including
Germany, Austria, Spain, the Netherlands and Hungary, are still
undecided about relying on its potentially compromised technology or de
facto allowing their national operators to use Chinese providers.
Moreover, **[[Chinese investments in]{.underline}]{.mark}** continental
**[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** without conditionalities attached and
targeting critical infrastructure (railway stations, ports and airports)
**[[raise suspicions about]{.mark} Beijing's [underlying political and
military motives]{.mark}. [Moreover, China is pressing ahead with
military applications]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.mark}**), and its space ambitions are growing.

#### Link - The pacing gap prevents tech innovation like the aff and the maintenance of international relations at the same time, NATO diplomacy could be thrown off balance by weighing tech regulation against international disputes

**Haar 18'** (Flemming, The Strategy Bridge, 9/16
https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2018/8/16/resistance-to-innovation-in-nato)

In the 1940s, the German psychologist Kurt Lewin was the first to
introduce a systemic understanding of the resistance phenomenon. The
cause, according to Lewin, is not found in the mind of the individual
employee, but in the dynamics of opposing forces, including the behavior
of leadership. According to the political economist Josef Schumpeter,
"Innovation is the creation of new combinations that represent a
departure from established practices." In other words, a [technological
tension between the need to innovate and the desire to maintain order
and stability will always exist.]{.mark} Wendell Wallach nicely defines
the problem as "the pacing gap" between the introduction of a new
technology and the establishment of laws, regulations, and oversight
mechanisms for shaping its safe development. Wallach believes that
modern technological innovation is occurring at an unprecedented pace,
making it harder than ever to govern using traditional legal and
regulatory mechanisms. [If the allies are not careful, domestic
contentions and international disputes over trade and technology
regulation could consume their political energy, breaking the promise of
transatlantic renewal before it has even begun]{.mark}. To stave off
this dim prospect, NATO is embarking on a strategy of transatlantic
renewal, the centerpiece of which will be a new Strategic Concept---its
first in a decade. NATO's current Strategic Concept dates back to 2010
and reflects NATO's thinking on how to cope with the divisive nature of
the War on Terror, and it is inadequate for a changed world of great
power rivalry.

#### Internal Link - Continuing to have a wide and shallow focus will prove fatal as the rising power of China coerce to break NATO

**Haar 18'** (Flemming, The Strategy Bridge, 9/16
https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2018/8/16/resistance-to-innovation-in-nato)

[A focused]{.mark} (narrow and deep) [approach to a renewed Strategic
Concept would serve NATO better than a broadened agenda]{.mark} because
it highlights what NATO does best---collective defense---and in a
complex security environment, it forces decision-makers to think through
the defense implications of political choices like enlargement. NATO can
and should address any theme and any geography that impacts its
collective defense interests and capacity; it should avoid chasing
alliance legitimacy and relevance by labeling a range of national
security issues as "core tasks. "Continuing to go wide will bring NATO
into conflict with the range of domestic reforms as well as the
political-economic rationale of a strengthened EU. [Russia and China are
the two strategic actors that have a capacity to break NATO by
strategies of coercion.]{.mark} [NATO allies,]{.mark} by fighting long
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and intervening in Libya and Syria, [have
offered these competitors ample opportunity to adapt to Western military
strengths and political\
weaknesses]{.mark}.29 [Were NATO to]{.mark} label these countries
threats and challenges, which it has, and then [wander off in many
policy directions]{.mark}, which it may, [it would embolden these
competitors further and erode NATO's own resolve and reputation]{.mark}.
This challenge lies at the heart of a new Strategic Concept for NATO.

#### **Impact- China expansionism creates World War III, Cold War 2.0, and proxy wars**

**Veriek 20' (Sim, 06/15,**
<https://asiatimes.com/2020/06/three-pathways-to-war-between-the-us-and-china/>[)]{.underline}

According to the theory of international relations, the world is
constantly in a state of anarchy and countries always seek a balance of
power to maintain their own security. **[[With China's rise, the US and
its allies fear losing the equilibrium that supports American domination
of the global order. Considering China a "revisionist state," they have
raised concerns about Beijing's unchecked attempt to change the status
quo, to pursue military expansionism and follow a path toward
hegemony.]{.underline}]{.mark}** From geo-strategic flashpoints in the
South China Sea to Taiwan, to trade wars and technological wars, the
likelihood of confrontations seems inevitable. That raises a simple
question. **[Will war between the US and China result from the current
tension?]{.underline}** If so, what form of war will that be? If history
is any indication, three speculations can be made for war between the US
and China: **[[World War III, Cold War 2.0, and regional proxy
wars.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[World War III would be the most
extreme.]{.underline}** When China is considered a security threat and
that seeks hegemony through military expansionism, should one consider
it as equivalent to Germany and Japan during the two World Wars? Has
China invaded and occupied any countries? Has China pursued imperialist
colonialism? Has it committed a mass atrocity, or is it a terrorist
state? Similarly, if war is to happen between the two superpowers, then
what might trigger the United States' involvement? Events like the
attack on Pearl Harbor? **[The second form of war is Cold War 2.0, which
is being hotly debated as the closest to the current
realities.]{.underline}** But this time it is not about ideologies,
space war or nuclear brinkmanship. **[[It is more about a trade war,
currency war, technological war, cyber war or even hybrid war that
combines elements of some or all of these.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Competition for the domination of multilateral frameworks is one of the
possible fronts of Cold War 2.0, which has gradually divided nations
along this polarity if it truly exists -- **[for instance, the
competition between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indo-Pacific
Strategy.]{.underline}** But if Cold War 2.0 does exist, it would be a
limited version of Cold War 1.0 with fewer fronts and features owing to
China's reluctance to take global leadership on every front as the
former Soviet Union tried to do vis-à-vis the US. Using the word
"competition" on multilateral frameworks is not totally right either,
because while China is increasing its contribution to the multilateral
system, the share is still low compared with the US. It would not
constitute a competition either if the US is withdrawing from every
multilateral system that it helped build after World War II. **[[Modern
China in fact has benefited from the system created by the domination of
the US, and it has yet to create any global governance system, either
politically or economically.]{.underline}]{.mark}** China has not tried
or at least has not been seen as attempting to impose or spread its own
system. Thus far, no country has proclaimed that it is adopting China's
governance system. **[[The next possible type of war is a regional proxy
war in the Asia-Pacific, which is the main platform of competition
between the US and China.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Like in Cold War 1.0,
the US-China rivalry could result in "hot wars" between peripheral
states. Regional flashpoints such as the South China Sea and Taiwan
could ignite such hot wars. For the Mekong region, the likelihood of
Vietnam War 2.0 cannot be ruled out while China and Vietnam keep
confronting each other in the South China Sea. Cambodia used to be a
sideshow of Vietnam War 1.0.

"relevant to the challenges posed by the rise of China."He said that
applies not only to Europe, NATO's traditional focus, but also to
challenges in the Asia Pacific, where "the rise of China just makes it
even more important that Europe and North America stand together in
NATO."

policies present challenges to alliance security,]{.mark}" Stoltenberg
said at the post-summit press conference. "[Leaders agreed that we need

#### China expanding its power rapidly and aggressively, putting NATO on high alert

**Xi 21'** (Jai, 10/22, VOA News Reporter
<https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-s-new-focus-reflects-china-s-rise-/6282496.html>)

As [China expands its influence globally in a more aggressive manner,
NATO's concern about China's rise has grown.]{.mark} In a joint
communiqué in June, [NATO leaders accused China of rapidly expanding its
nuclear arsenal and]{.mark} being opaque in [implementing its military
modernization]{.mark}. "China's stated ambitions and assertive behavior
present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and
to areas relevant to alliance security," the communiqué said. Dan
Hamilton, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University\'s SAIS Foreign
Policy Institute and director of the postdoctoral program on "The United
States, Europe, and World Order," told VOA Mandarin that the 27
countries in the European Union are feeling China's presence in the
region. [China is the EU's No. 1 trading partner and the source of
billions of dollars per year in direct investment]{.mark}, particularly
in energy, according to a recent VOA Mandarin report. Beijing's
relations vary from one EU nation to the next, with east-central
European nations such as Hungary and Serbia eager to engage while
Western European countries are more skeptical.

#### NATO pivot focus on China is vital to security for the future

**Xi 21' ( Jie,** Reporter for VOA News 10/22)
<https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-s-new-focus-reflects-china-s-rise-/6282496.html>

In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Stoltenberg said that
**[[countering the security threat from the rise of China will be an
important part of NATO's future rationale]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "NATO
is an alliance of North America and Europe. But this region faces global
challenges: terrorism, cyber, but also the rise of China. So when it
comes to strengthening our collective defense, that's also about how to
address the rise of China," Stoltenberg told the Financial Times. "What
we can predict is that the rise of China will impact our security. It
already has." He pointed out that **[[China has had an impact on
European security through its cyber capabilities, new technologies and
long-range missiles.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Bruce Jones, director and a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank,
said Stoltenberg's remarks revealed an important shift of the military
alliance. "It\'s an important shift of NATO inside NATO," he told VOA
Mandarin in a phone interview. "There\'s been a debate about whether
NATO should concentrate on Russia, Europe, or whether it should be part
of a wider American reorientation towards China." He added that the
statement from the secretary-general is "a signal about the direction
that he is going to go and that he has some support for changing the
orientation." Stoltenberg said **[[NATO will adopt a new strategic
concept]{.underline}]{.mark}** next summer[**[, which
wil]{.underline}**l]{.mark} outline the group's strategies for the next
10 years. The current 2010 version does not mention China. In an
interview with Politico earlier this month, Stoltenberg also stressed
that NATO needs to **[[strengthen its engagement with
China.]{.underline}]{.mark}** "We don\'t regard China as an adversary or
an enemy," he said. "We need to engage with China on important issues
such as climate change --- there\'s no way to reduce emissions enough in
the world without also including China."

#### NATO Expanding its Technology With China in its Sights

**Wright 21'** (Ann,
03/29,https://truthout.org/articles/in-alarmist-turn-nato-is-increasingly-positioning-itself-in-opposition-to-china/)

During the March 23-24 meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) council, Anthony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state,
**[[encouraged NATO members to join the U.S. in viewing China as an
economic and security threat to the U.S. as well as to NATO countries,
thereby expanding NATO's areas of focus to include the
Pacific.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This is a dangerous move that must be
challenged. To gain insight into what transpired at the March NATO
meeting, we can look to a roadmap for NATO's future, which was released
last fall. The report, entitled [["]{.underline}*NATO 2030: United for a
New
Era*](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/12/pdf/201201-Reflection-Group-Final-Report-Uni.pdf),"
is intended to be a guide for the military alliance in meeting the
challenges it will face in the next decade. This new proposed roadmap
for NATO reflects an alarming expansion: **[[It is as much about China
and the Asia/Pacific region as it is about NATO's traditional area of
operations and concern, Europe and Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Although the group identified the No. 1 threat to NATO as Russia, China
was named as threat number 2. Secretary of State Blinken, in his address
on **[March 24 to NATO members, strongly rebuked China and urged NATO
allies to join with the U.S. in this adversarial
position.]{.underline}** Blinken said the U.S. wouldn't force its
European allies into an "*us-or-them choice*," but he then implied the
opposite, **[[emphasizing that Washington views China as an economic and
security threat, particularly in technology, to NATO allies in
Europe.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "*When one of us is coerced, we should
respond as allies and work together to reduce our vulnerability by
ensuring our economies are more integrated with each other*," Blinken
said. Stoltenberg nevertheless continued to spell out specific reasons
NATO agrees with the U.S.: **[["The rise of China has direct
consequences to our security.... So, one of the challenges we face as we
now have this forward looking process with NATO 2030 is how to
strengthen and how to work more closely together as allies, responding
to the rise of China."]{.underline}]{.mark}** NATO's concerns about
Chinese military expansion include the construction of **[nine naval
bases]{.underline}** on atolls in the South China Sea and **[an
increasing number of ships: China now has the largest navy in the world,
with 350 ships and submarines, including over 130 ships. In comparison,
the U.S. Navy has 293 ships as of early 2020, but U.S. naval ships have
substantially more firepower than Chinese Navy ships.]{.underline}** At
the March meeting, NATO members spoke frequently about China's
increasingly global military footprint, including the development of an
overseas base in Djibouti, which now [["]{.underline}*hosts*[" military
bases]{.underline}](https://medium.com/@LongTwentiethCentury/why-are-there-so-many-military-bases-in-djibouti-f8c579e961d5)
of the United States, France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Japan and
China. China also has several smaller bases around the world, including
**[in the province of Neuquén, Patagonia, Argentina, on land loaned to
the Chinese government during Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's
presidency]{.underline}**. [[China claims the land is for space
exploration]{.underline}](https://www.rionegro.com.ar/nacion-respaldo-la-continuidad-de-la-base-china-en-neuquen-1260148/)
and intelligence services**[.]{.underline}** The Chinese government also
has a **[[naval [electronic intelligence facility on the Great Coco

China has a total of **[[13 military bases

#### NATO wants to set AI standards. If only its members agreed on the basics.

(Melissa, 03/29,
https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/)

**[Big differences over how to treat autonomous weapons could undermine
NATO's drive.]{.underline}** On paper, NATO is the ideal organization to
go about setting standards for military applications of artificial
intelligence. But the widely divergent priorities and budgets of its 30
members could get in the way. [[The Western military alliance has
identified artificial intelligence as a key technology needed to
maintain an edge over adversaries, and it wants to lead the way in
establishing common ground rules for its use.]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[\"I\'m \... not sure that they\'re having the same debates on
principles of responsible use or they\'re definitely not applying our
democratic values to these technologies," he said.]{.underline}**
Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll out the world\'s first
binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is seeking closer collaboration
with Washington to oversee emerging technologies, **including artificial
intelligence.** **[[The alliance\'s own AI strategy, to be released
before the summer, will identify ways to operate AI systems responsibly,
identify military applications for the technology, and provide a
"platform for allies to test their AI to see whether it\'s up to NATO
standards,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** van Weel said. ***["If an adversary
would use autonomous AI powered systems in a way that is not compatible
with our values and morals, it would still have defense implications
because we would need to defend and deter against those
systems,"]{.underline}*** Van Weel said. The problem is that NATO\'s
members are at very different stages when it comes to thinking about AI
in the military context. *[The U.S., the world\'s biggest military
spender, has prioritized the use of AI in the defense realm. But in
Europe, most countries --- France and the Netherlands excepting ---
barely mention the technology's defense and military implications in
their national AI strategies.]{.mark}* The U.S., which tends to be light
on regulation and keen on defense, sees things differently. There are
also divergences over what technologies the alliance ought to develop,
including lethal autonomous weapons systems --- **often dubbed "killer
robots" --- programmed to identify and destroy targets without human
control.** *[These weapons systems have also faced fierce public
opposition from civil society and human rights groups, including from
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who in 2018]{.mark}
called for a ban.* *[\"I think there's a certain danger that if NATO
doesn't take this on as a real challenge, that it may be marginalized by
other such efforts,"]{.underline}* Franke said. She pointed to the
U.S.-led AI Partnership for Defense, which consists of 13 countries from
Europe and Asia to collaborate on AI use in the military context --- a
forum which could supplant NATO as the standard-setting body. **[[That

#### Danger of Emerging Technologies Dividing NATO

**Walsh 13'** (Eddie, 9/16,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/danger-of-emerging-technologies-dividing-nato/)

Converging technologies also pose fundamental human security challenges.
**[As Francis Fukuyama once argued in [[Our Posthuman Future:
Consequences of the Biotechnology
Revolution]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Posthuman-Future-Consequences-Biotechnology/dp/0312421710),
converging technologies could]{.mark} inequitably [transform the world
we live in and, in the process, undermine the very foundations that
underpin liberal democracies]{.mark}**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark} Whether
or not such a future unfolds, it is clear that their application raises
**[[serious ethical and moral issues]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are
proving divisive for allies and enemies alike (eg: the debates over
armed drones and cyber espionage). If NATO member states want to sustain
**["the traditional transatlantic compact \[European political support
in return for US military guarantees\]", they must change the way NATO
approaches cooperative security around emerging technologies. And, they
need to do it now.]{.underline}** First and foremost, NATO needs to
[[substantially increase its investment in its Emerging Security
Challenges Division (ESCD).]{.underline}]{.mark} This division should be
provided the resources necessary to properly investigate the net
security implications of converging technologies. It also must be
granted the agency to pursue independent assessments of the security
impacts posed by emerging technologies. [[This requires a mandate to
conduct its research at arm's length from NATO member states to ensure
that its reports are not subject to their political
meddling.]{.underline}]{.mark} If this cannot be achieved within the
institution, then NATO should consider transforming ESCD into an
independent institution (eg: the role that UNIDIR plays in the United
Nations). **[NATO also needs to ensure that all member states possess
equal agency to call upon the ESCD to prepare reports on particular
emerging technology issues of concern. This would be similar to the
agency provided to US Congress members to call upon [Congressional
Research Services](https://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/).]{.underline}**
Separately, the [NATO Parliamentary Assembly](http://www.nato-pa.int/)
needs to be **held accountable for failing in its duty to address the
serious threat posed by emerging technologies.** To date, there have
been [far too few committee
reports](http://www.nato-pa.int/Default.asp?SHORTCUT=677) designed to

#### War spirals into Proxy wars

The bombing was said to be one of the major triggers of the
consolidation of the Khmer Rouge's power and the genocide that followed.
While other parts of Southeast Asia remained peaceful, half of the
Mekong region experienced prolonged bloodshed during the Cold War until
the late 1990s when the civil war finally came to an end in Cambodia in
1998. It is true that China and the US do not want to confront each
other in any direct war. As for China and Vietnam, even if they
constantly confront each other in the South China Sea, they do not want
direct war either owing to the strong ties between the two Communist
parties and enormous trade relations. However, **[one cannot ignore the
fact that these two countries did experience multiple wars between each
other after World War II, including a brief and bloody battle in 1974
over the [Paracel
Islands](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-flash-war-74-china-vietnams-south-china-sea-showdown-15540).]{.underline}**
**[[Even if the US and China themselves do not want direct war, proxy
wars could re-emerge, and small states would pay the price, as was the
case during the Vietnam War.]{.underline}]{.mark}** These are the three
speculations of possible types of wars between China and the US.
Onlookers like Cambodia and other peripheral states can divide
themselves in the new polarity at their own risk. **[[Like in the
previous Cold War, silence and neutrality would not be an option. Few
policy options would be left for small states. Like it or not, these few
options often present risks to their sovereignty and
independence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Countries can stay safe and secure
only if they can learn from history, which can be horrifying, cruel and
bloody, at least in the case of Cambodia, because Cold Wars are only
cold for the superpowers.

#### No Alt Cause -- NATO is strong and united right now, China is the only thing that can cause a rift but standing together against them in the squo will draw NATO closer, the aff tears them apart

**[King 19']{.underline}** **(Ian, 11/27,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-nato-stronger-ever-100482>)**

**[[Some suggest communist China is a greater challenge to U.S.
supremacy. China's rise is a story of rags to riches. Today, the country
draws its strength from its new status as a manufacturing superpower,
making it the only rival to the economic supremacy of the United
States]{.mark}.]{.underline}** There is no doubting the connection
between economic strength and the power to influence world events. After
all, it was a head start in the industrial revolution which enabled the
British empire to thrive, and a similar leap in U.S. manufacturing which
helped the United States to win out in the twentieth century. [But the
challenge from both China and Russia is not primarily economic. It is to
the system of rules and international norms, carefully developed over
several decades, under U.S. leadership, which underpins peace and
prosperity in the world. Through their illegal annexation of Crimea,
their shameless assassinations on the streets of Berlin and Salisbury,
and their mischievous efforts to sow discord through disinformation,
Moscow is challenging that system. And China undermines it too---by
creating artificial islands to make artificial claims of sovereignty, by
stealing intellectual property, and through coercive economic
measures.]{.mark}

[The twenty-nine countries of the Western military alliance are now
responsible for 53 percent of global GDP. Half of that total is
American, but the other half comes from countries like the UK, France,
Germany, Spain and Italy. **[These non-U.S. NATO countries have a
combined GDP greater than China's and, if the United States is included,
more than twice as much.]{.underline}** NATO is already upholding the
rules-based international system in Europe. It has troops poised to
respond to a Russian incursion in the Baltics. It is fighting back
against Moscow's disinformation campaigns, and it is deterring further
Russian malfeasance against its neighbors. But NATO is more than that.
**[The Alliance is proof that once rival nations can come together to
defend principles and to defend each other. From the most populous
contributor, the United States, to the smallest, Iceland, all NATO
member states invoked the principle of collective defense after
9/11.]{.underline}** NATO---the most powerful military alliance ever
assembled---embodies the rules-based international system laid out by
the US following allied success in World War II. It is an alliance of
values as much as it is an alliance of armed forces.]{.mark}

[Signed into being on April 4, 1949, NATO is older than Russia's status
as a nuclear power and has been established longer than the communist
leadership of China. **[NATO does not seek world leadership---it is a
defensive alliance.]{.underline}** But it can lend moral authority to
the United States around the world and help protect U.S. interests
against the challenges posed by the other institutions that came into
being in 1949, such as nuclear-armed Russia and Communist China. **[Best
of all, NATO can underpin the rules and norms of the international
system far better than any one nation ever could. The United States
should not fear bequeathing its leadership role to a seventy-year-old
institution, which now dominates half the world economy, because that
institution is the NATO alliance it still leads.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

#### \-\-- Yes impact, US would overreact and exasperate a war along with China, ropes everyone else in and causes nuclear escalation Disrupting the balance between maintaining relations and new technology leads to nuke war

https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war/)**

**[The key to this model of deterrence is the maintenance of secure
second-strike capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear
attack and respond with a devastating counterattack. [Recently analysts
have begun to worry, however, that new strategic military technologies
may make it possible for a state to conduct a successful first strike on
an enemy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, Chinese colleagues have
complained to me in Track II dialogues that the United States may decide
to launch a sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear command
and control, essentially turning off China's nuclear forces. **[[Then,
Washington will follow up with a massive strike with conventional cruise
and hypersonic missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if
any Chinese forces happen to survive, the United States can simply mop
up China's ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile
defenses.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Would any US president truly decide to
launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack because he or she
thought s/he could get away with it? And why does it make sense for the
country in the inferior position, in this case China, to intentionally
start a nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose? **[[More
importantly, this conceptualization of how new technology affects
stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how new military
technologies might be used against nuclear forces
directly.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[New technologies threaten to create potentially destabilizing shifts
in the balance of power. For decades, stability in Europe and Asia has
been supported by US military power. In recent years, however, the
balance of power in Asia has begun to shift, as China has increased its
military capabilities.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The results of Russia's
military modernization have been on full display in its ongoing
intervention in Ukraine. And Russian President Vladimir Putin is
building new unmanned vehicles while ominously declaring, ***["Whoever
leads in AI will rule the world."]{.underline}*** **[[If China or Russia
are able to incorporate new technologies into their militaries before
the United States, then this could lead to the kind of rapid shift in
the balance of power that often causes war.]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And
if Putin thinks new tech has strengthened his hand, **[he may be more
tempted to launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a NATO
member.]{.underline}** **[[Either scenario could bring these nuclear
powers into direct conflict with the United States, and once nuclear
armed states are at war, there is an inherent risk of nuclear conflict
through [limited nuclear
war](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1962402?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

escalation](http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100559570&fa=author&person_id=428).]{.underline}]{.mark}**
This framing of the problem leads to a different set of policy
implications. The concern is not simply technologies that threaten to
undermine nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but, rather,
**[[any technologies that can result in a meaningful shift in the
broader balance of power.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[When it comes to new
technology, this means that the United States should seek to maintain an
innovation edge. Washington should also work with other states,
including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms control
and nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny these newer
and potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially hostile
states. [These are no easy tasks, but the consequences of Washington
losing the race for technological superiority to its autocratic
challengers just might mean nuclear Armageddon.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
