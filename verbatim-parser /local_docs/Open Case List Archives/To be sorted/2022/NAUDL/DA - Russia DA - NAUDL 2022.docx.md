## Introduction

Welcome to the Russia Disadvantage Evidence Set. In here, you'll find
all the research you'll need to construct a winning disadvantage
argument in the Novice Division and beyond on the negative for the
novice affirmatives on this year's topic: AI technology and
cybersecurity.

We've organized this evidence into a few different categories:

> •1NC: This section of the file includes the cards that should be read
> on the negative in the first negative constructive. These cards should
> be read in addition to other case arguments that you may already be
> more familiar with
>
> •Negative Extensions: This section of the file includes arguments to
> bolster the claims you've made in the 1NC in later speeches in the
> debate, specifically the 2NC and 1NR.
>
> •Affirmative Answers: This section includes the cards the affirmative
> team will need in order to answer the Russia DA.

How to use this file:

The file is organized by side and the components of a disadvantage. You
will need to pick and choose which arguments you will make in a given
round after the 1NC. You will not have time to make all of these
arguments in any round.

> 1\. Read the summaries of each argument available in the packet.
>
> 2\. Check out the glossary to make sure you understand all of the
> words and terms.
>
> 3\. Read and highlight the evidence, making sure you understand the
> argument being made and pulling out the key parts of each piece of
> evidence.
>
> 4\. Pick the arguments you will use in the negative block and as the
> affirmative.

## Debating the Russia DA

The goal of the negative is simple: Prove that the plan presented by the
affirmative team is a bad idea. The more you focus on the plan and why
it is a bad idea, the more often you'll win debates. The Russia DA is
one way you can prove the affirmative is a bad idea. It argues that even
if the plan has some good effects it starts a chain reaction that
changes how Russia will react and that causes bad impacts.

Speaking Roles on the Negative:

> •1^st^ Negative Speaker: Your job is to introduce a range of negative
> arguments in the 1NC, and to definitively win at least one of those
> arguments in the 1NR.
>
> •2^nd^ Negative Speaker: Your job is to expand upon one or two
> arguments made in the 1NC, then to choose the best argument made by
> the negative team and show why the negative should win the debate in
> the 2NR. You are in charge of choosing negative strategy, since you'll
> have to explain it in the 2NR. \*NOTE: In the block decide who will
> take the DA and only address those arguments in the 2NC or the 1NR.
> The other speaker can take the case arguments. This is the best way to
> divide labor in the block.\*

## Topic Introduction Russia DA

The Russia disadvantage argues that NATO increasing their AI and
cybersecurity technology is dangerous as it sends the wrong message to
Russia. Russia is strongly opposed to the expansion of NATO, including
their AI and cybersecurity developments, as they believe the
organization poses a threat to their security. Therefore, if NATO
increases cooperation within AI and cybersecurity, Russia will feel
threatened and develop their own technology. As a result, NATO and
Russia will enter an arms race which will create high tensions, increase
the risk of miscalculation, and lead to nuclear war.

**Strategic Overview**:

To win the DA you will need to win that the risk of Russia developing
their own AI and cybersecurity technology in response to the perceived
threat of NATO expanding their AI and cybersecurity capabilities is more
important than the impacts the affirmative claims. You will also need to
win that the affirmative uniquely causes this change, and that it would
not occur otherwise.

Debating the DA as the negative and affirmative:

When putting together your 1NC block, you'll want to read the argument
straight down. This will start a new flow sheet for the DA so you don't
need to worry about lining these arguments up with anything.

The 2AC will then number their responses straight down to set the order
for the flow in the debate. For example:

> 1\. Non-unique \<insert card\>
>
> 2\. No link \<insert card/analytic\>
>
> 3\. No link \<insert card/analytic\>
>
> 4\. No internal link \<insert card/analytic\>
>
> 5\. No impact \<insert card/analytic\>
>
> 6\. Our impact outweighs \<insert card/analytic\>

\*Note: While some of these arguments can be analysis you will want a
healthy mix of cards in the debate, particularly for claims that will
need more expertise or proof.

The block then answers the 2AC. Either the 2NC or the 1NR will be
responsible for winning the DA. They will answer those arguments using
line by line and the "they say/we say" method:

"They say non-unique however, that's not true because we say: \<insert
card/analytic\>"

They say →\<Insert argument\>

That's not true because →\<Restate your argument or read a new card to
answer their argument\>

Prefer our argument because →\<Explain why your argument is better\>

Consider the following questions:

> •How does Russia perceive NATO?
>
> •How would Russia react if they thought NATO was increasing their AI
> and cybersecurity capabilities?
>
> •How likely is the risk of miscalculation if tensions are high between
> Russia and NATO?
>
> •How should the judge evaluate the impacts of the aff and neg against
> each other?

## 1NC Summaries

1.  Uniqueness:

    a.  Tadjdeh, 2021: Russia is currently expanding its AI and cyber
        security technology by heavily investing within these sectors.

2.  Link:

    a.  Russia has a long history with NATO in which part of the reason
        for the organization's establishment was to combat former Soviet
        Union aggression. As a result, Russia views NATO as a threat to
        their security therefore being aggressive at any sign of NATO
        expanding its capabilities, including AI and cyber security
        technology.

    b.  The current AFF plan calls for further NATO cooperation within
        AI technology and cyber security which puts Russia on alert.
        Russia sees NATO's increasing ventures into AI and cyber
        security as a threat to their development within the field.
        Russia is afraid that NATO and its allies may bolster their
        capabilities to an extent in which Russia cannot compete.

    c.  Marijan, 2022: Consequently, Russia feels pressure to further
        engage in AI and cyber security advancements therefore creating
        an arms race in which both NATO countries and Russia are
        developing new AI technology. The issue with this new AI
        technology is that they are preliminary therefore at high risk
        for errors and miscalculation.

3.  Impact:

    a.  Fisher, 2022: If Russia perceives NATO expansion as a threat to
        their security, they are likely to use their emerging AI and
        cyber security technology which is a risk for miscalculation
        given the new nature and current conflict with Ukraine.

4.  Impact Scenario-Economic Collapse:

    a.  Bloomberg and Horobin, 2022: The global economy is extremely
        vulnerable right now given factors like COVID-19 and the
        Ukraine-Russia conflict. Therefore, any provocation from NATO
        that will make Russia more aggressive is dangerous as it has the
        potential to further disrupt the world's economy.

    b.  UNCTAD, 2022: A global economic collapse does not only affect
        the economy, but it has real human impacts. Given the current
        global climate, people in vulnerable countries risk facing food
        shortages, extreme debt, and blackouts if they are further
        burdened with a failing economy.

## 1 NC Russia Disadvantage Shell

#### Uniqueness: Russia is increasing AI and cyber security innovation. 

**Tadjdeh, 2021**, (Yasmin, N/A) "Algorithmic Warfare: Russia Expanding
Fleet of AI-Enabled Weapons". National Defense. 07/20.
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2021/7/20/russia-expanding-fleet-of-ai-enabled-weapons

[[Russia --- which has made no secret of its artificial intelligence
ambitions --- is building a cadre of AI-enabled, autonomous weapon
systems that could one day threaten the United States. "The Russian
military seeks to be a leader in weaponizing AI technology," Lt. Gen.
Michael Groen, director of the Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence
Center, told National Defense.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The JAIC --- which has been working to facilitate AI adoption across the
Defense Department since 2018 --- recently commissioned a report by CNA,
a research organization based in Arlington, Virginia, to examine
Russia's developments. The report --- titled "Artificial Intelligence
and Autonomy in Russia" --- identified more than 150 AI-enabled military
systems in various stages of development, Groen said in an email in
June. [[Key areas of interest include autonomous air, underwater,
surface and ground platforms.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The nation wants to
use AI for electronic warfare, intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance and strategic decision-making processes as leaders pursue
information dominance on the battlefield, Groen
said.]{.underline}]{.mark}

While Russia is not a leader in commercial and academic AI research ---
as the United States and China are --- it would be a grave mistake for
the Pentagon to take its eyes off the threat, he said. "Russia was not a
major leader in the development of the internet or computer networking,
but Russia has become a leader in weaponizing those technologies for
advanced cyberattacks and cybercrime capabilities," he noted. The
Russian military has taken significant steps to reform and improve the
organization of its research and development enterprise, he noted. This
was done in part because Moscow believed its previous structures were
stifling innovation in technology areas such as AI.

The scale of these reforms --- such as creating a new advanced R&D
organization modeled on the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency --- demonstrates the nation's seriousness about fielding
an AI-enabled fighting force, he said. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff Gen. John Hyten noted that Russia has invested enormous
resources into the development of artificial intelligence, big data and
software technologies. The country is moving quickly across many areas,
including nuclear weapons, space and cyber, he said during remarks at
the Defense Department's AI Symposium in June. Embedded in each of those
elements is new software, processing and artificial intelligence
systems.

[["Russia is a significant threat, especially in the near term," he
said. "It is a challenge to not just keep up with them but stay ahead of
them." Like the United States, Russia is working to digitize its
military.]{.underline}]{.mark} Its Ministry of Defense recently
announced it intends to create a specialized department to develop AI,
according to the CNA report. It is even working on developing a military
information sharing structure that resembles the Pentagon's joint
all-domain command and control, or JADC2, effort.

#### Link: If Russia perceives NATO as a huge threat, they are likely to engage in risky AI technology which is at high risk for errors leading to miscalculation.

**Marijan, 2022**, (Branka, Senior Researcher at Project Ploughshares),
"Beyond Ukraine: AI and the Next US-Russia Confrontation". Centre for
International Governance Innovation. 02/14.
<https://www.cigionline.org/articles/beyond-ukraine-ai-and-the-next-us-russia-confrontation/>

Two titans from the Cold War era seem set to go another round, this time
over the prospect of Ukraine's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), which the United States calls a sovereign Ukrainian
decision and Russia opposes vehemently. Whatever the outcome of the
current standoff, [[another confrontation between the United States and
Russia that merits closer attention is brewing --- one that may
fundamentally reshape the US-Russia security relationship in the
not-so-distant future.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Both states are heavily
committed to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in military systems
and operations, including logistics, command and control, and
intelligence collection and analysis, as well as to the development of
more autonomous weapons. As tensions rise, these countries are likely to
employ capabilities that are enhanced by AI and machine learning in
cyberattacks and misinformation and disinformation campaigns. Rising
political temperatures might well encourage fast-tracking of more
autonomous military systems as each side seeks to gain the
advantage.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The United States and Russia have already tested several autonomous
systems. Russia has made important advances on autonomous tanks, while
the United States has demonstrated a number of capabilities, including
swarming munitions, which have the ability to destroy a surface vessel
using a swarm of drones. At the moment, the United States is at the
forefront of the development of autonomous systems and military AI
applications. However, Russia has approached China to partner with it in
building its AI readiness, and such a partnership could be a game
changer. [[One crucial concern is that the growing autonomy and use of
AI in decision making in existing weapons platforms and in cyberspace
will result in the deployment of immature systems; the result could be
accidents that help to escalate conflict.]{.mark} [At the same time,
both Russia and the United States have prevented progress on new
international norms and agreements on the development and use of
autonomous systems that could help to avoid dangerous
situations.]{.mark}]{.underline} The United States and its allies are
developing norms on responsible military uses of AI, but little dialogue
with potential adversaries has taken place. And so, the competition
between the great powers is allowed to grow unchecked.

The United States and other NATO members are already bolstering
Ukrainian cyber defences in expectation of cyberattacks by Russia on
Ukraine's infrastructure, including its electrical grid, communication
systems and government departments. Yet Russia could use AI to overwhelm
Ukrainian systems in conjunction with misinformation and disinformation
campaigns, some of which might involve manufactured or manipulated
images or video, known as deepfakes. While cyber and misinformation
tactics are not new, AI and machine learning are offering novel ways to
engage in them. [[And, while Western media and analysts focus on Russian
cyber techniques, it is almost certainly true that the United States and
other NATO members are also pursuing some of these same tactics against
Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Impact: NATO intervention on Ukraine will escalate probability of nuclear retaliation from Russia suggested by former statements made by Putin.

**Fisher, 2022**. (Max, an international reporter and columnist for The
New York Times, March 16). As Russia Digs In, What's the Risk of Nuclear
War? 'It's Not Zero.' The New York Times.
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/world/europe/ukraine-russia-nuclear-war.html>

[[As Russia and NATO escalate their standoff over Ukraine, nuclear
strategists and former U.S. officials warn that there is
a]{.underline}]{.mark} remote but [[growing risk of]{.underline}]{.mark}
an unintended slide into direct conflict --- even, in some scenarios,
[[a nuclear exchange.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"The prospect of nuclear conflict," António Guterres, the United Nations
secretary general, warned this week, "is now back within the realm of
possibility."

[[Leaders on both sides emphasize that they consider such a war
unthinkable, even as they make preparations and issue declarations for
how they might carry it out. But the fear, experts stress, is not a
deliberate escalation to war, but a misunderstanding or a provocation
gone too far that, as each side scrambles to respond, spirals out of
control.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The war in Ukraine heightens these risks to a level not seen since the
Cuban Missile Crisis, and in some ways is potentially more dangerous
than that, some experts say.

[[NATO forces, intended as defensive, are massing near Russian borders
that, with much of Russia's military bogged down in Ukraine, are
unusually vulnerable. Increasingly paranoid Kremlin leaders, faced with
economic devastation and domestic unrest, may believe that a Western
plot to remove them is already underway.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Russia has said that it considers the weapons and other increased
military aid that Western governments are sending to Ukraine tantamount
to war, and has implied that it might strike NATO convoys. Over the
weekend, Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian base mere miles from Polish
territory.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Those are the things that make me really concerned about escalation
here," said Ulrich Kühn, a nuclear strategist at the University of
Hamburg in Germany. "The chance for nuclear weapons employment is
extremely low. But it's not zero. It's real, and it might even
increase," he said. "Those things could happen."

The Kremlin has turned to nuclear saber-rattling that may not be
entirely empty of threat. [[Russian war planners, obsessed with fears of
NATO invasion, have implied in recent policy documents and war games
that they may believe that Russia could turn back such a force through a
single nuclear strike]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a gambit that Soviet-era
leaders rejected as unthinkable.

[[The outcome of such a strike would be impossible to predict. A recent
Princeton University simulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, projecting out
each side's war plans and other indicators, [[estimated that
it]{.underline}]{.mark} would be likely to trigger a tit-for-tat
exchange that, in escalating to strategic weapons like intercontinental
missiles[[, could kill 34 million people within a few
hours.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## 1NC Impact Scenario: Economic Collapse

#### Global economy is weak and miscalculation could lead to economic collapse.

**Bloomberg and Horobin, 2022**, (William, NA), "Shock of War Threatens
Lasting Impact on Global Economy". Time. 06/08.
<https://time.com/6185394/global-economy-war/>

The world economy will pay a "hefty price" for the war in Ukraine
encompassing weaker growth, stronger inflation and potentially
long-lasting damage to supply chains, [[the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD)]{.underline}]{.mark} said. The
organization [[slashed its outlook for global growth this year to 3%
from the 4.5% it predicted in December and doubled its inflation
projection to nearly 9% for its 38 member
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to forecasts released on
Wednesday in Paris. [[In 2023, it expects growth to slow to
2.8%.]{.underline}]{.mark}The price of war could be "even higher," it
warned, describing a long list of risks ranging from an abrupt cut-off
of Russian supply in Europe to vulnerabilities on financial markets from
high debt and elevated asset prices. [["There have been several
significant changes in the global economic environment in recent months,
including the worldwide spread of the Omicron variant of Covid and the
greater-than-expected persistence of inflationary
pressures,"]{.underline}]{.mark} the organization said in its economic
outlook. [["The single greatest change, however, is the economic impact
of the war in Ukraine."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The gloomy assessment, which echoes a similar warning from the World
Bank, indicates a deeper and broader economic fallout from Russia's
invasion that will make it harder to set the right fiscal and monetary
policies.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is the first detailed view from the
OECD, which didn't issue full forecasts in April because of the
prevailing uncertainty. The early effects of surging prices have already
forced central banks to tighten monetary policy, with the US Federal
Reserve for example having just raised interest rates at a quickened
pace of 50 basis points last month. Meanwhile governments are rethinking
spending plans as they attempt to shelter households. While the OECD
said it's warranted for all monetary authorities to pare back stimulus,
it urged caution particularly in the euro area, where surging prices
mainly reflect supply pressures. "Central banks will have to conduct a
delicate balancing act between keeping inflation under control and
maintaining the post-pandemic economic rebound, especially where the
recovery is not yet complete," the organization said. Chief Economist
Laurence Boone, speaking to reporters in Paris, said that disruption to
the global economy could leave a lasting impact on investment. [["We had
a series of shocks, first the pandemic, then the war, and in some
countries the supply side of the economy has not fully recovered," she
said. "The longer this lasts, the longer global supply chains are
disrupted and the less there would be appetite for investment." The OECD
observed that inflation is hitting living standards and reducing
consumer spending across the globe, and business are becoming less
optimistic about future production. Crucially, that hit to confidence is
deterring investment, which in turn threatens to hurt supply "for years
to come,"]{.underline}]{.mark} it said. Still, the organization is
cautious about whether the global economy is on the brink of stagflation
despite similarities with the oil shock of the 1970s. Compared to that
time, major economies are less energy intensive, central banks have more
robust frameworks and independence, and consumers have a stock of excess
savings leftover from the Covid pandemic, it said. "Nonetheless, there
are clear risks that growth could slow more sharply than expected and
inflationary pressures could intensify further," the OECD said

#### Negative impact on global food supply, energy, and financial sector following effects of Russia-Ukraine conflict.

**UNCTAD, 2022**, (UNCTAD, the UN trade and development body. It
supports developing countries to access the benefits of a globalized
economy), "World on brink of "perfect storm" of crises, warns un chief
calling for immediate action to avert cascading impacts of war in
Ukraine". UNCTAD. 04/13.
https://unctad.org/press-material/world-brink-perfect-storm-crises-warns-un-chief-calling-immediate-action-avert

[[The war in Ukraine is setting in motion a three-dimensional crisis -
on food, energy and finance - that is producing alarming cascading
effects to a world economy already battered by COVID-19 and climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to the new findings of the Global
Crisis Response Group (GCRG). "We are now facing a perfect storm that
threatens to devastate the economies of developing countries," said UN
Secretary-General António Guterres. "The people of Ukraine cannot bear
the violence being inflicted on them. And the most vulnerable people
around the globe cannot become collateral damage in yet another disaster
for which they bear no responsibility." "Our world cannot afford this.
We need to act now," stressed the Secretary-General calling for urgent,
concrete and coordinated action to help countries and communities most
at risk avert the interlinked crises. "We can do something about this
three-dimensional crisis. We have the capacity to cushion the blow."

[[As two of the world's breadbaskets, Russia and Ukraine provide around
30% of the wheat and barley we consume. Russia remains the world's top
natural gas exporter, second-largest oil exporter and a significant
producer of fertilizers. The war has severely affected food, energy and
financial markets, sending commodity prices to soar record high. Global
economic growth is forecast to decrease by 1% in 2022. Preliminary
analysis suggests that as many as 1.7 billion people in 107 economies
are exposed to at least one of three risks, mostly in Africa, Asia and
the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. When combined with the
already devastating impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and climate change,
the exposure to just one risk is dire enough to cause debt distress,
food shortages and blackouts.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## 2NC/1NR Link- AI Technology

#### Russia vamping up AI technology in military sector amid concerns of US security threats. 

**Eversden, 2021**, (Andrew, American University Graduate, Congressional
Reporting Fellow for Texas Tribune), "A Warning to DoD: Russia advances
quicker than expected on AI, battlefield tech". C4ISRNET. 05/24.
<https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2021/05/24/a-warning-to-dod-russia-advances-quicker-than-expected-on-ai-battlefield-tech/>

WASHINGTON --- [[The Russian military is more technologically advanced
than the U.S. realized and is quickly developing artificial intelligence
capabilities to gain battlefield information
advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}, an expansive new report commissioned by
the Pentagon warned. [[The federally funded Center for Naval Analyses
examined the Kremlin's whole-of-government approach for artificial
intelligence development and found it is largely driven by the perceived
threat from the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}, combined with
lessons learned from its continuing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine about
what the future battlefield will look like, the report released Monday
said.

[[The Russian military has AI initiatives to improve command and control
and decision-making; early warning and air defense; and training,
logistics, maintenance and procurement --- from the tactical level to
the strategic planning level in Moscow.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Russian
government is using artificial intelligence to analyze changing
geopolitical events using data from previous global armed conflicts, the
report found. Operationally, its military is trying to link platforms
across different military branches to share information in order to "to
better coordinate forces and make faster decisions," similar to the
Pentagon's new joint war-fighting concept known as Joint All-Domain
Command and Control.

[[Russia perceives that the U.S. will sow domestic unrest in its country
by trying "to undermine Russian authorities and create instability
within Russia to foment political change, leading to a justification for
U.S. military action]{.underline}]{.mark}," the report read. [[That view
of how the U.S. could attack is driving technology investment in many
areas, including global event analysis.]{.underline}]{.mark} An air
assault from the United States is one of its biggest security fears for
the Kremlin, hence its investments in AI technologies for early-warning
systems and air defense. Its military strategists believe the processing
power of AI will allow air defense systems to more quickly monitor,
detect and respond to any aerial attack. [["Russia is trying to
understand what the Americans are up to or what the NATO is up to,"
Bendett said. "So NATO and the United States are very much in focus. And
a lot of the Russian efforts in AI, military autonomy are actually
geared towards how can they best counter the U.S. threat
perception."]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The story is similar for Russia's perception of the future of
autonomous weapons, another area where it's
investing.]{.underline}]{.mark} The CNA analysis found substantial
debate over the ethics and future of autonomous weapons and having a
human "in the loop" of the decision cycle. [[Russia's military views
completely autonomous weapons as an "inevitability" based on its
perceptions of U.S. and China that the systems will become fully
autonomous.]{.underline}]{.mark} "This is part of the overall Russian
security mindset about the United States ... that where we have an
advantage, we're just going to keep pushing," Edmonds said.

## 2NC/1NR Link- Cyber Security

#### The plan continues to push NATO expansion triggering US cyber security attacks from Russia.

The warning came as President Joe Biden sent additional weapons to
Ukrainian forces and reportedly weighed the option of sending thousands
of U.S. troops to the Baltic states bordering Russia over concerns that
Moscow was planning imminent military action against Ukraine. Kyiv has
defied the Kremlin\'s protests by seeking membership in the NATO Western
military alliance, something that Russian officials have said threatened
their country\'s national security. The bloc has expanded eastward since
the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago and has refused to rule
out including Ukraine as well.

#### Miscalculation risks triggering global nuclear conflict leading to mass death and extinction.

**Kallenborn, 2022**, (Zachary, Research Affiliate with the
Unconventional Weapons and Technology Division of the National
Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism
(START), Policy Fellow at the Schar School of Policy and Government),
"Giving an AI control of nuclear weapons: What could possibly go
wrong?". Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. 02/01.
<https://thebulletin.org/2022/02/giving-an-ai-control-of-nuclear-weapons-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/>

[[If artificial intelligences controlled nuclear weapons, all of us
could be dead. That is no exaggeration. In 1983, Soviet Air Defense
Forces Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov was monitoring nuclear early
warning systems, when the computer concluded with the highest confidence
that the United States had launched a nuclear war. But Petrov was
doubtful]{.underline}]{.mark}: The computer estimated only a handful of
nuclear weapons were incoming, when such a surprise attack would more
plausibly entail an overwhelming first strike. He also didn't trust the
new launch detection system, and the radar system didn't have
corroborative evidence[[. Petrov decided the message was a false
positive and did nothing. The computer was wrong; Petrov was right. The
false signals came from the early warning system mistaking the sun's
reflection off the clouds for missiles. But if Petrov had been a
machine, programmed to respond automatically when confidence was
sufficiently high, that error would have started a nuclear
war.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The huge problem with autonomous nuclear weapons, and really all
autonomous weapons, is error.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Machine
learning-based artificial intelligences---the current AI vogue---rely on
large amounts of data to perform a task.]{.underline}]{.mark} Google's
AlphaGo program beat the world's greatest human go players, experts at
the ancient Chinese game that's even more complex than chess, by playing
millions of games against itself to learn the game. For a constrained
game like Go, that worked well. But in the real world, data may be
biased or incomplete in all sorts of ways. For example, one hiring
algorithm concluded being named Jared and playing high school lacrosse
was the most reliable indicator of job performance, probably because it
picked up on human biases in the data.

[[In a nuclear weapons context, a government may have little data about
adversary military platforms; existing data may be structurally biased,
by, for example, relying on satellite imagery; or data may not account
for obvious, expected variations such as imagery in taken during foggy,
rainy, or overcast weather.The deeper challenge is high false positive
rates in predicting rare events]{.underline}]{.mark}. There have
thankfully been only two nuclear attacks in history. [[An autonomous
system designed to detect and retaliate against an incoming nuclear
weapon, even if highly accurate, will frequently exhibit false
positives.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In the extremely unlikely event those problems can all be solved,
autonomous nuclear weapons introduce new risks of error and
opportunities for bad actors to manipulate systems. Current AI is not
only brittle; it's easy to fool. A single pixel change is enough to
convince an AI a stealth bomber is a dog.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The
decision to unleash nuclear force is the single most significant
decision a leader can make. It commits a state to an existential
conflict with millions---if not billions---of lives in the balance. Such
a consequential, deeply human decision should never be made by a
computer.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Political and technological miscalculations can trigger nuclear war.

New York Times, March 16). As Russia Digs In, What's the Risk of Nuclear
War? 'It's Not Zero.' The New York Times.
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/world/europe/ukraine-russia-nuclear-war.html>

[["The escalation dynamics of a conflict between the U.S. and Russia
could easily spiral into a nuclear exchange," said Dmitry Gorenburg, an
analyst of Russian military policy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Partly this is because]{.underline}]{.mark}, unlike Cold War proxy
battles, [[Ukraine's war is raging in the heart of Europe, with NATO and
Russian forces massed a relatively short drive away from
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} and several Western capitals. [[Partly it is
because of Russia's lowered nuclear threshold and heightened sense of
vulnerability. But Moscow also seemingly believes that a sort of
NATO-Russia conflict has already begun.In these circumstances, Moscow
could misconstrue NATO's troop buildup, or steps of military support for
Ukraine, as preparations for just the sort of attack that Russian
nuclear policy is designed to meet.]{.mark}]{.underline} "Between
volunteers from NATO countries, all this NATO weaponry, reinforcement of
Poland and Romania," Mr. Charap said, "they might connect dots that we
didn't intend to be connected and decide they need to pre-empt."

[[In such a climate, a few mishaps or miscalculations --- say, an errant
strike or clumsy provocation by one side that sets off a
stronger-than-expected retaliation by the other --- could escalate, in
only a few steps, to the point of triggering Moscow's fears of an
attack.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Mr. Putin has already said that direct Western intervention in the
Ukraine war might trigger Russian nuclear retaliation. Now, each uptick
in Western support for Ukrainian forces tests those
limits.]{.underline}]{.mark} "Part of our problem is that I'm not sure
we have a clear sense of exactly where the lines are," Dr. Gorenburg
said, adding, "This is why we're seeing all the hemming and hawing back
and forth with the question of providing aircraft. There's just
uncertainty as to how the Russians would take that."

The truth is that even Mr. Putin may not know his nuclear red lines for
sure. But American fears of Russian nuclear escalation may be dangerous,
too. [[Any nuclear conflict, however initially limited, carries an
escalatory risk that strategists call "use it or lose it." Both sides
know that rapid nuclear strikes could wipe out their military forces in
Europe, even their entire nuclear arsenals, leaving them defenseless.
This means that both sides face an incentive to launch widely before the
other can do so first --- even if leaders believe that the conflict may
have begun in error.]{.mark}]{.underline} Recent advances in short-range
missile technology means that leaders now have as little as a few
minutes to decide whether or not to launch, drastically increasing the
pressure to launch quickly, widely and with only partial information
from the ground.

## 2NC/1NR Answers to Russian Aggression

#### NATO expansion triggers Russian aggression. 

**Bender, 2015**, (Jermy, BA in Middle Eastern Studies, Fulbright
Fellow), "This is the simplest explanation of why Putin is so opposed to
NATO". Business Insider. 02/12.
<https://www.businessinsider.com/simplest-explanation-of-why-putin-hates-nato-2015-2>

Putin\'s suspicion of NATO can be boiled down to one simple explanation:
geography. [[At the height of the Cold War and the Soviet Union\'s
power, the USSR and its allied Warsaw Pact countries encompassed half of
Europe and almost the entirety of Central Asia. But after the demise of
the USSR in 1989, lands once within Moscow\'s orbit quickly peeled away
to join NATO.]{.underline}]{.mark} Today, only Belarus remains firmly
within Moscow\'s influence, and even that partnership has teetered
recently. [[For Putin, the peeling away of countries from Russia towards
NATO comes as both an existential threat and a personal insult. As a
former agent in the KGB and an avowed nationalist, Putin has dreams of
resurrecting the glories of Imperial Russia --- a goal that is seriously
hampered by the inclusion of what Putin would deem rightful Russian
lands, such as the Baltics, into the NATO alliance. With this in mind,
it is easy to see why Putin signed off on Russia\'s new military
doctrine in December 2014. The doctrine, which placed explicit focus on
NATO being Moscow\'s main existential enemy and threat, called on the
further militarization of three geopolitical frontlines: the Russian
Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad near Poland, the annexed Crimean
Peninsula, and the Arctic.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Russia targets the United States in cyberattacks following sanctions in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

## 2NC/1NR Answers to NATO Necessary

#### NATO is not an effective force against Russian cyberattacks given limitations within Article 5.

**Lonergan & Moller, 2022**, (Erica is an assistant professor in the
Army Cyber Institute and a research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of
War and Peace Studies at Columbia University, Sara is a former
Eisenhower Fellow at the NATO Defense College), "NATO's Credibility Is
on the Line with its Cyber Defense Pledge. That's a Bad Idea.".
Politico. 04/27.
<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/27/nato-credibility-cyber-defense-pledge-russia-ukraine-00027829>

President Joe Biden has issued grave warnings that Russia might launch a
cyberattack against the United States in retaliation for the punishing
sanctions levied after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. He's advised
American companies to "accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"
and many officials expect an attack against critical U.S. infrastructure
to be inevitable.

[[One way Biden and other Western leaders are attempting to deter
potential Russian cyber retaliation during the Ukraine crisis is through
NATO's Article 5 collective defense pledge --- that an attack on one is
an attack against all.]{.underline}]{.mark} That's because since the
2014 NATO summit in Wales (which, coincidentally, took place following
another Russia-Ukraine crisis), the alliance has affirmed that Article 5
extends to cyberspace. In other words, a cyberattack against any NATO
member could conceivably represent an attack against the entire
alliance. The pledge is the embodiment of the allies' security guarantee
to each other and the beating heart of NATO.

[[After Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
confirmed that NATO policy on collective defense and cyberspace holds
strong, noting that NATO has "decided to make clear that a cyberattack
can trigger Article 5."]{.underline}]{.mark} And following an
extraordinary meeting of heads of state and government on March 24, the
alliance reinforced that it is "ready to impose costs on those who harm
us in cyberspace."

[[But despite this rhetoric, exactly how and when Article 5 applies to
cyberspace remains unclear. This ambiguity is a problem --- with
potentially disastrous consequences. Staking the credibility of Article
5 to what are often murky activities in cyberspace threatens to
undermine the broader principle of collective defense. We can't risk
fracturing the transatlantic alliance at a critical juncture in its
history over a debate on what constitutes a major or minor
cyberattack.]{.underline}]{.mark} For that reason, NATO should move
quickly to clarify its policy on cyberattacks and explicitly state the
threshold for what would trigger an Article 5 response. Furthermore,
NATO members should commit to treating cyberattacks that do not rise to
the level of a major attack as a national matter --- not one for the
alliance.

## 2NC/1NR Answers to No Miscalculation

#### Putin miscalculated threat of NATO expansion triggering war with Ukraine.

**Wright, 2022**, (Robin, Former correspondent for the Washington Post,
CBS News, the Los Angeles Times, and the Sunday Times of London,
Recipient of U.N. Correspondents Association Gold Medal), "Putin's
Historic Miscalculation May Make Him a War Criminal". The New Yorker.
02/24.
<https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putins-historic-miscalculation-may-make-him-a-war-criminal>

In the eyes of the world and almost certainly history, [[Vladimir
Putin's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday was an epic
miscalculation]{.underline}]{.mark}, drawing comparisons to Adolf Hitler
and Saddam Hussein for cold-blooded aggression that could challenge the
world order and change its borders. [[The Russian leader appeared almost
delusional in a pre-dawn speech from the Kremlin announcing a "special
military operation" to "protect" Donbas, the eastern region where
Russian-backed separatists have waged a war for eight years. Putin,
instead, immediately ordered Russian tanks into Ukraine and air strikes
on the capital and more than a dozen cities in a country of forty
million people.]{.mark}]{.underline} "Peace on our continent has been
shattered," the NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters.
"We now have war in Europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged
to history." Putin's "reckless" attack risks "countless innocent lives,"
Stoltenberg warned.

[[Putin's invasion is based on wild accusations]{.underline}]{.mark},
including a claim that he needed to "denazify" Ukraine, a country led by
President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is, in fact, Jewish. [[Putin vowed to
end the "humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime," when,
in fact, separatists backed by Russia have for years waged a war in
eastern Ukraine. Putin also claimed that the Kyiv government sought to
acquire nuclear weapons when, in fact, Ukraine, once the third-largest
nuclear power, denuclearized after the Soviet Union collapsed and it
became an independent country again]{.underline}]{.mark}. He described
the government in Kyiv as a "junta," even though it was democratically
elected in 2019. And Zelensky, in fact, won in a landslide with
seventy-three per cent of the vote, defeating thirty-eight others who
ran for President. In a plaintive final appeal, Zelensky spoke directly
to the Russian people, hours before the attack. "You are being told this
is a plan to free the people of Ukraine," Zelensky said, in an official
video in Russian. "But the Ukrainian people are free." He implored
Russian citizens to embrace peace. "Many of you have visited Ukraine.
Many of you have relatives here," he said. "You know our character, you
know our people, and you know our principles. You know what we value. .
. . Hear us."

[[Putin was, in fact, the one who sparked the crisis with an
erroneous---even fictional---claim that Ukraine would soon gain
membership in NATO. Joining the Western military alliance is an
aspirational goal for Ukraine, which it enshrined in a constitutional
amendment in 2019. But NATO's leadership has openly said that Ukraine
does not yet qualify for membership. It would have to introduce and
enact multiple reforms that may be years away.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Russia and China' strong relationship emboldens Putin to engage in risky AI technological warfare.

https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-s-new-focus-reflects-china-s-rise-/6282496.html

WASHINGTON ---China wasn't on the agenda at this week's NATO defense
ministers meeting, but by the time the gathering concluded, the
secretary-general had said the military alliance needs to respond to the
challenges presented by China's rise. "We see the whole global balance
of power is shifting because of the rise of China," Jens Stoltenberg
told reporters Thursday at a press conference in Brussels.

[[China is "heavily modernizing its military capabilities, including
advanced nuclear systems and long-range missile systems,\" and \"we see
China coming much closer to us, not least in cyberspace," he
said.]{.underline}]{.mark} And in response, the allies agreed "to do
more together.\" Without giving details, Stoltenberg said NATO would
cooperate on a strategy involving areas such as artificial intelligence
and technologically advanced weapon systems, "relevant to the challenges
posed by the rise of China." He said that applies not only to Europe,
NATO's traditional focus, but also to challenges in the Asia Pacific,
where "the rise of China just makes it even more important that Europe
and North America stand together in NATO." At their June meeting, the
allies had agreed to strengthen their relationships with partners in the
Asia Pacific, which include New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and
Japan.

"China is coming to us. It's about China being present in Europe as sort
of a power that includes investments in defense-related supply chain,
investments in ports," Hamilton said in a phone interview. [[In their
June joint communique, NATO leaders expressed concern over China's
military cooperation with Russia in the Euro-Atlantic
region.]{.underline}]{.mark} [["China and Russia are collaborating more
closely together, and that might affect the risk calculation each of
them might take with regards to Western interests," Hamilton
said."Russia might feel a bit more emboldened when it comes to issues
like Ukraine or Belarus or military exercises if it feels China is
supporting it," he added. "Similarly, China might feel it has Russian
support, then it might be able to be a bit more adventurous than
otherwise it would ordinarily be."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Russia is using killer drones in Ukraine conflict.

**Knight, 2022**, (Will, Former Senior Editor at MIT Technology Review,
Former Editor and Writer at New Scientist), "Russia\'s Killer Drone in
Ukraine Raises Fears About AI in Warfare". Wired. 03/17.
<https://www.wired.com/story/ai-drones-russia-ukraine/>

[[A RUSSIAN "SUICIDE drone" that boasts the ability to identify targets
using artificial intelligence has been spotted in images of the ongoing
invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} Photographs showing what
appears to be the KUB-BLA, a type of lethal drone known as a "loitering
munition" sold by ZALA Aero, a subsidiary of the Russian arms company
Kalashnikov, have appeared on Telegram and Twitter in recent days. The
pictures show damaged drones that appear to have either crashed or been
shot down. [[With a wingspan of 1.2 meters, the sleek white drone
resembles a small pilotless fighter jet. It is fired from a portable
launch, can travel up to 130 kilometers per hour for 30 minutes, and
deliberately crashes into a target, detonating a 3-kilo
explosive.]{.underline}]{.mark} ZALA Aero, which first demoed the
KUB-BLA at a Russian air show in 2019, claims in promotional material
that it features "intelligent detection and recognition of objects by
class and type in real time." The drone itself may do little to alter
the course of the war in Ukraine, as there is no evidence that Russia is
using them widely so far. But its appearance has sparked concern about
the potential for AI to take a greater role in making lethal decisions.

[["The notion of a killer robot---where you have artificial intelligence
fused with weapons---that technology is here, and it\'s being
used,]{.underline}]{.mark}" says Zachary Kallenborn, a research
affiliate with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and
Responses to Terrorism (START). [[Advances in AI have made it easier to
incorporate autonomy into weapons systems and have raised the prospect
that more capable systems could eventually decide for themselves who to
kill.]{.underline}]{.mark} A UN report published last year concluded
that a lethal drone with this capability may have been used in the
Libyan civil war. It is unclear if the drone may have been operated in
this way in Ukraine. One of the challenges with autonomous weapons may
prove to be the difficulty of determining when full autonomy is used in
a lethal context, Kallenborn says.

Despite such uncertainties, the issue of AI in weapons systems has
become contentious of late because the technology is rapidly finding its
way into many military systems, for example to help interpret input from
sensors. The US military maintains that a person should always make
lethal decisions, but the US also opposes a ban on the development of
such systems. [[To some, the appearance of the KUB-BLA shows that we are
on a slippery slope toward increasing use of AI in weapons that will
eventually remove humans from the equation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the military alliance
of 30 countries that border the North Atlantic Ocean, this week
announced that it would adopt an 18-point AI strategy and launch a
"future-proofing" fund with the goal of investing around \$1
billion.]{.underline}]{.mark} Military.com reports that U.S. Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin will join other NATO members in Brussels,
Belgium, the alliance's headquarters, to formally approve the plans over
two days of talks.

Speaking at a news conference, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said
that the effort was in response to "authoritarian regimes racing to
develop new technologies." NATO's AI strategy will cover areas including
data analysis, imagery, cyber defense, he added.

NATO said in a July press release that it was "currently finalizing" its
strategy on AI" and that principles of responsible use of AI in defense
will be "at the core" of the strategy. Speaking to Politico in March,
[[NATO assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges
David van Weel said that the strategy would identify ways to operate AI
systems ethically, pinpoint military applications for the technology,
and provide a "platform for allies to test their AI to see whether it's
up to NATO standards."]{.underline}]{.mark} van Weel said

[[In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) launched the AI
Partnership for Defense, which consists of 13 countries from Europe and
Asia to collaborate on AI use in the military context. More recently,
the department announced that it plans to invest \$874 million next year
in AI-related technologies as a part of the army's \$2.3 billion science
and technology research budget.]{.underline}]{.mark} Much of the DoD's
spending originates from the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC)
in Washington, D.C., a government organization exploring the use and
applications of AI in combat. (In news related to today's NATO
announcement, JAIC is expected to finalize its AI ethics guidelines by
the end of this month.) According to an analysis by Deltek, the DoD set
aside \$550 million of AI obligations awarded to the top ten contractors
and defense accounted for 37% of total AI spending by the U.S.
government, with contractors receiving the windfall.

#### Amid Russia-Ukraine conflict Russia considers AI development a priority, any sign of a NATO threat pushes Russia towards further AI innovation and use. 

**Kahn, 2022**, (Jermey, Former Technology Reporter and Senior Writer

International Herald Tribune, Newsweek, The Atlantic, Smithsonian, The
Boston Globe, and Portfolio), "A.I. is on the front lines of the war in
Ukraine". Fortune. 03/01.
<https://fortune.com/2022/03/01/russia-ukraine-invasion-war-a-i-artificial-intelligence/>

[[Meanwhile, the development of autonomous weapons has continued at a
quickening pace.]{.underline}]{.mark} Right now, those weapons are still
in their infancy. We won't see humanitarian groups' worst nightmares
about swarms of "slaughterbot" drones realized in the Ukraine conflict.
But weapons with some degree of autonomy are likely to be deployed by
both sides. Already, Ukraine has been using the Turkish-made TB2 drone,
which can take off, land, and cruise autonomously, although it still
relies on a human operator to decide when to drop the laser-guided bombs
it carries. (The drone can also use lasers to guide artillery strikes.)
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} meanwhile [[has a "kamikaze" drone with
some autonomous capabilities called the Lantset, which it reportedly
used in Syria and could use in Ukraine. The Lantset is technically a
"loitering munition" designed to attack tanks, vehicle columns, or troop
concentrations. Once launched, it circles a predesignated geographic
area until detecting a preselected target type. It then crashes itself
into the target, detonating the warhead it carries.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Russia has made A.I. a strategic priority.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Vladimir Putin, the country's president, said in 2017 that whoever
becomes the leader in A.I. "will become the ruler of the world." But at
least one recent assessment, from researchers at the U.S.
government--funded Center for Naval Analyses, says Russia lags the U.S.
and China in developing A.I. defense capabilities. In an interview last
week with Politico, one of the study's authors, [[Samuel Bendett, told
the publication that Russia would definitely use A.I. in Ukraine to help
analyze battlefield data, including surveillance footage from drones. He
also said that it was possible that China would provide Russia with more
advanced A.I.-enabled weapons to use in Ukraine in exchange for gaining
insights into how Russia effectively integrates drones into combat
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}, an area in which Russia has
battle-tested expertise from Syria that China lacks.

[[A.I. might also play a vital role in the information war. Many fear
that A.I. techniques such as deepfakes---highly realistic video fakes
created using an A.I. technique---will supercharge Russian
disinformation campaigns]{.underline}]{.mark}, although so far there is
no evidence of deepfakes being used. Machine learning can also be used
to help detect disinformation. The large social media platforms already
deploy these systems, although their track record in accurately
identifying and removing disinformation is spotty at best. Some people
have also suggested A.I. can help analyze the vast amount of open source
intelligence coming out of Ukraine---everything from TikTok videos and
Telegram posts of troop formations and attacks uploaded by average
Ukrainians to publicly available satellite imagery. This could allow
civil society groups to fact-check the claims made by both sides in the
conflict as well as to document potential atrocities and human rights
violations. That could be vital for future war crimes prosecutions.

## 2NC/1NR Answer to Non-Unique- Cybersecurity

#### As Russia feels threatened by the increasing NATO cooperation, they are increasingly likely to launch cyberattacks. The USFG and private sector cybersecurity firms are not prepared to face Russian attacks.

Given past cyber-attacks Washington has attributed to Moscow and the
current level of escalation, however, others emphasized a need to
reinforce digital defenses.

[[\"Russia has telegraphed that they are willing to attack critical
infrastructure here in the U.S.,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} Brian Harrell,
who served as former Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary
for Infrastructure Protection before his resignation in August 2020,

proactive threat hunting efforts,\" he added. \"We have absolutely
entered a heightened period of awareness given the threats that have
been made and the demonstrated attacks we\'ve seen from the Russian GRU
and Foreign Intelligence Service.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Kyiv has already accused Moscow of employing covert cyber tactics
throughout the course of the current dispute, which first began to grab
global attention in March of last year and then again in November as up
to 100,000 Russian troops amassed near the country\'s restive border
with Ukraine, where Russia-aligned separatists have been active since
2014.]{.underline}]{.mark} An apparent cyber-attack gripped the
post-Soviet Eastern European state earlier this month, but Russian
officials have dismissed any allegations their government was behind the
incident.

In an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony
Blinken warned that \"in the event that there is a renewed Russian
incursion, Russian forces going into Ukraine, there is going to be a
swift, a severe, and united response\" and also threatened such a
reaction in response to other things \"Russia could do short of sending
forces into Ukraine again to try to destabilize or topple the government
-- cyber attacks, hybrid means, et cetera.\"

That same day, [[Peskov]{.underline}]{.mark} too criticized what he
called \"information hysteria\" when it came to the situation between
Russia and Ukraine. He [[placed the blame on the U.S. and NATO, however,
and said Western powers were also responsible for real-world

In the initial weeks of the Russian invasion, American officials

albeit on a smaller scale than expected. In many cases cyber-attacks
occurred within days or hours of missile strikes on similar targets,
indicating the attackers may have had overlapping objectives.

[[On March 1st a Russian hacker group used malicious software against a
major Ukrainian broadcaster and other Kyiv-based media organizations;
the same day, a Russian missile strike pulverized a television tower in
the capital. On March 2nd a nuclear-power company was hacked; the next
day, the Russian army occupied Ukraine's largest nuclear-power station.
On March 4th a group affiliated with gru, Russia's military intelligence
service, carried out cyber-operations against a government agency's
network in the city of Vinnytsia. Two days later, Russian missiles
struck an airport in the same city. While the cyber-attacks have been
limited in scope, their use alongside the military is probably designed
to disrupt Ukrainian administration.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The number of Russian cyber-operations has doubled every month since
December, when 15 were reported. This only includes attacks that
Microsoft was able to detect in its own networks---the true number is
likely to be higher.]{.underline}]{.mark} But because the Russians are
conducting disruptive attacks, they are much more likely to be found out
than pure espionage, such as Chinese intelligence gathering against
America, reckons Benjamin Read, director of espionage analysis at
Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm.

[[At least six Russian hacking groups were responsible for these
operations in Ukraine, which were designed mainly to destroy files in
computer systems, but also to gather intelligence, cut off access to
information and support efforts to spread misinformation. The attacks,
which seem to be more frequent than previously appreciated, highlight a
new kind of hybrid warfare.]{.underline}]{.mark} "There has not been a
situation before where this much disruption has been going on in a
concentrated area in the history of cyber," says Mr Read. Other
governments, wary of Russia, will be watching closely.

#### Russia has a history of committing cyberattacks harming critical infrastructure beyond Ukraine given spillover. 

**Madnick, 2022**, (Stuart, Professor of Engineering Systems in the MIT
School of Engineering, and Director of Cybersecurity at MIT Sloan
(CAMS): the Interdisciplinary Consortium for Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity.), "What Russia's Ongoing Cyber Attacks in
Ukraine Suggest About the Future of Cyber Warfare". Harvard Business
Review. 03/07.
https://hbr.org/2022/03/what-russias-ongoing-cyberattacks-in-ukraine-suggest-about-the-future-of-cyber-warfare

[[Unlike conventional attacks, cyberattacks can be hard to accurately
attribute. Plausible deniability exists because in many cases,
cyberattacks can be launched from an unwitting
host.]{.underline}]{.mark} For example, partial control of your home
computer could be taken over, without you knowing it and used to
initiate a chain of attacks. One such event occurred in 2013 when smart
refrigerators were made part of a botnet and used to attack businesses.
In 2016, many thousands of home security cameras were taken over and
used to disrupt the operations of Twitter, Amazon, Spotify, Netflix and
many others. But there's strong evidence tying Russian hackers to a
string of attacks in Ukraine. [[Going back to 2015, after the Russian
invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, suspected Russian hackers managed to
knock out electric power for around 230,000 customers in western
Ukraine. Attackers repeated the trick the following year, expanding the
list of targets to include government agencies and the banking system.
In the hours before Russian troops invaded, Ukraine was hit by
never-before-seen malware designed to wipe data --- an attack the
Ukrainian government said was "on a completely different level" from
previous attacks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

It's easy to understand why Ukraine is an appealing target for testing
cyberwar capabilities. The country has similar infrastructure to that
found in Western Europe and North America. But unlike the United States,
the United Kingdom, and the European Union (EU), Ukraine has more
limited resources to counter-attack (though the U.S. and EU have both
provided support in bolstering its cyber defenses). And while Russia is
the obvious suspect, it's certainly possible that other countries, such
as Iran, North Korea, or China, have been testing their own cyber
weaponry in Ukraine, too. [[The larger point here is that there's little
chance that cyberattacks will be limited to Ukraine. Governments and
corporations should closely heed what's going on there, because cyberwar
can --- and has --- quickly spread across borders.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Given that the U.S. and EU have banded together in support of Ukraine,
the scope of a cyberwar could be broad. Large scale cyber skirmishes can
become global due to a spillover effect.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[There's
some precedent for what a spillover would look like. In 2017, a
suspected Russian attack featuring a piece of malware dubbed "NotPetya"
disrupted Ukrainian airports, railways, and banks. But, NotPetya did not
to stay in Ukraine. It spread rapidly around the world, infecting ---
and for a period of time largely shut down --- a diverse array of
multinational companies including the global shipping company Maersk,
the pharmaceutical giant Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary TNT Express,
and among others.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## 2AC Answers to Russia DA

#### Russia's invasion of Ukraine is not in response to NATO expansion. NATO has expanded in previous years, yet Russia did not react. 

**Popova & Shevel, 2022**, (Maria is a Jean Monnet Chair and Associate
Professor of Political Science at McGill University, Oxana is an
Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Tufts
University's School of Arts and Sciences), "Russia's Invasion of Ukraine
Is Essentially Not About NATO". Just Security. 02/24.
<https://www.justsecurity.org/80343/russias-new-assault-on-ukraine-is-not-entirely-maybe-not-even-largely-about-nato/>

In his Feb. 15 Just Security article "Ukraine: Unleashing the Rhetorical
Dogs of War," Barry Posen argued that NATO and Ukraine should have cut a
deal with Russia because the Ukrainian military would surely be defeated
by Russia without direct U.S./Western military participation and U.S.
offers of equipment were only encouraging a potential Ukrainian
insurgency against Russian occupation that would be as bloody as it
would be futile. [[The prescription depends entirely on Posen's
assumption that to satisfy Russia, all Ukraine would have had to do
would be "to swallow the bitter pill of accepting armed neutrality
between NATO and Russia, rather than NATO membership." This assumption
contradicts events of recent months and the historical
record.]{.underline}]{.mark} While Vladimir Putin has claimed that his
goal is keeping Ukraine out of NATO, he also insisted that he was just
conducting military exercises. Instead, he is invading Ukraine again. He
likewise insisted in 2014 that he wasn't capturing Crimea, despite the
presence of his unidentified "Little Green Men" and his subsequent
annexation of the peninsula, or that he was not fighting in Ukraine's
Donbas area in the east all these years, despite all evidence to the
contrary. There is no reason to take Putin at his word. His Feb. 21
diatribe conferring Russian recognition of independence for the two
eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and his order for
Russian troops to move in as ostensible "peacekeepers" shows clearly his
disdain for diplomatic resolutions. [[Moreover, this is not even
primarily about NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO's eastward expansion may
have played a role in straining the relationship between Russia and the
West, but mainly because, for Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly
abandon it for the greener pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung.
However, [[Putin's rhetoric and actions over almost two decades reveal
that his goals extend beyond imposing neutrality on Ukraine or even
staving off further NATO expansion. The larger objective is to
re-establish Russian political and cultural dominance over a nation that
Putin sees as one with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, and then follow up
by undoing the European rules-based order and security architecture
established in the aftermath of World War II. Given these goals,
Ukrainian neutrality is a woefully insufficient concession for Putin.
[[If Russia's main concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have
reacted with rhetoric and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after
each step in the NATO expansion process. The largest wave of NATO's
eastward expansion took place in March 2004, when seven Eastern European
countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic states. Russia
"grumbled]{.underline}]{.mark}," as the New York Times put it then, by
adopting a Duma resolution criticizing the expansion, [[but no hostile
and sustained rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement as a Western plot
against Russian interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Russia is too far behind technologically to reach US advancements in AI and cybersecurity innovation.

**Chernenko and Markotkin, 2020**, (Elena is a journalist with
Kommersant newspaper.and Nikolai is an expert with the Russian
International Affairs Council), "Developing Artificial Intelligence in
Russia: Objectives and Reality". Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. 05/08. <https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/82422>

[[The Russian government finances industry-specific projects---quite
generously by Russian standards---which testifies to the high priority
assigned to this field. The application of AI in the military industry,
in which Russia's position is traditionally strong, is the subject of
particular attention.]{.mark} [Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Russia
will become a leader in the development of AI as set forth in the
national strategy because of its current lag behind the leading
technological powers, as well as some other factors, such as a small
venture capital investment market.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Unlike China
and the United States, Russia isn't a global leader in AI technologies.
Although the strategy states that "the Russian Federation possesses
significant potential to become one of the international leaders in the
development and use of artificial intelligence technologies," it's
unlikely the country will be able to achieve this goal in the short and
medium term.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nevertheless, certain areas of AI
development and application do exist; Russia enjoys strong positions
there and can succeed in the future. Russia's ranking in the AI
technology race is hard to establish, since current international
ratings use different methodologies. Many of them don't list Russia at
all, which is unsurprising, since the country lacked an official AI
development strategy until November 2019.

[[In terms of individual AI-related technology indicators, Russia has
only three supercomputers ranked among the 500 most powerful computers
in the world, for example, while China has 228, the United States has
117, and Japan has 29.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The number of AI start-ups
in a given country is also a key indicator of its progress in this
field. According to TRAXCN statistics, Russia currently has 168 AI
start-ups, compared with 6,903 in the United States and 1,013 in
China.]{.underline}]{.mark} These estimates appear to be somewhat
exaggerated, since the list includes twenty- and thirty-year-old
"start-ups," but still, they make it possible to assess the bigger
picture of the state of venture capital investment markets with respect
to AI. In part, the small number of Russian AI start-ups can be
explained by the domination of established companies in this sphere.
This is what distinguishes Russia from most other developed
technological powers. According to Russia's proposed Artificial
Intelligence road map, the country has a total of 400 companies working
on developing AI.

[[In November 2019, the RDIF reported that it had raised \$2 billion in
domestic and international investments in Russian companies that use
AI.]{.underline}]{.mark} The RDIF will also undertake to bring these
companies to international markets. According to some media
publications, the fund will invest some of its money in creating an
Artificial Intelligence Institute at Moscow State University. [[Such
investment volumes are unique for Russian science. But how significant
are they on a global scale? It is certainly far less than the leaders of
the tech race spend on AI. China annually invests tens of billions of
dollars in AI, including at a regional level. Beijing alone is planning
to invest \$2.1 billion in an AI industrial park, while Tianjin is
considering the creation of a \$16 billion AI development fund. In turn,
the U.S. government allocated \$4.9 billion for AI research in 2020.
Venture investors have contributed even more, investing over \$8 billion
in AI start-ups in 2018 alone.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[As of today,
Russia cannot be described as a leader in the AI race. Even if AI
development becomes Russia's highest priority, Moscow essentially has no
chance of catching up with Washington and Beijing in this
field.]{.underline}]{.mark}

recessions,"]{.underline}]{.mark} said Dana M Peterson, Chief Economist
of The Conference Board. "Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus in major
economies around the world---which built a bridge to economic reopening
enabled by the rapid development of effective vaccines---likely
prevented the recession from devolving into a long period of lackluster
economic growth."

2020---is calculated to have recovered all of its losses by Q1 2021. By

will lag somewhat.

## AFF Extension- No Russian Aggression due to NATO Expansion

#### Putin is not concerned about NATO expansion given statements about Sweden and Finland seeking membership. 

**Bove, 2022**, (Tristan is a graduate of DePaul University with degrees
in International Studies and Chinese), "Putin says Sweden and Finland
joining NATO and breaking with decades of neutrality is fine after all.
'No problems'". Fortune. 05/16.
<https://fortune.com/2022/05/16/sweden-finland-join-nato-putin-no-threat-russia/>

But three months into a Ukraine invasion that's not going according to
plan, and after two other countries close to Russia announced that they
are joining NATO, Putin appears to be softening his tone, and resigning
himself to the fact that NATO's eastward expansion is happening anyway.

[[On Sunday, Finland---which shares an 800-mile border with Russia and
was part of the Russian Empire for over a century---said it had applied
to join NATO to ensure that its own national security would not be
threatened by Russia in the future. On Monday, Sweden followed suit
after a meeting amongst ruling party officials over the weekend, who
voted to end the country's 200-year neutrality
policy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Minister Magdalena Andersson said on
Sunday. "We're facing a fundamentally changed security environment in
Europe."

For months, Russian officials have warned against the two countries
taking this decisive step, but now that it has actually happened, Putin
appears to be doing his best to diminish the significance of the act.
[[\"As for the expansion of NATO, including through new members of the
alliance which are Finland, Sweden --- Russia has no problems with these
states," Putin said]{.underline}]{.mark} Monday at a summit of the
Collective Security Treaty Organization, a military alliance composed of
several post-Soviet states.

For months, Russian officials have been saying that should Finland and
Sweden join NATO, Russia would receive it as a threat, and respond by
building up its military capabilities in the Baltic Sea. Former Russian
president Dmitry Medvedev even suggested in April that nuclear weapons
and hypersonic missiles could be deployed. Just last week, Putin warned
that Finland joining NATO would be a "mistake," and suggested that
Russia would interpret it as an act of aggression. But [[Putin signaled
on Monday that Finland and Sweden's decision to join NATO is one of
relative unimportance, and does not constitute a danger to Russia.
\"Expansion at the expense of these countries does not pose a direct
threat to Russia," he said.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## AFF Extension- No Nuclear War Impact

#### Russia's current fight to lead AI and cybersecurity innovation futile due to their focus on Ukraine.

**Whyte, 2022**, (Christopher is an assistant professor in the homeland
security and emergency preparedness program in the Wilder School of
Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University),
"Russia's AI setbacks will likely heighten its cyber aggression". CSO.
04/14.
https://www.csoonline.com/article/3656957/russias-ai-setbacks-will-likely-heighten-its-cyber-aggression.html#:\~:text=With%20the%20weight%20of%20Western,AI

[[The consequences of the war waged against Ukraine on Russia's wealth,
workforce and access to sophisticated imported products such as
microprocessors used to operate everything from mobile devices to
automobiles are immense. Without capital, talent and a line on critical
commodities and technologies, Russia will struggle to be competitive in
everything from medical technology development to national security
practice.]{.underline}]{.mark} This likely result of increasing
isolation seems doubly assured with AI. Russia's relatively weak
fundamentals and strong competition from both China and the West
virtually guarantee vast opportunity costs to Russia in years to come.
This outcome might be seen as a positive development that will cede
techno-strategic advantages to defense communities in North America,
Europe and East Asia\--those most concerned about Russia's military
capabilities and intentions.

[[Despite Putin's statements, Russia's AI efforts have lagged behind
most initiatives in other countries. In 2014, barely two years after a
breakthrough innovation of deep neural networks by a multinational group
of researchers energized AI development, Russia's buildout of new
machine learning applications and other AI tools was already slowing
significantly. Collaborations with cutting-edge projects in the West,
China, India and elsewhere began to drop away following Putin's
annexation of Crimea and decision to embroil Eastern Ukraine in ongoing
conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark} State-sponsored companies and
military-intelligence institutions in the Russian Federation have
consistently been a leading source of novel AI technologies aimed at
bolstering national security and strengthening mechanisms of population
control. However, a slow leak of human capital and a complicated
relationship with parts of the global economy that dominate critical
high technology resources, such as graphics processing units (GPUs),
have become a substantial obstacle for the country's AI ambitions. Even
if Moscow matched China's or the United States' levels of domestic AI
investment, its fundamentals of innovation for the field simply haven't
been concrete for some time.

[[One major blow to Moscow's AI ambitions is the dramatic acceleration
of the brain drain that has plagued Russian high technology and
scientific communities for years.]{.underline}]{.mark} Enticing
researchers out of private industry and academia is perennially
difficult for governments, but Russia has been even less capable in this
regard than most, likely due to the unappealing culture and benefits of
Putin's military and paramilitary communities. [[Now, up to 70,000 tech
workers that were otherwise minimal flight risks have fled the
country.]{.underline}]{.mark} Many have ended up in former Soviet states
and South Asia, and no small number have left positions tied to the
Russian state's focus on building out facial recognition, autonomous
vehicles and surveillance capabilities. [[Sanctions worsen the impact of
this brain drain by cutting across the research and business
relationships that Moscow has heavily supported in recent
years.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## AFF Extension- No Economic Collapse Impact

#### The global economy is in recovery with positive outlook ahead.

**OECD, 2021**, (OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to
preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social
well-being of people around the world), "Global economic recovery
continues but remains uneven, says OECD". OECD. 09/21.
<https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/global-economic-recovery-continues-but-remains-uneven-says-oecd.htm>

[[The global economy is growing far more strongly than anticipated a
year ago,]{.underline}]{.mark} but the recovery remains uneven, exposing
both advanced and emerging markets to a range of risks, according to the
OECD's latest Interim Economic Outlook. [[The OECD says extraordinary
support from governments and central banks helped avoid the worst once
the COVID-19 pandemic hit. With the vaccine roll-out continuing and a
gradual resumption of economic activity underway, the OECD projects
strong global growth of]{.underline}]{.mark} 5.7% this year and [[4.5%
in 2022]{.underline}]{.mark}, little changed from its May 2021 Outlook
of 5.8% and 4.4% respectively. Countries are emerging from the crisis
with different challenges, often reflecting their pre-COVID 19 strengths
and weaknesses, and their policy approaches during the pandemic. Even in
the countries where output or employment have recovered to their
pre-pandemic levels, the recovery is incomplete, with jobs and incomes
still short of the levels expected before the pandemic. Presenting the
Interim Economic Outlook alongside Chief Economist Laurence Boone,
[[OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said: "The world is
experiencing a strong recovery thanks to decisive action taken by
governments and central banks at the height of the
crisis.]{.underline}]{.mark} But as we have seen with vaccine
distribution, progress is uneven. Ensuring the recovery is sustained and
widespread requires action on a number of fronts -- from effective
vaccination programmes across all countries to concerted public
investment strategies to build for the future."
