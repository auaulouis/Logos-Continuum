## Summary 

The goal of the Neg is to prove that the plan presented by the
affirmative team is a bad idea. The more you focus on the plan and why
it is a bad idea, the more often you'll win debates. This imperialism DA
is one way you can prove the affirmative is a bad idea. It argues that
even if the plan has some good effects it starts a chain reaction that
spreads more imperialist ideals. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
was established in 1949, post WWII for the Western bloc to prevent the
spread of Soviet communism. This is a linear disadvantage meaning
uniqueness is not up for contestation, the imperialist history of NATO
is undeniable.

The first card of the 1NC contextualizes the exploitation NATO has
inflicted on the global South and why NATO as an organization is flawed.
The following link card explains why the affirmatives reaffirms
imperialism. There are more link cards in the Neg extras section of this
file, choose links accordingly in respond to the case ran by the AFF.
The last part of this DA is the impact, divided into three big
categories, stealing tech from developing regions, threat to human
survival, and lastly attacks from Russia. Rule of thumb for the link
also applies here, choose the impact appropriate for the case run by the
affirmative. All additional neg cards are included at the end of the
file.

The strategy for the AFF is to select your response cards accordingly.
If the card read by the NEG has a no link or no impact answer read it
for your 2AC. The impact turn is critical to winning the DA. You must
establish why NATO imperialism is inevitable, it is happening regardless
of what the AFF plan is calling for. Next you need to do analysis work
on why American hold of the cyberspace is still comparatively better
than Russian or Chinese control. The key idea for the impact turn is
that the AFF is necessary, Unite States intervention is providing more
access to the internet allowing suppressed groups to use it to gain
freedom.

**NOTE:** Unlike the other disadvantages in this set the Imperialism
disadvantage is what we refer to as a "linear DA" that means imperialism
exists now (ie, is non-unique) but the negative will make the argument
that it is so bad we should not just throw up our hands and accept it,
we should instead reject instances that will make it worse.

## 1 NC -- NATO imperialism bad

#### NATO was created to protect Western civilization perpetuating imperialist exploitation of Africa in the name of securitization. 

**Sobukwe, 2022.** (Djibo, Former Central Committee member of the All
African People's Revolutionary Party, February 23.) NATO and Africa: A
Relationship of Colonial Violence and Structural White Supremacy. Black
Agenda Report.
http://blackagendareport.com/nato-and-africa-relationship-colonial-violence-and-structural-white-supremacy

Considering the public media attention and concern about possible
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it is worth
reminding people about NATO's bloody history in Africa. [[NATO was
founded in 1949 after WWII at a time when African countries were still
under the yoke of colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In [fact [most of
the original founders of NATO had been Africa's principal colonizers
such as UK, France, Portugal, Belgium, Italy]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[the USA as lead NATO organizer and dominant
partner]{.underline}.]{.mark} The organization was established as a
collective defense against the Soviet Union with the requirement
(Article 5) that any attack on one was considered an attack on all and
therefore requiring a collective response.

Since NATO was founded with the purported purpose of halting possible
Soviet aggression and stopping the spread of Communism it would seem to
follow that after the collapse of the USSR in 1991 there would no longer
be a need for NATO. Since then however, [[NATO has expanded from the
founding twelve to at present thirty member states]{.underline}]{.mark}
many of whom are eastern European countries, formerly Soviet
republics and Warsaw Pact allies. Today, [[NATO has become a huge axel
in the wheel of the military industrial complex controlled by U.S.
empire for the purpose of [full spectrum
dominance](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/03/20/countdown-to-full-spectrum-dominance/),
driven by the [ferocious
appetites](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/military-industrial-complex-defense-contractors-raytheon-united-technologies-merger/) of
corporate capital.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Walter Rodney accurately describes the early foundation of colonial
Africa's relationship with NATO which continues today as he described
in How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]{.underline}:]{.mark}

Needless to say, [[in the 1950's when most Africans were still colonial
subjects, they had absolutely no control over the utilization of their
soil for militaristic ends]{.underline}]{.mark}. Virtually the whole of
[[North Africa was turned into a sphere of operations for
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, with bases aimed at the Soviet Union. There
could have easily developed a nuclear war without African peoples having
any knowledge of the matter. The [[colonial powers actually held
military conferences in African cities]{.underline}]{.mark} like Dakar
and Nairobi in the early 1950's, inviting the whites of South Africa and
Rhodesia and the government of the USA. Time and time again, the
evidence points to [[this cynical use of Africa to buttress capitalism
economically and militarily]{.underline}]{.mark}, and therefore in
effect [[forcing Africa to contribute to its own
exploitation.]{.underline}]{.mark} \[emphasis
added\][1](https://mronline.org/2022/03/01/nato-and-africa/#edn_1)

Kwame Nkrumah had already warned in his 1967 Challenge of the Congo that
there were at least seventeen air bases, nine foreign naval bases, three
rocket sites and an atomic testing range operated by NATO in in North
Africa, in addition to military missions in about a dozen other African
countries, not to mention the exploitation of raw materials for the
production of nuclear weapons occurring in the mines of Congo, Angola,
South Africa and
Rhodesia.[2](https://mronline.org/2022/03/01/nato-and-africa/#edn_2) Nkrumah
called for the urgent need to counter the challenge of NATO in the
strategy he outlined in his Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare which
included the call for a military high command and an All African
People's Revolutionary Army
(AAPRA).[3](https://mronline.org/2022/03/01/nato-and-africa/#edn_3)

#### The extension of NATO membership to the Baltic region furthers imperialist American security rhetoric in the cyber-sphere. 

**Micko & Plichta, 2019.** ( Branislav, PhD candidate in political
science at Charles University. Marcel, an independent analyst in
Washington, DC. April 5).*The Case for NATO: Why the Alliance's
Post--Cold War Expansion is Vital to European Security and American
Interests*. Modern War Institute.
https://mwi.usma.edu/case-nato-alliances-post-cold-war-expansion-vital-european-security-american-interests/

At a time when NATO is tested by competition with a revanchist Russia,
critiques of its approach to membership have just as frequently been
from inside the alliance as out. Arguments
from [[scholars](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/26/nato-isnt-what-you-think-it-is/) and [commentators](https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/it-is-long-past-time-to-stop-expanding-nato/) bemoan
NATO's post-1991 expansion and advocate a halt to welcoming new
members]{.mark} altogether. Among [[reasons cited to freeze membership
are the inclusion of "vulnerable" countries, such as the Baltic nations
who]{.underline}]{.mark} allegedly [[do not bring enough to the
table]{.underline}]{.mark}, a supposedly deteriorating US domestic
commitment to the alliance[, [and the potential to provoke the
Russians]{.mark}]{.underline}. These critiques are
not [new](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1999-05-01/nato-fifty-minimalist-nato-wise-alliance-knows-when-retrench)---they
have appeared regularly throughout the alliance's history in one form or
another---nor do they convincingly demonstrate the need to freeze
membership in NATO. On the contrary: the alliance is best served by
continuing to consider new members.

First of all, there is the question of capabilities. The idea that the
smaller countries of central, eastern, and southern Europe do not bring
any relevant capabilities to the table [made an
appearance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB889653261535750000?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4) during
the initial debates about their inclusion. While it is obviously true
that smaller [[countries with smaller budgets cannot build military
forces that would be able to face Russia in conventional
warfare,]{.underline}]{.mark} proponents of this argument either forget
about or ignore the major qualitative contributions these countries
make[. [Every nation that has joined the alliance has brought something
new and important to the table---be it [mountain operations

## 1 NC - IMPACT

#### NATO is a tool for the Western war waging, its imperialist expansion agenda is a threat to humanity. 

**Lendman, 2020** (Stephen, a 2008 Project Censored winner and 2011
Mexican Journalists Club international journalism award recipient, June
9.) NATO's Diabolical 2030 Agenda.
<https://stephenlendman.org/2020/06/09/natos-diabolical-2030-agenda/>

From inception, US-dominated [[NATO has always been and continues to be
an instrument for advancing its imperial agenda by brute
force]{.underline}]{.mark} --- endless wars its favored strategy along
with other hostile actions.

[[Alliance secretaries general operate as US puppets, serving its
imperial interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, Jens Stoltenberg the latest in
a long line of subservient NATO heads.

On Monday, he addressed the Washington-based Atlantic Council (AC), a
neocon infested think tank involved in weaponizing hysteria against
nations on the US target list for regime change --- notably China,
Russia and Iran.

AC's board of director and so-called "experts" include a rogue's gallery
of hawkish extremists who never met a sovereign independent country they
didn't want transformed into a US vassal state by brute force or other
hostile means.

[[NATO's longterm vision is all about pursuing Washington's imperial
agenda globally.]{.mark}]{.underline} Stoltenberg's mandate is
furthering its diabolical aims.

[[Its 2030 agenda includes expanding the alliance worldwide, greater
military spending, and more preemptive wars on
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} than already --- a scourge essential to
challenge.

At a time when the only threats face by the US and other Western
countries are invented, not real, Stoltenberg pretends otherwise in
deference to his master in Washington.

He lied saying "Russia continues its military activities unabated."

Russian forces are in Syria by invitation of its legitimate government
--- involved in aiding its military combat US-supported ISIS and
likeminded jihadists.

Stoltenberg: "ISIL and other terrorist groups are emboldened" ---
instead of explaining they're US proxies in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,
Yemen, Libya and elsewhere, used by the Pentagon and CIA.

## 2 NC/1NR Link extension -- Conflict with Russia

#### Support for NATO expansion to Sweden and Finland creates tension with Russia. 

**Cato Institute, 2022**. (April 22) Nine Reasons Why NATO Should Close
the Door to Sweden and Finland.
https://www.cato.org/commentary/nine-reasons-why-nato-should-close-door-sweden-finland

[[Almost eight decades have passed since the end of World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark} and Europe remains helplessly dependent on
America. [[Yet U.S. officials are celebrating the]{.underline} [expected
application by Finland and Sweden to join NATO]{.underline}.]{.mark} 

The [[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline} [Blob [doesn't seem likely to be
satisfied until every country on earth relies on the U.S.
for]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In truth, [[NATO expansion has never been about American
security.]{.mark}]{.underline} Rather, [[it was meant to expand
Washington's defense dole]{.mark}]{.underline} in the name of promoting
regional stability. 

So why should Americans increase their defense load now? The U.S. should
stop adding new members to the transatlantic alliance and instead
prepare to turn Europe's defense over to Europe.

[[The allies did not invite Ukraine into NATO because they didn't want
to risk war.]{.underline}]{.mark} The same rationale applies to these
two countries.

Neither Finland nor Sweden is under threat. Both are well‐​armed and
friendly with the West; neither has major disputes with Moscow. Indeed,
Helsinki maintained its independence as a neutral against the Soviet
Union. Even the most Russophobic analysts offer no evidence that Russian
President Vladimir Putin plans to conquer the two states and add them to
an expanded U.S.SR. And if he attempted to do so, Ukraine's experience
suggests that the two would exact a terrible price.

Since [[including the two states would address no Russian threat to
existing members, doing so would be seen as threatening by
Moscow.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, Finland provides another route to
St. Petersburg, with the Finnish border little more than 100 miles
away. [Warned long‐​time Putin
ally](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/14/russia-baltic-nuclear-deployment-finland-sweden-nato/) Dmitry
Medvedev: "If Sweden and Finland join NATO, the length of the land
borders of the alliance with the Russian Federation will more than
double. Naturally, these boundaries will have to be strengthened."
[[Meaning that Moscow likely would rely on America's Cold War policy
of ["massive
retaliation,"](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dulles-announces-policy-of-massive-retaliation) using
nuclear weapons to cover conventional weakness.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Although [[further expanding NATO might appear to be an appropriate
riposte to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, doing so would reinforce the
security fears which animated Russia's aggressive policy
against]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[Georgia and
Ukraine.]{.mark} ]{.underline}Despite the Washington Blob's blithe
denial that U.S. policy had anything to do with Russia's actions[[, the
allies [recklessly
violated](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/we-poked-the-bear/) their
assurances that NATO would not expand, conducted aggressive military
operations undermining Russian interests]{.underline},]{.mark} and
promoted regime change against Russo‐​friendly governments. Had Moscow
acted similarly in Latin America the U.S. would have threatened war.
Further deepening Europe's division with [[Finland's and Sweden's
inclusion would exacerbate already deepening
hostilities.\\]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[NATO 2030 is a scheme for expanding NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
worldwide more than already, for greater military spending, for crushing

[[It]{.underline}]{.mark}'s an agenda that [[risks global war with

diabolical US aims.

saluting and obeying.

Claiming China is a threat to US hegemonic aims, he said the following:

capabilities, including missiles that can reach all NATO countries."

[[NATO is all about militarization and warmaking, unrelating to
"protecting each other"]{.underline}]{.mark} --- despite no foreign
threats to any alliance member states.

Disbanding NATO would be one of the most important ways to advance world
peace and stability over endless wars US-led member states wage.

since the Soviet Union dissolved nearly 30 years ago.

## 2 NC/1NR Impact Extension -- Russian cyberattack

#### If the U.S. continues to push NATO expansion, it will trigger cybersecurity attacks from Russia.

**O'Connor & Jamali, 2022**. (Tom  an award-winning senior writer of

double agent, January 24). Russia Could Launch Cyber Attacks Against
U.S. if Biden Sends Wrong Signals, Intel Warns. Newsweek.
<https://www.newsweek.com/russia-could-launch-cyber-attacks-against-us-if-biden-sends-wrong-signals-intel-warns-1672280>

In a new memo obtained by Newsweek[[, the [Department of Homeland
Security](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/department-of-homeland-security) has
warned of Russia\'s potential to launch cyberattacks against the United
States in response to a possible escalation of the crisis unfolding at
the border with Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"We assess that [[Russia would consider initiating a cyber attack
against the Homeland if it perceived a US
or [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato) response to a possible
Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national
security]{.underline}]{.mark},\" the memo, dated January 23 and
attributed to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, reads in bold
text.

The warning came as President [Joe
Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden) sent additional weapons
to Ukrainian forces and reportedly weighed the option of sending
thousands of U.S. troops to the Baltic states bordering Russia over
concerns that Moscow was planning imminent military action against
Ukraine.

Kyiv has defied the Kremlin\'s protests by seeking membership in [[the
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Western military alliance, something that
Russian officials have said threatened their country\'s national
security. The [[bloc has expanded eastward since the fall of the Soviet
Union three decades ago and has refused to rule out including Ukraine as
well.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The memo detailed a range of ways in which [[Russia may choose to
unleash its cyber arsenal in the event of a
flare-up]{.underline}]{.mark} while noting such an action would be
unprecedented.

[[\"Russia maintains a range of offensive cyber tools that it could
employ against US networks --- from low-level denials-of-service to
destructive attacks targeting critical
infrastructure,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} the memo read. \"However, we
assess that Russia\'s threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive
cyber attacks in the Homeland probably remains very high and we have not
observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US
critical infrastructure --- notwithstanding cyber espionage and
potential prepositioning operations in the past.\"

Reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland
Security told Newsweek said it \"regularly shares information with
federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial officials and the private
sector to ensure the safety and security of all communities across the
country.\"

\"We have increased operational partnerships between private sector
companies and the federal government to strengthen our nation\'s cyber
defenses, including through CISA\'s newly established Joint Cyber
Defense Collaborative (JCDC),\" the spokesperson said. \"The JCDC brings
these partners together to help us understand the full threat landscape
and enable real-time collaboration to empower our private sector
partners to gain information and take action against the most
significant threats to the nation.\"

[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} the Biden administration has tried to \"keep
the U.S. out of bilateral confrontation\" with Russia, and \"that\'s why
they kind of took this approach limited to diplomacy\" as the U.S.
leader ruled out the deployment of U.S. soldiers to Ukraine itself.

[[\"Already we see that\'s eroding,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} Vindman, who

## 2 NC/1NR Impact turn answer -- U.S. censorship, freedom decline

#### The USFG is passing new legislation leading to a continuous decline in cyber freedom, global decline in internet freedom hinders social movement. 

Paul, 2021. (Kari September 22.) Internet freedom on the decline in US
and globally, study finds. The Guardian.
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/21/internet-freedom-decline-free-speech-study

[[Online freedom is continuing to decline globally]{.underline}]{.mark},
according to a new study, [[with governments increasingly cracking down
on user speech and misinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} on the rise.

The [[report from [Freedom
House](https://freedomhouse.org/about-us)]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
Washington DC-based democracy advocacy group, [[found internet freedom
declined for the fifth year in a row in the US and the 11th year
internationally]{.underline}]{.mark} -- for two distinct reasons.

[[Domestically, the lack of regulation in the tech industry has allowed
companies to grow beyond reproach and
misinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} to flourish online. [[Abroad,
authoritarian governments have harnessed their tight control of the
internet to subdue free expression]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Freedom House cited a growing lack of diversity among sources of online
information in the US that allowed conspiracies and misinformation to
rise, an issue that was gravely underscored during the 2020 elections
and the 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol.

Meanwhile, [[global internet freedom declined for the 11th consecutive
year]{.underline}]{.mark}, with [[more governments arresting users for
nonviolent political, social, or religious speech]{.underline}]{.mark}
than ever before. Officials in at least 20 countries suspended internet
access, and 20 regimes blocked access to social media platforms, the
report said.

The biggest declines were seen in Myanmar, Belarus, and Uganda. In
Uganda, internet freedom fell by seven points after pro-government
social media accounts flooded the online environment with manipulated
information preceding the January 2021 elections. In August 2020 in
Belarus, government forces cracked down on election unrest by
restricting access to the internet and surveilling activists online.

The report called the Chinese government "the world's worst abuser of
internet freedom", citing new legislation criminalizing certain
expressions online and draconian prison terms issued to activists for
online dissent - including an 18-year sentence against one activist for
distributing a paper criticizing the government's handling of the
Covid-19 pandemic.

#### The NATO alliance was created to protect the white Western Civilization.

["Western
civilization"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/western-civilisation-appiah-reith-lecture) is
a term that posits liberal ideals as the unique heritage of White
people. For example[[, in 1949, one
senator [justified](https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1949/07/07/senate-section) the
creation of NATO by saying:]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[There is not a member of the Senate who does not stem from one of
\[the North Atlantic\] countries.]{.mark}]{.underline} His forebears
came from Europe. ... We are the result. ... [[\[T\]his is our hour not
to fail civilization]{.mark}.]{.underline} Three hundred million persons
... believe in the great common principles which the race has developed
and inherited through generation after generation." (Note: Emphasis is
the author's)

This was not an isolated sentiment. Fifty years before Samuel
Huntington's book "Clash of Civilizations," the term "Western
civilization" was the title
of [history](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320950722_'Western'_and_'White_Civilization'_White_Nationalism_and_Eurocentrism_at_the_Crossroads) [courses](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/105/3/770/23403?login=true).
The most famous was Arnold Toynbee's bestseller "[A Study of
History](https://nyupress.org/9780853459613/inventing-western-civilization/),"
in which he represents "Western Civilization" as the only civilization
exclusively made up of the three White "races" --- Nordic, Alpine and
Mediterranean. (By contrast, he states that Black "races" have not
contributed to any civilization).

Because [["Western Civilization" was (or is) understood to be
exclusively made up White "races," the term]{.underline}]{.mark} [could
[function as a surrogate term for "Whiteness," including in [the
preamble of the North Atlantic
Treaty](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/history_pdf/20161122_E1-founding-treaty-original-treaty_NN-en.pdf):
"The Parties to this Treaty ... are determined to safeguard the
freedom, common heritage and civilization of their
peoples."]{.underline}]{.mark} (Note: Emphasis is the author's)

As [[one senator [elaborated in 1949
hearings](https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1949/07/11/senate-section),
this proposal to "defend our so-called western tradition" meant "the
culmination of a thousand years \[of\] the Anglo-Saxon \[i.e. White\]
people."]{.underline}]{.mark} Unsurprisingly, what makes Ukrainians'
plight so shocking is that ["they seem so like us," so
"civilized."](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/civilised-european-look-like-us-racist-coverage-ukraine)

The invasion of Ukraine has been horrifying to witness.

Early
on, [some](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/28/ukraine-coverage-media-racist-biases/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) observers [repeatedly](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/27/western-media-coverage-ukraine-russia-invasion-criticism) [expressed](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/charlie-dagata-cbs-apology-ukraine-iraq-b2024265.html) [the
idea](https://twitter.com/saratu/status/1497700938269835269) that the
invasion of Ukraine is especially horrifying because, as CBS reporter
Charlie D'Agata, who was in Kyiv, put it, "This isn't a place, with all
due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for
decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European --- I have
to choose those words carefully too --- city.\" (D'Agata later
issued [an

To understand the selective empathy toward Ukraine, here are four
historical examples that illustrate how race has always mattered when it
comes to NATO and the concept of Western civilization, drawn from a
large body of scholarship as well as my own dissertation research.

[[NATO was born out of a fear of White slavery.]{.mark}]{.underline}
American commitments to NATO were born out of the fear
that [communism](https://www.vub.be/sites/vub/files/nieuws/users/bcoppiet/118risse.pdf) would
spread in Europe. However, [[communism was seen to pose a threat not
just to "freedom" --- but specifically to [White
freedom](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179469/white-freedom),
as historian Tyler Stovall]{.underline}]{.mark} and others [[have
shown]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In the U.S.
South, [communism](https://lsupress.org/books/detail/black-struggle-red-scare/) was
seen as synonymous
with [desegregation](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469613871/defending-white-democracy/).
Looking abroad, arch-segregationist Sen. James Eastland (D-Miss.) in
1947 [explained](https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1947/04/11/senate-section) his
support for U.S. commitments to Europe: ... there is more slavery on the
earth today than at any previous time in the world's history ...
communism is the greatest of all enslavers \[because\] Nazi Germany and
Soviet Russia are the first nations in modern history which have
recognized and practiced the doctrine of human slavery as applied to the
white race. (Note: Emphasis is the author's.)

[[Defending European democracy meant reinforcing colonization elsewhere.
NATO was born as an alliance that protected --- and]{.mark}]{.underline}
even [[funded --- European colonization.]{.underline} As explicated
[during the 1948 congressional hearings on the Marshall Plan, the United
States believed that Europe's postwar economic recovery was crucial to
resisting communism.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Britain]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[was to recover through
recolonizing Malaya and its strategic resources --- rubber and
tin]{.underline}]{.mark}. British-controlled Malaya was the
second-highest exporter to the United States before Japan's takeover in
World War II. Reestablishing this "triangular trade" was so important
[that [the United States [indirectly
assisted](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24914471?seq=1) the suppression
of independence movements in colonial Southeast
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [culminating in the Vietnam

#### NATO's Western allies divided and conquered Africa by recruiting and infiltrating government leadership.

African People's Revolutionary Party, February 23.) NATO and Africa: A
Relationship of Colonial Violence and Structural White Supremacy. Black

http://blackagendareport.com/nato-and-africa-relationship-colonial-violence-and-structural-white-supremacy

Imperialism has always used its strategy of divide and rule. [[To enable
the acceptance of the idea of a 'benevolent' NATO, the colonial powers
knew that they had to convince and recruit a neo-colonial class of
indigenous Africans who would do their bidding.]{.underline}]{.mark}
This divide played itself out in the national liberation movements
between those who were friendly to imperialist forces and those who
wanted a real break from colonialism. Nkrumah explains
in Neo-colonialism, The Last Stage of Imperialism, the wide array of
methods employed by neocolonialism, ranging from economic, political,
religious, ideological and cultural spheres. To do this, [[NATO works
hand in hand with other mechanisms of imperialism like the
CIA [7](https://mronline.org/2022/03/01/nato-and-africa/#edn_7) which
was [instrumental in the
coup](https://www.theghanareport.com/today-in-history-the-cia-masterminded-1966-coup-to-overthrow-nkrumah/) against
the Nkrumah government and the [murder of Patrice
Lumumba](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/11/us-cia-intervention-africa-white-malice-susan-williams-book-review).]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The settler colony of Azania/South Africa would be another example of
a NATO outpost. From the beginning it was obviously on the side of the
Western/ NATO powers since it was essentially a colony of Britain and
therefore was a NATO surrogate.]{.underline}]{.mark} In 1955 South
Africa and Britain formulated the [Simonstown
agreements](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41066027) which
contained provision for the naval surveillance and defense of the
African continent from Cape to Cairo. In spite of a purported arms
embargo, NATO countries and Israel also provided South Africa with the
necessary technology to develop nuclear weapons.

## 2 NC/1NR Link extensions - Imperialist expansion bad

#### NATO is using military and technological development to supress growth of Chinese and Russian power. 

**Shea, 2020.** (Raner, September 21.) NATO 2030: a Desperate Plan to
Try to Preserve US Imperialist Hegemony. Orinoco Tribune - News and
Opinion Pieces about Venezuela and Beyond.
https://orinocotribune.com/nato-2030-a-desperate-plan-to-try-to-preserve-us-imperialist-hegemony/

The technocrats of the NATO empire have frantically been trying to
reverse the damage, to patch up the strained imperial alliances and
restore the paradigm of 20th century liberal hegemony. When Henry
Kissinger talks about how important it is to "safeguard the principles
of the liberal world order," he's talking about stopping the imperialist
contradiction which Stalin described from incurably destabilizing the
U.S.-centered corporatocracy.

And [[NATO encapsulates]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[desire for retaining
imperial unity and control]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Strategic thinkers
within the global imperialist elite believe that the imperialist powers
will need to cooperate in order to have a better chance of subduing the
rising anti-imperialist powers.]{.underline}]{.mark} It's why Andrés
Oppenheimer, the editor of the empire-loving Miami Herald, agrees with
Stoltenberg in that Trump's ultra-nationalist strategy harms U.S.
foreign policy goals. Oppenheimer and the rest of the anti-Trump
neoconservative intelligentsia have thus been hoping for a Biden
victory, believing Biden's approach of international cooperation would
make Washington better able to achieve regime change in Venezuela and to
counter the rise of Russia and China.

But the power of Republican voter suppression, as well as the largely
reactionary nature of the U.S. voting population, make me highly
doubtful that they'll succeed in ousting Trump. The capitalist
contradictions of the U.S. will continue to translate into an
increasingly fractured world order. The reactionary nationalism of
countries like Britain will continue to result in deteriorating
proletarian conditions throughout the neoliberal world, especially
within the core imperialist countries. Expanding NATO to the U.S.
loyalist states within the Pacific hemisphere isn't going to undo these
processes within the collapse of global capitalism, any more than it's
going to stop the trend towards a multi-polar world where China is the
strongest power.

This is why the [[NATO technocrats aim to continue intensifying
anti-Chinese and anti-Russian propaganda, tightening censorship, and
making the countries they control more militarized; the heightening of
the capitalist and imperialist]{.underline}]{.mark} contradictions
result in a greater potential for proletarian uprising.

#### Growth in NATO influence will allow leaders to tighten grasp of global security preventing other nations from surpassing their political influence.

The U.S.-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) has lost its purpose to continue as a
defence alliance. However, its [[aggressive expansion is endangering
world peace and the survival of the planet.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Despite its irrelevant role, [[NATO has become part of the U.S.
military]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead of dismantling the once defence
alliance, [[the U.S. pushed to enlarge NATO and expand its
boundaries.]{.underline}]{.mark} The U.S. has lured most European
nations, including former Warsaw Pact members, the so-called "New
Europe", to join its military. Poland, Hungry and the Czech Republic
joined in 1999; Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuanian, Estonia, Slovakia and
Romania in 2004, others are waiting in line. Becoming a NATO member
proves to be a profit bonanza for U.S.-Israeli weapon industries and arm
dealers. All new recruits into NATO are obliged to increase their
"defence" budgets to modernise and enlarge their military arsenals at
the expense of vital public services.

[[Engineering and using crisis in Europe and elsewhere, the U.S.
cancelled the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) in order to locate
ABMs and to lure more nations to sign up for the system, including
Australia, South Korea and Japan.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Under the
fraudulent pretext of defence against "rogue" states, the U.S. has just
signed a "deal" with Poland to station on Polish soil U.S. "interceptor
missiles"]{.underline}]{.mark}. The provocative deal is seen by Russians
as a dangerous opportunity for the U.S. to expand its military presence
and threat across the world. Poland hailed the deal as a counter to
Russian "threat". Of course Poland is fully aware that the missiles are
against Russia not Iran, as the U.S. continues to mislead the public.
After Poland, the U.S. is planning to build a twin anti-missile radar
system in the Czech Republic. Many Poles as well as Czechs are against
the deals and rightly believe their countries are becoming vassal states
of a dangerous U.S. militarism.

[[Since the end of the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [["Cold War", the
U.S. aim has always been a quest for imperialist domination of the globe
through U.S. militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the
establishment of U.S. military bases in strategic areas of the world.
The U.S. policy of destabilising Russia and undermining Russia's
integration with Europe is aimed at controlling Eurasia's natural
resources . The events of 9/11 provided the U.S. with a pretext to
justify the U.S. war on Islam and a global imperialist expansion.

World peace is greatly served by multilateralism and international
institutions without an aggressive U.S. military expansion. [[The

## 2 NC/1NR Impact extensions -- NATO expansion bad for economy

#### Continued support for the NATO alliance will force members into difficult political and economic positions. 

**Dr. Roberts, 2020.** (Peter, professor at Emory University's
Goizueta Business SchoolNATO 2030: Difficult Times Ahead. (n.d.).

Amidst the national angst around the coronavirus pandemic response,
the [speech](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_176197.htm) by
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on 8 June 2020 did not make
headlines -- perhaps it should have done.

[[In outlining his vision for NATO in 2030, Stoltenberg focused on
increasing the political and economic unity and impact of the
Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}, and doing so
[[globally]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than simply in a European or
North Atlantic context. Such language is exactly what the US was
lobbying for at the [leaders' meeting in
London](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_171584.htm) in
December 2019: a refocusing and appreciation of the role China has been
playing in global security challenges. This is a bold plan in the face
of various [European economic tie-ins with
China](https://asiatimes.com/2020/06/china-germany-ties-in-new-cold-war-spotlight/).
It also comes at an opportune moment, as President Donald Trump
has [ordered](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-06/trump-s-troop-plan-stuns-germany-and-rocks-the-postwar-order) the
withdrawal of more US troops from European soil, a move which has been
met with unusual criticism from [European
politicians](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-plan-pull-us-troops-germany-putin-dangerous-game-2020-6?r=US&IR=T) and [former
US military
staff](https://www.stripes.com/news/europe/trump-directs-pentagon-to-pull-9-500-troops-from-germany-report-says-1.632622).

Whilst Stoltenberg focused on political unity and the potential economic
levers of a united Alliance, there are a number of military changes that
are being developed and reviewed over this summer. [[The new NATO
military strategy achieved approval in May 2019 and SACEUR (NATO's
senior warfighting commander) is drafting a new Operational Concept of
Deterrence and Defence]{.underline}]{.mark} and a new NATO Warfighting
Capability Concept is also in
the [works](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_175792.htm?selectedLocale=en).

These plans are perhaps an attempt to shift the Alliance's military
planning from one that is capability-based (a concept that tries to have
a smattering of every military capability available, including some new
ones), to one that is threat-based (a concept that looks specifically at
competitors and builds/develops capabilities designed to counteract any
weaknesses and build on opportunities for advantage).

Currently, NATO is driven by the equipment states have determined they
need (or wish to retain), and will make available to NATO. [[The new
concept]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[prioritise and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[presumably encourage states to change their priorities in favour of
those the Alliance determines as important]{.underline}]{.mark}. What is
difficult to imagine is how SACEUR will reconcile the ability to
generate these forces with national prioritisation and deployment of
forces by individual states: this is a fundamental dilemma that will
need to be overcome if the concepts are to be useful.

The Trade-offs for Member States

[[For individual member states, this will lead to some tough choices,
and questions over the prioritisation of investment
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}. If, for example, the UK decided -- in
its [paused Integrated
Review](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/04/15/uk-hits-pause-on-defense-review-due-to-coronavirus/) --
to move away from [heavy-armour
formations](https://www.rusi.org/publication/rusi-newsbrief/war-without-tanks) in
favour of lighter and more manoeuvrable forces, this impacts on any NATO
plan for a heavy deterrence capability to match that of Russia. [[The
implication is that decisions will need to determine whether NATO is
actually important enough to skew internal, sovereign policy decisions,
or whether a balance can be struck.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### NATO's European expansion exacerbates regional instability while creating a financial burden for the U.S.

The costs to the region are not simply monetary. By [[admitting certain
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} before others, [[NATO would sharpen
already existing divisions in the region]{.underline}]{.mark}--between
the more prosperous North and the less prosperous South, between Eastern
Europe and the struggling countries of the former Soviet Union. This
division in particular threatens Ukraine, whose eastern half contains a
large ethnic Russian population. Russia simply cannot countenance the
absorption of Ukraine into a Western security alliance. Ukraine itself
suspects that it will be allowed to slip into the Russian sphere of
influence in exchange for Russia's approval of Visegrad Four membership
in NATO. The Clinton administration's preference for limited
expansion--a "two-community solution"--would draw new lines of
demarcation through an already conflicted region.

[[Should NATO pursue membership for the region as a whole, a new set of
problems arise]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, how would NATO handle
already existing conflicts--between Hungary and Romania, Hungary and
Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine, Ukraine and Russia, Estonia and Russia?
To date, only Greece and Turkey maintain a substantial rift within the
alliance. Could the alliance survive a new set of fault lines? [[Finally
there are the costs to the U.S. of NATO expansion. According to the CBO,
incorporation of just the Visegrad Four would cost an additional \$60 to
\$125 billion over 15 years. The bill for the U.S. would be \$5 to \$19
billion--but only if the Visegrad Four covered a substantial portion of
the upgrade, an implausible scenario.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The countries of East-Central Europe largely favor joining NATO. The
region has been promised a great deal in terms of European integration
and Western aid, but integration remains in limbo, and Western aid has
not been forthcoming in large quantities. Sadly, NATO expansion has
become a substitute for more substantial political and economic
integration into the West, which is what East-Central Europe really
desires.

Lost in the discussion of NATO expansion is the obvious question: is the
alliance still necessary after the end of the cold war? The [[risks
outlined above seem to outweigh any possible benefits for postcommunist
Europe.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In an event from this June that was sponsored by the neoconservative
think tank the Atlantic Council, NATO's General Secretary Jens

to absorb Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and south Korea into NATO, as
well as to expand NATO's influence beyond a mere military role and also
make it a tool for influencing the wider political spheres of the
countries under its jurisdiction.]{.underline}]{.mark} Stoltenberg's
explanation for this project's existence was perfectly reflective of the
recent liberal push against Trumpian nationalist isolationism: "we must
resist the temptation of national solutions and we must live up to our
values: freedom, democracy and the rule of law. To do this, we must stay
strong militarily, be more united politically and take a broader
approach globally."

This plan isn't just about securing imperial cooperation within the
region where the U.S. is expanding its military buildup against China.
It's about trying to bypass one of the great contradictions of
imperialism, which is the tendency of the imperialist powers to fight
among themselves amid their quests for domination. In The Foundations of
Leninism, Stalin described this dynamic as:

The contradiction among the various financial groups and imperialist
Powers in their struggle for sources of raw materials, for foreign
territory. Imperialism is the export of capital to the sources of raw
materials, the frenzied struggle for monopolist possession of these
sources, the struggle for a re-division of the already divided world, a
struggle waged with particular fury by new financial groups and Powers
seeking a "place in the sun" against the old groups and Powers, which
cling tenaciously to what they have seized. This frenzied struggle among
the various groups of capitalists is notable in that it includes as an
inevitable element imperialist wars, wars for the annexation of foreign
territory. This circumstance, in its turn, is notable in that it leads
to the mutual weakening of the imperialists, to the weakening of the
position of capitalism in general, to the acceleration of the advent of
the proletarian revolution and to the practical necessity of this
revolution.

#### The continuation of NATO expansion disrupts global demilitarization efforts. 

**Feffer, 1996.** (John,  director of Foreign Policy in Focus at the
Institute for Policy Studies, November 1.) The Costs and Dangers of NATO
Expansion. Institute for Policy Studies.
https://ips-dc.org/the_costs_and_dangers_of_nato_expansion/

Although a member of PFP, [[Russia has]{.underline}]{.mark} steadfastly
[[opposed NATO expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Virtually all political
forces within the country view this policy as an encirclement, a
containment that will lead to greater isolation.
[[Thus]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia [[is particularly sensitive about
the inclusion of bordering countries--the Baltics, Ukraine,
Moldova]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Should the Baltic countries join NATO,
Russian officials hinted that they would counter with troop
concentrations or tactical nuclear weapons on the
border]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[thus decreasing]{.underline}]{.mark}, not
increasing, [[security in the region.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Yeltsin
government also threatened to scuttle key arms control agreements such
as START II, CFE, and INF. Since Russia poses a considerably diminished
security threat to Europe (see In Focus: U.S.-Russian Relations),
[[expansion is an aggressive act that threatens to undo decades of
security cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} and tilt Russia closer toward
considering an anti-Western alliance with China or pariah states such as
Iraq.

Even if Russia should suddenly change its mind, [[NATO
expansion]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[represents a step backward for
Eastern and Central Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the heels of Soviet
withdrawal, expansion [[would reverse the trend toward demilitarization
in the region]{.underline}]{.mark}. New NATO members would have to
devote enormous funds to buy the weapons and communication systems
necessary to mesh with the Western command structure--an increase by one
estimate of at least 60 percent and possibly 80 percent over current
military expenditures. These defense budget hikes would put enormous
pressure on strained budgets and divert money from the reform of
productive sectors at a time when the region is cutting its military
spending (Hungary has pared its defense spending by 60 percent since
1988, Poland by 44 percent). [[Expansion will also undo the
steps]{.underline}]{.mark}, however tentative, that these countries have
[[taken toward military conversion.]{.underline}]{.mark}

NATO has promised to pick up some of the bill, but this aid would be
earmarked for military expenditures rather than critical economic or
civic reform. U.S. policy is driven in part by domestic considerations:
new NATO members would be prime markets for U.S. arms exports (F-16 and
F-18 fighter aircraft and Cobra attack helicopters have already been
offered to the region). Yet, even with NATO subsidies and weapons
giveaways from the Pentagon, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
estimates that the Visegrad Four would still be unable to afford the
necessary modernization.

## 2 AC -- NATO imperialism inevitable

## 2 AC No link -- military race inevitable

#### The Cold War era came to an end in the late 1990s but Russian militaristic growth continues, race to the top persists regardless to action of the AFF.

Josh **Holder**, Scott **Reinhard**, and Michael **Schwirtz**, **2022**.
(Jan, 27.) 2022.)
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/27/world/europe/russia-forces.html

A build-up of Russian forces near the border with Ukraine has raised
concerns among Western and Ukrainian officials that the Kremlin might be
preparing for significant military action, possibly an invasion. This
map, compiled by The New York Times, shows troops, tanks and heavy
artillery moving into positions that threaten to widen the conflict in
Ukraine's east and potentially open a new front on Ukraine's northern
border, closer to the capital, Kyiv. From there, they can also menace
the countries on NATO's eastern flank.

[[Russia currently has about 130,000 troops on the Ukraine
border]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Ukraine's military[[. U.S.
intelligence agencies have assessed that the Kremlin
has]{.underline}]{.mark} drawn up [[plans for a military operation
involving]{.underline}]{.mark} up to [[175,000
troops]{.underline}]{.mark} that could begin in the coming weeks. While
it is not clear whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has
decided to launch an attack --- and Moscow has said repeatedly in recent
weeks that it has no plans to do so --- analysts say the country is well
on its way toward constructing the architecture needed for a significant
military intervention in Ukraine.

Much of the buildup so far, according to officials and military
analysts, has involved troops and equipment that take time to deploy,
including tanks and heavy armor, some of which have traveled by train
from bases as far away as Siberia.

Before launching a significant military operation, Russia needs to
deploy reserve soldiers and logistical infrastructure, like field
hospitals, that until recently appeared to be missing from positions
near Ukraine, analysts say. But these elements along with additional
troops have been moving into some areas of Russian deployment, Ukrainian
and western officials say.

Much of the attention so far has been directed at the buildup of forces
near two breakaway provinces ineastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk,
where the Ukrainian military has been at war with Russian-backed
separatists since 2014. The separatist forces, which include Russian
troops and Ukrainian fighters opposed to Kyiv's rule, number about
30,000, according to an assessment by the Ukrainian military.

[[Since the start of 2021, Russia has moved an additional five battalion
tactical groups into the border area near Luhansk and Donetsk,
including]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[5,000 soldiers sent to reinforce
the 12,000]{.mark}]{.underline} or so [[stationed there
permanently]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Ukrainian authorities.

Just as significant, according to officials and military analysts, are
the forces massing north of Ukraine in areas such as Klintsy, at the
point where the Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian borders meet[[. Russia
has also begun ferrying troops, armor, fighter jets and advanced
antiaircraft systems into Belarus, a Russian ally and Ukraine's northern
neighbor]{.underline}]{.mark}, putting a growing force within range of
Kyiv. Russia's Defense Ministry says the buildup in Belarus is purely
for military exercises scheduled to begin Feb. 10. But, American
officials and NATO say these exercises could be a pretext for deploying
troops meant to threaten Ukraine and put NATO allies on edge.

## 2 AC Impact turn -- Tech Collaboration

#### NATO members are work collaboratively to invent new technology and methods to strengthen cybersecurity on a united front. 

**NATO**, **2022.** (Last updated March, 23.) NATO Cyber defense
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm

Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive
and coercive, and are becoming ever more frequent. [[NATO will continue
to adapt to the evolving cyber threat landscape. NATO and its Allies
rely on strong and resilient cyber defences to fulfil the Alliance's
core tasks of collective defence]{.underline}]{.mark}, crisis management
and cooperative security. The Alliance needs to be prepared to defend
its networks and operations against the growing sophistication of the
cyber threats it faces.

Cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective defence.

[[NATO Allies have affirmed that international law applies in
cyberspace.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[NATO\'s main focus in cyber defence is to protect its own networks,
operate in cyberspace (including through the Alliance's operations and
missions), help Allies to enhance their national resilience and provide
a platform for political consultation and collective
action.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In July 2016, Allies reaffirmed NATO's defensive mandate and recognised
cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as
effectively as it does in the air, on land and at sea.

Allies also made a Cyber Defence Pledge in July 2016 to enhance their
cyber defences, and have continued to bolster their national resilience
as a matter of priority.

NATO reinforces its cyber capabilities, including through education,
training and exercises.

[[Allies are committed to enhancing information-sharing and mutual
assistance in preventing, mitigating and recovering from cyber
attacks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are on standby 24 hours a day to assist
Allies, if requested and approved.

In February 2019, Allies endorsed a NATO guide that sets out a number of
tools to further strengthen NATO's ability to respond to significant
malicious cumulative cyber activities.

NATO is intensifying its cooperation with industry through the NATO
Industry Cyber Partnership.

At the 2021 NATO Summit in Brussels, Allies endorsed a new Comprehensive
Cyber Defence Policy, which supports NATO's core tasks and overall
deterrence and defence posture to enhance further the Alliance's
resilience.

[[Allies are promoting a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace, and
pursuing efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} by supporting international law and
voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. 

## 2 AC Impact turn -- U.S. cyber freedom

#### Americans are able to roam the cyberspace freely, the U.S. is determined to provide the same access to the rest of the world allowing suppressed groups to fight for their freedom. 

The **United States Agency for Global Media** Retrieved June 16, 2022,
from https://www.usagm.gov/office-internet-freedom/

[[Since 2002, USAGM has been involved in activities to circumvent
internet censorship by foreign governments]{.underline}]{.mark} in order
[[to distribute news content and better provide a forum for free
expression in closed societies.]{.underline}]{.mark} This portfolio has
since grown to be an increasingly critical component of the agency's
ability to fulfill its mission to "inform, engage, and connect people
around the world in support of freedom and democracy."   

USAGM has supported internet freedom projects through the Office of
Internet Freedom (formerly the Internet Anti-Censorship Division) and
the Open Technology Fund (OTF), USAGM's newest non-profit grantee.  The
USAGM's internet freedom program supports, per congressional
appropriations guidance, global internet freedom for the expansion of
unrestricted access to information on the internet.  [[Over the past
seven years, USAGM has invested more than \$100 million in projects to
promote internet freedom in the world's most restricted
environments.]{.underline}]{.mark}  Together, these programs have
supported the tools and systems necessary for USAGM networks to report
and disseminate content in information-restrictive markets, and for
USAGM audiences to receive and share content safely online.    

While previously OIF directly supported certain circumvention at-scale
projects, OTF now supports all the agency's internet freedom needs.
OIF's role is to maintain a strong partnership with OTF, to provide
oversight to ensure continued OTF compliance with relevant rules and
regulations in the execution of congressionally mandated use of internet
freedom funds for technology projects, ensure uninterrupted
circumvention services for USAGM entities and their training needs,
provide critical field-driven feedback loop, and manage the assessment
of particular OTF projects to inform USAGM strategy and oversight.   

## 2 AC No impact -- No nuclear war

#### Nuclear war unlikely, even Russia understandings this is the last resort. 

**Valenti**, **2022**. (Maggie, April 14). How Likely Is A Nuclear War
In Europe? Russian Officials Make Threats Amid Risk Of NATO Expansion.
International Business Times.
https://www.ibtimes.com/how-likely-nuclear-war-europe-russian-officials-make-threats-amid-risk-nato-expansion-3474683

Russian officials have taken a step towards [threatening nuclear
war](https://www.ibtimes.com/russia-warns-nuclear-deployment-if-sweden-finland-join-nato-3474026),
warning that if Sweden and Finland join NATO, Russia will place nuclear
weapons in the Baltic region.

[[Russian officials have previously stated that if Russia\'s existence
or territory is threatened, nuclear weapons are an
option.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Keeping nuclear weapons in the Baltic --- [specifically in
Russian-controlled Kaliningrad, which sits between Poland and
Lithuania](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaliningrad,+Kaliningrad+Oblast,+Russia/@54.6849238,20.4501385,13.83z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46e33d8d4b7c21a9:0x5050960016126ed3!8m2!3d54.7104264!4d20.4522144) --- as
Russian officials have recently threatened, would make it easier for
Russia to target Western countries.

[[However, threats like these are not uncommon from
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and nuclear weapons have previously been in
the region.

Sweden and Finland are near Baltic countries and have held onto
neutrality for a long time, but since have reconsidered their positions
after Russia invaded Ukraine. Finland also shares an 830-mile border
with Russia and currently around half of the world\'s nuclear weapons
are owned by Russia.

[[Despite the threats of nuclear war, events like the Cuban Missile
crisis, [North
Korea](https://www.ibtimes.com/north-koreas-tests-stir-nuclear-debate-south-3473751)n
aggression, and Russian threats, governments have not used nuclear
weapons during a war since World War II]{.underline}]{.mark}. IN 1945,
the U.S. dropped bombs on two Japanese cities, [[Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.underline}]{.mark}, in [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} first and
[[only time these weapons were used]{.mark}]{.underline} during a war.

Even with the recent heightening of Russian aggression, multiple people
have been quick to say that [[Russian President Vladimir Putin is
bluffing]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[that nuclear war is not in his best
interest.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[\"This threat of escalation . . . is cheap talk.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Putin is bluffing[[. He is]{.underline}]{.mark} deliberately [[allowing
the U.S. intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} community [[to discover data
about escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [[to scare us away from
helping Ukrainians win]{.underline}]{.mark},\" [Michael McFaul wrote in
an opinion column for the Washington
Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/13/west-help-ukraine-win-next-phase-russia/)

McFaul argues that the U.S. and Western allies are not doing more to
help Ukraine, including providing certain weapons out of fear of Russian
escalation. He believes they should be doing more to ensure Ukraine\'s
victory and should ignore Putin\'s threats.

[[\"Putin is angry and unhinged, but not
suicidal,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} he added.

NATO Secretary-General has [called Putin\'s threats of
escalation](https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-tells-putin-stop-nuclear-saber-rattling-amid-ukraine-war-2022-3) \"nuclear
saber-rattling.\"

[[\"Nuclear war can not be won and it could never be
fought,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} he said.

## 2 AC Answers to -- Economic impact

#### European countries are hesitant to increase military spending to support NATO's expansion agenda. 

**Dr. Roberts, 2020.** (Peter, professor at Emory University's
Goizueta Business SchoolNATO 2030: Difficult Times Ahead. (n.d.).
Rusi.Org.
<https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/nato-2030-difficult-times-ahead>

[[Across the Alliance, striking]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[balance is a
dilemma that can become divisive]{.underline}]{.mark}, as [[some members
step up to the fighting part of the requirement, whilst others focus on
the high-tech]{.underline}]{.mark} (but much safer) part.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} relative [[investments might be equal in
national treasure, but the difference in risk]{.underline}]{.mark} to
personnel [[will be significant.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Should the UK make unilateral decisions (for example on potentially
scrapping the Army's heavy-armoured capability), it will be tempting for
the government to argue that the additional capabilities of British
Carrier Strike capability, or large numbers of F35s, drones, or new
surveillance capabilities, along with a healthy research and development
financial allocation, outweigh the potential drawbacks from the removal
of tanks from its commitment to NATO's Order of Battle. The reality,
however, is that those new capabilities will not buy out that commitment
of a heavy armour formation in the land domain, specifically aimed at
countering Russian armoured strength. A NATO threat-based model of force
design and employment is realistic and desirable in the current
competition against Russia, but cannot be achieved unless member states
also adopt the same concept. A divergence in the philosophy of force
designs between member states and NATO will mean that the Alliance can
generate neither a capability-based force, nor one that matches the
threat, [leaving the organisation in a worse position than it is
already](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/12/05/commentary/world-commentary/trump-least-natos-problems/#.XuIFBS-ZOfU).

[[If Stoltenberg is serious about making these military changes, as well
as the political and economic ones, he will need to make a more
convincing argument to major contributors]{.underline}]{.mark} (the US,
France, the UK, and Germany) [[that their defence budgets and
procurement plans need to be NATO-centric]{.underline}]{.mark}, and not
merely where national defence plans conveniently coincide with NATO's.
[[The speed of development of these states is much faster than many
other Alliance member states can afford]{.underline}]{.mark}, or have
planned for. Yet more transformation might be needed, and there is the
risk of developing a three-speed NATO, with the staggering pace of US
military development, the slower pace of similar trends in the UK,
France and potentially Germany, and the more measured speed of other
Allies, which will be largely determined by broad national economic
trends and budget allocations.

## 2 AC Answers to - Cyber attack 

#### The U.S. is prepared for Russian cyber attacks. 

[**Blinken**, **2022**. (Antony J. Secretary of
State,](https://www.state.gov/biographies/antony-j-blinken/) May 10.)
Attribution of Russia's Malicious Cyber Activity Against Ukraine. United
States Department of State.
https://www.state.gov/attribution-of-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-against-ukraine/

The United States is joining with allies and partners to condemn
Russia's destructive cyber activities against Ukraine.  [[In the months
leading up to and after Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} illegal further
[[invasion]{.underline}]{.mark} began, [[Ukraine experienced a series of
disruptive cyber operations, including website defacements, distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and cyber attacks
to]{.underline}]{.mark} delete data from [[computers belonging to
government and private entities]{.mark}]{.underline} -- all part of the
Russian playbook.  For example, the United States has assessed
that Russian military cyber operators have deployed multiple families of
destructive wiper malware, including WhisperGate, on Ukrainian
Government and private sector networks.  These disruptive cyber
operations began in January 2022, prior to Russia's illegal further
invasion of Ukraine and have continued throughout the war.

Today, in support of the European Union and other partners, [[the United
States is sharing publicly its assessment that Russia launched cyber
attacks in late February against commercial satellite communications
networks to disrupt Ukrainian command]{.underline}]{.mark} and control
during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other
European countries.  The activity disabled very small aperture terminals
in Ukraine and across Europe.  This includes tens of thousands of
terminals outside of Ukraine that, among other things, support wind
turbines and provide Internet services to private citizens.

As nations committed to upholding the rules-based international order in
cyberspace, [[the United States and its allies and partners are taking
steps to defend against Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} irresponsible
[[actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The U.S. Government has developed new
mechanisms to help Ukraine identify cyber threats and
recover]{.underline}]{.mark} from cyber incidents. [[We have also
enhanced our support]{.underline}]{.mark} for Ukraine's digital
connectivity, including [[by providing satellite phones and data
terminals to Ukrainian government officials, essential service
providers, and critical infrastructure operators.]{.underline}]{.mark}
We praise Ukraine's efforts---both in and outside of government---to
defend against and recover from such activity, even as its country is
under physical attack.
