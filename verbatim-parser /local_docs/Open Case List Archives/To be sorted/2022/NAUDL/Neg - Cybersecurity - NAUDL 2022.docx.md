# CyberSecurity NEG

The [goal]{.underline} of the negative is simple: Negate the plan of
action presented by the affirmative, explain why the affirmative is a
bad idea, and present new arguments which serve as reasons why the
affirmative will make the status quo WORSE. If the judge believes the
plan will not work or make the status quo worse, then neg wins

**\
Speaking Roles on the Negative:**

- **1^st^ Negative Speaker:** Your job is to introduce a range of
  negative arguments in the 1NC, and to definitively win at least one of
  those arguments in the 1NR.

- **2^nd^ Negative Speaker:** Your job is to expand upon one or two
  arguments made in the 1NC, then to choose the best argument made by
  the negative team and show why the negative should win the debate in
  the 2NR. You are in charge of choosing negative strategy, since you'll
  have to explain it in the 2NR

**Phases of a Debate:**

1.  **1NC:** Outline a few different reasons why the affirmative is a
    bad idea, without going into too much detail on any one of them.

2.  **2NC/1NR:** Think of these as a single speech, given by different
    people. [Each debater should choose one or two (different) arguments
    from the 1NC and go into greater detail,]{.underline} explaining and
    adding evidence when needed.

3.  **2NR:** The second negative speaker should give a closing argument
    all about the strongest negative position (after hearing the
    affirmative speak in the 1AR). Tell the judge why the negative team
    should win.

Each negative case will have four main parts. You'll have to win each
piece in order to win a debate as the negative.

- **Solvency:** How will the plan work? Will the affirmative solve what
  it is they are attempting to solve with their advantages? Will there
  be a different consequence if the affirmative is passed? In the
  context of the Cybersecurity negative file, will cooperation with NATO
  truly solve diplomatic issues with Russia, low voter turnout, and
  social media misinformation? Will this trigger conflict with other
  nations?

- **Case impacts/defense:** These are arguments saying the impacts the
  affirmative claims to solve are not correct.

- **Case turns:** These arguments are negative consequences if the
  affirmative were to pass. In this instance, will US cooperation with
  NATO, in turn, somehow worsen international relations with Russia war?

- **Impact Framing:** These arguments answer the moral obligation claims
  the affirmative makes. How long will it take for the affirmative
  impacts to be solved? How many people does the affirmative claim to
  aid? How probable are the affirmative impacts?

You and your partner will have a chance to support your arguments and
read more evidence in the block (13-minute stretch of neg speeches, i.e.
2NC + 1NR).

**Topic Introduction:**

The cybersecurity affirmative offers that we increase cooperation with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in cybersecurity.
Currently the United States is a member of NATO, but has not made any
efforts to include them in U.S. cybersecurity efforts or tried to join
theirs. The United States is one of the strongest nations in cyber space
but is not the most protected. With the growing cyber-attacks from
Russia, growing distrust in US political processes, and spread of
misinformation on social media platforms, the U.S. needs to increase
their security methods via cooperation with NATO. NATO is working on a
new program for cyber protection and the U.S. should incorporate that in
their own defenses.

The Biden Administration has made cybersecurity one of their top goals
for the United States, and the AFF argues that working with NATO would
fulfill that goal. This file contains the arguments to negate these
claims.

## Strategic Overview

The negative version of this file has a few different avenues to take,
pending the way the affirmative is constructed in the round. Every
advantage is formulated so you can read every card in that section. A
lot of the evidence is centered around the lack of consequences left by
cyberattacks, the ongoing efforts by private companies to strengthen
cybersecurity in the status quo, and alternative causes to impacts the
affirmative claims to solve. Breakdown below:

#### COVID-19 Advantage

a.  This is a very short advantage with a defensive response. The
    affirmative claims the "work-from-home" culture has increased since
    the start of the pandemic and, thus, exacerbates the need for
    stronger cybersecurity.

b.  The negative argues that hackers have cost private companies
    millions of dollars which has already forced their hand to improve
    their cybersecurity (Tulane University 22)

    i.  [This is in direct response to the affirmative's Meiger 22
        evidence]{.underline}

#### Russia Advantage

a.  The affirmative claims having a strong cybersecurity front will
    prevent escalation to war between the US and Russia

b.  The negative argues that the consequences of cyberattacks are
    greatly exaggerated and will not trigger an act of war (Blessing
    4/25)

    i.  [This is a direct response to the affirmative's second Meiger 22
        evidence]{.underline}

c.  In addition, the negative presents the argument that if we treat
    every cyberattack as an act of war, it delegitimizes efforts against
    acts of violence all over the globe

#### Civic Engagement Advantage

a.  The affirmative claims hackers and cyber threats have compromised
    the integrity of democracy and the election process. This results in
    election mistrust and low voter turnout, particularly for people of
    color.

b.  The negative makes 2 important arguments on this advantage

    i.  First, voter turnout for people of color is actually INCREASING
        since the 2016 election (Frey 3/9). [This is a direct response
        to the affirmative's American Bar Association 20
        evidence]{.underline}

    ii. Second, the negative claims voter turnout is fueled by changing
        demographics in the US, and not by perception of the election
        process (Frey 3/9)

#### Social Media Misinformation Advantage

a.  The affirmative's story on this advantage is most Americans get
    their news from social media platforms, most of which are comprised
    by fake/unreliable news planted by hackers via cyber attacks

b.  The negative argues there is an alternative cause to fake news, and
    that's the lack of regulation and fact checking on the social media
    platforms' behalf

c.  In addition, the negative claims social media algorithms promote
    whatever has the most outrage, regardless of reliability/accuracy
    (Stewart 20)

    i.  [These arguments will directly clash with the affirmative's
        Greenburg 20 evidence]{.underline} by presenting alternative
        factors which will prevent the affirmative from making any
        substantial/successful improvement

#### Russian cyberattacks forces US to advance cybersecurity

[Acting to counter Russia's aggressive use of cyberattacks across Europe
and around the world, [the U.S. is expected to announce that,]{.mark} if
asked, [it will use its formidable cyberwarfare capabilities on NATO's
behalf]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a senior U.S. official. The
announcement is expected in the coming days as U.S. Defense Secretary
Jim Mattis attends a meeting of NATO defense ministers on Wednesday and
Thursday. Katie Wheelbarger, the principal deputy assistant defense
secretary for international security affairs, said [[the U.S. is
committing to use offensive and defensive cyber operations for NATO
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, but America will maintain control over its
own personnel and capabilities. The decision comes on the heels of the
NATO summit in July, when members agreed to allow the alliance to use
cyber capabilities that are provided voluntarily by allies to protect
networks and respond to cyberattacks. It reflects growing concerns by
the U.S. and its allies over Moscow's use of cyber operations to
influence elections in America and elsewhere. "Russia is constantly
pushing its cyber and information operations," said Wheelbarger, adding
that this is a way for the U.S. to show its continued commitment to
NATO. [NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on
Wednesday that [the inclusion of offensive cyber operations in alliance
missions "is just one of many elements in our strengthened NATO cyber
defenses]{.mark}." And he said that it's important to have cyber
capabilities that can be used against the Islamic State group to destroy
the networks they use for recruiting, financing and
communicating]{.underline}. He said that the British and Denmark have
also agreed to make cyber contributions to NATO and he expects other
allies will follow. "We have seen an increasing number of cyber-attacks.
They are more frequent, they are more sophisticated," Stoltenberg said.
["We see cyber being used to meddle in domestic political processes,
attacks against critical infrastructure. Cyber will be an integral part
of any future military conflict]{.underline}." Wheelbarger told
reporters traveling to NATO with Mattis that the move is a signal to
other nations that NATO is prepared to counter cyberattacks waged
against the alliance or its members. [[Much like America's nuclear
capabilities, the formal declaration of cyber support can help serve as
a military deterrent to other nations and
adversaries]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. has, for some time,
considered cyber as a warfighting domain, much like air, sea, space and
ground operations. In recent weeks the Pentagon released a new
cybersecurity strategy that maps out a more aggressive use of military
cyber capabilities.

####  US already increasing efforts and cooperation with NATO on cybersecurity

**Baldor, 18 \--** Baldor, L. C. (2018, October 3). *US to offer
cyberwar capabilities to NATO allies*. AP NEWS. Retrieved June 16, 2022,

And it specifically calls out Russia and China for their use of
cyberattacks. China, it said, has been "persistently" stealing data from
the public and private sector to gain an economic advantage. And it said
Russia has use cyber information operations to "influence our population
and challenge our diplomatic processes." U.S. officials have repeatedly
accused Moscow of interfering in the 2016 elections, including through
online social media. ["**[We will conduct cyberspace operations to
collect intelligence and prepare military cyber capabilities to be used
in the event of a crisis or conflict]{.mark}**," the new strategy
states, adding that t[he U.S. is prepared to use cyberwarfare along with
other military weapons against its enemies when needed, including to
counter malicious cyber activities targeting the country. The document
adds that the Pentagon will "work to strengthen the capacity" of allies
and partners.]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO has moved cautiously on
offensive cyber capabilities. At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, allies
recognized cyberspace as a warfighting domain. It has said that a
computer-based attack on an ally would trigger NATO's commitment to
defend its members. And last year the alliance agreed to create a new
cyber operations center. [But the focus has always been on defending
NATO networks and those of its members, not offensive
cyberwar]{.underline}. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on
Tuesday that the defense ministers will have a working session this week
to address cyber and other risks, and how allies can cooperate to
counter such threats. He did not provide details.

#### Data breaches cost companies millions -- they are already expanding cybersecurity and include those who work from home

**Tulane University, 22 \--** Tulane University. (2022). *Four Reasons
the Cybersecurity Field is Rapidly Growing*. Tulane University: School
of Professional Advancement. Retrieved June 17, 2022, from
https://sopa.tulane.edu/blog/four-reasons-cybersecurity-field-rapidly-growing

In recent years, many high-profile data breach cases have made
headlines. Companies like Yahoo!, Uber, and Target faced security
threats that exposed possibly millions of Americans\' private
information like usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. [[As
hackers and cybercriminals develop new ways to access sensitive systems
and information, even the largest companies in the world must stay
vigilant about security vulnerabilities. Information security analysts,
or cybersecurity specialists, are more in demand than
ever]{.underline}]{.mark}, and here's why. Hackers Are Getting Smarter
[Hackers find new ways to access data every day]{.underline}. The role
of an information security analyst is to identify security risks before
hackers do. They then develop and implement new preventative security
controls for defending against cyberattacks. As hackers' skills become
more sophisticated, a growing number of cybersecurity specialists are
needed to develop and implement advanced security solutions. Earn Your
Master in Cybersecurity
Management<https://sopa.tulane.edu/blog/four-reasons-cybersecurity-field-rapidly-growing>
Cybercrime Is Expensive One reason the cybersecurity field is growing is
that most businesses simply can't afford a data breach. [According to
IBM, [data breaches cost businesses an average of \$3.62
million]{.mark}---a number that can put many companies out of business.
The number of data breaches and the cost of cybercrime worldwide have
also rapidly increased]{.underline}: the total cost by 2021 is expected
to be double that of 2015. When a company's future is on the line, it
can't afford to not hire the best information security analysts to
defend its information. Everything Is Automated As companies' processes
become automated, more of their infrastructure is rooted in technology.
Every automated system is created by code that can be accessed when
cybercriminals break in. Thus, the more processes that are done
digitally, the more opportunities hackers get to steal private
information. This is bad news for businesses, but good news for
[Cybersecurity
Management](https://sopa.tulane.edu/degrees-programs/masters-degrees/master-professional-studies-cybersecurity-management)
graduates who find an increasing demand for their skills.
Vulnerabilities Are Everywhere Hackers aren't just targeting computers,
websites, and servers; any technology based in code offers an
opportunity in. From airplane systems and car alarms to power grids and
security systems, more products and systems than ever before are at risk
for takeover by cybercrooks. Businesses need the best online security
professionals to identify and mitigate security threats for every
technological innovation. Career Outlook for Cybersecurity Professionals
[[These are just a few reasons the cybersecurity field is experiencing
such rapid growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 28%
increase in the demand for information security analysts between 2016
and 2026]{.mark}---that\'s an increase of 28,500 jobs.]{.underline}
[[With demand for cybersecurity professionals at an [all-time
high](https://sopa.tulane.edu/blog/cybersecurity-demand-all-time-high/),
positions are available in virtually every industry]{.mark}. The pay
isn\'t shabby either: the median salary was over \$98,000]{.underline}
in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

#### Cyberattacks are rarely acts of war -- considering them as such undermines NATO's efforts to deal with legitimate acts of violence

**Blessing, 4/25** \-- Blessing, J. (2022, April 25). *The Russian cyber
threat is here to stay and NATO needs to understand it*. AEI. Retrieved
June 16, 2022, from
https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-russian-cyber-threat-is-here-to-stay-and-nato-needs-to-understand-it/

Since the Russian invasion of
[Ukraine](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine), the
Biden administration has escalated warnings about likely Russian
cyber-attacks on American infrastructure and business. More worrying
still, [cyber alarmists like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark
Warner, D-Va., have suggested that cyber-attacks from the Kremlin could
be acts of war that trigger NATO's collective defense.]{.underline} This
sky-is-falling delusion, particularly from leaders with access to
[classified
intelligence](https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cia), is at
best counterproductive and at worst dangerous. [[Cyber-attacks are
rarely acts of war, and treating them as if they are undermines
[NATO](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe)'s
ability to deal with real threats short of cyber
war.]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which
triggers a collective response -- once and that was after the 9/11
attacks. [[Cyber-attacks are unlikely to destroy buildings and kill
thousands in an instant. While collective defense extends to cyberspace,
few operations could realistically be a cause for
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} This would include cyber-attacks resulting in
death or damage like traditional military operations or coordinated
assaults that take the power grid or entire economic sectors offline.
These scenarios are unlikely though: [such attacks require far too much
time, funding, manpower, and control. Instead, most attacks temporarily
overwhelm servers with traffic, deny network access, hold computers
hostage, and steal or delete data.]{.underline} Even if allies wanted to
trigger Article 5 over cyber operations, disagreements about the
definitions of threats, origins of attacks, and pain thresholds in
cyberspace can derail the process. [[Collective retaliation requires a
unanimous vote across NATO; building unity across these points is nearly
impossible for most cyber activity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unlike missile
attacks or tanks in the streets, few "red lines" exist to distinguish
cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber disruption from digital acts of
war. Beyond the bureaucratic and logistical limitations of elevating
cyber to a casus belli, focusing on cyber-attacks as acts of war
distracts from the more likely Russian digital assaults below the level
of armed conflict. These include ransomware attacks and supply chain
infiltrations that look like criminal activity or espionage. The Kremlin
is particularly adept at the latter. In the SolarWinds compromise,
Russia hacked one company's software product to access networks of
Fortune 500 companies and U.S. government agencies.

####  Cyberattacks will not warrant and Article 5 response -- NATO must build cyber resilience rather than preparing for "cyber doomsday" 

**Blessing, 4/25** \-- Blessing, J. (2022, April 25). *The Russian cyber
threat is here to stay and NATO needs to understand it*. AEI. Retrieved

[Spillover from operations in Ukraine poses an additional risk. [The
Russians have already deployed several digital tools to destroy computer
data, resulting in corrupted computers for Ukrainian companies with
government support roles]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same malicious
software has also affected several Latvian and Lithuanian businesses.
The danger is another situation like NotPetya in 2017, where malware
self-replicated, spread past Ukrainian targets to cripple networks in
over 150 countries, and created \$10 billion in damages. [[Each of these
scenarios are much more likely than a "cyber doomsday" that would
justify an Article 5 response from NATO]{.mark} members.]{.underline} To
be fair, policymakers' fears of cyber war have led to some positive
developments for the alliance. For instance, over the last several
years, [NATO has developed its own framework for combining cyber and
conventional military capabilities in warfighting. But allies remain
unprepared to deal with "death by 1000 cuts" in cyberspace.
[Concentrating only on acts of war comes at the expense of addressing
the cumulative costs of low-level cyber threats over time. It leads to
an overreliance on cyber deterrence or defensive whack-a-mole
strategies, neither of which are sustainable]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Threats of retaliation simply don't deter most cyber-attacks, and it is
unrealistic for defensive measures to stop every hacker. [[Policymakers
across NATO must acknowledge that security failures are the norm in
cyberspace,]{.mark} and that the compounding costs of failure over time
are every bit as dangerous as the threat of cyber war. [Building cyber
resilience is an important step forward]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us
in cyberspace. The focus is on controlling failures to limit damage and
quickly get networks back online. Moving from buzzword to actual
strategy requires addressing several questions. Which digital assets are
most significant? Where is the alliance most exposed to Russian
cyber-attacks? Where should NATO reduce operating risks, and in what
areas can it assume more? How can allies track long-term trends and
adapt to new technologies? The Russian cyber threat is here to stay.
Collective defense is -- and should remain -- the cornerstone of NATO.
But time is running out for the alliance to protect itself from
scenarios that aren't all-out cyber war.

#### POC voter turnout increasing now, 2020 election proves

**Frey, 3/9 \--** Frey, W. H. (2022, March 9). *Turnout in 2020 election
spiked among both Democratic and Republican voting groups, New Census
Data shows*. Brookings. Retrieved June 17, 2022, from
https://www.brookings.edu/research/turnout-in-2020-spiked-among-both-democratic-and-republican-voting-groups-new-census-data-shows/

[[Voter turnout in the 2020 election was exceptionally
high]{.underline}]{.mark}, with [66.8% of eligible
voters](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html)
casting ballots, resulting in a victory for Joe Biden. In response, some
Republican-controlled state legislatures have enacted measures that
would have the effect of [restricting
voting](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2021/04/19/georgias-voter-suppression-bill-is-an-assault-on-our-democracy/)
in future elections among groups that often vote Democratic. However,
recently released results from the Census Bureau's Current Population
Survey [voting
supplement](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/voting/data/tables.html)
indicate that 2020's **[[voting spike occurred across both
Democratic-leaning demographic groups and Republican-leaning
ones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In particular, there was a noticeable
increase in voting among white adults who did not graduate from college
(the so-called "non-college white" group). The results from the Census
Bureau survey provide information that was not available earlier:
estimates of voter turnout for key demographic groups, both nationally
and for states. The analysis below reveals how different groups' voter
turnout shifted in 2020 from 2016 and earlier elections, and what that
might mean for shifts in the demographic makeup of the voter population.
The Census Bureau's estimates confirm the general perception that 2020
voter turnout was very high, at 66.8%. This was the biggest turnout in a
presidential election since 1992 (67.7%) and more than 5 points higher
than the 2016 election. [[Turnout showed distinct increases from 2016
among **Asian American, Latino or Hispanic**, and non-college white
voters]{.mark}. Each displayed 2016-to-2020 turnout increases that
exceeded 6 points or greater.]{.underline} The non-college white rise in
turnout is especially significant, as this group is linked to voting
Republican in presidential elections, including in
[2020](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/voting/data/tables.html).
This group's 2020 turnout rate of 64% was its highest since at least
2000, and served to close the gap between their turnout and the
traditionally higher turnout of their less Republican-leaning college
graduate counterparts (which rose by just 3 points, from 79% to 82%).
This rise occurred among both non-college white men and women (Download
Table A). The non-college white turnout spike helped to increase the
overall white turnout in 2020 (from 65% to 71%), elevating the overall
white turnout level, which continues to exceed other race and ethnic
groups. [Yet increased turnout was also evident for Asian American
voters (a 10-point increase) and Latino and Hispanic voters (a 6-point
increase). Black voters also showed a turnout spurt from their [dip in
the 2016
election](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2017/05/18/census-shows-pervasive-decline-in-2016-minority-voter-turnout/).]{.underline}
While 2020's Black turnout---at 63%---still exceeded that of Latino or
Hispanic or Asian American voters, it remains below the rate of the two
elections won by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 ([Download Table
A](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210504_Metro_2020-Turnout-Table-A.xlsx)).
Consistent with much of the recent past, older adults voted at higher
rates in 2020 than their younger counterparts. However, younger age
groups showed the greatest turnout increase in that election, rising by
8 points for those aged 18 to 29. In total, over half of these young
adults turned out to vote. [[Even more remarkable is the rise in turnout
of the youngest of this group: those aged 18 to 24, who are now mostly
members of "Gen Z." This group was especially notable in 2020, as they
comprised a large part of the summer's political and racial justice
protests, leading analysts to

if this activism would translate into voter
turnout]{.mark}.]{.underline} The answer to this question, based on the
new census statistics, is a resounding "yes."

####  Racial makeup of the population fuels voter turnout, not mistrust

**Frey, 3/9 \--** Frey, W. H. (2022, March 9). *Turnout in 2020 election
spiked among both Democratic and Republican voting groups, New Census
Data shows*. Brookings. Retrieved June 17, 2022, from

[[These young adult voters cast ballots at higher rates in 2020 than in
any election so far this century, with turnout at more than half for Gen
Z Asian American and white voters, nearly half for Gen Z Black voters,
and more than two-fifths for Gen Z Latino or Hispanic voters.]{.mark}
The impact of this voting bloc---which [leaned heavily
Democratic](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results)
in the most recent election---was influential in many close 2020 swing
states]{.underline}. The voter population for presidential elections
continues to change in its demographic makeup. This relates both to
turnout and to the changing shifts in the nation's overall population.
Because of the [rising growth
rates](https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-census-data-shows-the-nation-is-diversifying-even-faster-than-predicted/)
of nonwhite race and ethnic groups nationally and the [increased
educational
attainment](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html)
of younger voters, the share of all voters identifying as "non-college
white" continues to shrink. Thus, for the first time in a presidential
election, white voters without college degrees comprised less than
two-fifths of the voter population.These changes look quite different
from 2004, when non-college white voters comprised more than half of the
voter population and nonwhite minorities comprised only one-fifth. Since
then, the former's share dropped to 39.7%; the share of white
college-educated voters increased modestly, from 27.7% to 31.3%.; and
the share of nonwhite voters rose to 29%, almost equaling that of white
college graduates. [[The shift in the race-ethnic makeup of the
population---especially the younger population---is evident when looking
at voters in the past five presidential elections. During this period,
younger generations of voting-age citizens have become more racially
diverse]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2020, for the first time, at least 10%
of the total voter population identified as Latino or Hispanic, as did
15% of voters below age 40. The white share of the under-age-40 voter
population declined by 10 points from 2004 to 2020, to 64% ([Download
Table
B](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210504_Metro_2020-Turnout-Table-B.xlsx)).
National turnout shifts between 2016 and 2020 were broadly evident
across individual states. Turnout rose in 44 states as well as
Washington, D.C. ([Download Table
C](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210504_Metro_2020-Turnout-Table-C.xlsx)).
[Among the states with double-digit turnout gains was the swing state of
Arizona, where turnout rose from 60% to 72%. New Jersey increased
turnout from 61% to 78%, giving it the highest 2020 turnout rate of all
states. Similarly, all but nine states showed turnout gains for their
18- to 29-year-old populations]{.underline} Most notable are turnout
shifts among white non-college and white college graduate populations.
Only six states registered 2016-to-2020 turnout drops for non-college
white voters, whereas 15 states showed such drops for white college
graduates. In all but 11 states, turnout gains were greater for
non-college white voters than for college-educated white voters. And
particularly relevant for the 2020 election, both Michigan and Wisconsin
registered turnout gains for non-college white voters and declines for
college-educated white voters. Given the importance of the state
outcomes in the Electoral College, it is useful to study turnout
patterns in swing or near-swing states from the 2020 presidential
election ([Download Table
D](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210504_Metro_2020-Turnout-Table-D.xlsx)).
Three such states in the rapidly growth South and West regions are
Georgia, Arizona, and Texas. The former two gave Biden a razor-thin win
over Donald Trump; the latter, which Trump won, showed a smaller
Republican margin than in recent elections. In all three states, turnout
was highest for white college graduates, and lowest for nonwhite voters.

####  The turnout trend for young voters, particularly people of color has been increasing since the 2016 election

**Frey, 3/9 \--** Frey, W. H. (2022, March 9). *Turnout in 2020 election
spiked among both Democratic and Republican voting groups, New Census
Data shows*. Brookings. Retrieved June 17, 2022, from
https://www.brookings.edu/research/turnout-in-2020-spiked-among-both-democratic-and-republican-voting-groups-new-census-data-shows/

Yet in each case, 2016-to-2020 turnout increases were greater for
non-college white voters than for white college graduates. [[Each state
also exhibited sizeable gains in their nonwhite turnout rates, which
countered the Republican-leaning impact of the non-college white turnout
increase. This was especially the case for the large Latino or Hispanic
populations in Arizona and Texas, and modestly for the Black population
in Georgia]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is the case that the white
non-college bloc voted [somewhat less
Republican](https://www.brookings.edu/research/2020-exit-polls-show-a-scrambling-of-democrats-and-republicans-traditional-bases/)
in each of these states in 2020 than in 2016. However, it appears that
the rise in white non-college turnout helped to make the races in
Georgia and Arizona close, and in Texas, kept the Republican margins
from shrinking further. Among northern states in 2020, the three closest
presidential vote totals were in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and
Wisconsin---each of which went for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.
These generally "whiter" states show similar shifts in turnout between
2016 and 2020. Of the three, Pennsylvania exhibited the greatest overall
rise in turnout, but it was most accentuated for the state's non-college
white voters. As mentioned earlier, both Michigan and Wisconsin showed
turnout declines for their college-educated white populations, although
each registered turnout gains among their nonwhite populations. [The
rise in turnout among non-college white voters in these states were
perhaps even more instrumental in keeping their 2020 elections close
than in the more racially diverse states discussed earlier]{.underline}.
Of course, these rises were countered by the rising turnout of strongly
Democratic-leaning Black populations, especially in Pennsylvania and
Michigan. Despite the rise in turnout among generally Republican-leaning
white non-college voters, it is important to note this group's
decreasing share of all voters in both Sun Belt and Snow Belt
battlegrounds. This is evident in the highly diverse states of Georgia,
Arizona, and Texas, where the nonwhite share of voters rose considerably
between 2004 and 2020. In Arizona, especially, white non-college adults
dipped from over half of all voters in 2004 to 36% in 2020. While the
three northern swing states---Pennsylvania, Michigan, and
Wisconsin---are less racially diverse, the impact of their white college
graduate and nonwhite populations will rise over time. And for all
states, the rise in diversity was even more accentuated for the
under-age-40 voter group, which people of color now comprise roughly
half of in Georgia, Arizona, and Texas ([Download Table
E](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20210504_Metro_2020-Turnout-Table-E.xlsx)).
VOTER TURNOUT IN 2020 AND BEYOND The new census data makes plain that
the 2020 election was record-breaking in terms of the magnitude of its
voter turnout. Yet there are two aspects of this turnout which need to
be emphasized[. [One is the sharp rise in the turnout among white
non-college voters---a group that has strongly favored
Republicans]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The other is the accentuated turnout
among young people and people of color---representing the increasing
influence of voters who heavily lean toward Democratic presidential
candidates.]{.mark}]{.underline} Both of these groups exerted
countervailing forces on the results of the 2020 election, leading to
close popular vote totals in a handful of states. [[However, the
underlying demographics of the nation's voter population show that
Democratic-leaning voter populations are on the rise in both
fast-growing and slow-growing parts of the country]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This raises the question as to whether even greater turnout among white
non-college voter groups---or Republican efforts to alter voting
requirements in their favor---will be enough to counter the influence of
young voters and voters of color in future presidential elections.

## AT: Social Media Misinformation

#### Social media companies rarely fact check or regulate news on their platforms. This is the largest cause for increasing fake news

fake news problem, in one chart*. Vox. Retrieved June 17, 2022, from

America's [fake
news](https://www.vox.com/21430923/fake-news-disinformation-misinformation-conspiracy-theory-coronavirus)
problem is getting worse, not better. [According to an analysis released
by
[NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-report-2020-engagement-analysis/)
and first reported by
[Axios'](https://www.axios.com/unreliable-news-sources-social-media-engagement-297bf046-c1b0-4e69-9875-05443b1dca73.html)s
Sara Fischer on Tuesday, [websites that provide "unreliable news"
increased their share of social media interactions this year. In 2019, 8
percent of engagement with the 100 top-performing news sources on social
media was dubious. In 2020, that number more than doubled to 17
percent.]{.mark}]{.underline} NewsGuard, which rates news websites
according to reliability, found that people are engaging in a lot more
news this year than they were last year. Engagement with the top 100 US
news sources (meaning likes, shares, and comments on Facebook and
Twitter) went from 8.6 billion reactions to 16.3 billion reactions
between 2019 and 2020. That makes sense given, well, everything that has
happened in 2020. [There has been a lot of news, and due to
pandemic-related factors such as unemployment and lockdowns, people have
a lot of time on their hands to read stuff online. [But an increasing
amount of the news people are seeing **is problematic, inaccurate, or
suspicious**.]{.mark} And that's something to worry about. The analysis
found that the Daily Wire, the outlet founded by right-wing commentator
Ben Shapiro, saw 2.5 times more interactions this year than
last.]{.underline} The blossoming of false and unreliable news on the
internet is a cultural, political, and technological phenomenon that's
hard to get your head around, let alone tackle. [[Conspiracy theories,
misinformation, and disinformation run rampant on the internet, and it's
often difficult for people to tell what is true and what's not. Social
media companies are not exactly doing a bang-up job of addressing the
problem]{.mark}, either.]{.underline} Right-wing content, in particular,
thrives on platforms such as Facebook. But just because someone sees
certain content doesn't necessarily mean they are particularly
influenced by it, and figuring out just how powerful certain messages
are can be complicated. Over the summer, Kevin Roose at [the New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/technology/what-if-facebook-is-the-real-silent-majority.html)
reported on what he described as a "parallel media universe" of
super-conservative content on Facebook, noting that right-leaning pages
and posts on the platform consistently get more interactions and shares
than more liberal and mainstream ones. (Though just because someone
likes a news post doesn't mean they actually read it.)

####  Algorithms which run social media newsfeed preferences are biased towards outrage and views, thus promoting news regardless of its accuracy or reliability

There's now [a running
debate](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/22/21332774/facebook-crowdtangle-kevin-roose-nyt-tweets-interactions-reach-engagement)
among academics, analytics experts, and observers like Roose around what

scientist Brendan Nyhan recently
[argued](https://twitter.com/BrendanNyhan/status/1299166780913602560)
that "likes," comments, and shares are just a small part of what people
actually see on Facebook, and that it's difficult to draw conclusions
from these interactions alone or to know what they might mean for an
election. Still, the trend is concerning. [[Social media is making
political polarization worse in
America](https://www.vox.com/recode/21534345/polarization-election-social-media-filter-bubble),
and it's often the case that people no longer agree on even basic facts.
[What people consume shapes what they see --- basically, someone clicks
on a certain article and algorithms start to predict what else they
might like in alignment with that]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the further
down the rabbit hole they go, the more they begin to seek out that
media, often winding up in an information bubble. For people who
complain so much about supposed social media censorship, they are not
really being censored Republicans have spent years complaining that
social media companies are biased against them and that their content is
being censored and removed. President Donald Trump [has often lashed
out](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/28/21273878/trump-executive-order-twitter-social-media-section-230-free-speech-implications)
against tech companies with unfounded claims of bias. He and his
administration [have also attempted to undercut and scrap Section
230](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/18/21294331/section-230-bill-barr-josh-hawley-trump-internet-free-speech),

their platforms however they want and aren't liable for the content

explainer on Section

[Rather than bias toward a certain political leaning, [social media
algorithms are often biased toward outrage --- they push content that
people have an emotional reaction to and are likely to engage
with]{.mark}. The NewsGuard data and other [research shows that **people
are increasingly being drawn to unreliable
content**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and often, unreliable content that
has a conservative bent. And that content can influence all sorts of
attitudes and cause confusion on even basic facts. [The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/technology/georgia-senate-runoff-misinformation.html)
recently took a look at Georgia and how misinformation and unreliable
news is playing a role in the [US Senate
runoffs](https://www.vox.com/21571755/georgia-senate-runoffs-9-questions)
there. A conservative local news network called Star News Group
announced it would launch the Georgia Star in November, and NewsGuard's
analysis found that the website has published misleading information
about the presidential election and the Senate races. One story making
false claims about Georgia's presidential election results reached up to
650,000 people on Facebook. Combating fake and misleading news would
require efforts from multiple stakeholders. Yet Facebook [recently
rolled back
changes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/technology/facebook-reverses-postelection-algorithm-changes-that-boosted-news-from-authoritative-sources.html)
to its algorithm that would promote news from reliable sources. **[Given
the pace at which the problem is growing, the matter is likely to worsen

The other battlefield: It isn\'t only Russia\'s military might that has
some [[U.S. lawmakers and experts concerned about what\'s next in the
conflict with Ukraine. They\'re also worried about a stealthy but
possibly just as damaging enemy: cyber warfare.]{.underline}]{.mark}
They believe that as Russian President Vladimir Putin is pressed on the
battlefield and continues to be squeezed by the sharp bite of U.S. and
European sanctions, [NATO\'s newly evolved cyber policy might not be
prepared to respond.]{.underline} Over the past decade, NATO --- like
most organizations and entities --- has modernized its cyber defensive
posture and practices, prompting NATO to say last year that it would
"weigh 'on a case-by-case basis' whether a cyberattack would trigger its
Article 5 collective defense principle, which establishes that an attack
against one ally is an attack against all allies," our colleagues [Cat
Zakrzewski and Joseph Menn reported last
month.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/24/russia-cyberattacks-global/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9)
["[We will not speculate on how serious a cyberattack would have to be
in order to trigger a collective response,]{.mark}" a NATO official
[told reporters
month](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyberattack-nato-could-trigger-collective-defence-clause-official-2022-02-28/).
"[Any response could include diplomatic and economic sanctions, cyber
measures, or even conventional forces, depending on the nature of the
attack]{.mark}," the official added.]{.underline} The updated policy,
according to former U.S. ambassadors to NATO and experts who work
closely with the organization, has come a long way since Russian-based
attackers launched [massive cyberattacks on
Estonia](https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415) over the removal of a Soviet
war memorial in the small Baltic country in 2007. As it currently
stands, [[NATO leaders were deliberately ambiguous in defining what
would qualify as an Article 5 attack when revising the group\'s cyber
policy, "so as not to create a clear-cut threshold beneath which an
opponent could operate freely]{.mark}," said Douglas Lute, a former U.S.
ambassador to NATO. But [there is some concern the ambiguity might
muddle a potential response to a cyberattack]{.mark}.]{.underline} Key
quote: "If you have a catastrophic cyberattack that shuts down your
\[power\] grids or shuts down your ability to keep your people warm in
the winter or fed or what have you, we\'ve got to figure that out. [[I

Article 5 James Andrew Lewis, the director of the strategic technologies
program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said NATO
has "actually done a pretty good job of figuring out what their response
would be to a significant cyber attack," Lewis said, adding that "there
would have to be some equivalence with a physical attack" in order to
trigger Article 5. "[But [NATO might not have the political
consensus,]{.mark}" Lewis added, referring to the need for the consent
of all 28 members in order for any invocation of the collective defense
clause]{.underline}. [At least one NATO]{.underline} member, for
example, "[has taken a broad view suggesting a cyber operation would be
an armed attack \'if it caused substantial loss of life or considerable
physical or economic damage,\']{.underline}\" Michael Schmitt, a
distinguished scholar at West Point, wrote [in Just
Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/80347/expert-backgrounder-nato-response-options-to-potential-russia-cyber-attacks/)
last month. But: "[[The prevailing view is that ... an armed attack is
the 'most grave form' of a use of force. Thus, the scale and effects of
any Russian cyber operations would have to be especially severe before
triggering the right of individual or collective
self-defense]{.underline},"]{.mark} Schmitt writes. Ivo Daalder, U.S.
ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013, added that updates to Article 5
are irrelevant if the overall system "**[[to act collectively in defense
of NATO territory has eroded]{.mark}."]{.underline}** "[Although NATO
has done what it needs to do in order to maintain some significant
capability of defense, the system as a whole really hasn\'t lived with
the prospect of a military or cyber attack on its territory in a
credible way]{.underline}," Daalder said. Ukraine was admitted to
NATO\'s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) last
week, [Cyberscoop\'s Suzanne Smalley
reports](https://www.cyberscoop.com/ukraine-admitted-nato-ccdcoe/) of
the NATO-accredited military research institution. NATO Sec. Gen. Jens
Stoltenberg said in January that CCDCOE\'s cyber experts "had been
exchanging information with their Ukrainian counterparts \'on the
current malicious cyber activities\' that Ukraine was experiencing in
the lead-up to Russia's invasion," per Smalley. [[But another potential
setback for NATO is that it has not taken steps to acquire offensive
cyber capabilities and is dependent on member states that boast
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} "We need to add into our plans the way we
fight offensive cyber capability because you better believe Russia is
going to use it on us ... [But [what NATO is good at is being a
defensive alliance, and sometimes they\'re slow to pick up on we have to
also be capable of offensive action]{.mark}]{.underline}," retired

## AT: "Russia/US war"

#### Russia/US war will not happen -- Russia just pushing nuclear rhetoric

**Ellyat, 4/29 --** Ellyatt, H. (2022, April 29). *Could there be war
between Russia and the west? strategists predict what could happen
next*. CNBC. Retrieved June 19, 2022, from
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/russia-ukraine-war-should-the-west-prepare-for-war-with-putin.html

[The saber-rattling and rhetoric between Moscow and the West have become
notably more aggressive]{.underline} this week, prompting concerns that
a direct confrontation between the two power blocs could be more likely.
In the last few days alone, for example, Russia stopped gas supplies to
two European countries and has warned the West several times that the
risk of a nuclear war is very "real." In addition, [Russian President
Vladimir Putin](https://www.cnbc.com/vladimir-putin/) has said that any
foreign intervention in Ukraine would provoke what he called a
"lightning fast" response from Moscow, while his Foreign Ministry warned
NATO not to test its patience. [For their part, Western officials have
dismissed Russia's "bravado" and "dangerous" nuclear war
rhetoric]{.underline}, with the U.K. calling on Western allies to
"double down" on their support for Ukraine. CNBC asked strategists about
the likelihood of a direct confrontation between Russia and the West.
Here's what they said. Nuclear attack? At the start of the week,
Russia's foreign minister warned that the threat of a nuclear war
"cannot be underestimated" and said NATO's supply of weapons to Ukraine
was tantamount to the military alliance engaging in a proxy war with
Russia. Putin doubled down on the bellicose rhetoric Wednesday,
threatening a "lightning fast" retaliation against any country
intervening in [the Ukraine
war](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html)
and creating what he called "strategic threats for Russia." He then
appeared to allude to Russia's arsenal of intercontinental ballistic
missiles and nuclear weapons when he warned that Russia has the "tools"
for a retaliatory response "that no one else can boast of having now
\... we will use them if necessary." [But strategists told CNBC that
Putin is playing on risk aversion in the West and that the chances of a
nuclear war are **remote**. "I think it's outside the realm of
possibility right now that there's going to be a nuclear war or World
War III that really spills over that far beyond Ukraine's
borders]{.underline}," Samuel Ramani, a geopolitical analyst and
associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told CNBC. ["If
there's a border spillover right now, we're still probably most likely
looking at something like Moldova being vulnerable to an
invasion]{.underline}," he said. A U.S. infantryman at a combined arms
live fire exercise at Al-Ghalail Range in Qatar, on Nov. 14, 2018. [He
noted that Russia has a long history of using "nuclear brinkmanship" as
a way of preventing the West from pursuing security policies that it
doesn't like, with the escalation in hostile rhetoric aimed at deterring
NATO members from making heavy arms deliveries to Ukraine.]{.underline}
Moment of danger Nonetheless, Ramani noted the threat posed by Russia
could become more acute if it felt humiliated on the battlefield. In
particular, military setbacks in Ukraine around May 9 could pose some
danger. That's Russia's "Victory Day" --- the anniversary of Nazi
Germany's defeat by the Soviet Union in World War II. "Putin has had a
history of escalating unpredictability if he feels that Russia is being
humiliated in some way \... and if there are major setbacks, especially
on around the 9th \[of May\] then there's a risk of unbreakable action,"
he said. "But also there's a logic of mutually assured destruction that
hopefully will rein everybody in."

####  Nuclear war threats from Russia are just scare tactics -- even if they escalate, they cannot handle NATO's defense capabilities

[Threatening nuclear attacks is part of Putin's "playbook]{.underline},"
said William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control
at the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank. ["Putin
enjoys using risks and he thinks he has a much more appetite for risk
than the West does," he told CNBC on Thursday. "He's trying to use the
old playbook of 'if I terrify you enough, you'll back down'," he
said.]{.underline} "Ultimately, if he uses nuclear weapons, even a
demonstration strike, this would turn Russia into a global pariah,"
Alberque said. He advised Western leaders, "We just need to be able to
manage our risk and keep our nerve and not panic when he does something
that we might not expect." [There's no indication that there will be a
direct confrontation, Liviu Horovitz, a nuclear policy researcher at the
German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told CNBC.
"Both the United States and Western European governments have repeatedly
said that they have no interest in escalating this conflict beyond
Ukraine, and I don't see anything suggesting that NATO troops will be
fighting in Ukraine anytime soon."]{.underline} How NATO is defending
Eastern Europe Still, if a wider war did break out, ["NATO's overall
conventional capabilities outmatch Russia's," he noted. What's important
now is that "all sides should avoid any steps that could create
misunderstandings,"]{.underline} he said --- steps that could lead to an
accidental and potentially catastrophic war. Economic war While NATO has
shied away from providing any aid to Ukraine that could be misconstrued
as a direct attack on Russia, Western allies continue to pile on the
pressure on Moscow. Indeed, the economic punishment on Russia has been
increasing by the day, in the form of more sanctions on its businesses,
key sectors and officials close to or within Putin's regime. Russia's
own Economy Ministry expects the economy to contract as a result, by

Russian forces patrol in Mariupol, Ukraine, where the Russian Army has
taken control, on April 22, 2022. "There is no end in sight to Russia's
war in Ukraine, and relations with the West will likely continue to
deteriorate," one analyst said. For its part, Russia has sought to
inflict its own pain on European countries that are, awkwardly, heavily
reliant on Russian natural gas imports. This week [it suspended supplies
to Poland and Bulgaria because they refused to pay for the gas in
rubles](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/russias-gas-supplies-to-poland-bulgaria-uncertain-as-tensions-rise.html).
Russia's move was branded as "blackmail" by the EU but defended by
Moscow. While a direct confrontation between Russia and the West remains
unlikely, one close Russia watcher said Western governments need to
imbue their populations with a "war mentality" to prepare them for the
hardships they could face as the economic fallout from the war
continues. Those include rising energy costs and disrupted supply chains
and goods from Russia and Ukraine, among the world's biggest "bread
baskets."

Russia-Ukraine war could be
immense](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/from-food-to-inflation-the-russia-ukraine-war-has-a-global-impact.html)
"[We're likely to see a further escalation of the economic war, because
in some ways, that's a rational and logical move from both sides that
have a very difficult time fighting one another in a direct way because
of the nuclear escalation risks]{.underline}," Maximilian Hess, a fellow
at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC on Thursday.
["Russia will cut off gas to more countries, it will increase its ruble
demands, because it wants to ensure the ruble convertibility remains
open, and the West needs to be preparing for this with a full war
mentality, making the Western populations understand that this is going
to have real economic costs and real impacts on the cost of goods, the
cost of living and inflation over the coming years."]{.underline} "If we
don't take this war mentality and apply it to the economic war, then it
becomes a lot easier for Putin to win and have successes there," Hess
said. Other flashpoints to watch After more than two months of war,
Russia has expanded its control of territories in eastern and southern
Ukraine, trying to create a land bridge from Russia via the Donbas
region to its annexed territory of Crimea. But it has also sustained
large losses in terms of manpower and arms. In the meantime, [the West
continues to pledge more and more support for
Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html),
and the country's forces are mounting a strong resistance to Russian
troops, signaling a protracted and bloody conflict ahead. NATO's chief,
Jens Stoltenberg, warned Thursday that the war in Ukraine could last for
years. Ukraine war has been a 'trigger' for Sweden, Finland to seek NATO
membership Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at Teneo
Intelligence, said that against this backdrop, "there is no end in sight
to Russia's war in Ukraine, and relations with the West will likely
continue to deteriorate." "[The rhetoric in Russia is already shifting
from statements of fighting the 'nationalists' in Ukraine to an alleged
(proxy) war with NATO]{.underline}. Multiple flashpoints could further
escalate the tensions with the West," he said. Those include recent
explosions in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria (which could
serve as a pretext for an increased Russian presence in the region)
which could bring the conflict "dangerously close to NATO's borders,"
Tursa said in a note Wednesday. ["Moscow could also step up threats to
NATO over weapons supplies to Ukraine, especially after multiple
military and energy facilities in Russia have been allegedly hit by
Ukraine. Finally, decisions by Finland and Sweden to join NATO would be
perceived by Moscow as another security threat to Russia and could
increase military tensions in the Baltic region.]{.underline}

## AT: "Hackers plant fake news in social media"

#### Social media misinformation comes from all platforms, independent of cyber attacks

thumbs down to social media*. Local News Initiative. Retrieved June 19,

https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/posts/2022/02/09/medill-social-media-survey/

Journalists say social-media platforms have hurt their industry,
contributing to inaccurate and one-sided news accounts by exerting too
much control over the mix of news that people see, according to a recent
survey. More than nine of every 10 survey respondents said [social-media
companies deliver a "worse mix of news" to their users]{.underline},
according to the online survey of journalists by Northwestern
University's Medill school of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing
Communications. The survey also found that nearly eight of 10 said
harassment of journalists on social media is a "very big" or "moderately
big" problem. The second-ever Medill Media Industry Survey was conducted
at the end of 2021 by Associate Professor Stephanie Edgerly of Medill,
and Danielle K. Brown, the Cowles Professor of Journalism, Diversity and
Equality at the University of Minnesota. More than 1,500 members of the
U.S. news media completed the questionnaire. Medill used Cision, a media
listings database, to obtain email contact information from individuals
who had at least one of the following keywords in their profile:
columnist, correspondent, director, editor, producer, reporter, writer,
then sorted the list for news organizations exceeding a minimal audience
size. Exactly 25,000 people were invited to participate in the survey,
which was open between Nov. 30 and Dec. 31. Among the findings, [90.7
percent of respondents said the role social media companies play in
delivering the news results is a worse mix of news, while 86.5 percent
said social media companies have too much control over the mix of news
people see. Some 79.3 percent said social media has a mostly negative
impact on the journalism industry, and an overwhelming 94.3 percent of
respondents blamed social media for spreading **inaccurate
news**]{.underline}. The survey was the subject of a discussion at a
Medill Centennial panel on Feb. 3, featuring newsroom leaders of ABC
News, The Wall Street Journal, Vox Media and the Los Angeles Times.
"There's certainly a lot of frustration," observed Kevin Merida,
Executive Editor at the Times. But Merida also said social-media
platforms are an important gateway to the work of journalists, who must
learn to operate on them. "We're not putting the genie back in the
bottle," he said. "Within the platforms, we have the ability to also hop
in and define our relationship, how we're going to access them and how
we're going to communicate through them." [ABC News President Kimberly
Godwin said journalists need to help people become smarter consumers of
news on social platforms. "They keep sending you misinformation," she
said. "We have to find ways to break through the clutter so that they
get at the truth."]{.underline}

####  Journalists and news reporters already fighting to improve accuracy, reliability, and quality of news information on social media platforms

[Social media challenges journalists to understand its strengths and
weaknesses so they can interest an audience and deliver strong, accurate
messages, said Melissa Bell, publisher of Vox Media. "It is important
for us to recognize how much of an impact social media has had on our
reporting," she said. "There are strengths in it. There are ways to
reach people that you couldn't reach before."]{.underline} Journal
Editor in Chief Matt Murray warned that journalists should not mistake
dialogue on social media for the "richer, fuller, more varied and
dramatic" stories that reporters can uncover in "real life." ["Social
media is a tool, from a journalist's perspective, to be used," he said.
"It's a tool to get news out there," Murray said.]{.underline} The
survey indicates that journalists are more critical of social media than
are U.S. adults at large. The percentage of U.S. adults saying the
companies have too much control over the mix of news they see was 62
percent in a Pew Research Center survey from July 2019. That response
was nearly 25 percentage points lower than that of journalists in the
2021 Medill survey. Similarly, the percentage of U.S. adults who said
social-media companies provide a worse mix of news was 55 percent in the
Pew survey, far less than the 90.7-percent response from journalists
surveyed by Medill. Edgerly, who oversaw the survey, said its results
suggest that social media is not living up to its potential to make
vital news stories more visible. ["A clear majority of journalists are
seeing the potential gains are not matching the realities,]{.underline}"
she said. "The survey suggests that we're not seeing quality information
reaching a broader audience. That is not the reality of how social media
functions." The University of Minnesota's Brown, who partnered with
Edgerly, said she's not surprised that journalists' view of social media
is more negative than the population's at large, as measured in other
surveys. "We asked journalists to think about: social-media companies
and their control; loss of autonomy; and how the work they create is
used by other people," she said. "It doesn't surprise me that they don't
like the way social-media companies control the news that people have
access to. It doesn't surprise me at all."

#### Democracy strong now -- Global leaders pushing for international alliance. Efforts on COVID-19 and economic issues prove

President Joe Biden delivered an emphatic message to democratic allies
and rivals alike at the Munich Security Conference Friday morning,
pledging to work with Europe and stop at nothing to ensure democratic
values prevail around the world. ["I believe with every ounce of my
being that democracy must prevail," Biden said.]{.underline} Appearing
on-screen in a display of trans-Atlantic unity with German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Biden [said
democracy is under assault around the world and called on Western allies
to "demonstrate that democracy functions and works and together there's
nothing we can't do."]{.underline} Aware that [many European countries
came to doubt America's commitment to collective NATO
defense](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-nato/)
under former President Donald Trump, Biden insisted: "[Let me erase any
lingering doubt: The United States will work closely with our European
Union partners and capitals across the continent." The president added
that America's commitment to NATO is "guaranteed" and that "an attack on
one is an attack on all," a sharp break from Trump, whose [rhetoric on
the trans-Atlantic
alliance](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/12/trump-nato-spending-714976)
was dominated by [haranguing member states about their relatively low

German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks to the media following her
participation in a virtual meeting of G-7 leaders on Feb. 19, 2021, in
Berlin, Germany. Biden reserved his toughest words for China and Russia.
Biden accused Beijing of perpetuating abuses that "undercut the
foundations of the international economic system," and insisted that
"Chinese companies should be held to the same standards" of governance
and transparency as Western companies. Urging a strong NATO and EU,
Biden insisted that only trans-Atlantic unity could contain Russia.
"It's so much easier for the Kremlin to bully and threaten individual
states than a strong and united trans-Atlantic community," Biden said.
Speaking after Biden, [Angela Merkel said that "the prospects of
democracy are better "thanks to Biden's trans-Atlantic commitments and
promised her full support --- with a subtle warning: "In Germany we say
words are not enough, you have to do them, and that is true in
trans-Atlantic cooperation."]{.underline} Merkel said that Germany and
U.S. interests would "not always converge" but that trans-Atlantic
values are fundamentally the same. Emmanuel Macron offered assurances
that the [EU's push for "strategic
autonomy"](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-trade-wants-strategic-autonomy-decide-what-means/)
is not an effort to distance itself from the U.S., but to show that
Europe can be a "reliable and responsible and credible partner," instead
of a continent dependent on the U.S. for security. Macron called for
western allies to immediately deliver 13 million Covid-19 vaccine doses
to African nations to protect the continent's health workers, before
China and Russia fill the void. [At an earlier meeting of G-7 leaders,
Biden agreed with counterparts "to work together to beat Covid-19 and
build back better]{.underline}," mirroring his own domestic messaging.
[On economic issues, the G-7 committed to "cut emissions and create good
jobs on a path to net zero no later than 2050,"]{.underline} to reform
the World Trade Organization, and to agree a global taxation framework
by mid-2021.

####  The aff can't solve the demise of democracy -- Sustained educational, national, and community investments are key

Luckily, just because a democracy is in crisis does not mean it will
collapse. On average, [**it takes [about a
decade](https://web.archive.org/web/20210328045720/https:/www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/chapters/conditions-and-consequences-of-populism-and-democratic-backsliding.pdf)**
from the onset of democratic backsliding to end in either democratic
breakdown or recovery. But we are long overdue for a course
correction.]{.underline} Aside from international NGOs focusing on
fixing America's democracy, we can learn from the experiences of foreign
governments throughout history, too. Germany's post-World War II efforts
to strengthen democracy include a wide variety of investments that
simultaneously tackle right-wing extremism, racism, and antisemitism.
South Africa built a national Truth and Reconciliation Commission to
address the atrocities of apartheid and provide a path to restorative
justice and healing. [These cases demonstrate that it is possible ---
with sustained educational, national, and community investments --- to
create more informed citizens, restore trust across dividing lines,
energize youth engagement, and reduce political violence. Doing so
requires significant educational and [media
literacy](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/22/705809811/students-in-ukraine-learn-how-to-spot-fake-stories-propaganda-and-hate-speech)
programming. It requires engagement across sectors, through partnerships
with civil society, the tech and media sector, local governments, and
faith communities. Ultimately, restoring democracy requires creating a
nation in which every citizen and resident feels part of a shared
community in which they have a voice and a path to a common
future.]{.underline} We are a long way from that kind of shared
community. And in the end, saving our own democracy will require more
than the efforts of a few committed citizens. The kind of effort we need
to turn our backsliding democracy around cannot be done if the federal
government doesn't lead the charge with serious resource investments. At
its heart, this work is about resilience, rooted in an understanding
that democracies must be nurtured through education and not just
defended with force. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the U.S. made
unprecedented investments in our security infrastructure. We created an
entire new agency --- the U.S. Department of Homeland Security --- whose
mission is to "[secure the nation from the many threats we
face](https://www.dhs.gov/about-dhs)." But now, the call is coming from
inside the house: the biggest threats to our nation are ones we've
created ourselves.
