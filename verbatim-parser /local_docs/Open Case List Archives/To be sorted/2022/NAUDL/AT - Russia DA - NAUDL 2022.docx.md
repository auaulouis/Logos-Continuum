**Russia's invasion of Ukraine is not in response to NATO expansion.
NATO has expanded in previous years, yet Russia did not react.**

**Popova & Shevel, 2022**, (Maria is a Jean Monnet Chair and Associate
Professor of Political Science at McGill University, Oxana is an
Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Tufts
University's School of Arts and Sciences), "Russia's Invasion of Ukraine
Is Essentially Not About NATO". Just Security. 02/24.
<https://www.justsecurity.org/80343/russias-new-assault-on-ukraine-is-not-entirely-maybe-not-even-largely-about-nato/>

In his Feb. 15 Just Security article "Ukraine: Unleashing the Rhetorical
Dogs of War," Barry Posen argued that NATO and Ukraine should have cut a
deal with Russia because the Ukrainian military would surely be defeated
by Russia without direct U.S./Western military participation and U.S.
offers of equipment were only encouraging a potential Ukrainian
insurgency against Russian occupation that would be as bloody as it
would be futile. [[The prescription depends entirely on Posen's
assumption that to satisfy Russia, all Ukraine would have had to do
would be "to swallow the bitter pill of accepting armed neutrality
between NATO and Russia, rather than NATO membership." This assumption
contradicts events of recent months and the historical
record.]{.underline}]{.mark} While Vladimir Putin has claimed that his
goal is keeping Ukraine out of NATO, he also insisted that he was just
conducting military exercises. Instead, he is invading Ukraine again. He
likewise insisted in 2014 that he wasn't capturing Crimea, despite the
presence of his unidentified "Little Green Men" and his subsequent
annexation of the peninsula, or that he was not fighting in Ukraine's
Donbas area in the east all these years, despite all evidence to the
contrary. There is no reason to take Putin at his word. His Feb. 21
diatribe conferring Russian recognition of independence for the two
eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and his order for
Russian troops to move in as ostensible "peacekeepers" shows clearly his
disdain for diplomatic resolutions. [[Moreover, this is not even
primarily about NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO's eastward expansion may
have played a role in straining the relationship between Russia and the
West, but mainly because, for Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly
abandon it for the greener pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung.
However, [[Putin's rhetoric and actions over almost two decades reveal
that his goals extend beyond imposing neutrality on Ukraine or even
staving off further NATO expansion. The larger objective is to
re-establish Russian political and cultural dominance over a nation that
Putin sees as one with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, and then follow up
by undoing the European rules-based order and security architecture
established in the aftermath of World War II. Given these goals,
Ukrainian neutrality is a woefully insufficient concession for Putin.
[[If Russia's main concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have
reacted with rhetoric and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after
each step in the NATO expansion process. The largest wave of NATO's
eastward expansion took place in March 2004, when seven Eastern European
countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic states. Russia
"grumbled]{.underline}]{.mark}," as the New York Times put it then, by
adopting a Duma resolution criticizing the expansion, [[but no hostile
and sustained rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement as a Western plot
against Russian interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Russia is too far behind technologically to reach US advancements in
AI and cybersecurity innovation.**

**Chernenko and Markotkin, 2020**, (Elena is a journalist with
Kommersant newspaper.and Nikolai is an expert with the Russian
International Affairs Council), "Developing Artificial Intelligence in
Russia: Objectives and Reality". Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. 05/08. <https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/82422>

[[The Russian government finances industry-specific projects---quite
generously by Russian standards---which testifies to the high priority
assigned to this field. The application of AI in the military industry,
in which Russia's position is traditionally strong, is the subject of
particular attention.]{.mark} [Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Russia
will become a leader in the development of AI as set forth in the
national strategy because of its current lag behind the leading
technological powers, as well as some other factors, such as a small
venture capital investment market.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Unlike China
and the United States, Russia isn't a global leader in AI technologies.
Although the strategy states that "the Russian Federation possesses
significant potential to become one of the international leaders in the
development and use of artificial intelligence technologies," it's
unlikely the country will be able to achieve this goal in the short and
medium term.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nevertheless, certain areas of AI
development and application do exist; Russia enjoys strong positions
there and can succeed in the future. Russia's ranking in the AI
technology race is hard to establish, since current international
ratings use different methodologies. Many of them don't list Russia at
all, which is unsurprising, since the country lacked an official AI
development strategy until November 2019.

[[In terms of individual AI-related technology indicators, Russia has
only three supercomputers ranked among the 500 most powerful computers
in the world, for example, while China has 228, the United States has
117, and Japan has 29.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The number of AI start-ups
in a given country is also a key indicator of its progress in this
field. According to TRAXCN statistics, Russia currently has 168 AI
start-ups, compared with 6,903 in the United States and 1,013 in
China.]{.underline}]{.mark} These estimates appear to be somewhat
exaggerated, since the list includes twenty- and thirty-year-old
"start-ups," but still, they make it possible to assess the bigger
picture of the state of venture capital investment markets with respect
to AI. In part, the small number of Russian AI start-ups can be
explained by the domination of established companies in this sphere.
This is what distinguishes Russia from most other developed
technological powers. According to Russia's proposed Artificial
Intelligence road map, the country has a total of 400 companies working
on developing AI.

[[In November 2019, the RDIF reported that it had raised \$2 billion in
domestic and international investments in Russian companies that use
AI.]{.underline}]{.mark} The RDIF will also undertake to bring these
companies to international markets. According to some media
publications, the fund will invest some of its money in creating an
Artificial Intelligence Institute at Moscow State University. [[Such
investment volumes are unique for Russian science. But how significant
are they on a global scale? It is certainly far less than the leaders of
the tech race spend on AI. China annually invests tens of billions of
dollars in AI, including at a regional level. Beijing alone is planning
to invest \$2.1 billion in an AI industrial park, while Tianjin is
considering the creation of a \$16 billion AI development fund. In turn,
the U.S. government allocated \$4.9 billion for AI research in 2020.
Venture investors have contributed even more, investing over \$8 billion
in AI start-ups in 2018 alone.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[As of today,
Russia cannot be described as a leader in the AI race. Even if AI
development becomes Russia's highest priority, Moscow essentially has no
chance of catching up with Washington and Beijing in this
field.]{.underline}]{.mark}

COVID-19.**

[["Despite the depth of the recession in the first half of 2020---and
the unexpected setbacks of the Delta variant in 2021---the global
economy has recovered rapidly from the pandemic shock compared to past
recessions,"]{.underline}]{.mark} said Dana M Peterson, Chief Economist
of The Conference Board. "Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus in major
economies around the world---which built a bridge to economic reopening
enabled by the rapid development of effective vaccines---likely
prevented the recession from devolving into a long period of lackluster
economic growth."

2020---is calculated to have recovered all of its losses by Q1 2021. By

will lag somewhat.

**AFF Extension- No Russian Aggression due to NATO Expansion**

**Putin is not concerned about NATO expansion given statements about
Sweden and Finland seeking membership.**

**Bove, 2022**, (Tristan is a graduate of DePaul University with degrees
in International Studies and Chinese), "Putin says Sweden and Finland
joining NATO and breaking with decades of neutrality is fine after all.
'No problems'". Fortune. 05/16.
<https://fortune.com/2022/05/16/sweden-finland-join-nato-putin-no-threat-russia/>

But three months into a Ukraine invasion that's not going according to
plan, and after two other countries close to Russia announced that they
are joining NATO, Putin appears to be softening his tone, and resigning
himself to the fact that NATO's eastward expansion is happening anyway.

[[On Sunday, Finland---which shares an 800-mile border with Russia and
was part of the Russian Empire for over a century---said it had applied
to join NATO to ensure that its own national security would not be
threatened by Russia in the future. On Monday, Sweden followed suit
after a meeting amongst ruling party officials over the weekend, who
voted to end the country's 200-year neutrality
policy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Minister Magdalena Andersson said on
Sunday. "We're facing a fundamentally changed security environment in
Europe."

For months, Russian officials have warned against the two countries
taking this decisive step, but now that it has actually happened, Putin
appears to be doing his best to diminish the significance of the act.
[[\"As for the expansion of NATO, including through new members of the
alliance which are Finland, Sweden --- Russia has no problems with these
states," Putin said]{.underline}]{.mark} Monday at a summit of the
Collective Security Treaty Organization, a military alliance composed of
several post-Soviet states.

For months, Russian officials have been saying that should Finland and
Sweden join NATO, Russia would receive it as a threat, and respond by
building up its military capabilities in the Baltic Sea. Former Russian
president Dmitry Medvedev even suggested in April that nuclear weapons
and hypersonic missiles could be deployed. Just last week, Putin warned
that Finland joining NATO would be a "mistake," and suggested that
Russia would interpret it as an act of aggression. But [[Putin signaled
on Monday that Finland and Sweden's decision to join NATO is one of
relative unimportance, and does not constitute a danger to Russia.
\"Expansion at the expense of these countries does not pose a direct
threat to Russia," he said.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**AFF Extension- No Nuclear War Impact**

**Russia's current fight to lead AI and cybersecurity innovation futile
due to their focus on Ukraine.**

**Whyte, 2022**, (Christopher is an assistant professor in the homeland
security and emergency preparedness program in the Wilder School of
Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University),
"Russia's AI setbacks will likely heighten its cyber aggression". CSO.
04/14.
https://www.csoonline.com/article/3656957/russias-ai-setbacks-will-likely-heighten-its-cyber-aggression.html#:\~:text=With%20the%20weight%20of%20Western,AI

[[The consequences of the war waged against Ukraine on Russia's wealth,
workforce and access to sophisticated imported products such as
microprocessors used to operate everything from mobile devices to
automobiles are immense. Without capital, talent and a line on critical
commodities and technologies, Russia will struggle to be competitive in
everything from medical technology development to national security
practice.]{.underline}]{.mark} This likely result of increasing
isolation seems doubly assured with AI. Russia's relatively weak
fundamentals and strong competition from both China and the West
virtually guarantee vast opportunity costs to Russia in years to come.
This outcome might be seen as a positive development that will cede
techno-strategic advantages to defense communities in North America,
Europe and East Asia\--those most concerned about Russia's military
capabilities and intentions.

[[Despite Putin's statements, Russia's AI efforts have lagged behind
most initiatives in other countries. In 2014, barely two years after a
breakthrough innovation of deep neural networks by a multinational group
of researchers energized AI development, Russia's buildout of new
machine learning applications and other AI tools was already slowing
significantly. Collaborations with cutting-edge projects in the West,
China, India and elsewhere began to drop away following Putin's
annexation of Crimea and decision to embroil Eastern Ukraine in ongoing
conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark} State-sponsored companies and
military-intelligence institutions in the Russian Federation have
consistently been a leading source of novel AI technologies aimed at
bolstering national security and strengthening mechanisms of population
control. However, a slow leak of human capital and a complicated
relationship with parts of the global economy that dominate critical
high technology resources, such as graphics processing units (GPUs),
have become a substantial obstacle for the country's AI ambitions. Even
if Moscow matched China's or the United States' levels of domestic AI
investment, its fundamentals of innovation for the field simply haven't
been concrete for some time.

[[One major blow to Moscow's AI ambitions is the dramatic acceleration
of the brain drain that has plagued Russian high technology and
scientific communities for years.]{.underline}]{.mark} Enticing
researchers out of private industry and academia is perennially
difficult for governments, but Russia has been even less capable in this
regard than most, likely due to the unappealing culture and benefits of
Putin's military and paramilitary communities. [[Now, up to 70,000 tech
workers that were otherwise minimal flight risks have fled the
country.]{.underline}]{.mark} Many have ended up in former Soviet states
and South Asia, and no small number have left positions tied to the
Russian state's focus on building out facial recognition, autonomous
vehicles and surveillance capabilities. [[Sanctions worsen the impact of
this brain drain by cutting across the research and business
relationships that Moscow has heavily supported in recent
years.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**AFF Extension- No Economic Collapse Impact**

**The global economy is in recovery with positive outlook ahead.**

**OECD, 2021**, (OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to
preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social
well-being of people around the world), "Global economic recovery
continues but remains uneven, says OECD". OECD. 09/21.
<https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/global-economic-recovery-continues-but-remains-uneven-says-oecd.htm>

[[The global economy is growing far more strongly than anticipated a
year ago,]{.underline}]{.mark} but the recovery remains uneven, exposing
both advanced and emerging markets to a range of risks, according to the
OECD's latest Interim Economic Outlook. [[The OECD says extraordinary
support from governments and central banks helped avoid the worst once
the COVID-19 pandemic hit. With the vaccine roll-out continuing and a
gradual resumption of economic activity underway, the OECD projects
strong global growth of]{.underline}]{.mark} 5.7% this year and [[4.5%
in 2022]{.underline}]{.mark}, little changed from its May 2021 Outlook
of 5.8% and 4.4% respectively. Countries are emerging from the crisis
with different challenges, often reflecting their pre-COVID 19 strengths
and weaknesses, and their policy approaches during the pandemic. Even in
the countries where output or employment have recovered to their
pre-pandemic levels, the recovery is incomplete, with jobs and incomes
still short of the levels expected before the pandemic. Presenting the
Interim Economic Outlook alongside Chief Economist Laurence Boone,
[[OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said: "The world is
experiencing a strong recovery thanks to decisive action taken by
governments and central banks at the height of the
crisis.]{.underline}]{.mark} But as we have seen with vaccine
distribution, progress is uneven. Ensuring the recovery is sustained and
widespread requires action on a number of fronts -- from effective
vaccination programmes across all countries to concerted public
investment strategies to build for the future."
