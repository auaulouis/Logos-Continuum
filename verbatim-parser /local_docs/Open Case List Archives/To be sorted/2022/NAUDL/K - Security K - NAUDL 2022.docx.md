# Security Kritik

## Topic Introduction: Security K 

Every year, the National Debate Association releases a *[yearly
topic]{.underline}* for students to debate. *[The Policy Debate
resolution for 2022-2023 is as follows:]{.underline}*

#### Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in one or more of the following areas: artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity. 

Breaking down the text of this topic gives you three topics for to
center cases around: increasing security cooperation with NATO in
**artificial intelligence**, **biotechnology**, and **cybersecurity**.

Your objective as the negative will be to **negate** the resolution --
Meaning, you will need to either **disprove the affirmative** or **offer
an alternative solution to the resolution**. This file will focus on the
latter.

### What is a Kritik?

Critiques, (better known in debate as "Kritiks" or "K" arguments), are
critical arguments that challenge the mindsets or assumptions made by
the affirmative. It's typically a negative argument, and running this
argument takes a higher understanding of debate's technical terms.

**It is not recommended to run Kritiks without understanding what it
means, nor for the sake of confusing your opponent. This will not take
the debate anywhere if neither side can comprehend the argument. For
these reasons, this is a file you should probably use only AFTER you've
debated in a couple of other tournaments and have a solid understanding
of disadvantages and CPs.**

### Negative Strategy

When using this file as the negative, there are few things to keep in
mind. First, there is a 1NC "foundation" that has the usual generic link
to the affirmative's case, the impact (significance of your argument),
and alternative (an "alternative" method to the affirmative's way of
doing things).

If you wish to, which you should, be more specific in your criticism
there are more specific links in the "Link" section of the file. There
is also a "2NC/1NR Framework" section. You will want to use this section
in the 2NC/1NR to frame the debate. Importantly, [you will need to make
the argument that fiat is illusory or not real.]{.underline}

If we're going to talk about treating things as threats, you can still
argue things like "all violence comes from the desire to protect
ourselves."

It's interesting, because you can have something of a uniqueness claim
-- that "we are always already unsafe." We're standing on a rock that's
flying through space at millions of miles a minute and around a giant
hot ball that could explode (solar flare) at any moment -- and we would
die without even knowing it. We are always threatened and never secure,
and yet we have a psychological drive to protect ourselves. Everything
we do comes from the desire to protect ourselves and secure our
happiness and favored things.

Thus, it's not "how do we make ourselves secure?" but "how do we deal
with our insecurity?"

The most common answer you'll find is "threats are real,"-- which may be
true, but we're always already unsafe. Threats are socially constructed.
Why does a state have a military? We build the military because there
are others out there that may want to hurt us -- and we have to protect
ourselves from them. That's the purpose of lethal autonomous weapons,
and cybersecurity, and nukes and soldiers.

Slavoj Žižek, a Slovenian philosopher, once said it is so easy for
people to imagine an apocalypse, zombies, what are we going to do when
the asteroid hits us, or when climate change is unbearable? But it is
much harder to imagine an alternative-- we assume threats are here to
stay, it's natural, and that it's the best way to be.

*Fiat* is just an act of imagining doing the plan, so why can't the
negative team imagine another world? It *can* go both ways!

This rhetoric of seeing people as threats is what causes \"threats\" in
the first place, because we try to constrain \"threats\" and they
respond. China is not a \"threat\", but the US believes it is, so we try
to contain them with Obama\'s Asia Pivot (2012). They then panic and
must respond (antisatellite tests in 2007), because America is beating
down their doorstep (Australian military deployments). Arms races and
miscalculation are the product of these security dilemmas that nations
escalate to crises.

### Affirmative Strategy

Answering this argument requires understanding its basic arguments in
the context of whichever affirmative you choose to run.

You will need to remind the judge about the purpose of fiat. If its
entire purpose is to provide the aff with enough ability to debate the
implications of their case, then allowing the negative to also use takes
away from the fairness of the round. The negative will claim,

You should be able to advocate for a *permutation*. A *permutation* is
the argument that we should **do both the affirmative plan as well as
the negative's alternative.**

When answering the K remember you want to "F-STOP" the K. Always make
the following arguments:

Framework -- defend why your affirmative matters and the methodology
behind your affirmative

Solvency -- You need to make an argument that the Alternative does not
solve the affirmative

Theory -- You should have a theoretical objection to the K. If there is
also a counterplan/DA strategy in the round that should be
conditionality. If the K is being framed as a Floating PIK you also need
to defend against that.

Offense -- Have offensive reasons that your affirmative is good. These
function as disadvantages to the alternative

Permutation -- You should always perm the K. The best perms take the
language of the alternative and also advocate the affirmative. If you
cannot figure out how to write that language the next best idea is to
say: "perm do the plan and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the
alternative."

## Argument Glossary

**AWS** (noun) -- Autonomous Weapons Systems, a synonym for a type of AI
the aff may interact with.

**Conceptual** (noun) -- Occurring primarily in thought our relating to
mental concepts**\
Threat construction** (noun) -- the manner in which international
governments and bodies view others as a perceived "threat" to constantly
prepare against.

**Securitization/Securitizing** (noun) -- The act of a
country/nation/military preparing itself from external threats due to
threat construction.

**Stigma** (noun) -- A mark of disgrace associated with a particular act
or action.

**The Other/Otherizing** (noun) -- A philosophy term defined as the
state of being different from the social identity of a person, and
judging those that do not meet that norm. This can extend to collective
groups as those who are perceived by the group as being different in
some way.

### Debate Terms

**Fiat** -- Fiat stems from the word "should" in the resolution. It is
the idea that we should assume the AFF plan in order to test its merits,
without the question of whether it realistically would pass in the real
world.

**"Net worse/Net better"** -- an eloquent way to say "overall
worse/overall better".

**Status quo** -- used to describe the current state of affairs, or the
current situation the case is set in.

**Impact** -- the reason a given argument is important. It is used to
explain why an argument is important, and why the judge should vote for
you.

**Extend (verb)** -- to "extend" an argument made in the 1AC to later
speeches.

**Extension (noun)** -- a category of argument that are made past the
1AC. Used to continue an argument made from previous speeches.

**Link** -- a card/evidence that "links" two arguments together. Without
a link to the resolution, you risk being irrelevant to the debate.

**Impact turn** -- an argument that the opponent's claim benefits your
argument.

**Shell** -- A type of argument meant to be generic and read before
using any specific links.

## Strategic Overview

# 1NC -- Threat Construction Shell

#### The affirmative plan was morally flawed from the start -- Perceiving any non-US or NATO nations as "threats to eliminate" is rooted in fear, which blinds the United States into emotionally-charged judgements.

**Rythoven 18** (Eric Van Rythoven, Instructor in the Department of
Political Science at Carleton University, 12-17-2018, accessed on
6-17-2022, Brill, \"On Backlash: Emotion and the Politicisation of
Security\",
<https://brill.com/view/journals/eris/5/3/article-p139_7.xml>)

[These embodied [judgments are significant because they can function as
a powerful source of certainty]{.mark}. [In informationally dense
environments, emotions can cut through the]{.mark} blooming, buzzing
[confusion and give us confidence in our interpretation]{.mark} of
events]{.underline}. One way this occurs is through convictions. Writing
at the turn of the 20th century, William James argued that emotions of
religious experience helped create especially strong beliefs -- what he
referred to as convictions -- in the existence of God.13 Today, modern
psychologists argue moral convictions are deeply tied to emotional
experience.14 Another way this occurs is through dispositions. **[[Even
mild emotional reactions towards]{.mark} objects and [events can
suppress conscious reflection and promote unthinking forms of
action]{.mark}.]{.underline}**15 [[American officials who felt distrust
towards Iran]{.mark}, for example, were disposed to [accept the
existence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program despite ambiguous
evidence]{.mark}.]{.underline}16 [Whether through unconscious
dispositions or more outwardly visible moral convictions, [emotions can
dramatically reduce the ambiguity of the world and make us certain that
one interpretation is 'true', while others are decisively
'false']{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### These judgements lead countries into developing technology for the sole purpose of [securitizing against backlash]{.underline} -- The act of constantly preparing for backlash from fear-constructed threats.

#### Rythoven continues:

Taking this widened range of emotional experience as an entry point,
this essay examines how emotions contribute to the politicisation of
security. [The discussion focuses on the understudied phenomena of
['backlash': situations where security claims provoke hostile emotional
reactions]{.mark}]{.underline}. A backlash is not the same thing as a
failed securitising move. [[Security claims can often fail because they
are met with apathy]{.mark} -- [as is the case of]{.mark} esoteric
[threats such as declining biodiversity or the emergence of artificial
intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other cases, audiences may be
sympathetic to a security claim even if they ultimately reject it -- as
is the case of residents who refuse mandatory evacuations when faced
with natural disasters. [The concept of backlash denotes something
different: [it is not a matter of security claims failing to resonate,
but]{.mark} a situation [where claims]{.mark} resonate in a way that
provokes hostility and contention.]{.underline} [It signals a visceral
and reactionary episode where security claims [are adamantly
rejected]{.mark}, speakers are rebuked, [and the subject of 'security'
becomes intensely controversial]{.mark}. In sum, backlash represents a
distinctive kind of politicisation of security.]{.underline}

## Links

### Link -- Lethal Autonomous Weapons

#### Lethal autonomous weapons were borne from an ideology of fear. The logic that we must always prepare for "the next big bad" produces a never-ending cycle of violence, a *self-fulfilling prophecy*.

**Hellmann et al. 17** (Gunther Hellmann and Benjamin Herborth, Gunther
Hellmann is professor of political science and a principal investigator
in the Cluster of Excellence, \"The Formation of Normative Orders,\" at
the Goethe University Frankfurt, Herborth is an assistant professor of
the Faculty of Arts, specializing in international relations at the
University of Groningen, January 2017, accessed on 6-17-2022, Cambridge
Core, \"Uses of \'the West\'\",
https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uses-of-the-west/B42DDCC72312CBC4D5D0888E0FCED54B)

Geopolitical determinacy based on an unavoidable power expansion as the
default option is fundamental. But a default option would still leave
some room for maneuver, if this default were perhaps not realized in the
case at hand. Here, a geopolitical framing adds further determinacy in
moving the analysis from the level of observation to the level of action
and in assuming that we simply cannot afford to ignore the possible
worst case. This is an understandable, if often counterproductive,
practical move, but it has quite pernicious implications, both
theoretical and prac- tical. [It basically claims that [whether or not
there really is some 'necessary' tendency to power expansion]{.mark} can
be considered secondary; [we simply assume it, because]{.mark}, to quote
former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, [there are]{.mark}
'[also unknown unknowns]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are things we don't
know we don't know.'12 [On the theoretical level, this ultra-prudential
(or ultra-paranoid) statement does not resolve anything: we still do not
know whether or not the behavior of states is characterized by a
tendency to expand their power, and hence to collide. And, on the
practical level, [if every state behaves on the]{.mark} general
[assumption that such a tendency exists]{.mark}, [the risk of a
dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy looms large in the
picture.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[\]{.underline}

### Link -- Cybersecurity 

#### The narrative of securitizing AI tech is most commonly found in cybersecurity policies. Cybersecurity was created with the justification of "protecting the nation" from threats, not its people. As a result, policies related to cybersecurity are counterproductive to the cause.

**Burton and Christou 21** (Joe Burton and George Christou, Burton is
Associate Lecturer in the School of International Relations at the
University of St Andrews, George Christou is a British-American chemist,
currently the Drago and Distinguished Professor at the University of
Florida, previously the Earl Blough Professor at the Indiana
University., 11-1-2021, accessed on 6-17-2022, Oxford University Press,
\"Bridging the gap between cyberwar and cyberpeace\",
<https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/97/6/1727/6412439?login=true>)

[The shortcomings of cyberwar narrative and practice are evident in
other areas of policy and intellectual debate too. [Cyber warfare is
often used to justify protecting the nation-state, even when the
protection of]{.mark} people or groups, including [vulnerable
communities]{.mark}, [within the state is not fully
considered]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cyber warfare has led to overly
militarized approaches to cyber security and the involvement of the
military (and intelligence agencies) in traditionally civilian areas of
society, even when police, justice or crime-based approaches may be more
suitable to countering cyber threats (in the same way that the 'war on
terror' was an overly militarized approach to a transnational security
threat). Often, military involvement is justified by reference to the
notions of the permanency and constancy of cyberwar; as the British
Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter described it, we are
'at war every day'.26 [And yet, [cyberspace is not a
controllable]{.mark} or conquerable [territory, and is fundamentally
ill-suited to the logic of]{.mark} national, [defendable
boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline}.27 [As Lawson argues, [the proliferation
of these types of narratives leads to 'the adoption of
counterproductive, even dangerous policies']{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Link -- China Advantage

#### China is constantly seen by the United States and NATO as a "strict and threatening *other*". This only serves to fuel a self-fulfilling view of China that justifies violence.

**Pan 4** (Chengxin Pan, The 'China Threat' in American
Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power
Politics, 6-1-2004, accessed on 6-16-2022, SAGE Journals, \"The "China
Threat" in American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of
other as Power Politics Authors Authors\",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030437540402900304?journalCode=alta>)

[**More specifically, I want to argue that [U.S. conceptions of China as
a threatening other are always]{.mark} intrinsically [linked to how U.S.
policymakers]{.mark}/mainstream China specialists [see]{.mark}
themselves (as representatives of the indispensable,
security**-conscious nation, for example).]{.underline} As such, they
are not value-free, objective descriptions of an independent,
preexisting Chinese reality out there, but are better understood as a
kind of normative, meaning-giving practice that often legitimates power
politics in U.S.-China relations and helps transform the \"China
threat\" into social reality. [[**In other words, it is
self-fulfilling** in practice, and is always part of the \"China
threat\" problem it purports merely to describe]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
doing so, I seek to bring to the fore two interconnected themes of
self/other constructions and of theory as practice inherent in the
\"China threat\" literature---themes that have been overridden and
rendered largely invisible by those common positivist assumptions.

### Link -- Russia Advantage

#### Historically, Russia has been seen as a threat to U.S. hegemony due to the Cold War-era stigma that Russia is a "communist state that needs to be purged". The U.S. military was complicit in this. 

**Hellmann et al. 17** (Gunther Hellmann and Benjamin Herborth, Gunther
Hellmann is professor of political science and a principal investigator
in the Cluster of Excellence, \"The Formation of Normative Orders,\" at
the Goethe University Frankfurt, Herborth is an assistant professor of
the Faculty of Arts, specializing in international relations at the
University of Groningen, January 2017, accessed on 6-17-2022, Cambridge
Core, \"Uses of \'the West\'\",
https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uses-of-the-west/B42DDCC72312CBC4D5D0888E0FCED54B)

[[Debate over a country's foreign policy identity was suppressed during
the Cold War, but this is no longer the case]{.mark}. This would apply
to all countries of the former Warsaw Pact, possibly also including
Russia (if [Russia is seen as suppressed by the Soviet Union, a line of
thought which was of some prominence in the 1990s]{.mark}) and
potentially also Italy.]{.underline} Geopolitical thought is
particularly well suited to respond to such an ontological anxiety,
since it provides allegedly objective and mate- rial criteria for
circumscribing the boundaries (and the internal logic) of 'national
interest' formulations. [[Invoking national interest almost inevitably
mobilizes justifications]{.mark} in terms wider than the interest of the
ruler or the government. Such wider justification can be [given by
ideologies, as in the case of anti-communism]{.mark} and anti-capitalism
[during the Cold War, or with reference to the 'nation']{.mark}, for
instance.]{.underline} But when yesterday's certitudes have gone
missing, national interests have to be anchored anew. In this context,
geopolitics in its classical under- standing provides 'coordinates' for
thinking a country's role in world affairs. Deprived of traditional
reference points and with a challenged self-understanding or outside
view of its role, spatial logic can quickly fill this ideational void
and fix the place of the state and its national interests within the
international system or society. And geopolitics is particularly well
suited to such a role, since it relies upon environmental determinism
from both physical geography (mobilized often through strategic
thinking) and human/cultural geography typical for discourses
essentializing a nation.

## Impacts

### Impact -- Poverty

#### Being blinded by war scenarios the affirmative creates is a smokescreen, distracting from global issues like poverty, which is only exacerbated through war.

**DeParle 20** **(Jason DeParle, Jason DeParle is a senior writer at The
New York Times and a frequent contributor to The New York Times
Magazine. Previously he served as a domestic correspondent in Washington
for The Times., 4-16-2020, accessed on 6-17-2022, The New York Times,
\"A Gloomy Prediction on How Much Poverty Could Rise\",**
<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/upshot/coronavirus-prediction-rise-poverty.html>**)**

**[The pandemic crippling [the American economy portends a sharp
increase in poverty]{.mark}, [to a level that could exceed that of the
Great Recession and that may even reach a high]{.mark} for the
half-century in which there is comparable data, [according to
researchers at Columbia]{.mark} University. The coming wave of hardship
is likely to widen racial disparities, with poverty projected to rise
twice as much among blacks as among whites. Poverty is also likely to
rise disproportionately among children, a special concern because brain
science shows that early deprivation can leave lifelong
scars]{.underline}**. Children raised in poverty on average have worse
adult health, lower earnings and higher incarceration rates. **[If
quarterly unemployment hits 30 percent --- as the president of one
Federal Reserve Bank predicts --- [15.4 percent of Americans will fall
into poverty]{.mark} for the year, the Columbia [researchers found, even
in the unlikely event the economy instantly recovers.]{.mark} [That
level of poverty would]{.mark} exceed the peak of the Great Recession
and [add nearly 10 million people to the ranks of the
poor.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Impact -- Structural Violence

#### Prioritizing the cyclical violence only reifies the structural violence many face. The affirmative plan plays into this violence.

**Hoddy 20** **(Eric T. Hoddy, Eric is an Associate Lecturer in the
Department of Politics at the University of York, 4-29-2020, accessed on
6-17-2022, Taylor & Francis, \"From agency to root causes: addressing
structural Barriers to transformative justice in transitional and
post-conflict settings\",**
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21582041.2020.1812706>**)**

[What do we mean by 'harm-generating relations and structures and 'root
causes'? Our understanding here draws on insights from realist social
theory]{.underline}, systems thinking and complexity theory (Archer,
1995; 2003; Bhaskar, 2016; Jackson, 2001; Mingers, 2014; Sayer, 2010).
[Simply put, [root causes are the underlying 'generative' or 'causal
mechanisms' that make events occur. The mechanisms of interest here are
those which link particular societal relations and structures to violent
or harmful outcomes and constraints on action]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Rylko-Bauer & Farmer, 2016). What makes a structure are various objects
and practices that stand in relation to one another, such as the
practice of exchange between buyers and sellers that characterise market
structures[. [Structures steer human activity]{.mark} are continually
reproduced [and occasionally transformed by the actors implicated in
them.]{.mark}]{.underline} The emergent 'powers' of structures to behave
in certain ways and their 'liabilities' towards certain kinds of change
are what is referred to as mechanisms. Mechanisms lie at the heart of
many problems that transformative justice is concerned with, such as
indirect violence and poverty, since these phenomena can only occur as a
function of societal structures. Both mechanisms and structures are
trans-empirical phenomena, that is, they are not readily open to
empirical measurement and can only be understood indirectly, through
retroductive enquiry that examines their empirical effects. [[Structures
may be social, cultural, political, economic and so on, and are
experienced in terms such as poverty, discrimination, and]{.mark} the
[lack of access to public services.]{.mark}]{.underline}Crucially, the
way mechanisms operate and the effects they have depends on their
interaction with various conditions, or other mechanisms, such as
material and cultural constraints, political decisions, and how people
decide to act (Mingers, 2014). Processes and outcomes are contingent,
and change is non-linear and causes difficult to trace. Mechanisms may
operate with and against each other to produce similar or different
outcomes, and feedback may ensue where outcomes affect change elsewhere
in the system. Mechanisms may remain unactivated under particular
configurations of conditions. In addition, mechanisms exist at multiple
scales, such as from the biophysical level to those found in the
structures of the global economy. The association of a given event or
phenomenon with mechanisms at different scales reflects the 'laminated'
nature of these systems (Bhaskar, Danermark, & Price, 2017).

## Alternative 

#### As the negative, it is within our ground to encourage debate by proposing an alternative method to the plan. 

#### Thus, the alternative is to embrace a world free of threat construction, free of the securitization that only perpetuates violence. 

## Solvency

**Prioritize our argument -- Even if the aff wins that wars are a
consequence of reality, [addressing the root cause]{.underline} of wars
should come first.**

**Glover 18** (Andrew Glover, Andrew Glover is a sociologist based in
Melbourne, 6-25-2018, accessed on 6-17-2022, Quillette, \"Beware of Root
Causes\", <https://quillette.com/2018/06/25/beware-of-root-causes/>)

[[Once a problem's root causes are found, night becomes day]{.mark}.
What was a murky cloud of befuddling [complexity becomes a social
problem structure so clear that its correct solutions are
obvious]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[It's easy to see why the prospect of uncovering and describing root
causes is so attractive to researchers, activists, and policymakers. For
researchers, seeking to identify the root cause of a social issue
appears intellectually ambitious, revealing the base social structure of
what we experience in everyday life.]{.underline} For activists,
identifying and tackling the root cause of something is likely to be far
more satisfying than merely addressing the symptoms. [[For
policymakers]{.mark} in government[, the prospect of funding programs
and initiatives that address the root of a problem is]{.mark} also
[appealing]{.mark}, given that it may reduce their need for future
expenditure in [dealing with the manifestation of the problem in
society]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## Answers To

### A2 Framing: Engage with the Real

#### Cross-apply Rythoven 18 and prefer our framing: The aff's method of engaging in endless violence only serves to reinforce a self-fulfilling prophecy:

#### The affirmative plan is just as imaginary as ours'; It's only a matter of choosing which side is more ethically right. Nothing done in a debate round truly passes in real life, so our alternative does work. 

**\**

### A2 Permutation: Do Both

#### The perm is nonsense - the AFF says they prevent war by developing AI [for war]{.underline}, while we reject the plan for that very reason.

#### And, Cross-apply Hoddy 20: You cannot do both. The permutation will fail because the affirmative plan is complicit in structural violence, and the negative's is not. Only through the alternative method can solve.

political decisions, and how people decide to act (Mingers, 2014).
Processes and outcomes are contingent, and change is non-linear and
causes difficult to trace. Mechanisms may operate with and against each
other to produce similar or different outcomes, and feedback may ensue
where outcomes affect change elsewhere in the system. Mechanisms may
remain unactivated under particular configurations of conditions. In
addition, mechanisms exist at multiple scales, such as from the
biophysical level to those found in the structures of the global
economy. The association of a given event or phenomenon with mechanisms
at different scales reflects the 'laminated' nature of these systems
(Bhaskar, Danermark, & Price, 2017).

### A2 War is Real/Escalation

#### Extend Rythoven 18: The rhetoric of escalation is built on fear of "what threat will strike next", which is just a byproduct of securitization. 

#### Thinking of war as inevitable is dangerous because it only justifies further violence. Treating conflict as part of human nature only serves to allow war to continue.

**Einsenstein 08** (Zillah Eisenstein has been Professor of Politics at
Ithaca College in New York for the last 35 years and is presently a
Distinguished Scholar in Residence, Resexing militarism for the globe,

[Hobbes was not right]{.underline} about most men or women. Yet [[the
naturalization and normalization of war are maintained by this notion
of]{.mark} a mythic [human nature]{.mark}, which is also constructed as
male. [It is dangerous to think that war is
inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}, and intrinsic to human nature. I do not
think genes are simply nature, nor do I think human nature is natural at
all. [[The concept of nature is]{.underline}]{.mark} truly [[political
at the start]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}]{.mark} is a construct that
[[reifies the needs of those who need us to fight their
wars]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this techno-masculinist world that we
inhabit we are shown war as the drama of manhood. Sometimes it is named
the 'Oedipal compulsion,' and the 'psychic quest for the father.' Yet
over 120,000 dutiful sons who fought the Vietnam War came home to commit
suicide, twice the number killed in the war (Boose 1993: 504, 605)

# AFF Answers

Remember to F-STOP!

When answering the K remember you want to "F-STOP" the K. Always make
the following arguments:

**Framework** -- defend why your affirmative matters and the methodology
behind your affirmative

**Solvency** -- You need to make an argument that the Alternative does
not solve the affirmative

**Theory** -- You should have a theoretical objection to the K. If there
is also a counterplan/DA strategy in the round that should be
conditionality. If the K is being framed as a Floating PIK you also need
to defend against that.

**Offense** -- Have offensive reasons that your affirmative is good.
These function as disadvantages to the alternative

**Permutation** -- You should always perm the K. The best perms take the
language of the alternative and also advocate the affirmative. If you
cannot figure out how to write that language the next best idea is to
say: "perm do the plan and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the
alternative."

### Framework -- Engage with the Real

#### Engaging with the physical is necessary to avoid reproducing the status quo. 

**Bryant 12** Professor of philosophy at Collin College (Levi, We'll
Never Do Better Than a Politician: Climate Change and Purity, 5/11/12,
http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/well-never-do-better-than-a-politician-climate-change-and-purity/)

However, [pointing]{.underline} this [out and deriding]{.underline}
market based [solutions doesn't get us very far.]{.underline} In fact,
[such a response]{.underline} to proposed market-based solutions [is
downright dangerous and irresponsible. The fact of the matter is
that]{.underline} 1) we currently live in a market based world, 2) there
is not, in the foreseeable future an alternative system on the horizon,
and 3), [above all, [we need to do something now]{.mark}. [We can't
afford to reject interventions simply because they don't meet our
ideal]{.mark} conceptions [of how things should be]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[We have to work with the world that is here, not the one that we would
like to be here.]{.underline}]{.mark} And here [[it's crucial to note
that]{.mark} pointing [this]{.mark} out [does not entail that we
shouldn't work for producing that other world]{.mark}. [It just means
that we have to grapple with the world that is actually]{.mark} there
[before us.]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶]{.mark} It pains me to write this
post because I remember, with great bitterness, the diatribes hardcore
Obama supporters leveled against legitimate leftist criticisms on the
grounds that these critics were completely unrealistic idealists who, in
their demand for "purity", were asking for "ponies and unicorns". This
rejoinder always seemed to ignore that words have power and that Obama,
through his profound power of rhetoric, had, at least the power to shift
public debates and frames, opening a path to making new forms of policy
and new priorities possible. The tragedy was that he didn't use that
power, though he has gotten better.

### Solvency

#### Extend your affirmative plan here, tying an explanation into why the judge should prefer your argument below. Consider the following questions:

- Why would your plan be better than the alternative method the negative
  proposes?

- Why is it important to solve for the affirmative?

- Does prioritizing conceptual violence over actual violence truly
  benefit anyone?

### Offense

#### Strategic action is key -- the alternative only recreates the most violent aspects of their impact claims. Only through urgent, real action can we hope to solve any of their impacts.

**Liotta '15** (P.H. Liotta Professor of Humanities at Salve Regina

International Relations and Public Policy) 2005 "Through the Looking
Glass" Sage Publications

[[Although it seems attractive to focus]{.mark} on exclusionary concepts
that insist [on desecuritization]{.mark},]{.underline} privileged
referent objects, and the 'belief' that threats and vulnerabilities are
little more than social constructions (Grayson, 2003), all [[these
concepts work in theory but fail in practice]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
it may be true that national security paradigms can, and likely will,
continue to dominate issues that involve human security vulnerabilities
-- and even in some instances mistakenly confuse 'vulnerabilities' as
'threats' -- [there are distinct linkages between these security
concepts and applications.]{.underline} With regard to environmental
security, for example, Myers (1986: 251) recognized these linkages
nearly two decades ago: [[National security is not just about fighting
forces and weaponry]{.mark}. [It relates to]{.mark} watersheds,
croplands, [forests,]{.mark} genetic resources, [climate and other
factors that rarely figure in the minds of military experts]{.mark} and
political leaders, [but]{.mark} increasingly [deserve]{.mark}, in their
collectivity, [to rank alongside military approaches as crucial in a
nation's security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ultimately, we are far from what
O'Hanlon & Singer (2004) term a global intervention capability on behalf
of 'humanitarian transformation'. Granted, we now have the threat of
mass casualty terrorism anytime, anywhere -- and states and regions are
responding differently to this challenge. Yet, the global community
today also faces many of the same problems of the 1990s: civil wars,
faltering states, humanitarian crises. We are nowhere closer
toaddressing how best to solve these challenges, even as they affect
issues of environmental, human, national (and even 'embedded') security.
Recently, there have been a number of voices that have spoken out on
what the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty
has termed the 'responsibility to protect':10 the responsibility of some
agency or state (whether it be a superpower such as the United States or
an institution such as the United Nations) to enforce the principle of
security that sovereign states owe to their citizens. [Yet, [the
creation of a sense of urgency to act]{.mark} -- even on some issues
that may not have some impact for years or even decades to come -- [is
perhaps the only appropriate]{.mark} first [response]{.mark}. The real
cost of not investing in the right way and early enough in the places
where trends and effects are accelerating in the wrong direction is
likely to be decades and decades of economic and political frustration
-- and, potentially, military engagement.]{.underline}

[\]{.underline}

### Permutation

#### The affirmative proposes that we perm: Doing both the aff plantext and negative alternative method.

#### While our affirmative resolves material impacts, the negatives' method solves structural ones. 

#### Cross-apply Bryant 12 and prefer our framing of the round -- We have no choice but to engage with the material world.

#### Banning or regulating autonomous weapons still links

**Hynek and Solovyeva 22** (Nik Hynek and Anzhelika Solovyeva, Nik Hynek
is Professor of Politics at Charles University, Prague, Anzhelika

[However, any attempt at regulating or banning weapons still hinges upon
a prevailing interpretation of strategic interests]{.underline}.
[Strategic interests and political positions are not immutable; they can
evolve at times bringing about outcomes previously thought to be
inconceivable.]{.underline} An example is the Chemical Weapons
Convention signed, including by the P5, after a long history of using
chemical weapons in armed conflicts (World War I, Vietnam War, Iran-Iraq
War, etc.). So [we cannot discard the likelihood of change in the
current state of affairs on AWS, especially as a preemptive ban is just
one among several options being examined.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the
CCW can arguably continue to postpone any committal decision to another
time or give states a mandate to negotiate in earnest some sort of
regulation, not necessarily a ban, on AWS. [Incidentally, we should not
rule out at this juncture that, if CCW discussions do not produce
effective results in a timely manner and a deadlock is reached by 2021,
other forums or solutions may be more seriously considered to remedy the
diplomatic impasse.]{.underline}5 Some still insist the CCW should be
given the resources to perform its originally intended function, and
propose to reform its mode of decision-making (Rosert and Sauer 2020,
p.20). [Though a ban on AWS is unlikely to be enacted or
effective]{.underline} (Crootof 2015, pp.1883--1891), [an international
legally binding instrument is still most actively pursued]{.underline}
(Acheson 2017, p.2). [However, an international 'regime' may be
complemented by additional protocols, domestic laws, as well as other
informal or non-binding mechanisms]{.underline} (Crootof 2015,
pp.1897--1903[). Alternatively, it may be set in motion by 'interim'
steps, for instance, a political declaration, before legally binding
measures are embraced]{.underline} (Acheson 2017, p.2). [Since there are
many pathways, the dividing lines drawn in this article should not be
seen as static. They are dynamic and contingent on changes in world
politics, strategic interests and technological developments, as well as
the ability and willingness to trade-off.]{.underline}

## AT: Cybersecurity threats are real

#### Cybersecurity threats are overblown, fearmongering swamps moderation and hurts necessary policy solutions

**Overland 17** (Indra Overland, PhD at the University of Cambridge and
has since worked extensively on the post-Soviet energy sector, including
oil, gas and renewables, 11-22-2017, accessed on 6-16-2022, Energy
Research & Social Science, \"PerspectiveThe geopolitics of renewable
energy: Debunking four emerging myths\",
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618308636?via%3Dihub>)

The growth of renewable energy is occurring simultaneously with another
major development: digitalization. [Digitalization can help keep grids
balanced, even as large numbers of renewable energy producers raise and
lower production depending on the weather \[61\]. This causes academics,
security think tanks, intelligence and security organizations,
parliamentary committees, and consultancies to fear that terrorists or
the intelligence services of hostile countries may hack the computers
that control utilities and grids \[39\], \[62\]. Clearly, there is cause
for these concerns as society becomes dependent on new technologies and
the growing complexity of digital systems for grid management can give
rise to new cybersecurity challenges. However, sometimes such concerns
are overstated, as in when the potential large-scale hacking of smart
meters was likened to "the modern day equivalent of a nuclear
strike"]{.underline} \[63\] cited in \[62\]. [Those who raise concerns
about the cyber-security of electricity grids at seminars and
conferences often invoke the case of a cyber-attack against three energy
distribution companies in Ukraine in 2015]{.underline} \[64\]. As a
result of this attack, substations in 30 locations in Western Ukraine
were shut down, cutting off the electricity supply to 230 000 people for
a period of between 1 and 6 hours \[65\]. [While utilities and
electricity distribution networks in many countries are subject to
frequent hacking attempts, this is considered to have been the first
successful attack on this scale and with such geopolitical significance,
foreshadowing the role of cyber-attacks in the future energy
system.]{.underline} However, it is worth noting that Ukraine was a
special case, comprising unusually dilapidated infrastructure, a high
level of corruption, a military conflict with Russia, and exceptional
possibilities for Russian infiltration due to the historical linkages
between the two countries \[66\]. Despite all these issues, only 0.015%
of [Ukraine\'s daily electricity consumption was affected, and only for
a few hours]{.underline} \[67\]. The use and associated risks of
electricity are not new per se, as all homes, companies, and
institutions in developed countries already depend on electricity grids,
and grids have been controlled digitally for decades[. It is also
probable that increased use of renewable energy will lead to greater
decentralization, with millions of prosumer households supplying
electricity. This may actually make the system more resilient, as many
different units will have to be hacked to destabilize the system as a
whole. Like many pessimistic, policy-oriented forecasts, those
concerning digitalization and cybersecurity have merit, but are also
potentially self-destructing predictions: the more such predictions are
made, the greater the likelihood that incumbents will be encouraged to
implement counter-measures.]{.underline} In other words, the predictors
are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a
prediction and may influence that context in the process. [As a source
of policy recommendations, discourse on cybersecurity is therefore
clearly useful; as a prediction about the future energy system it is
trickier. As one of the rare critical contributions in the cybersecurity
field put it, "Moderate and measured takes on cyber security threats are
swamped by the recent flood of research and policy positions in the
cyber research field offering hyperbolic perspectives based on limited
observations"]{.underline} \[68\] (see also \[69\]).

#### Cybersecurity is already one of the top three security concerns of NATO

**Rythoven 18** (Eric Van Rythoven, Instructor in the Department of
Political Science at Carleton University, 12-17-2018, accessed on
6-17-2022, Brill, \"On Backlash: Emotion and the Politicisation of
Security\",
<https://brill.com/view/journals/eris/5/3/article-p139_7.xml>)

[NATO views on cyber-threats have been addressed in research but the
field is far from overstudied. In "NATO and Cyber security" Roger André
Tosbotn investigates the prominence of "cyber security" in NATO's
official documents, and examines the way in which NATO's outwards
understanding of the cyber domain has changed over time]{.underline}.
The thesis adopts content analysis to measure word frequency
(prominence) and discourse analysis to examine change of the
conceptualization of the "cyber domain" over time. The documentation
analysed span from 2002, when "cyber" was first mentioned in official
NATO documents, until the beginning of 2016 when the thesis was written.
[Tosbotn's results illustrate two main points; firstly, they indicate a
relative prominence of "cyber" vis-à-vis other aspects NATO deem as
important. Secondly, it elucidates several aspects of NATO's strategic
culture. Russia and terrorism remain the main concerns of the alliance,
but mentions of "cyber" has come to rank third in overall
mentions.]{.underline} In addition, critical junctures in the period of
2007-2009 (cyber-attacks in Estonia and Georgia) and 2014 (The Stuxnet
virus) yielded a considerably higher frequency in mentions of "cyber[".
The qualitative findings demonstrate a conceptualization that has grown
to embody a rich variety of associations. Once a juncture has been
reached the milieu and operation of NATO has transformed and forced them
to reformulate "cyber" as a conspicuous security dimension.]{.underline}

#### Cyberthreats are real and could trigger Article 5

**Rythoven 18** (Eric Van Rythoven, Instructor in the Department of
Political Science at Carleton University, 12-17-2018, accessed on
6-17-2022, Brill, \"On Backlash: Emotion and the Politicisation of
Security\",
<https://brill.com/view/journals/eris/5/3/article-p139_7.xml>)

[The purpose of this section has been to reinforce the aim of the paper
and to show that a case study of NATO is of interest. Cyber-threats are
undoubtedly one of the Alliances main concerns and the understanding of
them is constantly changing]{.underline}. Different cyber security
strategies and agendas, elements of uncertainty, the absence of
universal definitions, and the lack of consensus over how cyber-attacks
should be evaluated render cyber security a delicate matter. [Any
counter measure has the potential of being controversial. In the worst
of cases minor disagreements could escalate into full-scale
conflict.]{.underline} [Consequently, NATO declaring that cyber-attacks
can trigger its Article 5 stress for a clarification of their structure
of thought.]{.underline}

## AT: AWS threat is real

**Some experts argue AI would make war less harmful**

**Hynek and Solovyeva 22** (Nik Hynek and Anzhelika Solovyeva, Nik Hynek
is Professor of Politics at Charles University, Prague, Anzhelika
Solovyeva is a doctoral candidate, lecturer and researcher at the
Department of Security Studies, Institute of Political Studies, Charles

socio-political prospects - AI & SOCIETY\",
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-01048-1>)

[To warrant and sustain their controversial stance on AWS, ban-resisting
actors engage in what Sauer and Reveraert (2018, pp.446--447) call
'stigma rejection'. They recognize the stigma but detach themselves from
it. For example, [both Russia and the US highlight the preservation of a
meaningful human element in their AI-oriented military
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} (TASS 2018; BBC 2019). [[The US]{.mark}
furthermore [insists that]{.mark}, even in the event of degraded or lost
communications, teleoperated [systems should not be capable of
autonomously selecting and engaging targets]{.mark}]{.underline} (DoD
2012/2017). Following the same course, the UK has also underlined the
signifcance of human direction for the application of lethal force
(Country Statement 2018b). China has even called for a ban on the use of
fully autonomous weapons (CSKR 2019a). The language of human
'involvement', 'judgement', 'control' and 'responsibility' has generally
been agreed upon and formally codifed at the CCW (CCW 2018; CCW 2019a).
[However, the question of norm compliance remains shrouded in ambiguity,
chosen by ban-resisting actors as an efective strategy to reconcile
normative pressure and preference for strategic fexibility.]{.underline}
During CCW GEE discussions, Russia has repeatedly requested to cut down
on unnecessary details in the fnal report, especially when there has
been no consensus or sufcient evidence. The US [has]{.underline} in turn
expressed concerns at the rigid concept of 'human control' (Acheson
2018; Acheson and Pytlak 2019). China's diplomatic position on AWS can
also be characterized by a degree of 'strategic ambiguity'. This is
evident, for instance, in its recent position papers and its national
strategy of 'civil-military fusion' (Kania 2018). At the same time, it
opposes a ban on the development or production of AWS (CSKR 2019a). The
situation is similar to private companies in the US, Russia, China,
Israel, Europe and beyond. [[While explicit about how human control is
ensured, some continue working on technologies relevant to AWS]{.mark}.
Quite a few do so [even without clear]{.mark}, at least clearly
declared, [policies concerning the question of human
control]{.mark}]{.underline} (PAX 2019, p.5--8). On top of that,
ban-resisting actors have simultaneously resorted to what might be
termed 'counter-stigmatization' (Sauer and Reveraert 2018, pp.446--447).
Often backed by knowledge based expertise, they have tried to shift
attention to the positive value of AWS (Country Statement 2018a, 2018b,
2019). Robert Work, former US Deputy Secretary of Defense, once 90 AI &
SOCIETY (2021) 36:79--99 1 3 argued: ['AI will make weapons more
discriminant and better, less likely to violate the laws of war, less
likely to kill civilians, less likely to cause collateral
damage']{.underline} (Fryer-Biggs 2019[). A clear indication of expert
support is, for example, that the Berlin Statement was not endorsed
unanimously at the experts' workshop in Berlin]{.underline} (ICRAC,
n.d.). [Referring to computer scientist Ronald C. Arkin, professor
George R. Lucas also assumed that autonomous robotic technology might
'render war itself, and the conduct of armed hostilities, less
destructive, risky, and indiscriminate']{.underline} (Lucas 2014).
