[[NATO is a force multiplier that gives the United States access to
military tools in greater numbers than it can achieve by itself. Non-US
NATO members have 1,857,000 active duty service members and 1,232,290
reservists. The seven largest non-US NATO member armies have the same
number of active duty troops as the United States (1.3 million). Non-US
NATO members can deploy 6,983 battle tanks, 34,000 armored vehicles,
2,600 combat aircraft, 382 attack helicopters, 252 major naval craft
(including submarines), and 1,582 patrol and surface combatants. France
and the United Kingdom alone provide 30 percent of the Alliance's
ballistic-missile-submarine fleet]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO's European
members are beginning to host the first stages of the Alliance's new
ballistic-missile-defense system aimed at preventing long-range attacks
by rogue states on the United States and Europe. [[NATO members
frequently share intelligence across the Alliance, aiding US operations
and intelligence-gathering. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany
alone add 40,000 intelligence personnel to the Alliance's intelligence
capabilities. Non-US NATO members host twenty-eight US main operating
bases in Europe, which cut down on the time needed for the United States
to respond to a crisis and are critical for US missions in the Middle
East and North Africa. In 2009, for example, Germany contributed \$800
million to offset and improve its US bases.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**2) The US promised to work with NATO on cyber security**

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development[[. The
Associated Press reports that the U.S. Defense Department will announce
a new commitment to use offensive and defensive cybersecurity
capabilities on behalf of NATO allies. The new commitment is notable
given how cybersecurity has long been treated as an exceptional domain
of operations, and cyber capabilities reserved as strategic national
assets to be shared with only the closest of
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. With this announcement, the Pentagon is
suggesting that cyber capabilities might be used alongside conventional
weapons with allies and indeed, equal weight appears to be given to
offensive and defensive operations. Perhaps most significantly, the
announcement moves NATO partners closer to what has been a tight coterie
of U.S.-favored signals intelligence partners such as the United
Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. [[The DoD announcement is a
sign of the continued, if nascent, normalization of cybersecurity under
the current administration and in Europe. Even where offensive cyber
operations may not rise to the level of war, they provide
decision-makers with options to influence the geopolitical environment.
This aligns with recent trends in the U.S. military to integrate cyber
capabilities into maneuver units and large exercises, and reflects the
shift towards more risk acceptant and offensive measures to counter
cyberattacks found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[Solvency Deficit- AI AFF]{.underline}**

**1) The United States needs NATO in AI**

[[NATO Review]{.underline}]{.mark}, October 25,

[[With the formal adoption of the NATO AI Strategy, Allies have
committed to the necessary cooperation and collaboration to meet these
very challenges in both defence and security, naming NATO as the primary
transatlantic forum.]{.underline}]{.mark} The aim of NATO's AI Strategy
is to accelerate AI adoption by enhancing key AI enablers and adapting
policy, including by adopting Principles of Responsible Use for AI and
by safeguarding against threats from malicious use of AI by state and
non-state actors. [[By acting collectively through NATO, Allied
governments also ensure a continued focus on interoperability and the
development of common standards. Overall, with innovation ecosystems
implicating different actors and faster technology lifecycles than
typically included in traditional capability development systems, the
NATO AI Strategy is also a recognition that exploitation of AI will
require new efforts to foster and leverage the Alliance's innovation
potential, including through new partnerships and mechanisms. Taken
together, these efforts will in turn strengthen the Alliance's ability
to pursue cooperative security efforts and to engage with international
partners and other international organisations on matters of
international security.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**2) The United States is in an AI race with China**

[[As the United States races with China to apply artificial intelligence
for military purposes, many experts worry that it may be hampered by a
shift in the nature of AI. The conventional wisdom has been that, until
now, American technologists could depend on elite researchers and faster
computers to outperform their Chinese rivals. However, these advantages
are no longer the keys to harnessing AI most
effectively.]{.mark}]{.underline} Data is[[. Chinese AI experts believe
that China's larger population and lax privacy controls give China a
durable advantage in collecting the best data sets to teach AI
algorithms how to optimize their performance.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Kai-Fu Lee, China's most prominent AI researcher, has dubbed China the
"Saudi Arabia of data" and argues that China's data advantage is
expanding by the day. [[The Center for Data Innovation, an American
think tank, agrees, calculating that the Chinese population generates
terabytes more information than Americans do.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The success of American technology companies illustrates the most
promising path for the U.S. military to pursue at the dawn of its own AI
age]{.underline}]{.mark}. That does not mean that the Department of
Defense should simply copy Silicon Valley's strategy mindlessly. While
data from the commercial sector --- such as an individual's social
connections, current employer, or personal finances --- will continue to
be a gold mine for global intelligence agencies, data relevant to the
future battlefield will primarily concern soldiers, vehicles, training
exercises, and the like. No organization will have more relevant data
for these use cases than the military itself. [[Fortunately, the Defense
Department has positioned itself well to become the globally dominant
platform for military data, just as American technology companies
dominate the global marketplace in their realms. The United States
counts most industrialized nations as military allies and equipment
manufactured by the United States or its NATO allies is driven and flown
around the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the Defense Department
has yet to capitalize on this potential. NATO weapons and vehicles were
originally designed to be interoperable in an industrial-age sense,
shooting the same bullets or refueling from the same connectors.
Unfortunately, NATO has not yet upgraded for the information age. The
data generated by U.S. Army tanks cannot easily be accessed or
aggregated with data generated by Marine Corps tanks, let alone British
ones. Just as the Goldwater-Nichols Act once pushed America's separate
armed services to break out of their isolated battlefield domains,
military data must now discover how to operate jointly as well. Three
initiatives could be critical to accomplishing this.
