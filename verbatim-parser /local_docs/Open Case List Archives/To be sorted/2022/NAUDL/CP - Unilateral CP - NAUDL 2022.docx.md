# Introduction:

Welcome to the "US Do It Alone" counterplan (CP) in this year's evidence
set. This file is not for debaters in their first rounds, but if you are
attending your third or fourth tournament can be a fun addition to the
packet. You'll find all of the evidence you need to construct a winning
argument on the CP against the AI or Cybersecurity affirmatives. This
file also includes some affirmative answers to the counterplan.

This is an argument central to the topic. The basic idea behind this
argument is that the Affirmative must prove that the United States and
NATO should cooperate on the affirmative to be part of this year's
resolution. The negative can therefore agree with part of the idea of
the plan (AI/Cybersecurity good) but disagree with another part of the
plan (NATO cooperation is good) and win the debate round.

## Negative Introduction & Running the CP

When using this file as the negative there are few things to keep in
mind. Counterplans are a strategy that argues that while the affirmative
may solve a real problem, it does so in a way that either makes the
problem worse and/or causes some other bigger problem. The negative will
win if they win that they solve the problems as well as the affirmative
while avoiding a bad impact. Like all debate arguments they have some
predictable components.

First, counterplans, like plans, need a **text**. This will be the one
or two sentence action that the negative will defend. That text will
change depending on which affirmative you are debating so make sure you
update it before every round.

Second, there is a 1NC shell that includes **solvency**. You must prove
that you also solve the problems of the affirmative even though you
don't do the same action.

Finally a counterplan includes a **net benefit**. A net benefit is a
disadvantage that the counterplan avoids and the plan calls. It is a
reason to prefer the negative's arguments instead of the affirmative's
arguments.

## Affirmative Introduction & Answering the CP

A CP argues that the affirmative may solve a real problem, but they do
so in a way that causes other worse problems. As the affirmative, you
should first always try to STOP the CP:

1)  Solvency Deficit: Make an argument that the counterplan doesn't
    solve as well as the affirmative. This can come from cards in the
    file. It may also be embedded in cards in your 1AC.

2)  Theoretical Objections: Make an argument that there is a reason the
    counterplan should not exist.

3)  Offense (against the net benefit): You will want to answer the net
    benefit like you would any disadvantage. Attack the link,
    uniqueness, and impact of the net benefit. For example, if you can
    win that the affirmative is better for the economy than the CP you
    will win.

Permutations: This argument means that the plan and the CP could exist
at the same time while not triggering the net benefit. Some permutations
are simple "Perm do both" others require evidence. For example, in this
counterplan the counterplan excludes the NATO part of the plan, so the
best permutation is perm do the affirmative and then the CP, which would
argue that NATO is necessary to success on AI/Cybersecurity.

# U.S. DO IT ALONE CP

## PLAN TEXT

#### The United States Federal Government should "insert plan text excluding cooperation with NATO" 

### 1NC 

#### The U.S. alone carries most of the NATO burden

[[CATO Institute]{.underline}]{.mark}, December 5,
20[[19]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-no-longer-serves-american-interests

[[The alliance continued to add members. Most recently it accepted
Montenegro, with North Macedonia awaiting treaty approval by the 29
current members.]{.underline}]{.mark} Next up, the Duchy of Grand
Fenwick, featured in the novel The Mouse that Roared! The latest
out‐​of‐​area wars have been distant, unconventional conflicts:
Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria, of which the latter triggered French
President Emmanuel Macron's complaint about a lack of allied
coordination. [[Some NATO fans call the organization a "global
alliance," presumably ready to act as global cop. In every case, of
course, the heavy lifting inevitably falls on Washington. Every recent
president criticized Europeans for failing to make sufficient
contributions for the common defense. Defense Secretary Robert Gates
suggested that the alliance itself was at risk, since "there will be
dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress, and in the
American body politic writ large, to expend increasingly precious funds
on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the
necessary resources ... in their own defense."]{.mark}]{.underline}
President Trump expressed similar sentiments, though more crudely.

#### 2) The EU has high tech regulations- co-op with NATO would necessitate co-op with GDPR 

[[Proton Technologies AG]{.underline}]{.mark},
20[[22]{.underline}]{.mark}, https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/

[[The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the toughest privacy
and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the
European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere,
so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The
regulation was put into effect on May 25, 2018.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
GDPR will levy harsh fines against those who violate its privacy and
security standards, with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of
euros. With the GDPR, [[Europe is signaling its firm stance on data
privacy and security at a time when more people are entrusting their
personal data with cloud services and breaches are a daily
occurrence.]{.underline}]{.mark} The regulation itself is large,
far-reaching, and fairly light on specifics, making GDPR compliance a
daunting prospect, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs).

#### 3) tech innovation help, broader economy

[[Brookings]{.underline}]{.mark}, October 19,
20[[11]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://www.brookings.edu/research/technology-and-the-innovation-economy/

[[Innovation and entrepreneurship are crucial for long-term economic
development. Over the years, America's well-being has been furthered by
science and technology.]{.underline}]{.mark} Fears set off by the Soviet
Union's 1957 launch of its Sputnik satellite initiated a wave of U.S.
investment in science, engineering, aerospace, and technology[[. Both
public and private sector investment created jobs, built industries,
fueled innovation, and propelled the U.S. to leadership in a number of
different fields.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this paper, [[I focus on ways
technology enables innovation and creates economic prosperity. I review
the range of new advances in education, health care, and communications,
and make policy recommendations designed to encourage an innovation
economy.]{.underline}]{.mark} By adopting policies such as a permanent
research and development tax credit, more effective university knowledge
commercialization, improving STEM worker training, reasonable
immigration reform, and regional economic clusters, we can build an
innovation economy and sustain our long-term prosperity[[. Researchers
have found a link between technology innovation and national economic
prosperity. For example, a study of 120 nations between 1980 and 2006
undertaken by Christine Qiang estimated that each 10 percentage point
increase in broadband penetration adds 1.3 percent to a high income
country's gross domestic product and 1.21 percent for low to
middle-income nations.]{.underline}]{.mark}\[i\]

#### 4) Tech innovation is needed to stop econ collapse 

Brenda [[Schmidt]{.underline}]{.mark}, September 16,
20[[20]{.underline}]{.mark}, Schmidt is the CEO of Coplex, a corporate
startup studio that partners with entrepreneurs, industry experts, and
corporate innovators to establish high-growth tech companies. She
previously founded Solera Health and has spent her career educating,
speaking, advising, and leading in the name of creating social impact.
https://innovationmanagement.se/2020/09/16/how-the-next-wave-of-innovators-can-rebuild-the-economy-after-a-crisis/

[[During the last economic expansion, lean startups tapped into the
potential of the internet for social networking and transformed the cell
phone into a platform for apps that we now consider essential to our
lives.]{.underline}]{.mark} Teenagers in dorm rooms and former corporate
executives in startup incubators figured out how to move faster and
build better than corporations with thousands of employees and seemingly
endless resources. The companies they launched are now some of the
world's most powerful organizations. Will tomorrow's disruptors follow
the same formula? Don't bet on it. [[Today, established corporations
have more advantages over ventures --- even if fundraising does pick
up]{.underline}]{.mark}. The surge in stocks while small businesses
floundered and VCs took a breather illustrates an important point about
today's economy: The resource inequality between America's largest
companies and potential disruptors is bigger than ever[[. Prior to the
pandemic, leading organizations in nearly every industry raced to adopt
digital infrastructures and new technologies. As a result, many have
adapted quickly to the new normal --- and some have even thrived.
Throughout the summer, major tech companies have continued to hire, and
only recently has employment in the sector begun to show signs of
slowing.]{.mark} [If you're leading a company through the current
crisis, now is the time to become more innovative and creative than
ever. Regardless of how big your company or industry might be, winning
in the next normal will require you to think bigger and move
faster.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### CYBER SECURITY SOLVENCY

#### The U.S. should improve cyber security alone

[[MIT Technology Review]{.underline}]{.mark}, March 18,
20[[22]{.underline}]{.mark},
<https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/18/1047395/inside-the-plan-to-fix-americas-never-ending-cybersecurity-failures/>

[[The change in tack comes just as the war in Ukraine, and the
heightened threat of new cyberattacks from Russia, is forcing the White
House to rethink how it keeps the nation safe.
"]{.underline}]{.mark}We\'re at an inflection point," Chris Inglis, the
White House's national cyber director and Biden's top advisor on
cybersecurity, tells MIT Technology Review in his first interview since
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [["When critical functions that serve the
needs of society are at issue, some things are just not discretionary."
The White House's new cybersecurity strategy consists of stronger
government oversight, rules mandating that organizations meet minimum
cybersecurity standards, closer partnerships with the private sector, a
move away from the current market-first approach, and enforcement to
make sure any new rules are followed.]{.mark}]{.underline} It will take
its cue from some of the nation's most famous regulatory landmarks, such
as the Clean Air Act or the formation of the Food and Drug
Administration. With looming threats from Russian hackers, the FCC is
planning for the prospect of Russians hijacking internet traffic, a
tactic they've seen Moscow employ in the past. A new FCC initiative,
announced March 11, aims to investigate if US telecom companies are
doing enough to be secure against the threat. However, it's a real test
for the agency because it doesn\'t have the power to force companies to
comply. They are relying on the possibility of a national security
crisis to get them to toe the line[[. For many officials, this almost
total reliance on the goodwill of the market to keep citizens safe
cannot continue. \"The purely voluntary approach \[to cybersecurity\]
simply has not gotten us to where we need to be, despite decades of
effort," says Suzanne Spaulding, previously a senior Obama
administration cybersecurity official.]{.mark}]{.underline}
"Externalities have long justified regulation and mandates such as with
pollution and highway safety.\" Crucially, the White House's top
officials concur. "I'm a strong fan of what Suzanne says and I agree
with her," says Inglis. Without a dramatic change, advocates argue,
history will repeat itself.

#### High tech regulations are bad for innovation

[[Harvard Business Review]{.underline}]{.mark}, February 9,
20[[19]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-more-regulation-for-u-s-tech-could-backfire

[The best regulator of technology, it seems, is simply more
technology.]{.underline} And despite fears that channels are blocked,
markets are locked up, and gatekeepers have closed networks that the
next generation of entrepreneurs need to reach their audience, somehow
they do it anyway --- often embarrassingly fast, whether the presumed
tyrant being deposed is a long-time incumbent or last year's startup
darling. [[That, in any case, is the theory on which U.S. policymakers
across the political spectrum have nurtured technology-based innovation
since the founding of the Republic. Taking the long view, it's clearly
been a winning strategy, especially when compared to the more invasive,
command-and-control approach taken by the European Union, which
continues to lag on every measure of the Internet
economy.]{.underline}]{.mark} (Europe's strategy now seems to be little
more than to hobble U.S. tech companies and hope for the best.) Or
compared to China, which has built tech giants of its own, but only by
limiting outside access to its singularly enormous local market. And
always with the risk that too much success by Chinese entrepreneurs may
one day crash headfirst into a political culture that is deeply
uncomfortable with the internet's openness[[. That solution --- to stay
the course, to continue leaving tech largely to its own correctives
---]{.underline}]{.mark} is cold comfort to those who believe tomorrow's
problems, coming up fast in the rear-view mirror, are both unprecedented
and catastrophic.

#### Government regulation of tech is bad 

[[Forbes]{.underline}]{.mark}, March 26, 20[[18]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2018/03/26/no-we-really-dont-need-government-regulation-of-the-tech-industry/?sh=227500f6eb8d

[[In any event, in the case of tech, without doubt, the private sector
will be far ahead of the bureaucrats. Expert regulators get hired by the
regulated. If the regulators themselves were any good at what they do,
then it is more than likely that they\'d end up working for one of the
regulated companies.]{.underline}]{.mark} Why? This happens because the
private sector can and does pay far more than does the government for
such expertise. [[The hiring companies can afford to pay fat salaries
because the knowledge the former regulators bring allows the companies
to run circles around the rules.]{.underline}]{.mark} Investopedia dubs
the situation one of \"gamekeeper turned poacher.\" The only caveat is
that the poacher manages to give the gamekeeper the runaround while
remaining within the rules of the law. In short, it makes the
regulations impotent[[. It is part of a problem known as regulatory
capture whereby the regulators listen far more to the companies/industry
they are supposed to oversee rather than anyone
else.]{.underline}]{.mark} For a more detailed outline of the matter see
Investopedia. Regulatory capture, without doubt, can occur in the tech
business just as much as it has elsewhere[[. Regulations help the
largest companies the most. By no means least important, is the fact
that government rules help to entrench the dominant companies more than
they would be otherwise. Regulations, whether they be simple
form-filling or more extensive, are costly to administer by the
companies regulated. These costs tend to disproportionately fall on
smaller firms which don\'t have the economies of scale associated with
being a large corporation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### 5) Innovation key to cyber security

[[Nasdaq]{.underline}]{.mark}, October 20[[21]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://indexes.nasdaq.com/docs/Cybersecurity%20Innovation.pdf

[[As the world becomes more digitally connected, cybersecurity's role in
business, technology, and society has become mission
critical.]{.underline}]{.mark} Simply put, the modern world is built on
cybersecurity. Without it, capital cannot flow freely, information
cannot be stored safely, and businesses, governments and critical
infrastructure cannot operate securely[[. One major challenge in
securing a world that relies on data and connectivity is that the rapid
pace of technological change has created more vulnerabilities and
opportunities for cyber threat actors, e.g.: nation states, groups, or
cybercriminals, to exploit]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a result of these
rapid technological advancements across several different technologies,
businesses, organizations, and cybersecurity companies have been forced
to embrace new, innovative technologies to make the world more secure.
[[Since the world has become more digital, cybersecurity has also become
a key element in the way businesses make decisions and innovate. For
example, in a KPMG article, they stated that businesses and
organizations have shifted from a paradigm of asking, "How do I mitigate
and manage risk?" to "How do I leverage cyber security to give my
business a competitive advantage?" 1 Said another way, cybersecurity is
a key component of unlocking innovation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### 6) Innovation in Cybersecurity is imperative 

[[Nasdaq]{.underline}]{.mark}, October 20[[21]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://indexes.nasdaq.com/docs/Cybersecurity%20Innovation.pdf

[[Today, innovation within the cybersecurity theme is just as critical
as the cybersecurity itself. This is due in part to the rampant
technological change taking place across both sides of the
cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[aisle]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the
businesses and organizations deploying cybersecurity to protect their
data, networks, etc. and the threat actors who are looking to steal,
destroy, and wreak havoc on those systems being protected. [[What's
happening though is that the threat actors are beginning to use more
advanced methods and technologies, making it paramount for cybersecurity
firms and cybersecurity technology to keep up with this change. How?
Through innovation. According to the World Economic Forum in The Global
Risk Report 2021, "Business, government, and household cybersecurity
infrastructure and/or measures are outstripped or rendered obsolete by
increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyber-crimes, resulting in
economic disruption, financial loss, geopolitical tensions and/or social
instability." 8 Cybersecurity must innovate to keep up with the
sophistication and frequency of cybercrimes.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AI SOLVENCY

#### NATO can only set AI regulations IF all countries agree

[[Politico]{.underline}]{.mark}, Marc 29, 20[[21]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/

[[The problem is that NATO\'s members are at very different stages when
it comes to thinking about AI in the military context.The U.S., the
world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use of AI in the
defense realm. But in Europe, most countries --- France and the
Netherlands excepting --- barely mention the technology's defense and
military implications in their national AI
strategies.]{.mark}]{.underline} "It's absolutely no surprise that the
U.S. had a military AI strategy before it has a national AI strategy,\"
but the Europeans \"did it exactly the other way around,\" said Ulrike
Franke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign
Relations, said: [[That echoes familiar transatlantic differences ---
and previous U.S. President Donald Trump\'s complaints --- over defense
spending, but also highlights the different approaches to AI regulation
more broadly.]{.underline}]{.mark}The EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious
line, touting itself as \"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate
excesses and keeping citizens\' data safe. The U.S., which tends to be
light on regulation and keen on defense, sees things differently.
[[There are also divergences over what technologies the alliance ought
to develop, including lethal autonomous weapons systems --- often dubbed
"killer robots" --- programmed to identify and destroy targets without
human control. Powerful NATO members including France, the U.K., and the
U.S. have developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these
weapons, while others like Belgium and Germany have expressed serious
concerns about the technology.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The United States can manage AI alone 

[[Brookings]{.underline}]{.mark}, May 17, 20[[22]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2022/05/17/the-u-s-can-improve-its-ai-governance-strategy-by-addressing-online-biases/

[[The United States has been working to codify the National Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Initiative that focuses on six strategic pillars:
improving AI innovation, advancing trustworthy AI, creating new
education and training opportunities through AI, improving existing
infrastructure through new technologies, facilitating federal and
private sector utilization of AI to improve existing systems, and
promoting an international environment that supports further advances in
AI.]{.underline}]{.mark} In April 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce,
and the National Institute on Standards (NIST) announced members of the
inaugural National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC),
which will be tasked with advising the Biden administration on how to
proceed with national AI governance efforts[[. At their first meeting on
May 4, 2022, the NAIAC discussed the use of AI pertaining to U.S.
competitiveness, issues related to workforce, and whether there is
adequate national oversight of AI systems. Taken together, the
objectives of the national AI initiative and the creation of the NAIAC
will ensure strategic and timely approaches to the design and deployment
of autonomous systems, as well as further establish national
norms.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### 3) NATO is ill-equipped to handle AI development 

[[Defense News]{.underline}]{.mark}, February 15,
20[[18]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://www.defensenews.com/smr/munich-security-forum/2018/02/16/ai-warfare-is-coming-and-some-global-leaders-say-nato-isnt-ready/

[[The future of warfare will involve artificial intelligence systems
acting as lethal weapons, and much like cyber a decade ago, NATO allies
are ill-equipped to manage the potential threat, said current and former
European leaders speaking at the Munich Security Conference.]{.mark}
[Kersti Kaljulaid, president of Estonia, estimated a 50 percent chance
that by the middle of this century we will have an AI system capable of
launching a lethal attack.]{.mark}]{.underline} And yet, just as the
world was not prepared for a cyberattack when Russia first launched a
cyberattack against Estonia in 2007 --- bombarding websites of Estonian
parliament, banks, ministries, and news outlets [[--- there is no
strategy or international law to deter such tactics of
warfare.]{.mark}]{.underline} First, "we need to understand the risks
--- what we're afraid of," said Kaljulaid,, pointing to three: someone
using AI disruptively; intelligence going widespread; and AI depleting
energy.

#### 4) Innovation key to AI 

[[Science Direct,]{.underline}]{.mark} December

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521005138

[[Artificial intelligence (AI) is radically changing the process and
outcomes of digital innovation owing to its specific nature and
ontology]{.underline}]{.mark} (Benbya et al., 2021; Haefner et al.,
2021; Kohli and Melville, 2019; Nambisan et al., 2019, 2017; Yoo et al.,
2012[[). The nature of the changes triggered by AI is fundamentally
different from those triggered by other traditional information
technologies as it is developing new ways to collect and process vast
amounts of information]{.underline}]{.mark} (Balasubramanian et al.,
2020; Haefner et al., 2021[[). The increasing fluidity and complexity
between digital innovation processes and outcomes leads to a significant
new way of value creation and differentiation by the
competitors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nambisan et al., 2017; Yoo et al.,
2012). [[This encourages a rethinking of how actors, organisations, AI,
and action possibilities may pursue innovative
endeavours.]{.underline}]{.mark} Prior studies suggest that AI can
support and speed up labour-intensive information processes in Human
Resource Management (HRM) (Leicht-Deobald et al., 2019), evaluate
candidates with the same criteria consistently (Metcalf et al., 2019),
make fairer and less biased decisions compared to human intuition
(Cowgill, 2019), and promote diversity in organisations (Daugherty et
al., 2019).

#### 1) A permutation would just be the AFF, and cause war

https://www.justsecurity.org/80347/expert-backgrounder-nato-response-options-to-potential-russia-cyber-attacks/

[[Over recent weeks, concern has been expressed that Russia might launch
hostile cyber operations against the United States and other NATO
members in parallel with a military campaign against Ukraine. That
military campaign is now fully underway.]{.underline}]{.mark} This
article examines how the feared Russian cyber operations would be
characterized under international law and outlines the response options
open to States targeted by them. [[The analysis is, among other things,
a cautionary note to those who would too readily jump to describing such
Russian operations as an "attack" that triggers the alliance's
collective self-defense mechanism. It is important to sort through the
more likely scenarios of Russian-led activity below that threshold, as
well as if that threshold is crossed. And it's important to comprehend
how the legal framework applies to Russian use of non-state actors to
carry out such operations. All this and more in the analysis that
follows.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### 2)A "permutation" is the key next step to another world war

[[European Leadership Network]{.underline}]{.mark}, May 16,
20[[22]{.underline}]{.mark},
https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/collective-cyber-defence-and-attack-natos-article-5-after-the-ukraine-conflict/

[[Recent state activities demonstrate how cyberoperations can have
physical consequences. In the summer of 2020, Iranian hacking of Israeli
water treatment facilities came close to over-chloritizing the water,
changing faucets into poison dispensers. More recently, in February
2022, in an attempt to cut communications within Ukraine, Russian
cyberattacks on Viasat satellite networks disrupted German windmill
electricity generation and distribution.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Additionally, Russia has in the past---and continues in the current war
as recently as April 2022---to target electrical power generation and
distribution systems with cyber effects and to harm Ukrainian civilian
and military infrastructure. As the above examples show, cyber attacks
are not limited to online locations but their impact can be felt in the
physical world. [[As a result, NATO must prepare for these activities to
grow and expand.]{.underline}]{.mark} Following the shortcomings of the
2015 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts report on information
and telecommunications in the context of national security, a lack of
consensus continues to exist on the severity of cyberspace operations
targeting critical infrastructure requiring collective and even national
responses. Individual nations constructed individual criteria and
response actions, utilising diplomacy, information, military, or
economic action. [[They largely did so alone or in combination with
other states. NATO, however, did not formulate a coherent analogous
response and as a result, lacks publicly acknowledged policy addressing
cyberspace activities that would constitute a necessary collective
response under Article 5.]{.mark}]{.underline} In order for NATO to
maintain its relevance in the present moment and sustain it through the
coming years, this paradigm must change.

\**Currently, NATO does not have the group cooperation to in-act Article
5, but the AFF's proposed solution would increase cooperation and
finally help define the article and start a war.*

NATO members have 1,857,000 active duty service members and 1,232,290
reservists. The seven largest non-US NATO member armies have the same
number of active duty troops as the United States (1.3 million). Non-US
NATO members can deploy 6,983 battle tanks, 34,000 armored vehicles,
2,600 combat aircraft, 382 attack helicopters, 252 major naval craft
(including submarines), and 1,582 patrol and surface combatants. France
and the United Kingdom alone provide 30 percent of the Alliance's
ballistic-missile-submarine fleet]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO's European
members are beginning to host the first stages of the Alliance's new
ballistic-missile-defense system aimed at preventing long-range attacks
by rogue states on the United States and Europe. [[NATO members
frequently share intelligence across the Alliance, aiding US operations
and intelligence-gathering. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany
alone add 40,000 intelligence personnel to the Alliance's intelligence
capabilities. Non-US NATO members host twenty-eight US main operating
bases in Europe, which cut down on the time needed for the United States
to respond to a crisis and are critical for US missions in the Middle
East and North Africa. In 2009, for example, Germany contributed \$800
million to offset and improve its US bases.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### 2) The US promised to work with NATO on cyber security

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development[[. The
Associated Press reports that the U.S. Defense Department will announce
a new commitment to use offensive and defensive cybersecurity
capabilities on behalf of NATO allies. The new commitment is notable
given how cybersecurity has long been treated as an exceptional domain
of operations, and cyber capabilities reserved as strategic national
assets to be shared with only the closest of
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. With this announcement, the Pentagon is
suggesting that cyber capabilities might be used alongside conventional
weapons with allies and indeed, equal weight appears to be given to
offensive and defensive operations. Perhaps most significantly, the
announcement moves NATO partners closer to what has been a tight coterie
of U.S.-favored signals intelligence partners such as the United
Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. [[The DoD announcement is a
sign of the continued, if nascent, normalization of cybersecurity under
the current administration and in Europe. Even where offensive cyber
operations may not rise to the level of war, they provide
decision-makers with options to influence the geopolitical environment.
This aligns with recent trends in the U.S. military to integrate cyber
capabilities into maneuver units and large exercises, and reflects the
shift towards more risk acceptant and offensive measures to counter
cyberattacks found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Solvency Deficit- AI AFF

####  1) The United States needs NATO in AI 

[[NATO Review]{.underline}]{.mark}, October 25,

[[With the formal adoption of the NATO AI Strategy, Allies have
committed to the necessary cooperation and collaboration to meet these
very challenges in both defence and security, naming NATO as the primary
transatlantic forum.]{.underline}]{.mark} The aim of NATO's AI Strategy
is to accelerate AI adoption by enhancing key AI enablers and adapting
policy, including by adopting Principles of Responsible Use for AI and
by safeguarding against threats from malicious use of AI by state and
non-state actors. [[By acting collectively through NATO, Allied
governments also ensure a continued focus on interoperability and the
development of common standards. Overall, with innovation ecosystems
implicating different actors and faster technology lifecycles than
typically included in traditional capability development systems, the
NATO AI Strategy is also a recognition that exploitation of AI will
require new efforts to foster and leverage the Alliance's innovation
potential, including through new partnerships and mechanisms. Taken
together, these efforts will in turn strengthen the Alliance's ability
to pursue cooperative security efforts and to engage with international
partners and other international organisations on matters of
international security.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[As the United States races with China to apply artificial intelligence
for military purposes, many experts worry that it may be hampered by a
shift in the nature of AI. The conventional wisdom has been that, until
now, American technologists could depend on elite researchers and faster
computers to outperform their Chinese rivals. However, these advantages
are no longer the keys to harnessing AI most
effectively.]{.mark}]{.underline} Data is[[. Chinese AI experts believe
that China's larger population and lax privacy controls give China a
durable advantage in collecting the best data sets to teach AI
algorithms how to optimize their performance.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Kai-Fu Lee, China's most prominent AI researcher, has dubbed China the
"Saudi Arabia of data" and argues that China's data advantage is
expanding by the day. [[The Center for Data Innovation, an American
think tank, agrees, calculating that the Chinese population generates
terabytes more information than Americans do.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The success of American technology companies illustrates the most
promising path for the U.S. military to pursue at the dawn of its own AI
age]{.underline}]{.mark}. That does not mean that the Department of
Defense should simply copy Silicon Valley's strategy mindlessly. While
data from the commercial sector --- such as an individual's social
connections, current employer, or personal finances --- will continue to
be a gold mine for global intelligence agencies, data relevant to the
future battlefield will primarily concern soldiers, vehicles, training
exercises, and the like. No organization will have more relevant data
for these use cases than the military itself. [[Fortunately, the Defense
Department has positioned itself well to become the globally dominant
platform for military data, just as American technology companies
dominate the global marketplace in their realms. The United States
counts most industrialized nations as military allies and equipment
manufactured by the United States or its NATO allies is driven and flown
around the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the Defense Department
has yet to capitalize on this potential. NATO weapons and vehicles were
originally designed to be interoperable in an industrial-age sense,
shooting the same bullets or refueling from the same connectors.
Unfortunately, NATO has not yet upgraded for the information age. The
data generated by U.S. Army tanks cannot easily be accessed or
aggregated with data generated by Marine Corps tanks, let alone British
ones. Just as the Goldwater-Nichols Act once pushed America's separate
armed services to break out of their isolated battlefield domains,
military data must now discover how to operate jointly as well. Three
initiatives could be critical to accomplishing this.
