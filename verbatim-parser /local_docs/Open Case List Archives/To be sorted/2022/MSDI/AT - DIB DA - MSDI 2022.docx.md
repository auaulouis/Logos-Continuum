#### The Ukraine confilct has exposed weakness in the DIB and Bidens budget doesn't leave room for growth in the industry

Defense-Industrial Base Keep Up?" *The Heritage Foundation*, **2019**,
www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/the-war-ukraine-continues-can-the-us-defense-industrial-base-keep.

To some degree, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia-[[Ukraine conflict has
served as a stress test for the]{.underline}]{.mark} West's [[defense
industrial base]{.underline}]{.mark}. From that has come a growing
recognition that, for too long, [[America has underestimated the amount
of munitions]{.underline}]{.mark} and platforms [[required in modern
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}. Due to the complexity and time required to
manufacture today's precision weapons, we must start thinking now,
before a war breaks out, about whether America has enough weaponry to
sustain a conflict. Last month President [[Biden released a defense
budget]{.underline}]{.mark} request [[that does not even keep up with
the rate of inflation, much less provide for any growth to meet our own
needs. It's a recipe for weakness]{.underline}]{.mark} at a time when
the free world desperately needs strength.

#### The DIB got a failing grade in industry health \-- The industry is down bad 

Stephen **Losey 02-11-2022** \[Air warfare reporter at Defense News;
previously reported for Military.com, covering the Pentagon, special
operations and air warfare; Before that, covered U.S. Air Force

defense industrial base down to failing grade,"
https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2022/02/11/covid-drags-defense-industrial-base-down-to-failing-grade/

WASHINGTON --- [[The National Defense Industrial Association gave the
defense industrial base an overall failing grade for the first time
ever]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the [ongoing [[COVID
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2022/01/28/as-covid-grinds-on-defense-sector-braces-for-inflation-hit/)
[[continues to upend the sector.]{.underline}]{.mark} In its third
annual Vital Signs report released Feb. 2, [[NDIA gave the industrial
base a health and readiness score of 69 out of 100, which it deems an
unsatisfactory and failing grade and "cause for real
concern."]{.underline}]{.mark} NDIA, which worked on the report with
decision science company Govini, scores categories on a 100-point scale,
and scores below 70 are considered failing. The association based most
of its study on data sources from 2020, the first year of the pandemic
and before vaccinations began, so some of these results are lagging
indicators. NDIA said the two of the eight key categories it uses to
measure the health of the defense industry --- the [supply
chain](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/11/23/no-company-is-immune-supply-chain-woes-weigh-on-defense-firms/)
and companies' production capacity and ability to surge if necessary ---
have deteriorated significantly, "almost certainly" due to the
pandemic's effects. Three other categories --- industrial security,
innovation and production inputs --- also received failing scores in
2021, [[though production inputs and industrial security saw slight
improvements over the previous two years. And with the pandemic
continuing, the association added, it is crucial for the nation to
figure out how to sort out these problems]{.underline}]{.mark}. However,
NDIA said it opted not to offer policy recommendations, support specific
legislative or regulatory changes, or call for investments in the
report.

####  Americans Believe the U.S. is Falling Behind in Innovation

[[The United States is the most powerful nation in the
world.[^1^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2021.1917392) It
has the most powerful military, the biggest economy, and the most
dominating culture.]{.underline} **[It is the world's leader in science,
engineering, and medicine.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Its universities are
the most admired. Its corporations are the richest and most successful.
People eat Big Macs, drink Coca Cola, fly on Boeings, use their iPhones,
and watch Hollywood movies around the globe. Everyone knows the name of
the American president, what the CIA does, and who you should call if
there is trouble on your border. The United States is also a very secure
country. It is surrounded by two big oceans and two unthreatening
neighbors. Its surveillance systems scour the globe looking for dangers.
It has nuclear weapons, a Navy and Coast Guard on constant patrol, an
Air Force on high alert and with a global reach, and an Army and Marine
Corps second to none in capability and recent combat experience. **[But
many [Americans believe that this is all slipping away, that America is
becoming vulnerable and losing its power and
dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} They cite internal and
external sources of the vulnerability. American power, they claim, is
being frittered away by a dysfunctional Congress, an incompetent
president, and a bloated, slow moving, gold-plating acquisition
bureaucracy that cannot keep up. Indecision and gridlock have seemingly
become the American Way of government. Meanwhile, some **[[fear that
agile rival nations, specifically including China, can tap fast moving

United
States]{.mark}.[^2^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2021.1917392)]{.underline}**
Here we examine these concerns that the American military advantage in
the Post-Cold War era has dissipated in large part because the Defense
Department lags behind in developing advanced technologies. Our judgment
is that the [[America]{.underline}]{.mark}n defense research and
development system, as honed during the Cold War and expanded since, is
fully capable of handling any military challenge. It [[is a gigantic
technology-generating, innovation-producing, war-fighting machine. U.S.
'hard' innovation capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} -- 'input and
infrastructure factors' like R&D facilities, human capital, access to
foreign technology, and availability of funding -- far outstrip those of
its potential rivals, even though those factors are the ones often
thought of as easier for catch-up countries to
obtain.[^3^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2021.1917392) Despite
warnings that the United States no longer spends enough on R&D and that
Chinese R&D spending is surging, the reality is that the United States
dramatically leads in military innovation investment. In functional
terms, the United States dominates all other countries, including China,
in 'input factors,' starting with resource allocations to defense
research and development. More important, we believe that the American
defense technology system is pushed toward innovation by specific
contextual factors, the 'soft' categories of attributes and
capabilities, that cannot readily transfer to likely
rivals.[^4^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2021.1917392)

#### Precautionary policies good

Approach to Artificial Intelligence,"

Cut By: m.jam

Even without reliable data, [[decision-makers must move forward with AI
governance]{.mark}. And, as the world waits for scientific certainty
(which may never arrive), there is an existing solution that can guide
us into the unknown: [the "precautionary principle."]{.mark} [Adopted
globally in 1992 as part of the United Nations]{.mark}]{.underline} [Rio
Convention](http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm)
on sustainable development, and later incorporated into one of the
[European Union's founding
treaties](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=celex:12016E191),
the precautionary principle states that a lack of [[certainty cannot be
a basis for failing to protect human health]{.mark} or the environment.
That seems like [a suitable way to address the uncertainty of a
tech-driven future.]{.mark}]{.underline} The precautionary principle is
not without its detractors. But while its merits have been debated for
years, [[we need to accept that the lack of evidence of harm is not the
same thing as evidence of lack of harm]{.mark}. This simple idea has
been applied to [myriad human development
issues](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/91173/E83079.pdf)]{.underline}
-- from public health to infant mortality. There are three good reasons
why AI should be next. [[For starters, applying the precautionary
principle to the context of AI would help rebalance the global policy
discussion, giving weaker voices more influence in debates that are
currently monopolized by corporate interests.]{.mark} Decision-making
would also be more inclusive and deliberative,]{.underline} and produce
solutions that more closely reflected societal needs. The [Institute of
Electrical and Electronics
Engineers](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html),
and [The Future
Society](https://assembl-civic.bluenove.com/ai-consultation/home) at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government are already spearheading work in
this participatory spirit. Additional professional organizations and
research centers should follow suit. [[Moreover]{.mark}, by applying the
precautionary principle[, governance bodies could shift the burden of
responsibility to the creators of algorithms]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
requirement of explainability of algorithmic decision-making can change
incentives, prevent blackboxing, help make business decisions more
transparent, and allow the public sector to catch up with the private
sector in technology development. [And, by [forcing tech
companies]{.mark} and governments [to identify and consider multiple
options, the precautionary principle would bring to the fore neglected
issues, like environmental impact.]{.mark} Rarely is science in a
position to help manage an innovation long before the consequences of
that innovation are available for study]{.underline}. But, in the
context of algorithms, machine learning, and AI, humanity cannot afford
to wait. The beauty of the precautionary principle lies not only in its
grounding in international public law, but also in its track record as a
framework for managing innovation in myriad scientific contexts. We
should embrace it before the benefits of progress are unevenly
distributed, or, worse, irreversible harm has been done.

#### Distinction between military and civilian innovation -- the plan doesn't hurt the bulwark of the DIB 

Vincent **Boulanin and** Maaike **Verbruggen 2017** "MAPPING THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMY IN WEAPON SYSTEMS" November 2017 Stockholm
International peace research institute
https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/siprireport_mapping_the_development_of_autonomy_in_weapon_systems_1117_1.pdf

[[The innovation ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is driving the
advance of autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} in weapon systems is diffuse,
chiefly because the technologies, academic disciplines and industry
sectors involved in the development of autonomous capabilities may vary
greatly depending on the type of application and systems at issue.
Nevertheless, three general observations can be made. First, [[much of
the fundamental research in the fields of AI and robotics that
could]{.underline}]{.mark} feed the [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark} of
[[autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} in weapon systems [[is
dual-use]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[divergence between civilian and
military innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[emerges towards the
development end of the R&D cycle]{.underline}]{.mark} because civilian
and military products often need to meet different performance criteria.
Hence, should CCW delegates eventually engage in a formal discussion on
the monitoring or [[regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} of R&D efforts that
could lead to the development and production of LAWS, they [[should
focus on the development end of the R&D cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
this is where the actual capabilities of LAWS will be definitively
created. [[Attempting to monitor and control R&D at the more basic
research level would be challenging]{.underline}]{.mark} from a
practical perspective and possibly problematic as it could threaten
civilian innovation. Second, the barriers to entry to the development of
robotic systems are very low. Nearly all hardware components that might
serve the development of autonomous robots are commercially available.
It is even possible to acquire off-the-shelf low-cost robotic systems
that feature advanced autonomous capabilities. These may be adopted,
modified and weaponized by states but also, and more worryingly, by
non-state actors seeking, for instance, to conduct terrorist operations.
This scenario has not yet received great attention within the CCW
discussions on LAWS, despite the fact it represents an imminent
humanitarian risk. While it falls outside the traditional scope of the
CCW, it would be prudent for the GGE to allocate some time to this issue
in 2018. It could start a discussion on the options that are offered
outside the CCW to control or limit the diffusion and malevolent use of
key technologies. This could include discussing the possibilities
offered by export control mechanisms and self-control by the industry.
Third, future [[discussions]{.underline}]{.mark} on the development and
control of autonomy in weapon systems [[could]{.underline}]{.mark}
usefully [[benefit from]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[exchanges of
experience with the civilian sector]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially
companies developing safety-critical applications of autonomy (e.g.
aerospace companies, carmakers and medical robot companies), considering
that a number of issues that are central to discussion on LAWS have
already been, or are currently being, actively addressed within the
civilian sphere. These issues include the following. 1. How to define
and measure autonomy? This question has been the concern of
standardization and regulatory bodies for a long time. The International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International
Electrotechnical Commission have had multiple projects aimed at
generating an official definition of robot-associated terms, including
'autonomy' (ISO 8373:2012). In addition, the US National Highway Traffic
Safety Association has adopted the Society of Automotive Engineers'
levels of autonomy for self-driving systems, ranging from complete
driver control to full autonomy.110 2. How to operationalize meaningful
human control? Civilian industry sectors that produce safety-critical
systems (e.g. aerospace, automotive and medical robotics) are facing the
same human control dilemmas as the defence sector. They too are
dedicating their efforts to finding a model of the human--machine
command-and-control relationship that will maximize safety. 3. How to
test the safety and predictability of autonomous technologies? The
commercial aerospace sector has procedures to test and verify advanced
automated systems. Inviting experts from this community to talk about
existing procedures would help to identify possible best practices for
testing and evaluating weapons with advanced autonomous capabilities in
the context of Article 36 reviews.

#### DOD policy means they can't even buy LAWS

[The DOD recently announced that it is planning to update DODD 3000.09
this year]{.underline}. Michael Horowitz, director of the DOD's Emerging
Capabilities Policy Office and the Pentagon official with responsibility
for shepherding the policy, praised DODD 3000.09 in a recent interview,
stating that "the fundamental approach in the directive remains sound,
that the directive laid out a very responsible approach to the
incorporation of autonomy and weapons systems." While not making any
firm predictions, [Horowitz suggested that major revisions to DODD
3000.09 were unlikely]{.underline}. In general, this is good news. The
DOD's existing policy recognizes that some categories of autonomous
weapons, such as cyber weapons and missile defense systems, are already
in widespread and broadly accepted use by dozens of militaries
worldwide. It also allows for the possibility that future technological
progress and changes in the global security landscape, such as Russia's
potential deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled lethal
autonomous weapons in Ukraine, might make new types of autonomous
weapons desirable. This [[requires proposals for such weapons to clear a
high procedural and technical bar]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to
[[demonstrating compliance with U.S. obligations under domestic and
international law]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[DOD system safety standards,
and DOD AI-ethics principles]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[proposed
autonomous weapons systems must clear an additional senior review
process where the chairman]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, [[under secretary of defense]{.underline}]{.mark} for policy; and
[[the under secretary of defense for acquisition,
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [[and logistics]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[certify that the proposed system meets 11 additional
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}**, each of which require presenting
considerable evidence. **[[Getting the signatures of the U.S. military's
highest-ranking officer]{.underline}]{.mark}** and two under secretaries
in a formal senior review [[is no easy task]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Perhaps the strongest proof of the rigor required to surpass such a
hurdle is the fact that **[[no DOD organization has even
tried]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Like many believers, **[proponents of hegemonic stability theory base

evidence to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline}** the **[pacific trends]{.underline}** that have swept

peaceful]{.underline}]{.mark}**, relatively speaking, **[[while the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[cut]{.mark} its [forces throughout the]{.mark} 19[90s]{.mark}, [as

statistical methods]{.underline}** should not be needed to
[**demonstrate that levels of U.S. military [spending have been]{.mark}
essentially [unrelated to]{.mark} global
[stability]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go
way beyond the absence of simple correlations to support them, however.
**[The theory's supporters have never been able to explain adequately
how precisely 5 percent of the world's population could force peace on
the other 95 percent]{.underline}**, unless, of course, the rest of the
world was simply not intent on fighting. **[Most states are quite free
to go to war without U.S. involvement but choose not to]{.underline}**.
**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[can be counted on]{.mark}, especially [after Iraq, to steer]{.mark}
well [clear of most]{.mark} civil [wars]{.mark} and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}**. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal
**[violence in]{.underline}**, say, **[most of [Africa]{.mark} would be
unlikely to attract serious attention of the world's policeman, much
less intervention]{.underline}**. **[The continent [is]{.mark},
nevertheless, more [peaceful]{.mark} today than at any other time in its
history]{.underline}**, **[[something for which]{.mark} U.S.
[heg]{.mark}emony [cannot take credit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.43
[**[Stability exists]{.mark} today [in many]{.mark} such [places to
which]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony simply [does not
extend.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Overall, [proponents of the **stabilizing
power** of U.S. hegemony should keep in mind one of the most **basic
observations** from **cognitive psychology**]{.underline}: [**rarely**
are our actions as important to others' calculations as we **perceive
them to be**]{.underline}.44 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} so‐​called
**[[egocentric bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is essentially
ubiquitous in human interaction, [[suggests]{.mark} that although it may
be **natural** for [U.S. policymakers]{.mark} to interpret their role as
crucial in the maintenance of world peace, they are **almost certainly
[overestimat]{.mark}ing [their own importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Washington is probably not as central to the **myriad decisions** in
foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks
it is. The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple
of factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [[Americans have]{.mark}
long [been **exceptional** in their
**exceptionalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.45 [The short history of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can easily be read as an
almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story of success, [has led
to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it is **morally,
culturally**, and **politically superior** to other, lesser
countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional state
would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the world.

#### Alternative explanations for stability outweigh.

Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear ---
Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism
--- also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability
fallacy. And unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the
great power of the United States comes a sense of great responsibility:
to serve and protect humanity, to drive history in positive directions.
More than any other single factor, the people of the United States tend
to believe that they are indispensable because they are powerful, and
power tends to blind states to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our
international behavior and our image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It
brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond
common sense."49 **[It is quite likely that [the world does not need the

[any]{.mark} of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing [explanations

(**[[economic development]{.mark}, complex [interdependence,
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, international [institutions]{.mark},
[democracy]{.mark}, [shifting]{.mark} global [norms]{.mark} on

peaceful ways]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the near future, at the very
least, **[[no matter what the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[chooses to do]{.mark} or not
do]{.underline}**. As Robert Jervis concluded while pondering the likely
effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in foreign capitals, "It is
very unlikely that pulling off the American security blanket would lead
to thoughts of war."51 The United States will remain fundamentally safe
no matter what it does --- in other words, despite widespread beliefs in
its inherent indispensability to the contrary.

influence on Modern China, and others. He is currently completing his
doctoral degree at Rutgers University. Yuan received his B.A. from

Tensions in the South China Sea continue to rise. China's People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)'s Rear Admiral Lou Yuan, regarded as a
hawkish military commentator, recently proclaimed that the continuing
dispute over the ownership of the South China Sea could be resolved by
sinking two US aircraft carriers. Statements like these result in a
legitimate fear that China's increasing presence in the South China Sea
might spark a kinetic military conflict with the United States. However,
**[while most Western scholars and media are paying excessive attention
to the rise of China, few are contemplating China's weaknesses in the
region.]{.underline}** Despite China's constant verbal objections and
rising tensions with the United States in the last century, **[the world
has yet to witness any major military confrontation between the two
superpowers]{.underline}**. **[[China will]{.mark} continue to
[avoid]{.mark} directly [confronting the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [for]{.mark}
[at]{.mark} [least]{.mark} [another decade]{.mark} [because China's
military remains immature and defective]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[China's weak joint command system, which has become an essential
instrument in modern warfare, comprises its first major military
weakness.]{.underline}** **[If any military operations are to be
conducted in a region such as the South China Sea, the integration and
cooperation between the air force, navy, and landing army is
indispensable]{.underline}**. However, even as it boasts the second
largest defense spending figures worldwide, **[China only recently
created their first and only joint command system]{.underline}**, the
Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC), under
President Xi Jinping's new national defense and military reform. In
addition, around 70 percent of the PLA soldiers belong to the PLA Army,
and almost all senior officers on the CMC are army officers. **[This
imbalance has the potential to cause serious complications, such as
interservice rivalry for the newly formed Joint Staff Department, when
it comes to decision-making involving naval and aerial affairs―areas in
which army officers have no experience.]{.underline}** The Chinese are
certainly attempting to resolve this problem by establishing departments
like the PLA Joint Logistic Support Force, which handles logistical
operations and oversees the military supplies, infirmaries, and barracks
of the PLA. However, **[[the "peace disease"]{.mark}―an idea that a
period of prolonged peace can weaken a state's military
ability―continues to [hamper China's]{.mark} military
[modernization]{.mark}, as there has been no opportunity to test its
joint command system in actual combat. The last time China had a
full-fledged military conflict was forty years ago with Vietnam, which
concluded with a Chinese defeat]{.underline}**. **[If the CMC hopes to
win a direct military engagement with US naval forces, it must
compensate for lack of experience in operating a joint command system.
Until it does so,]{.underline}** **[China's military poses little threat
to the United States and its allies]{.underline}**. Sea power is crucial
for taking control of the South China Sea. The Chinese Navy is divided
into the North, East, and South Fleets. Among the four divisions, the
PLAN's South Fleets poses the most immediate threat because it is
currently active in the South China Sea. Together, the fleets possess
only one aircraft carrier in operation: the Liaoning, an abandoned
Soviet-era vessel that was purchased from Ukraine as a training ship,
but reportedly had to return to port immediately due to an engine
failure during a sea trial. The country's one and only domestically
built aircraft carrier, the Type 001A, is under scrutiny, as it is
believed that the carrier manager might have leaked classified
information of Liaoning to the CIA. In contrast, the United States
possesses nineteen aircraft carriers, far outnumbering the Chinese.
Although the number and strength of aircraft carriers do not necessarily
determine the victor of a confrontation, the tonnage of a country's navy
might. Larger tonnage provides more space for fuel, weapons, and
ammunition, and a vessel with bigger hull not only has more rounds to
fire but also the capability to endure longer voyages. The United States
Navy has a total tonnage at least two times greater than that of PLAN's.
China also lags in its ballistic missiles. For instance, China's
People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) only began to field its
Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) DF-26 in 2016, and **[the
country's arsenal only consisted of ninety]{.underline}**
Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles **[(ICBM) as of 2019. In comparison,
the United States had a total of 405 deployed ICBMs and 278 non-deployed
ICBMs as of 2017]{.underline}**. In reality, **[[China's stockpile of
weapons]{.mark} and equipment [is]{.mark} still [substantially
inferior]{.mark} to that of the United States, [deterring a full-fledged
war]{.mark} from breaking out in the South China Sea.]{.underline}**
Alone, **[China's military is insufficient to face the United States in
direct confrontation]{.underline}** and would therefore be forced to
turn to its allies. **[[China]{.mark} currently [lacks any]{.mark} such
[dependable]{.mark} military [allies]{.mark} in the South China Sea.
China's leading ally in the region, North Korea, is a totalitarian
regime with a struggling economy, and most of its vessels are only
operable within fifty nautical miles of its coast]{.underline}**.
Although China and North Korea maintained strong relations during the
Cold War era, the Beijing-Pyongyang relationship has gradually declined
since the beginning of the twenty-first century and the start of North
Korea's nuclear program. China has joined the United Nations in
implementing sanctions against North Korea because of its unauthorized
nuclear testing. Although China remains North Korea's closest friend, an
alliance is rather far-fetched. Moreover, **[the [international
scrutiny]{.mark} that North Korea faces, as well as its deficient
economy, [means]{.mark} that [it lacks the resources]{.mark} to support
Chinese forces in the South China Sea if serious military conflict were
to occur. In contrast, the United States can easily depend on South
Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and the Philippines to provide naval
support]{.underline}**. In addition, although the United States is not
allied with most of the Southeast Asian nations, **[the increasing
cooperation between the United States and]{.underline}** the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (**[ASEAN) is similar to a military alliance
with no written agreement. The United States and ten ASEAN navies have
commenced multiple maritime drills as part of a joint exercise extending
into the South China Sea, countering China's presence in the
region]{.underline}**. In contrast, China and ASEAN only had their first
joint maritime exercise last year, which mostly focused on the code for
unplanned encounters at sea, search and rescue operations, and
communication exercises. In addition, **[US allies in the region have
increased their defense budgets to combat growing Chinese
influence.]{.underline}** Although China's navy has recently
commissioned the Nanchang guided-missile destroyer (the biggest surface
warship ever made), the vessel is only powerful in relation to other
**[Chinese ships]{.underline}**, which **[are around 3,000 tons less
powerful than the United States' Zumwalt-Class destroyer in terms of
displacement.]{.underline}** Consequently, **[China is slowing its plan
to build two aircraft carriers]{.underline}** for each of its regional
fleets to build the Nanchang. **[China may be aiming for a hegemonic
position in Asia, but that does not mean it will succeed. The country's
military―specifically its navy―is still immature.]{.underline}** China
is undoubtedly on the rise, yet **[[the country]{.mark} still [has
many]{.mark} profound and [systemic problems within its
military]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Perhaps some of these problems could be
resolved with China's continued growth, but **[[institutional
change]{.mark}―especially when problems are so ingrained into the
system―[takes a long time]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Based on what defense
analysts currently observe, **[China does not pose a military threat to
the United States in the South China Sea]{.underline}**; therefore,
there is no need to invest more resources and capital into the Pacific
for the time being. However, the United States should maintain its
presence in the area by continuing to foster relationships with its
allies while keeping a close eye on China's movements. Sacrificing
resources for the sake of military proliferation in a region where such
action is unneeded is a wasteful move that the United States should
avoid.

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[China-U.S.
[rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}** **[[is]{.mark} certainly
[growing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[but [war is]{.mark} still some [way
off]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[There are]{.mark}]{.underline}** several
**[[maritime encounters]{.mark} between the two sides every
day]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** [**[thousands]{.underline}**
**[every year]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[[Most]{.mark} of them [are
professional]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[safe]{.underline}**]{.mark}; only a few have involved some risks. The
recent pandemic has made both countries and militaries more sensitive,
which, to some extent, has heightened the tension of the situation.
Because of COVID-19, China and the United States are more concerned and
anxious about each other. In addition to maintaining daily operations in
the western Pacific, both sides have some new worries. The United States
is concerned that China would take advantage of the temporary power
vacuum; thus it has deliberately shown more force and given China more
diplomatic pressure. **[China]{.underline}** **[feels]{.underline}**
that **[Washington's]{.underline}** South China Sea **[policy
is]{.underline}** increasingly desperate to the point that, even during
the pandemic, the United States has not forgotten **[to]{.underline}**
**[provoke]{.underline}** **[China]{.underline}**. Beijing is also
convinced that the U.S., motivated by power competition, is focusing on
China's activities and ignoring the actions of other claimants. **[From
mid-April to early May]{.underline}**[, **[the]{.underline}**]{.mark}
U.S. **[[Navy dispatched]{.mark} several
[warships]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including USS America LHA-6, to the
so-called standoff area between the Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the West Capella
**[[to deter]{.underline}]{.mark}** China's
**[operations]{.underline}**. **[The PLA Navy]{.underline}** was
**[believed to have a similar number of warships]{.underline}** there at
the same time, **[which aroused]{.underline}** **[heated
discussion]{.underline}** **[among the media and experts.]{.underline}**
Another less publicized but more intense case was the reconnaissance and
counter-reconnaissance of China's aircraft carrier Liaoning formation
when it was conducting open sea cross-region mobile training while
followed by American warships and multiple military aircraft. An
anonymous PLA Navy officer revealed that the confrontation was so
intense that one U.S. warship even once came within 100 meters of the
Chinese carrier. [**[Even so]{.underline}**,
**[both]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[sides]{.underline}** have
**[[remained]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[largely
[professional]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[restrained]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In fact, **[[neither the
Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** military **[[nor the American military
has increased]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[activity]{.mark}
[significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[compared]{.underline}** **[with
the same period of 2019]{.underline}**, **[[despite]{.mark} the
impression]{.underline}** **[given by most media reports]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[expert
[commentaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The problem is that these
operations are over-exposed and over-focused. **[In the backdrop
of]{.underline}** **[power competition]{.underline}**, **[especially
amid the pandemic]{.underline}**, in order to show their strength and
determination, U.S. **[forces have given]{.underline}** **[undue
prominence]{.underline}** **[to covering and publicizing]{.underline}**
**[military activities]{.underline}**, giving the media and the public a
lot to discuss and imagine. There are some hawks in both countries who
take advantage of this and exaggerate the situation. Although most
countries including the South China Sea claimants, do not want to see
China-U.S. military conflict, some individual countries are indeed
rejoicing over the growing competition between China and the United
States, which may lead to some opportunity for them to expand.
China-U.S. military confrontation or even war in the South China Sea has
a huge market. **[[China and the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[are]{.underline}**,]{.mark} of course, **[[preparing for]{.mark} any
kind of]{.underline}** military **[conflict]{.underline}** and the
**[[worst scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the South China Sea;
[**[however]{.underline}**, **[there is no]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[indication]{.mark} that [the two]{.mark} sides [want to
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}** their [**[contradictions]{.underline}**
**[by using force]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[strategically or
[operationally]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[[despite
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** repeated **[war
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}** from some senior American officials.
**[[In daily]{.mark} military [interactions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[there are]{.mark} really increasing [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[but]{.underline}** **[in the absence of a subjective desire for
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [**[these risks are]{.underline}**
**[highly]{.underline}**]{.mark} likely to be
**[[controlled]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The most important thing for the
Chinese and American militaries to prevent is miscalculation,
considering the relatively backward or ineffective crisis management
mechanisms of the two countries even compared with Soviet-U.S. and then
Russia-U.S. military relations. In addition, we need to let
professionals do their work. The China-U.S. military rivalry has been
unduly influenced by the media, commentators, and some politicians,
which amplifies the intensity of the competition and is likely to lead
to self-fulfilling prophecies. Both Chinese and the U.S. militaries need
to remain competitive and professional, keeping politics and public
opinion in check. After all, **[if there were to be war]{.underline}**,
**[it would be the front-line commanders]{.underline}** and sailors
**[who bear the brunt of it;]{.underline}** **[others would be mere
bystanders]{.underline}**.

The **[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration **[of nuclear weapons [has
been far slower than predicted]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and this seems to
be **[[because]{.mark} the [weapons do not]{.mark} generally
[convey]{.mark} much [advantage]{.mark} to their possessor. [Dozens
of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark} have
[considered]{.mark}]{.underline}** obtaining **[nuclear arsenals,
[but]{.mark} very [few have]{.mark} done so.]{.underline}** A key reason
for this is that the **[possession of such expensive armaments actually
conveys in almost all cases rather little advantage]{.underline}** to
the possessor. In the main, **[[they are difficult to obtain,]{.mark}
militarily [useless, a]{.mark} spectacular [waste of time,
money,]{.mark} and scientific talent, distasteful, [and]{.mark} likely
to [rile]{.mark} the [neighbors.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Moreover, the
weapons have also been **[exceedingly difficult to obtain for
administratively dysfunctional countries.]{.underline}**9 Moreover, the
**[consequences of what little [prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}**eration
**[[has]{.mark} taken place have [been]{.mark} substantially
[benign]{.mark}. Those who have acquired the weapons have "used" them
simply [to stoke]{.mark} their [egos or]{.mark} to [deter]{.mark} real
[or]{.mark} imagined threats.]{.underline}** For the most part, **[they
have [quietly kept]{.mark} the weapons in storage and haven't even found
much benefit]{.underline}** in rattling them from time to time. **[[Nor
have]{.mark} the [weapons proven to be]{.mark} crucial
[status]{.mark}---or virility---[symbols]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
although Pakistan and Russia do probably garner more attention that they
would if they did not have nuclear weapons. But **[how much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would anybody pay a
great deal more attention to Britain or France if their arsenals held
5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much less if they had
none?]{.underline}** Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world
with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics?
**[Prolif]{.underline}**eration **[[alarmists]{.mark} may occasionally
grant that countries principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter
real or perceived threats, but many go on to [argue]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark} newly nuclear [country will]{.mark} then [use]{.mark} its
nuclear [weapons to "dominate"]{.mark}]{.underline}** the area. That
argument was repeatedly trotted out with dramatic urgency before 2003
for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein, and it is now being
applied to Iran. Exactly **[[how]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[domination]{.underline}** business **[is]{.underline}** to be
**[carried out [is never]{.mark}]{.underline}** made
**[[clear.]{.underline}]{.mark}**10 But the notion, apparently, is that
should an atomic country rattle the occasional rocket, other countries
in the area, suitably intimidated, would supinely bow to its demands.
Far more likely, **[any threatened states will make common cause with
each other and with other concerned countries against the threatening
neighbor]{.underline}**---rather in the way they coalesced into an
alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
