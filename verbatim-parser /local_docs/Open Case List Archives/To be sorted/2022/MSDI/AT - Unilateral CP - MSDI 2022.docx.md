# AFF ANSWERS

## 2AC

### Perm

#### Perm do both -- US pursues unilateral actions while working jointly with NATO on the multilateral level 

#### Perm do the CP -- just a different way to do the aff 

#### These two perms are very generic -- you should write perms that are specific to your aff. You could also say "Perm do the CP then the aff, US works unilaterally and then works on the international level"

### Solvency Deficits 

#### You should write solvency deficits specific to your own affirmative -- tailor it to something that your aff does at the international level 

### 2AC\-\--NATO Good -- Cyber/AI 

#### Alliance wide integration is key to stop Russia and China's AI and cyber operations

[As [Russia intensifies cyber hostilities]{.mark} and [China weaponises
a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence]{.underline}, joining forces in
the field of high-tech warfare [[will feature high on the
list]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} topics discussed by
[[Nato allies]{.underline}]{.mark} at a summit next week. But **[[the
transatlantic alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s 30 members **[[will need
to move fast]{.underline}]{.mark}** if they aim to make up lost ground.
[[Nato]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[proposing a new tech
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} [[centre]{.underline}]{.mark} [[bringing
together military personnel]{.underline}]{.mark} with industry to foster
digital defence start-ups. Some of these might be financed by a separate
initiative, also set to be debated: a venture capital fund for
innovation which member states could choose to opt in to. The efforts
are belated, as Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg himself
acknowledged. "[[For decades, Nato]{.underline}]{.mark} allies [[have
been leading when it comes to tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, but
**[[that's not obvious any more]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he told the
Financial Times in an interview last week. "We see
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} especially [[investing heavily
in]{.underline}]{.mark} new, [disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies like
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence,
[[autonomous systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, big data, and they
[[implement them into new advanced weapon systems]{.underline}]{.mark},
drones, submarines, aircraft and so on." He is not the first to sound
the alarm. Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive who now
chairs the US's National Security Commission on AI, warned earlier this
year that Beijing was planning to undermine conventional military forces
by "leapfrogging" to new technologies. The commission's report,
published in March, raised concerns that China would use AI for
"reconnaissance, electromagnetic countermeasures and co-ordinated
firepower strikes". Part of the problem is that western defence
institutions have been slow to recognise the potential of innovation
beyond their own industry. "For decades, a lot of technological
development would happen within the defence sector --- the internet,
nuclear, GPS, all of that was developed by the defence industry and then
shared with the civilian sector," Stoltenberg said. "Now, it goes the
other way around. It's a civilian sector which is leading in the
development of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and many of
the new disruptive technologies." Some Nato members are ahead of others.
The US and France have published military AI strategies, while the UK
announced this year that it is to establish a centre for defence AI. For
the first time, Britain's intelligence agency, MI6, is recruiting from
the private sector for a new head of its "Q" branch --- the technical
lab made famous in the James Bond films. **[[Establishing a new Nato
hub]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- known as an "accelerator" --- [[in which
tech companies and members]{.underline}]{.mark} of the armed forces
[[can experiment with new ideas has advantages]{.underline}]{.mark},
according to Professor Fiona Murray, co-director of MIT's innovation
initiative. Start-ups and investors do not always have the time to
tackle defence challenges when solutions are "hard to test, markets are
fragmented and procurement is slow", Murray said. Working together would
create a wider market for new products and enhance collective security,
she noted. **[[It was "not enough" for countries to be handling this
individually]{.underline}]{.mark}**, she said. The US has started
marshalling allies on the policy implications of using new technology.
The Pentagon's "AI Partnership for Defense", comprising 13 countries
(including Nato members Canada, Denmark, Estonia, the UK, France and
Norway) met virtually for the first time last year to agree joint
military standards on AI. Schmidt's commission has called on the Five
Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance (the US, UK, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand) to work more closely on developing AI systems. Ulrike
Franke, an expert in military technology at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, argues that Nato's tech centre will be most effective
if it prioritises systems designed to facilitate joint military
operations. The alliance should look at areas such as AI-enabled command
and control, she said, which could give members a unified picture of the
battlefield across multiple regions, using intelligent data analysis to
sift information. Franke said that in the vast arena spanning drones to
quantum computing, there was a temptation to cover too much. "It makes
massive sense for Nato to look more at this \[technology\]", she said.
"The question is, what exactly are they focusing on? There's a danger of
Nato spreading itself too thin."

### 2AC\-\--NATO solves Climate Change

#### NATO cooperation and cohesion solves pandemics, bioD loss and climate change

[NATO's climate security agenda]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} has long been [[known as a threat
multiplier]{.underline}]{.mark} and is increasingly recognised as a
"shaping threat" that [dramatically alters the environments in which
Allied militaries will have to operate in the coming
decades]{.underline}. From higher frequency and intensity of storms,
through extreme heat and cold, to reduced supplies of drinking water and
faster wear and tear of military equipment, [[climate change has
significant implications for NATO on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[tactical, operational and strategic levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
addition to **[[climate-related risks to military infrastructure and
force readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, more **[[extreme weather
events]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[increase conflict and
migration potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** in and beyond NATO's
immediate neighbourhood. Born of the Cold War and designed to defend its
members against any external aggression, [[NATO is evolving to reflect
the new security reality]{.underline}]{.mark} of actorless threats,
**[[such as pandemics, biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a security organisation, NATO cannot
be indifferent to these challenges. For NATO to be able to fulfil its
core mission of keeping the Euro-Atlantic space safe, building
resilience to the impacts of a changing climate and integrating
sustainable practices into military planning and capability development
is a necessity, not a choice. Evolving consensus The good news is that
**[[the Alliance is not starting from scratch]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For over 50 years now, [NATO has been paying attention to environmental
challenges]{.underline}, mostly through a wide range of scientific
research activities. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[developed six environmental protection
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} (STANAGs) that concern military camps,
management of waste, and sustainability of military training areas.
Climate change was written into the 2010 Strategic Concept and has been
factored into summit declarations since then. In 2014, NATO adopted a
Green Defence Framework and integrated energy efficiency and other
environmental considerations into the design of the current NATO
headquarters, which was completed in 2018. **[[The building blocks for a
more ambitious and visible role with respect to climate security are
already there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, [[NATO]{.mark} as an
alliance of 30 countries [works by consensus]{.mark}, which is always
evolving]{.underline}. As a former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change,
Jens Stoltenberg began [[advocating for NATO to take greater
climate-related]{.underline}]{.mark} [[action]{.underline}]{.mark} many
years ago, but [[his efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} may have been
[[stymied during the previous U.S. administration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The growing number of climate and weather related disasters, which
continue to impact lives and livelihoods both within and outside of
NATO's borders, has marked an evident shift in awareness and acceptance
of climate change as an issue of national security across the Alliance.
[[In view of increasing societal pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
current political momentum, [[which includes the renewed U.S. leadership
on climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[NATO]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} now **[[poised to push a more ambitious climate
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The United States is well on its way to protecting Americans from the
coronavirus]{.underline}. It's time to help the rest of the world. By
marshaling this nation's vast resources to produce and distribute enough
vaccines to meet global demand, the United States would act in keeping
with the nation's best traditions and highest aspirations while
advancing its geopolitical and economic interests. It is a moment of
both obligation and opportunity. [[Unfortunately]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[instead of a bold]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[comprehensive strategy to
vaccinate the world]{.underline}]{.mark} as quickly as possible, the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[has thus far
made]{.underline}]{.mark} a string of [[tactical
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}: donating millions of doses to countries
in need, signaling its support for patent waivers that might expedite
vaccine production efforts and nudging two companies --- Merck and
Johnson & Johnson --- to collaborate on increasing supply. [[These are
good steps]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[but they are not nearly
sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}** to meet the moment. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and the rest
of the world's wealthiest nations [[are facing a great moral
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Covax, [[the World Health
Organization's]{.underline}]{.mark} initiative to pool vaccine
resources, [[remains profoundly underfunded]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[and
has failed to meet even its modest target]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
vaccinating one-fifth of the population in the Global
South]{.underline}. Without a major course correction, the rest of the
world will have to wait until 2023 or later for large-scale vaccination
initiatives like the one underway in the United States. [[The
consequences of this disparity are]{.underline}]{.mark} expected to be
[[severe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hundreds of thousands more people will
get sick and die from a disease that is now preventable with a vaccine.
[The global economy will contract by trillions of dollars, according to
the International Chamber of Commerce, and tens of millions of people
will plummet into extreme poverty as the virus continues to fester and
evolve in the world's more vulnerable reaches.]{.underline} As global
hunger rises and global life expectancy falls, instability will prevail.
Already, [Colombia is mired in deadly protests over the pandemic's
economic fallout]{.underline}. [India is facing its gravest humanitarian
catastrophe in a generation]{.underline}. As the United Nations has
warned, a similar [crisis in Syria would be catastrophic]{.underline}.
President Biden can start by announcing that the United States intends
to help and by [appointing a vaccine czar]{.underline} to oversee the
expansion of vaccine production. The federal government has ample legal
power to [compel the participation of the pharmaceutical
companies]{.underline}, including the [sharing of critical information
and technologies]{.underline}. Congress has appropriated \$16 billion to
scale up production, most of which remains unspent. [[Increasing
manufacturing capacity has proved tricky]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[global demand for vaccines may be high now]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
[[once the coronavirus pandemic recedes, it will plummet back to normal
levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Increased public
ownership]{.underline}**, for its part, would ensure that
vaccine-production capacity is ready for future pandemics, which are
inevitable --- potentially including new coronavirus variants for which
routine boosters may be required.

[[The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee
announced]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[the alliance has sent a
counter-hybrid team to Montenegro to face Russian hybrid
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Last week in Brussels, the Chairman of
the NATO Military Committee (MC), Marshal Sir Stuart Peach,
**[[announced the effort of the Alliance in facing Russian hybrid
attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The term "[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}"
[refers to a military strategy which employs political warfare and
blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyberwarfare with
other influencing methods, such as fake news, diplomacy, lawfare and
foreign electoral intervention.]{.underline} Peach said that the NATO
alliance had set up the first NATO counter-hybrid team in Montenegro.
"The [first NATO counter-hybrid team has been deployed to our ally
state, Montenegro, with the aim of helping to strengthen Montenegro's
capacities and deterring hybrid challenges]{.underline}", Peach said.
Several countries, especially Russia, continue their aggressive
operations against foreign states, and **[[cyber warfare is becoming the
main concern]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[[any government]{.underline}]{.mark}. The official explained that since
2014 the defence spending to face hybrid threats has continued to
increase, it has been estimated that by 2024 that amount will reach \$
400 billion. "NATO data shows a 4,6% increase in 2019. That is the fifth
consecutive year of growth. By the end of this year, allies will have
invested over \$130 billion", added Marshal Peach [United States Army
General Mark Milley]{.underline}, the highest military officer and
military adviser to the President, Minister of Defence and U.S. National
Security Council, [accused the Russian Government of attempting to
destabilize the members of the alliance and divide it]{.underline}. "it
is evident that **[Russia has been trying to divide NATO and make it
weaker]{.underline}**". General Milley said. "**[It would be their
benefit]{.underline}**. **[It would be detrimental to Europe and the US
if NATO just collapsed and disintegrated]{.underline}**."
Representatives of Montenegro's Defence Ministry confirmed that NATO
counter-hybrid team visited Montenegro in November. Experts fear that
Russia could attempt to influence the forthcoming parliamentary
elections that will take place in October 2020. "This visit was the
first such engagement in one of the allies, and it was an important
experience for Montenegro. **[Montenegro wants to enhance its capacities
and the focus of NATO's team was on strengthening legislative
framework]{.underline}** in this domain and its implementation", said
Ivica Ivanović, director general for defence policy. On June 5, 2017
Montenegro officially joined NATO alliance despite the strong opposition
from the Russian Government that threatened to retaliate.
[[Cybersecurity experts believe that a new wave of attacks from the
cyberspace will hit the state]{.underline}]{.mark}. In February 2017,
for the second time in a few months, Montenegro suffered massive and
prolonged cyberattacks against government and media websites.
Researchers at security firm FireEye who analyzed the attacks observed
malware and exploits associated with the notorious Russia-linked APT
group known as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy,
Sednit, and Tsar Team). Another massive attack hit the country's
institutions during October 2016 elections, amid speculation that the
Russian Government was involved. Hackers targeted Montenegro with
spear-phishing attacks, the malicious messages used weaponized documents
pertaining to a NATO secretary meeting and a visit by a European army
unit to Montenegro. At the time, the cyberspies delivered the GAMEFISH
backdoor (aka Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT, and Sofacy), a malware that
was used only by the APT28 group in past attacks.

### 2AC\-\--US Failing at AI

#### The US is no longer demolishing China in the race -- need full NATO cooperation to outpace China

[The US-China Race for Artificial Intelligence]{.underline} Combining
decades of experience advancing frontier technologies, on the one hand,
and analyzing national security decisionmaking, on the other, we have
been collaborating over the past year in an effort [to understand the
national security implications of China's great leap forward in
artificial intelligence (AI]{.underline}). Our purpose in this essay is
to **[[sound an alarm over China's rapid progress and the current
prospect of it overtaking the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[in applying
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the decade ahead; to explain why AI is for
the autocracy led by the Chinese Communist Party (hereafter, the
"Party") an existential priority; to identify key unanswered questions
about [the dangers of an unconstrained AI arms race between the two
digital superpowers]{.underline}; and to point to the reasons why we
believe that this is a race the United States can and must win. We begin
with four key points. First, most **[[Americans believe that U.S.
leadership in advanced tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [[is so
entrenched]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it is
unassailable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Likewise, [[many]{.mark} in the
American national security community [insist that in the AI arena China
can never be more than a "near-peer competitor]{.mark}."]{.underline}
**[[Both are wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, **[[China stands
today as a full-spectrum peer competitor]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
United States [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} commercial and [[national
security applications of AI]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beijing is not just
trying to master AI---it is succeeding. Because AI will have as
transformative an impact on commerce and national security over the next
two decades as semiconductors, computers and the web have had over the
past quarter century, this should be recognized as a matter of grave
national concern.1,2,3 Second, [[China's zeal to master AI]{.mark} [goes
far beyond its recognition]{.mark} [that this]{.mark} suite of
[tech]{.mark}nologies [promises to be the biggest driver of economic
advances]{.mark} in the next quarter century]{.underline}. **[For the
Party, AI is mission critical]{.underline}**. The command of 1.4 billion
citizens by a Party-controlled authoritarian government is a herculean
challenge. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Americans have been
confident that authoritarian governments are doomed to
fail---eventually. But [AI offers a realistic possibility of upending
this proposition]{.underline}. AI could give the Party not just an
escape hatch from the "end of history,"4 but [a claim to advance a model
of governance---a national operating system---superior to today's
dysfunctional democracies]{.underline}. As one former Democratic
presidential candidate put it: "**[China is using technology to perfect
dictatorship]{.underline}**."5 It's a value proposition that resonates
with many leaders around the world. As former Google ceo Eric Schmidt
has argued: "if the Soviet Union had been able to leverage the kind of
sophisticated data observation, collection and analytics employed by the
leaders of Amazon today, it might well have won the Cold War." Third,
while [we share the general enthusiasm about AI's potential to make huge
improvements in human wellbeing]{.underline}, [[the development of
machines with intelligence]{.mark} vastly [superior to humans]{.mark}
will [pose]{.mark} special, perhaps even [unique
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1946, Albert Einstein warned, "the
unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of
thinking, and thus we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe." We
believe the same could be said of AI. Henry Kissinger has identified
these risks in what we call "Kissinger's Specter." In his words, [AI
threatens an unpredictable revolution]{.underline} in our consciousness
and our thinking, and an "inevitable evolution in our understanding of
truth and reality."6 In response to Einstein's insight, the
technologists and strategists who had built and used the bomb to end
World War II joined forces to find ways to prevent a nuclear World War
III. Meeting the challenges posed by AI will require nothing less.
Fourth, **[[China's advantages in size]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[data
collection and national determination]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[have
allowed it over the]{.underline}]{.mark} past [[decade to close the gap
with America]{.underline}]{.mark}n leaders of this industry. **[[It is
currently on a trajectory to overtake the United States in the decade
ahead]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nonetheless, if the United States will
awake to the challenge and mobilize a national effort, we believe that
it can develop and execute a winning strategy.

WASHINGTON --- [[Two NATO agencies recently kicked off an
a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence
[[initiative]{.underline}]{.mark} to better understand the technology
and its potential warfare applications. **[[More than 80 AI
experts]{.underline}]{.mark}**, researchers and academics [from the
U.S.]{.underline} and other member countries [[are involved with the
venture]{.underline}]{.mark}, known as a strategic "horizon scanning,"
[put together by the NATO Science and Technology Organization and the
NATO Communications and Information Agency]{.underline}. An inaugural
meeting and workshop was held this month in The Hague, Netherlands,
where the NCI Agency's data science and AI facilities are located. "[[AI
is one of the key emerging]{.underline}]{.mark} and disruptive
[[technologies identified by NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as vital for the
maintenance of its technological edge," NATO Chief Scientist Bryan Wells
said in a statement. "By working together, the STO and the NCI Agency
are able to bring together global experts to ensure the very best
scientific expertise is available to advise NATO and its allies and
partners on the latest scientific trends in this area." The NATO
guarantee of a collective defense and the advantage of numbers, both on
the battlefield and in the lab, has been much discussed amid Russia's
latest invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent membership applications
made by Finland and Sweden. **[[NATO ministers in October adopted the
alliance's first-ever AI strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
describes the capability as "changing the global defense and security
environment" and offering "an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen
our technological edge but will also escalate the speed of the threats
we face." The strategy [[emphasizes responsible use of AI for
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} across six tenets: [lawfulness;
responsibility and accountability; explainability and traceability;
reliability; governability; and bias mitigation. AI frameworks and other
guidance drafted by the U.S. and its defense community take a similar
approach]{.underline}. NATO allies in 2019 agreed to focus on seven
emerging and disruptive technologies, data, computing and AI among them.
Making sure there are shared standards, and that systems will work with
systems, will be critical to success, officials said. "[[One of the big
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} when we go into this new phase of
disruptive technologies [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} how do you keep all
allies on the same hymn sheet when it comes down to communicating with
each other, [[using the same technology]{.mark}, being
interoperable]{.underline}," David van Weel, NATO assistant secretary
general for emerging security challenges, told Defense News in March
2021. "So **[[that's a big part]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[of the
strategy\] **[[and a big role for NATO to play]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

#### Standardization and new rules solves for any of NATO shortcomings -- gets NATO back to innovating

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[should standardize and regulate AI]{.underline}]{.mark} to keep up
with rivals, according to findings published by the U.S. think tank,
Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). CEPA's comments came as it
published a series of AI-related recommendations for NATO amid growing
geopolitical tensions with the likes of Russia, China and North Korea.
[Its [recommendations include AI standardization]{.mark}]{.underline},
[encouraging and improving AI literacy and [spurring private sector
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Such undertakings would allow NATO
allies to better scale and deploy AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and keep
pace with rivals. "These new capabilities will revolutionize NATO's
military and strategic affairs, thus strengthening NATO's ability to
fulfill its essential core tasks of collective defense, crisis
management and cooperative security," CEPA's Nicholas Nelson and Nico
Luzum wrote. [The pair cited AI projects being undertaken by
adversaries, including China's attempts to develop purported
mind-controllable drones and AI assistants for fighter
pilots.]{.underline} But [[NATO allies have their own
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[[including U.S.-developed
autonomous tanks]{.underline}]{.mark}** and British-made systems that
provide ground troops with information on the surrounding terrain. The
think tank's study suggests that at present, [[NATO is leading the AI
race]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[[but risks losing its competitive
advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}** to peer competitors "competitors if
allies fail to leverage the private sector, coordinate implementation
and engage with the public." CEPA suggests that NATO allies should
accelerate AI adoption and actively encourage private sector innovation.

In March, [[WIRED ran a story]{.underline}]{.mark} with the headline
"[[Russia\'s Killer Drone in Ukraine Raises Fears About AI in
Warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}," with the subtitle, "The maker of the
lethal drone claims that it can identify targets using artificial
intelligence." The story [[focused on the KUB-BLA,]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [[small kamikaze drone]{.underline}]{.mark} aircraft that smashes
itself into enemy targets and detonates an onboard explosive. The
KUB-BLA is made by ZALA Aero, a subsidiary of the Russian weapons
manufacturer Kalashnikov (best known as the maker of the AK-47), which
itself is partly owned by Rostec, a part of Russia's government-owned
defense-industrial complex. The WIRED story understandably attracted a
lot of attention, but [[those who only read the sensational
headline]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[missed the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
article's **[[critical caveat]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "**[[It is unclear
if the drone may have been operated in]{.underline}]{.mark}** this
\[**[[an AI-enabled autonomous\] way]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Ukraine."
Other outlets re-reported the WIRED story, but irresponsibly did so
without the caveat. WIRED's assessment that [[Kalashnikov
claims]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[KUB-BLA]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[boasts
the ability to identify targets using a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence[[" is based on two main pieces of
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}: a Kalashnikov press release about ZALA
Aero's "Artificial Intelligence Visual Identification (AIVI)"
capabilities for its unmanned aircraft, and the original Kalashnikov
press release announcing the KUB-BLA in 2019. However, [[these]{.mark}
two **[pieces of evidence are less than they
seem]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The Russian]{.mark}-language]{.underline}
AIVI [[press release never mentions]{.mark} the [KUB-BLA or military
applications]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, it describes a ZALA Aero
machine-learning AI drone product line that is marketed to industrial
and agricultural sectors. **[[Incorporating modern machine-learning
AI]{.mark} [into military applications is significantly more
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** than in industrial or agricultural
applications. Modern machine-learning AI using deep neural networks
offers the opportunity for incredible gains in performance, but that
performance depends on having lots of training data during development.
Moreover, that training data needs to closely resemble operational
conditions. In general, it is much easier to get such training data from
commercial customers than from an enemy military, especially if friendly
weapons systems and sensors do not often come within range of enemy
ones. [[The most mature military AI applications
are]{.underline}]{.mark} ones like [[satellite
reconnaissance]{.underline}]{.mark}: even in peacetime, satellites get
to take a lot of pictures of Russian and Chinese military forces, and
[[those pictures can be digitally labeled by human experts]{.mark} to
turn them into training data.]{.underline} Training data is what machine
learning AI systems learn from. The combination of a learning algorithm
and training data is how AI systems learn to recognize what is in the
image. But training data is generally application-specific. Satellite
image recognition training data only helps build satellite image
recognition AI. One cannot magically use labeled satellite image data to
train an AI for a robotic drone's targeting computer (at least not with
today's technology). [[Getting enough]{.underline}]{.mark} of the right
sort of [[training data]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
incorporate]{.underline}]{.mark} modern [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} into,
say, a robotic tank's targeting computer, **[[is a much tougher
technical challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is not impossible in
principle, but in practice, there are far fewer opportunities to collect
the right sort of training data.

AI's Shortfalls for Military Applications [[As the military looks to
incorporate AI's success]{.underline}]{.mark} in these tasks into its
systems, [[some challenges must be acknowledged]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The first is that **[[developers need access to
data.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Many [AI systems are trained]{.underline}
using data that has been labeled [[by some expert
system]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., labeling scenes that include an air
defense battery), [[usually a human]{.underline}]{.mark}. Large datasets
are often labeled by companies who employ manual methods. [[Obtaining
this data and sharing it is a challenge]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[especially for an organization]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[that prefers
to classify data]{.underline}]{.mark}** and restrict access to it. An
example military dataset may be one with images produced by
thermal-imaging systems and labeled by experts to describe the weapon
systems found in the image, if any. [[Without
sharing]{.underline}]{.mark} [this with preprocessors and
developers]{.underline}, **[[an AI that uses that]{.underline}]{.mark}**
set **[[effectively cannot be created]{.underline}]{.mark}**. AI systems
are also vulnerable to becoming very large (and thus slow), and
consequently susceptible to "dimensionality issues." For example,
training a system to recognize images of every possible weapon system in
existence would involve thousands of categories. Such **[[systems will
require an enormous amount of computing power and lots of dedicated time
on those resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And because we are training a
model, the best model requires an infinite amount of these images to be
completely accurate. That is something we cannot achieve. Furthermore,
as we train these AI systems, we often attempt to force them to follow
"human" rules such as the rules of grammar. However, humans often ignore
these rules, which makes developing successful AI systems for things
like sentiment analysis and speech recognition challenging. Finally, AI
systems can work well in uncontested, controlled domains. However,
[[research is demonstrating that under adversarial
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[AI systems can easily be
fooled]{.underline}]{.mark}, resulting in errors. Certainly, many
**[[DoD AI applications will operate in contested
spaces]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[like]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} domain, [and thus, we should be wary of
their results]{.underline}. Ignoring the enemy's efforts to defeat the
AI systems that we may employ, there are limitations to these seemingly
super-human models. An AI's image-processing capability is not very
robust when given images that are different from its training set---for
example, images where lighting conditions are poor, that are at an
obtuse angle, or that are partially obscured. Unless these types of
images were in the training set, the model may struggle (or fail) to
accurately identify the content. Chat bots that might aid our
information-operations missions are limited to hundreds of words and
thus cannot completely replace a human who can write pages at a time.
Prediction systems, such as IBM's Watson weather-prediction tool,
struggle with dimensionality issues and the availability of input data
due to the complexity of the systems they are trying to model. Research
may solve some of these problems but few of them will be solved as
quickly as predicted or desired. Another simple weakness with [AI
systems is their inability to multi-task]{.underline}. A human is
capable of identifying an enemy vehicle, deciding a weapon system to
employ against it, predicting its path, and then engaging the target.
This fairly simple set of tasks is currently impossible for an AI system
to accomplish. At best, a combination of AIs could be constructed where
individual tasks are given to separate models. That type of solution,
even if feasible, would entail a huge cost in sensing and computing
power not to mention the training and testing of the system. Many AI
systems are not even capable of transferring their learning within the
same domain. For example, a system trained to identify a T-90 tank would
most likely be unable to identify a Chinese Type 99 tank, despite the
fact that they are both tanks and both tasks are image recognition. Many
researchers are working to enable systems to transfer their learning,
but such systems are years away from production.
[Artificial-intelligence systems are also very poor at understanding
inputs and context within the inputs. AI recognition systems don't
understand what the image is, they simply learn textures and gradients
of the image's pixels]{.underline}. Given scenes with those same
gradients, AIs readily identify portions of the picture incorrectly.
This lack of understanding can result in misclassifications that humans
would not make, [such as identifying a boat on a lake as a
BMP]{.underline}.

### NATO solves Climate 

#### NATO cooperation and cohesion solves pandemics, bioD loss and climate change

[NATO's climate security agenda]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} has long been [[known as a threat
multiplier]{.underline}]{.mark} and is increasingly recognised as a
"shaping threat" that [dramatically alters the environments in which
Allied militaries will have to operate in the coming
decades]{.underline}. From higher frequency and intensity of storms,
through extreme heat and cold, to reduced supplies of drinking water and
faster wear and tear of military equipment, [[climate change has
significant implications for NATO on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[tactical, operational and strategic levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
addition to **[[climate-related risks to military infrastructure and
force readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, more **[[extreme weather
events]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[increase conflict and
migration potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** in and beyond NATO's
immediate neighbourhood. Born of the Cold War and designed to defend its
members against any external aggression, [[NATO is evolving to reflect
the new security reality]{.underline}]{.mark} of actorless threats,
**[[such as pandemics, biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a security organisation, NATO cannot
be indifferent to these challenges. For NATO to be able to fulfil its
core mission of keeping the Euro-Atlantic space safe, building
resilience to the impacts of a changing climate and integrating
sustainable practices into military planning and capability development
is a necessity, not a choice. Evolving consensus The good news is that
**[[the Alliance is not starting from scratch]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For over 50 years now, [NATO has been paying attention to environmental
challenges]{.underline}, mostly through a wide range of scientific
research activities. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[developed six environmental protection
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} (STANAGs) that concern military camps,
management of waste, and sustainability of military training areas.
Climate change was written into the 2010 Strategic Concept and has been
factored into summit declarations since then. In 2014, NATO adopted a
Green Defence Framework and integrated energy efficiency and other
environmental considerations into the design of the current NATO
headquarters, which was completed in 2018. **[[The building blocks for a
more ambitious and visible role with respect to climate security are
already there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, [[NATO]{.mark} as an
alliance of 30 countries [works by consensus]{.mark}, which is always
evolving]{.underline}. As a former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change,
Jens Stoltenberg began [[advocating for NATO to take greater
climate-related]{.underline}]{.mark} [[action]{.underline}]{.mark} many
years ago, but [[his efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} may have been
[[stymied during the previous U.S. administration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The growing number of climate and weather related disasters, which
continue to impact lives and livelihoods both within and outside of
NATO's borders, has marked an evident shift in awareness and acceptance
of climate change as an issue of national security across the Alliance.
[[In view of increasing societal pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
current political momentum, [[which includes the renewed U.S. leadership
on climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[NATO]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} now **[[poised to push a more ambitious climate
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
