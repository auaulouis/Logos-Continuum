## What's all this?

Although MSDI's primary CP focus is US unilateralism (a nice test of the
topic's NATO focus), a lot of the articles cut for this aff have CP
potential to solve at least some specific parts of the 1AC. However, the
week 1 debates should stick with the US unilateralism as the sole CP.
Some of them could be framed as SQ solves.

Solid case turn options include NATO bad and Biotech bad, but recall
that the aff is intended to maximize the benefits of biotech while also
checking its drawbacks. It may take good analytical arguments and
analysis of affirmative evidence to win a link to some biotech bad
arguments.

Don't be afraid to defend that current NATO leadership strategies may be
sufficient to solve resilience without the plan. If they do and avoid
linking to the DA you go for, it could be a good 2NR.

2.1. Predicament 1: The Information Asymmetry Risk of Dual-Use
Biotechnology Keeps the

Traditional Self-Governance Model [[in the Field of
Biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark} from Playing Its Role In contrast to
the field of nuclear technology, in the biological sciences, [[the
autonomy of stakeholders is important]{.underline}]{.mark} \[30\]. The
biotechnology industry has a long tradition of self-governance, and
there are many historical success stories. However, [[the information
asymmetry risk of dual-use biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[has
caused problems]{.underline}]{.mark} for the traditional model of
[[industry self-governance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Dual-use risks of biotechnology show obvious characteristics of
information asymmetry. [[Since the research and
development]{.underline}]{.mark} environment and application scenario of
dual-use biotechnology [[are concealed, anonymous and opaque, the public
may not be able to ac- quire enough information]{.underline}]{.mark}
about the dual-use risk of biotechnology. The two hidden risks of
information asymmetry are as follows. The research of [[scientists who
have mastered dual-use biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[cannot be
monitored effectively by the institutions with which they are
affiliated. This could pose risks to national
biosafety]{.underline}]{.mark} and public safety. Moreover, is difficult
to supervise the application of dual-use biotechnology in the early
stages of disease diagnosis and treatment, as well as drug research and
development. In response to these information asymmetry risks,
professionals in the life sciences have always emphasized enhancing
professional [[internal supervision]{.underline}]{.mark} mechanisms, but
this [[may worsen information asymmetry]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Researchers concerned with dual-use biotechnology acquire their
professional skills in a closed environment, at scientific conferences,
under the guidance of risk or ethics expert committees, and peer review
of papers submitted for publication. All of these have formed an
enclosed internal supervision mechanism for research, training and
practice. These monitoring mechanisms determine that the identification
and judgment of dual-use risks of biotechnology depend on the expert
group from within the system, which may have some negative effects. For
example, the internal standards and operational mechanisms within the
scientific community may exclude the concerns, doubts and interventions
of the government and the public. Even the judicial system, as a third
party with traditional punitive capability, should rely on the judgment
standards and operational systems established by the life science
community in resolving legal disputes caused by the misuse of dual-use
biotechnology.

Furthermore, [[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[implementers]{.underline}]{.mark} who tend to be self-governing
[[within the industry will **resort to** information asymmetry to
**deliberately** resist the design of the public power system, which
**exacerbates the dual-use risks** of
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. Some biological scientists reject
the top-down public power supervision system, which is most obvious in
the field of synthetic biology research. [[Some technical
experts]{.underline}]{.mark} in this field
[[believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[supervision by public authorities
can't keep up with the pace of tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological
change, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[bottom-up industry
self-regulation is superior]{.underline}]{.mark} to the traditional
"hard law" in terms of time cost, and will be less likely to be resisted
by practitioners \[31\]. However, [[bottom-up]{.underline}]{.mark}
industry self-[[regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, or other
self-regulation modes, have [[failed to regulate the **malicious abuse**
of the synthetic tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[of known pathogenic
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is also difficult for such
self-regulation models to accommodate the greater risks caused by the
creation of synthetic organisms based on standardized component methods.
In addition, excessive reliance on industry self-regulation will easily
lead to the public's misunderstanding of biotechnology development.
[[Thus, the public may]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to believe that
biotechnology development will undermine social consensus on
biotechnology development and [[restrict]{.underline}]{.mark} the
sustained and rapid progress of [[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology if
scientists assume certain technological risks after taking internal
decisions to lift restrictions in some areas of research without having
arrived and an informed consensus with the public. The public can do
nothing except express doubt in the technology once such risks arise.

The He Jiankui incident of 2018 was an international controversy for two
reasons. He violated institutional and international research
regulations when he applied CRISPERCas9 gene editing technology to
editing human embryos, and he conducted his experiments while claiming
to be working on a cure for AIDS. As the public expects diseases to be
cured and people to live longer, the internal private domain in life
sciences will contradict public opinions on safety risk management and
control. In a larger sense, [[different stakeholders have
different]{.underline}]{.mark} understandings of and [[demands for the
risks of dual-use biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology among biological
scientists, social science experts, industries, media and the public.

Messenger RNA Vaccine

The role of messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cell is to synthesize protein
(translation). In mRNA vaccine, the strand codes for disease specific
proteins and are expressed on surface of cells. After expression of
specific disease-causing antigen of cell surface the immune response is
generated. mRNA vaccine is novel, safe and less expensive method as
compared to conventional vaccines. [[The administration of mRNA vaccine
remains a challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} for scientist [[because of
stability and other pharmacological features]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There are three types of mRNA vaccines i.e,

> Non-Replicating mRNA: The mRNA is injected in body where it is taken
> up by cells and express the antigen.
>
> In-Vitro Dendritic Cell Non-Replicating mRNA Vaccine: Dendritic cells
> present antigen on its surface for other types of cells could produce
> immune response. In this type of mRNA vaccine dendrtic cells are
> extracted from patients and the transfected in vitro with antigen and
> injected back to patient to stimulate immune response.
>
> In-Vivo Self-Replicating mRNA: In this strategy the pathogen mRNA is
> packed with additional mRNA to make sure it is copied inside cell
> \[19\].

Currently a great deal of research is in progress in filed of mRNA
vaccine for cancer as well as infectious diseases. A study by Brazzoli
et al describe self-amplifying mRNA vaccine encoding influenza virus
Hemagglutinin protein. The vaccine elicits humoral and cellular immune
response in mice \[19\]. The administration of mRNA encoding light and
heaving chain of anti-HIV antibody encapsulated in nanoparticles from
mice ven being challenged \[20\].

#### Normal DNA vaccines ineffective

Deoxyribonucleic Acid Vaccines

Deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[vaccines are
basically genetically engineered DNA that]{.underline}]{.mark} when
injected produce antigen and [[induce strong immune
response]{.underline}]{.mark}. The gene responsible for immunogenic
response is identified, cloned and then expressed in host by directly
injecting it. DNA vaccines have higher immune response inducing
potential as compared to conventional live attenuated or killed vaccine
\[13\]. In 1990 DNA vaccines were coined for the first time when plasmid
DNA was injected in muscle or skin and induce immune response against
viral along with non-viral antigens. [[DNA vaccines were thought to hold
very promising future]{.underline}]{.mark} \[14\]
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} till date [[**no** DNA vaccine for humans has
been approved by FDA]{.underline}]{.mark} only animal vaccines are
available like canine melanoma \[15\], vaccine for West Nile Virus in
horses \[16\].

#### Direct "dual use biotech" fails -- 22 agents/models are key -- aff will miss some

[[In the military field, "dual-use" biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[refers to **both** civilian **and** military
technology]{.underline}]{.mark} \[1\]. [[In the civilian
field]{.underline}]{.mark}, it refers to [[a legitimate scientific
purpose]{.underline}]{.mark} that yields information or technologies
that [[may be misused to pose a threat to public health
or]{.underline}]{.mark} other aspects of [[national
security]{.underline}]{.mark} \[2\]. Dual-use biotechnology has benefits
(such as promoting scientific progress or improving public health) but
also has the potential for malicious abuse or misuse (such as
bioterrorism). At present, internationally recognized dual-use
biotechnology consists of technology used for acquiring new types of
biological or molecular materials (combinatorial chemistry and high
throughput screening, DNA shuffling, and directed evolution), directed
design technologies (protein engineering, virus genome synthesis,
standardization in synthetic biology), technologies for manipulating
biological systems (development of psychoactive drugs, synthesis of
peptide bioregulators, immune regulation, personal genomics, RNA
interference, transcranial magnetic stimulation), and technologies for
the packaging and delivery (chemical micro-processing equipment, gene
therapy, aerosol vaccine). Tucker lists three characteristics of
dual-use: (1) its technical attributes, including availability, abuse
susceptibility and potential harm caused by abuse; (2) its
controllability, including concretization (the materialization of
technology), maturity, convergence, development speed and international
diffusion; and (3) the reducibility to the state, institutional,
individual, product and knowledge levels \[3\]. However, [[due to its
ubiquity, it is **difficult to manage** the risks of **all** dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies. Therefore, NSABB has adopted a
strategy of determining a limited scope of knowledge, products or
[[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} produced by life science research
that is [[most likely to be misused]{.underline}]{.mark} to threaten
national biosafety. This part of research is referred to as "dual-use
research concerns", and [[encompass]{.underline}]{.mark}es [[15 key
biological **agents**]{.underline}]{.mark} or toxins [[and seven
**types** of dual-use re]{.underline}]{.mark}search \[4\].

#### Panviral can't solve -- profit motives, drugs & testing

Starts" New York Times Magazine
<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/magazine/pandemic-vaccine.html>
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

But for years, Racaniello notes, [[the real
obstacle]{.underline}]{.mark} to making panviral drugs or vaccines [[has
been that]{.underline}]{.mark} no one was willing to pay for their
development. For pharmaceutical companies, he points out, [[panviral
vaccines are simply a **terrible** business
proposition]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[Companies]{.underline}]{.mark} have
to [[spend hundreds of millions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars [[to
develop a shot]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[people will
get]{.underline}]{.mark} once a year at most --- and **[[not at
all]{.underline}]{.mark}** in years [[when no]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[particular disease is ascendant]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Panviral **drug treatments** are unprofitable for similar
reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}. For one, the course of treatment is short,
usually just a few weeks; for chronic diseases (diabetes, high blood
pressure), patients take regimens of pills daily, often for years. (One
person noted that Gilead's stock price actually dropped after the
company produced a revolutionary hepatitis C drug. Because the treatment
completely cured patients, the market for it started to shrink,
undermining the company's bottom line.)

[[The other problem is that there's currently no way to **quickly
test**]{.underline}]{.mark} for most viruses, [[which is
**essential**]{.underline}]{.mark} if a doctor wants [[to establish a
diagnosis and prescribe]{.underline}]{.mark} the right drug. As a
result, Racaniello says, [[it's "a chicken-and-egg
situation]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[No one is
developing]{.underline}]{.mark} drugs for these viruses [[because
there's no way to test]{.underline}]{.mark} for them. And [[no one is
developing tests, because there aren't any drugs]{.underline}]{.mark} to
prescribe."

### Dual Use Defense

#### Unilateral and global mechanisms mitigate dual use biotech risks

(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

[[By the end of the 20th century, **all countries** had begun to pay
attention to]{.underline}]{.mark} the four [[risks caused by dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. In "Biotechnology, Weapons, and
Humanity" (1999), the [[British]{.underline}]{.mark} Medical
Association, for the first time in its history, expressed concern about
the malicious abuse of genetic engineering, biotechnology and other
emerging technologies, and suggested that social supervision should be
strengthened and moral standards be established within the sciences to
prevent the exacerbation of potential risks. In 2002, the
[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} government promulgated the "Regulations
on Export Control of Dual-use Biological Products and Related Equipment
and Technologies" to restrict the export of dual-use biological products
and related equipment and technologies, to prevent them from being used
to manufacture biological weapons \[16\]. In 2003, the National Academy
of Sciences of the [[United States]{.underline}]{.mark} released a
report, "Biotechnology Research in the Era of Terrorism" (the Fink
Report), a pioneering document of the research into national security
risks in the field of life science. The Fink Report identified seven
types of biological experiments with dual-use risks, including
microbiology and molecular biology experiments, which require safety
inspections before project approval and funding \[17\]. To this end, the
U.S. government set up a federal advisory committee under the National
Biosafety Scientific Advisory Committee, which took charge of
formulating policies and recommendations on dual-use research concerns
(DURC) in life science research \[2\]. In 2004, the World Health
Organization ([[WHO]{.underline}]{.mark}) announced that "every major
new technology can be used not only for peaceful purposes, but also for
hostile purposes. To tackle the common security challenges to all
mankind, we should put the protection of biotechnology from being
maliciously used above the security interests of all countries." In
2009, the [[European Union]{.underline}]{.mark} passed Regulation No.
428/2009, which listed the controlled goods subject to export
restrictions and licenses, including dual-use biological materials
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} production equipment \[18\]. In the same
year, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
([[FASEB]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[warned that
"scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} who educate their research on potential
dual-use [[shall pay more attention]{.underline}]{.mark} to taking
necessary [[safety control]{.underline}]{.mark} measures" \[19\].

[[Since 2011, countries have paid **more**
attention]{.underline}]{.mark} to the dual-use of biotechnology.
[[After]{.underline}]{.mark} the research results on [[genetic
modification of H5N1]{.underline}]{.mark}, the highly pathogenic [[avian
influenza]{.underline}]{.mark} virus published in "Nature" in September
2011 triggered global controversy. [[The United States issued several
regulatory policies]{.underline}]{.mark} concerning dual-use
biotechnology, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the "Regulatory Policy
on Dual-use Life Science Research of the U.S. Government" (2012) by the
National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity
([[NSABB]{.underline}]{.mark}), and the "Regulatory Policy of
Dual-Purpose Research Institutions in Life Sciences of the U.S.
Government" (2013) by Office of Science and Technology Policy
([[OSTP]{.underline}]{.mark}) \[20\]. In 2014, NSABB halted research on
the Gain of Function of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome
(MERS) viruses, and required all independent and federal research
institutions to strictly abide by the "Dual-use Research of Concern"
([[DURC]{.underline}]{.mark}) from 24 September 2015, and established a
special entity review body, the IRE. In 2015, the U.S. government
established the "[[Institutional Regulatory]{.underline}]{.mark} Policy
Concerning Dual-use Research in Life Sciences" \[21\]. In 2018, the U.S.
government issued a "[[National Biodefense
Strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the National
Academy of Sciences of the United States released the report "Biodefense
in the Age of Synthetic Biology", which
[[emphasized]{.underline}]{.mark} the imminent threat of
[[synth]{.underline}]{.mark}etic [[biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}
being used [[as a virus weapon for terrorist
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} by biohackers \[22\]. In 2017, the
Chinese government issued "Safety Management Measures for Biotechnology
Research and Development" to impose special control measures for
biotechnology research and development activities with high risks of
causing serious diseases in humans or animals \[23\].

While strengthening supervision at home, [[some countries have begun to
mitigate the dual-use risks of biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[on
international governance platforms]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2016, [[the
United States and Britain submitted Working Papers]{.underline}]{.mark}
No. 10, No. 14, and No. 17 to the General Assembly at the Eighth Review
Conference of the States Parties [[to the BWC. Germany submitted
'Control Measures]{.underline}]{.mark} of Dual-use Materials' at the
preparatory meeting, which emphasized that the dual-use of new
biotechnology poses a greater threat of large-scale epidemics and
bioterrorism \[24--27\]. The [[management of dual-use
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} of biotechnology [[was put on the
international agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} and became a hot topic in the
field of international arms control. To counter the possible abuse and
misuse of biotechnology, Working Paper No. 30,
[[jointly]{.underline}]{.mark} submitted [[by the Chinese and Pakistani
governments]{.underline}]{.mark}, proposed the formulation of a model
code of conduct for biological scientists. It would be binding upon all
biological scientists worldwide when conducting biological research. In
this important meeting, the state parties agreed to "encourage the
promotion of a culture of responsibility amongst relevant national
professionals and the voluntary development, adoption and promulgation
of codes of conduct" \[28\]. At the international level, UN Security
Council Resolution 1540 has been passed as the principled framework, BWC
has been adopted as the basic norm, and international export control
standards have been established by informal associations, including
Australia Group and similar organizations.

[[These conventions and standards]{.underline}]{.mark} have been adopted
by the international community, and [[have been enshrined in laws,
regulations and operational mechanisms, including
China]{.underline}]{.mark}'s "Regulations on Export Control of Dual-use
Biological Products and Related Equipment and Technologies", [[the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} "Regulations on Export Administration", [[and
Australia Group]{.underline}]{.mark}'s "Guiding Principles on Export
Control of Biosensitive Items".

2.2. Predicament 2: Top-Down Public [[Regulation often
Lags]{.underline}]{.mark} behind Technological Iteration [[Due to
Difficulty in the Prediction of Human-Made Risks]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Dual-Use Biotechnology

[[It is difficult to predict the human-made risks of dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology before it has been used. According to
Giddens, scientific and technological risk is a kind of "man-made risk"
\[32\], and [[technology is neither good nor evil in
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. People use technology for good or evil
purposes. Compared with the risk of public health and safety, [[the
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of biotechnological dual-use [[depends more on
the intention and ability of its users. Therefore, the cause
of]{.underline}]{.mark} biotechnology dual-use [[risk
is]{.underline}]{.mark} stakeholders' behavior [[out of control under
the comprehensive influence of both the internal and external
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While human beings are innovating dual-use biotechnology, they are
endeavoring to modify the rules that should apply to it. However,
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[human-made risks of dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[**cannot** be
predicted]{.underline}]{.mark}, since it is easy to find loopholes in
rules and policies, and since traditional "hard law" and other
governance rules are slow to adjust, [[governance innovation cannot keep
up with technology]{.underline}]{.mark}. The hope is that once
governance rules are established, they will be able to keep pace with
technological changes by establishing a system of adaptive governance
for continuous technology evaluation. With the development of dual-use
biotechnology and the deepening understanding of its risks, these
methods usually require a cycle of data collection, evaluation and rule
modification \[33\]. In other words, new scientific discoveries and
knowledge in other fields must be applied to the iterative
decision-making of the dual-use risk of biotechnology \[34\]. However,
such governance innovation ideas tend to challenge the scientific
formulation of risk governance.

In summary, the risk of information asymmetry of dual-use biotechnology
has placed the traditional biotechnology industry self-governance model
in trouble; at the same time, the difficulty of predicting the
human-made risks of dual-use biotechnology leads to public regulation
lagging behind technical iteration. The result is failed governance of
dual-use risks of biotechnology. In the 1920s, Ogburn observed that as
technology advanced, people's habits, thoughts and social arrangements
fell behind, resulting in the decisive influence of technology on
society \[35\]. The social reality since World War II has demonstrated
that social harmony exists only in the minds of idealists. In contrast,
heterogeneity is a basic feature of modern society. On this premise, the
predicament of the management of dual-use risk of biotechnology reflects
a failure in the checks and balances of the social governance structure.
The [[risk governance rules cannot cover the blind spots of non-state
actors]{.underline}]{.mark} and all biotechnology R and D and
application scenarios. [[It is difficult for the system design mechanism
to balance and coordinate]{.underline}]{.mark} the viewpoints and
propositions in the life sciences and social sciences, in addition to
finding a consensus among all parties. [[The balance between technology
iteration and governance rules]{.underline}]{.mark}, and between private
subjects' demands and social consensus [[is consequently
lost]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Private Model Turns

In fact, [[a wide range of actors contributes to Gavi, which itself
partners with local governments and nongovernmental
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} to distribute vaccines and run
immunization programs. Even [[before]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 pandemic, [[Gavi had immunized nearly
900 million children]{.underline}]{.mark} against infectious diseases.
[[It is an archetypal "impact hub]{.underline}]{.mark}," an
international initiative that assembles multiple actors from various
sectors to make demonstrable progress toward solving a range of
seemingly intractable global challenges.

[[Impact hubs]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Gavi [[offer a model for a
new kind of international cooperation oriented around multistakeholder
networks rather than nation states]{.underline}]{.mark}. They form the
basis of what United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres calls
"networked multilateralism," in which member states---together with U.N.
agencies, international financial institutions, businesses,
philanthropic groups, regional and municipal governments, and civil
society organizations---work together [[to fix the world's most
intractable problems]{.underline}]{.mark}.

To strengthen Gavi as an impact hub and demonstrate the efficacy of
networked multilateralism, the United Nations should lead a fundraising
effort to attract more contributions from the philanthropic and private
sectors. Although a diverse array of organizations already contributes
to Gavi, the total from these sectors is still relatively small---only
\$331 million. And nearly half of that comes from a single donor: the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

[[There is a clear opportunity for the philanthropic and private sectors
to step up]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to a UBS-led study, there are
more than 260,000 foundations in 39 countries with combined assets of
more than \$1.5 trillion. The annual expenditures of all these
foundations exceeds \$150 billion per year, suggesting an opportunity to
ramp up support considerably. The United Nations can also appeal to any
of the nearly 6,000 corporations that signed on to the U.N. Global
Compact, an agreement under which signatories commit to 10
sustainability principles. Even if only 30 of these companies committed
\$10 million each to Gavi, that would more than double the existing
contribution total from the private and philanthropic sectors.

[[This shouldn't be a hard sell. Fortune 500 companies spend \$20
billion annually on corporate social responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}
efforts, an average of \$40 million each. [[Global vaccination is an
urgent, high-profile imperative]{.underline}]{.mark}, and contributing
to it [[would burnish a company's reputation and]{.mark}]{.underline}
boost [[morale]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to it being the right
thing to do, it is also profitable. The pandemic is costing global
industries---from tourism and airlines to food services and
retail---billions of dollars in lost revenue. Ultimately, global
economic recovery hinges on vaccination. A corporation's contribution is
not so much a donation as an impact investment that will deliver both
social and economic returns.

In leading such a major fundraising effort for COVID-19 vaccines, the
United Nations would amplify networked multilateralism oriented around
impact hubs, such as Gavi and other multi-actor partnerships that have
proved success at scale. The effort could also draw inspiration from the
COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund established early on during the
pandemic. Set up by the World Health Organization and United Nations
Foundation, the fund crowdsourced donations to finance equitable access
to COVID-19 treatment for the most vulnerable populations. In a short
time span, it raised more than \$250 million from 100 companies and
660,000 individuals in 190 countries.

A similar approach should be used for other goals besides the
vaccination campaign. Building on the Global Compact on Refugees, for
example, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the newly created
Mayors Migration Council could scale up a global network of cities,
businesses, and international organizations to help with refugee
resettlement. Likewise, the United Nations Environmental Program could
partner with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, an
alliance of more than 10,700 cities, to help fund and implement climate
targets.

Ending the pandemic is just the first step to recovery. [[COVID-19 has
triggered setbacks]{.underline}]{.mark} in virtually every one of the
United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals,
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} reducing [[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark} to improving
[[health]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[education]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
pandemic has also accelerated urgent security challenges, [[from digital
harms to military confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the current
system of global cooperation fails to help the world recover, grievances
and mistrust toward the United Nations and member states will intensify.
[[If the world is to build back better]{.underline}]{.mark}---and
develop the capability to address the looming crises of the
future---[[then **impact hubs** are needed]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### CEPI 2.0 key to solve

2.0: A Critical Inflection Point,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-20-2022)

Richard Hatchett, M.D.: Well, [[CEPI 2.0 is]{.underline}]{.mark}
actually [[about the opportunities that have been created by the
response to the pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}. And it---Julie, when you
started and were talking about CEPI's creation and the idea that it was
founded because there was a realization that there weren't technical
barriers or scientific barriers necessarily but there were funding
barriers and there was an absence of political will. And I think we're
kind of in the same situation with respect to pandemic risk, in that
[[we're going to emerge from this pandemic with a whole suite of new
tools and new technology platforms that have been validated
and]{.underline}]{.mark} that have [[demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark}
that, you know, [[rapid vaccine development is
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[know what we need to do
to]{.underline}]{.mark}, you know, vastly improve the world's
preparedness for future pandemics, or even---I mean, vastly reduce the
risk, or even potentially, you know, [[take pandemics off the
table]{.underline}]{.mark}. I don't think that's as far-fetched as it
might sound. And so what CEPI 2.0 is, or what we've put forward is a,
you know, a proposal for the world. And then within that, CEPI has a
role. And we've sketched out what we would do with, you know, if we were
able to secure the resources.

And the \$3.5 billion that we have talked about wouldn't deliver, you
know, a pandemic-free world. But what we think would, you know, what we
think the world should do, if it can muster its political will, if it
can muster the resources even in the midst of fighting the current
pandemic but looking forward and take advantage of the opportunity, I
mean, we think that we obviously need to finish the job on Covid. We
need the generation 2.0 vaccines, and even generation 3.0---the oral
vaccines and the mucosal vaccines.

We need to do everything that we can to take coronaviruses off the
table. They are now---if anybody ever needed to argue that they were a
pandemic threat before, we know they're a pandemic threat now. And we
know [there are other coronaviruses out there]{.underline}. Looking at
our experience, we broke every speed record in the development of
vaccines for Covid, and it wasn't fast enough. [[We need to dramatically
shorten vaccine development times]{.underline}]{.mark}. And---

J. Stephen Morrison: This is where you get to your moonshot.

Richard Hatchett, M.D.: This is where you get to the 100-day goal. And
then we need to break that down. I mean, we don't just throw that out as
an aspiration. We have to actually have an idea of how we go about doing
that. And we're looking at every step of vaccine development to think
where we can achieve time savings. One of the most important places that
[[we can achieve time savings]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[by being at
least as prepared for future threats as]{.underline}]{.mark} we were
actually prepared for [[Covid]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And that preparedness for Covid was based on concerns about
coronaviruses and based on investments on understanding how to develop
vaccines against SARS and MERS. And those investments paid off in spades
during the response. And [[it essentially allowed new
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}, which have now been shown to be [[94-95
percent effective]{.underline}]{.mark}, to be designed, and I'm not
speaking hyperbolically, [[literally within hours of getting the
sequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. And we need to do all of this, you know,
while laying the foundations for equity and leaving no one behind.

And so [[CEPI, in]{.underline}]{.mark} mapping out [[the 2.0
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}, those are sort of the core components of
the agenda. And it's a shared agenda. It's not something that CEPI's
going to own and go off and do by itself. It's a proposal that we
[[brought to the world]{.underline}]{.mark}, and which [[has been
embraced by]{.underline}]{.mark}, you mentioned the United Kingdom.
They've become a huge supporter of our efforts. And they have taken that
core moonshot idea of the---

J. Stephen Morrison: And embraced it.

Richard Hatchett, M.D.: Embraced it. Took it to [[the
G7]{.underline}]{.mark}, who welcomed it. And now we're talking with the
[[U.K.,]{.underline}]{.mark} with [[the U.S., with other
partners]{.underline}]{.mark} [[about how do we]{.underline}]{.mark},
you know, collectively, collaboratively, you know, [[bring that vision
to pass?]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### CEPI moonshot internal

\"CEPI's moon shot: Developing pandemic vaccines in 100 days,\" No
Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or
[[CEPI]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[launched a multi-billion dollar plan to
accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark} the development and production of
[[vaccines during the next pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}, with a goal of
making them available in just 100 days.

If the "100 Days Mission" is successful, [[it would far
outpace]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[development]{.underline}]{.mark} and
authorization [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the world's numerous [[COVID-19
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}, which took place in record time.

CEPI has said the plan will cost \$3.5 billion --- [[more than \$1.5
billion]{.underline}]{.mark} of which [[has already been
pledged]{.underline}]{.mark} by countries including Australia, Germany,
Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. Others,
including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust, also
have pledged money.

Melanie Saville, MD, MSc, CEPI's executive director of vaccine research
and development, delivered remarks on the project during the Mary Lou
Clements-Mann Memorial Lecture in Vaccine Sciences at the National
Foundation for Infectious Diseases' Annual Conference on Vaccine
Research.

Saville noted the importance of real-time data and pandemic preparedness
to make the goal a reality. Her presentation included several examples
of how real-world and real-time data can contribute to controlling
emerging diseases through vaccine development. One centered around
chikungunya --- a mosquito-borne disease that has caused major outbreaks
in Africa, Asia and the Americas.

[Chikungunya is on a list of CEPI's priority diseases, along with MERS,
Lassa fever, Nipah virus, Rift Valley fever, Ebola and the so-called
"disease X" ---]{.underline} a previously unknown pathogen, like
SARS-CoV-2, that may emerge to cause a pandemic.

"It is very unpredictable as to where those outbreaks will occur, which
is a major issue when you're in the middle of vaccine development,"
Saville said.

Saville and colleagues modeled a chikungunya outbreak to understand
vaccine demand and what the potential impact of vaccines would be. Their
main concentration was in Southeast Asia and India.

"When we looked at trying to predict how many doses you might need, the
estimate was extremely broad, from 8,000 to 913 million doses per year,"
Saville said. "It is really quite a challenge there."

The researchers then looked at how vaccination could impact these
outbreaks and found that it could reduce reported cases by approximately
50%.

"This, however, depends on a number of key parameters such as the
threshold that triggers an outbreak response and how long it might
really take to actually vaccinate the population or get immunity to an
impactful level," Saville said. "How will a vaccine ultimately be used
for a disease like chikungunya? How can it be effectively used, and how
will you use a stockpile in an outbreak situation? Where do you put that
stockpile?"

According to Saville, the time from when the genetic sequence of
SARS-CoV-2 was published to the first vaccine was 326 days.

"As you look at the data globally, during that time, when the first
vaccine was made available, there were already 1.6 million deaths," she
said. "So, the question arises, 'What if you could develop a vaccine in
100 days, when there were only 200,000 deaths?'"

CEPI said [[the 100-day plan includes "investing in research and
development to combat those diseases most likely to cause epidemics and
pandemics and reducing manufacturing complexity]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Saville explained that knowing exactly what should trigger the start of
vaccine development is paramount. Some of the components include
confirmed human-to-human transmission, failure of control measures, high
severity of diseases or death, and a new infectious disease pathogen
being identified as the cause.

"Is this going to turn into something [[with high case
fatality]{.underline}]{.mark}? If so, you cannot afford to wait," she
said. "What [[you need]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[to be already
manufacturing doses of the vaccines to start clinical trials at a very
early stage]{.underline}]{.mark}. \... If you wait and see what happens,
you lose crucial time."

#### Future pandemics inevitable -- accelerated CEPI model dramatically cuts development time (CEPI as CP?)

Karen **Gilchrist**, 2-18-20**22**, CNBC London Correspondent,
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/bill-gates-covid-risks-have-reduced-but-another-pandemic-will-come.html,
"Bill Gates says Covid risks have 'dramatically reduced' but another
pandemic is coming," CNBC (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

Bill [[Gates said]{.underline}]{.mark} Friday that the risks of severe
disease from Covid-19 have "dramatically reduced" but [[another pandemic
is]{.underline}]{.mark} all but [[certain]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Speaking to CNBC's Hadley Gamble at Germany's annual Munich Security
Conference, Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said
that a potential new pandemic would likely stem from a different
pathogen to that of the coronavirus family.

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} he added that [[advances in medical
technology should help]{.underline}]{.mark} the world do a better job of
fighting it --- if investments are made now.

"We'll have another pandemic. It will be a different pathogen next
time," Gates said.

Two years into the coronavirus pandemic, Gates said the worst effects
have faded as huge swathes of the global population have gained some
level of immunity. Its severity has also waned with the latest omicron
variant.

However, Gates said that in many places that was due to virus itself,
which creates a level of immunity, and has "done a better job of getting
out to the world population than we have with vaccines."

"The chance of severe disease, which is mainly associated with being
elderly and having obesity or diabetes, those risks are now dramatically
reduced because of that infection exposure," he said.

Gates said it was already "too late" to reach the World Health
Organization's goal to vaccinate 70% of the global population by
mid-2022. Currently 61.9% of the world population has received at least
one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.

He added that the world should move faster in the future to develop and
distribute vaccines, calling on governments to invest now.

"[[Next time we should try and make it]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[instead
of two years]{.underline}]{.mark}, we should make it more like [[six
months]{.underline}]{.mark}," Gates said, adding that standardized
platforms, including messenger RNA ([[mRNA]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [[would make that
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"The cost of being ready for the next pandemic is not that large. It's
not like climate change. If we're rational, yes, the next time we'll
catch it early."

Gates, through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has partnered with
the U.K.'s Wellcome Trust to donate \$300 million to the Coalition for
Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which helped form the Covax program
to deliver vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.

The CEPI is aiming to raise \$3.5 billion in an effort cut the time
required to develop a new vaccine to just 100 days.

### CRIPR Bad Turns

#### CRISPR off target turn

\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

Considering that military service members already take significant risks
simply by enlisting in the armed services, the risk/benefit analysis for
research may be more favourable towards gene enhancement as the
enhancement itself could improve the chances of survival during armed
conflict (Annas and Annas 2009). Nevertheless, the risks of research
must be addressed in a systematic manner to ensure that service members
are not being exposed to unnecessary harm. [[Most concerning with gene
editing research using CRISPR is the potential for **off-target
effects**. If the CRISPR machinery accidentally docks at an
**unintended** location in the genome it could cause **mutations** and
disrupt or accelerate nontargeted biological processes thereby resulting
in]{.underline}]{.mark} any number of illnesses, some of [[which may be
**life threatening**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nevertheless, the possibility
of significant off target effects remains hypothetical. A recent report
indicating that CRISPR gene editing had caused over one thousand single
nucleotide mutations and over one hundred deletions was later retracted
after heavy criticism of the scientific methods used and the validity of
the paper's conclusions (Schaefer et al. 2017; Wilson et al. 2017;
Nature Methods, 2018). Nevertheless, [[our knowledge of biological
**processes** and potential CRISPR **effects** remains
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}. The risk--benefit calculus would require
military IRBs to balance risks of off-target effects against the
potential benefits of improved survival. The risks would be difficult to
predict because more research on the frequency of off-target effects
needs to be done in order to determine whether the benefits outweigh the
risks. Risks may be minimized through preclinical experiments using
robust animal models, reliable measures of off-target effects, and from
an adequate understanding of how gene changes affect biological
function. Risks may also be minimized if a reversible system was used.

#### CRISPR informed consent turn

Analyst, Peraton & Biomedical Ethics Research Program, Mayo Clinic,
https://www.ndu.edu/Portals/59/Documents/Incoming/AY21%20Briefings/NDU%206070/CRISPR_Military.pdf?ver=2020-08-11-170728-347,
\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

Informed Consent

[[One of the factors of military life that impacts informed consent for
research is the command structure. The military]{.underline}]{.mark}
adheres to a [[single chain of command structure]{.underline}]{.mark} as
outlined in the Joint Publication 1-02 (Gade 2015). The Uniform Code of
Military Justice [[makes it a crime for a service member to disobey a
lawful order]{.underline}]{.mark} from a superior commissioned officer,
as such disobedience could jeopardize operational security and directly
compromise the President's directives (Katz 2000). [[It can be
challenging for service members to break from the mould of this strict
command structure even in the research setting]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Thus, DoD Instruction 3216.02 requires that any research involving
military personnel specifically excludes senior officers in the
participant's chain of command from solicitation, recruitment, or
administering of informed consent. The responsibility of obtaining
consent falls with the research team to ensure that this exclusion is
enforced and that the autonomy and voluntariness of the research subject
is protected at all times.

[[Another]{.underline}]{.mark} closely related factor of military
training that presents a [[challenge to informed consent in the military
setting is that service members are trained to act as a
unit]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is based on several studies which
positively tie unit cohesion to military performance (National Defense
Research Institute 2010). Sometimes, recruitment efforts may target an
entire unit and in such cases researchers may conduct group briefings.
[[It can be]{.underline}]{.mark} especially [[challenging for an
individual to not go along]{.underline}]{.mark} with an activity
especially [[if a majority of the unit]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[decide]{.underline}]{.mark}d [[to participate]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This presents some difficulty in the informed consent process,
especially in terms of undue pressure of group conformity. It may be
that group recruitment activities within units or group briefings should
be avoided for first-in-human CRISPR research for military enhancement.
A focus on providing information to individuals in both written form
i.e., education packets, in addition to discussing the research and
answering questions through a gradual process may be important to help
ensure potential subjects are adequately informed of the procedures,
risks and benefits, ability to withdraw, and alternatives to study
enrolment.

Attitudes regarding CRISPR gene editing and expectations among service
members may also impact the informed consent process. Service members
may be drawn to participate if they believe that the procedure could
give them an advantage over the enemy or protect them from a terrorist
attack. Further complicating the issue is that some research
participants may have trouble grasping the basic concepts of genetics
and gene therapy trials (Rose, Russo, and Wykes 2013). Often
misconceptions exist regarding the intent of these types of trials.
Deaths that have occurred during other human gene therapy trials
highlight the disparity that often exists between goals of the research
and participant expectations (Dresser 2009). Although personal benefit
may be possible in early clinical trials, the main objective of
first-in-human studies is to address safety. As such, a type of
Btherapeutic misconception\^ is likely to exist among military research
subjects where CRISPR may protect them against harm from combat.
Military IRBs will need to consider whether the benefits of improved
performance are being overstated during informed consent to service
members.

A final point to consider surrounding informed consent is the impact of
the FDA's newly adopted stance on expedited development of DoD medical
products. During the first Gulf War, the FDA allowed the DoD to
administer two experimental treatments to deploying service members to
protect them against potential biochemical attacks (Boyce 2009).
Practically speaking, no one can predict when war may break out. [[If a
CRISPR based experimental treatment were developed enough for testing on
service members but had not yet been approved for use, it would be
impractical to obtain informed consent from every service member prior
to deployment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under the current regulations the
product could be used under emergency situations or, depending on the
stage of development, could be expedited. If some service members
refused, then they could place themselves at risk of personal harm and
jeopardize the success of a mission. [[Administering CRISPR gene editing
prematurely could threaten service members' safety, autonomy, ability to
consent and whether they could opt out of these types of
enhancements]{.underline}]{.mark}. This precedent could be important in
genetics research as service members can conceivably be given orders,
even against their wishes, if they are being sent to a war zone where
biological weapons are being used. A cautionary approach to gene
enhancement research using CRISPR may be prudent such that smaller scale
testing can be done in controlled research settings prior to large-scale
use and application during combat missions. Military leadership, IRBs,
and the FDA must carefully evaluate unknown risks to soldiers and the
risk of an unsuccessful mission if adequate human subjects research
using the technology has not yet been performed.

#### CRISPR command structure turn

\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

Inequality of Access

[[Inequality of access has been raised as a potential negative
consequence of gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark} (Rabino 2003). The
inequality of access argument against human gene enhancement could also
apply in military settings (Amoroso and Wenger 2003). Uniformity is one
mechanism the armed forces use to instil discipline and foster
willingness to follow directions and is intimately tied to the chain of
command structure. Due to the risks associated with gene enhancement
research, first-in-human studies may be restricted to Special Forces
personnel or those slated to participate in risky missions. If some
deployed service members had enhancements and others did not, this could
lead to dissent. [[Under the dissent rules, service members may refuse
deployment claiming they have not been provided with the same level of
protection as others. This could greatly hamper the success of
missions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even if a particular enhancement is given
to an entire unit, temporary duty assignments or permanent change of
stations could also create inequality within the forces and could
disrupt the overall chain of command structure.

Another DoD regulation that may impact inequality of access to CRISPR
research is whether the service member is on active duty. [[Military
human subjects' regulations prohibit active duty service members from
being compensated]{.underline}]{.mark} for participating in research
trials (DoDI 2002). Essentially if a service member is being paid by the
DoD, they cannot simultaneously be compensated with additional funds
through other DoD funding mechanisms for research purposes. [[A CRISPR
trial designed to offer compensation may be viewed as an unfair
incentive to service members who are on leave]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Researchers may want to consider not offering compensation at all. If
participation is limited to only service members on leave in order to
offer fair compensation to all participants, [[military IRBs may need to
consider whether this violates principles of fairness for
all]{.underline}]{.mark} military research subjects.

The [[corona]{.underline}]{.mark}virus pandemic has [[brought
into]{.underline}]{.mark} sharp [[focus]{.underline}]{.mark} the
possible [[benefits and]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[pitfalls
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology research.
Although such research can be [[used to]{.underline}]{.mark} produce
medical countermeasures to [[fight]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[diseases]{.underline}]{.mark} and develop healthier crops and
livestock, it [[can also]{.underline}]{.mark} be deployed to [[produce

though the current pandemic, as argued by most scientific experts, is
believed to have originated from natural sources, the origin of this
particular pandemic does not rule out the possibility that other
[[future infections could emerge from laboratories]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Gene therapy innovation should happen outside the military for ethical reasons

Peter H. **Schwartz**, April 20**20**, Indiana University Center for
Bioethics, Indiana University School of
Medicinehttps://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdf/S1525-0016(20)30142-8.pdf,
\" Ethics of Gene Therapy in the Military: Promise and Potential
Problems\" Molecular Therapy Vol. 28 No 4 (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

While certain enhancements are accepted in current medical practice,
such as plastic surgery for appearance or botox for wrinkles, these
cosmetic interventions are classified differently than most medical
care, for instance not covered by health insurance. [[When proposed
enhancements involve]{.underline}]{.mark} long-term medications or,
worse, [[genetic modification, concerns grow, as]{.underline}]{.mark}
can be [[seen with]{.underline}]{.mark} current programs in [[military
enhancement, such as human-machine interfaces and
neuroenhancement]{.underline}]{.mark}.8 The proposed gene therapy, in
contrast, is more like a vaccine to protect against future illness (in
this case caused by nerve agents rather than viruses).

The most important concerns about this gene therapy stem from its
potential risks, much like for other new therapeutics. While [[being
long-acting]{.underline}]{.mark} is a major point in the approach's
favor, this feature also [[brings potential
dangers]{.underline}]{.mark}: scientists have already pointed out that
[[the synthetic enzyme]{.underline}]{.mark} made by the gene
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}, by [[persisting in the blood stream,
stimulate an immune response]{.underline}]{.mark} to the naturally
occurring form, [[which is important in cholesterol
metabolism]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 In addition, the fact that the
treatment permanently modifies the individual's genome raises the
dangers of ot[[her long-term side effects, such as increasing cancer
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[would be difficult to
identify]{.underline}]{.mark}. The short-term benefits, one might hope,
would make such longterm dangers acceptable, initially in research
projects and then more generally in widespread use, but here things get
complicated, in part because of the potential military use. For one
thing, it can be difficult to carry out ethical clinical trials in the
military, since military personnel may not feel as if they can choose to
participate, due to command structure and culture.7,9

Perhaps even more importantly, since the treatment is preventative, it
would presumably be used for all soldiers who have a significant risk of
being exposed to nerve agents. But will the benefit to the potentially
few soldiers who are actually exposed outweigh the risks to the many
treated? Questions like this always arise for preventive interventions,
such as screening tests: many people are tested and treated, but
relatively few benefit. Groups such as the United States Preventive
Services Task Force or American Cancer Society make recommendations by
tallying up the benefits and risks at the population level.

Things are more complicated for a preventive treatment in the military,
where the risk to the individual is affected by decisions by superior
officers. [[Sending soldiers into a situation where chemical weapons may
be used is slightly easier if the soldiers are at least somewhat
protected]{.underline}]{.mark}. For this reason, [[the availability of
the treatment might increase the risk to the individual
soldier]{.underline}]{.mark}, on balance, [[by increasing the chance of
their being exposed even as it reduces the harm from
exposure]{.underline}]{.mark}. The treatment may thus more directly
benefit military efficacy overall rather than individual soldiers.

These issues arise for all technological and medical means used to
protect or treat soldiers. Think of everything from armored vehicles to
the incredible advances in trauma medicine that have saved so many. All
these advances are admirable and indispensable, but their availability
may lead soldiers to be placed in situations with higher risk. When we
start imagining making changes to soldiers' DNA, changes that will last
a lifetime, there are new, higher stakes.

Ruling on the ethics of gene therapy in the military, as for other
technological advances, depends in part on judgments about how the
technology or treatment will be used and for what ends. Even though the
potential benefits to our soldiers and military understandably motivates
this research, the first widespread uses of gene therapy may be more
appropriately tested and implemented outside of the military.

#### No legal prohibition on DOD enhancement now

Currently, [[there is no specific regulation barring the enhancement of
service members for military purposes although the Department's current
emphasis on optimization as opposed to enhancement suggests general
weariness regarding permanent gene editing for service
members]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nevertheless, research into human
performance optimization and by extension biomedical enhancements is
very active within the DoD (Land 2010; Jonas et al. 2010). As discussed,
using CRISPR, it is possible to create semi-permanent gene enhancements.
[[As public acceptability of gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark} for
somatic versus germline therapies [[shifts]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Scheufele et al. 2017), [[so may acceptance of somatic
enhancements]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is thus conceivable that in the
future, enhancements could become fully in compliance with the
Department's policies.

#### Genetic modification will dramatically increase ableism

Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

[[CRISPR has revitalized the debate over human gene
enhancement]{.underline}]{.mark}. In contemporary bioethics debates, [[a
distinction between gene editing to treat or prevent disease and
enhancement for non-health purposes is sometimes
made]{.underline}]{.mark} with the latter being more strongly
discouraged (Scheufele et al. 2017; Annas and Annas 2009; Ashcroft 2008;
Amoroso and Wenger 2003). The distinction is meant [[to draw a line
between practices that are considered morally
permissible]{.underline}]{.mark} (gene editing for therapeutic purposes)
[[versus those that are prohibitory]{.underline}]{.mark} (gene editing
for enhancement) (Buchanan et al. 2000). Therapy is considered medically
necessary in order to achieve normal function. But what is considered
Bnormal\^ function and what is Bpathological\^ is susceptible to change.
Yet in some cases, the moral difference between the therapy versus
enhancement distinction becomes blurry. The classic example of two young
boys both of whom are born with very short stature helps illustrate this
point. Boy A is born short due to a deficiency in the human growth
hormone (HGH) gene whereas Boy B is born short because both his parents
are very short. Using CRISPR to correct the mutation in Boy A would be
considered therapy because of a known gene defect whereas performing
gene editing for Boy B would be considered enhancement because there is
no clearly identifiable clinical pathology. Yet both Boy A and Boy B
would suffer the social prejudice known as heightism, both desire to be
taller, and both have very short statures due to a genetic lottery and
to no fault of their own. In this situation, it would be ethically
permissible to help both boys (Buchanan et al. 2000). Additionally, what
may be considered an enhancement now might be considered treatment or
routine care in the future (Frankel and Chapman 2000; Buchanan et al.
2000). In the above example, if we knew the specific set of genes making
Boy B very short, this may be labelled as a pathology and thus could
benefit from CRISPR therapy.

But [[there are valid reasons for maintaining the therapy/enhancement
distinction including concerns that enhancement may be a form of a new,
albeit softer, eugenics which likely furthers inequality among those who
cannot afford to create children with enhanced
traits]{.underline}]{.mark} (Frankel and Chapman 2000; Kiuru and Crystal
2008; Comfort 2015). [[The disability community finds the topic of gene
modification particularly concerning. Many are concerned that the
medical model characterizes disabilities as a medical problem that must
be mitigated or eliminated]{.underline}]{.mark} (Generations Ahead
2010). Disability is a social construct with a socially dominant view
that disabled people are unhappy and discounts the pride which people
have in their disabilities and how it brings diverse and new
perspectives to the world (Shakespeare 1995, 1998). [[Several in the
disability community view genetic modification to rid disabilities in
the world as highly discriminatory and argue that efforts towards such
goals may increase social intolerance and further prejudice disabled
persons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There are, however, dissenting opinions as some argue enhancements are
good for society and consider human enhancement a moral obligation
(Savulescu 2005; Harris 2007). Based on the principle of procreative
beneficence, Julian Savulescu argues that short of having competing
interests, such as harm to a pregnant mother, parent(s) are obligated to
have the most advantaged child, including by genetic enhancement
(Savulescu 2001; Savulescu and Kahane 2009). Not all enhancements might
be permissible, such as aesthetic ones like eye colour, but those that
improve human flourishing, such as intelligence, would be allowed (Chan
and Harris 2007).

For the purposes of our discussion here, we will not focus on the
permissibility of enhancements in general or even for military purposes.
Instead, we begin from the premise that CRISPR for military enhancement
may be permitted and focus on outlining ethical issues surrounding risks
and benefits to subjects, informed consent, and inequalities of access.

#### Public consultation / Recruiting CP

Marsha **Greene** **&** Zubin **Master**, 20**18**, Senior Policy

\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

We conclude with two points. First is to encourage public and
stakeholder engagement on the ethics of using CRISPR in military
enhancement technology. Currently, public debate on the use of CRISPR
for germline and enhancement purposes indicates that many in the public
display concern about somatic and germline enhancements (McCaughey et
al. 2016; Pew Research Center 2016; STAT-Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health 2016; Gaskell et al. 2017; Scheufele et al. 2017). These
studies capture the views of different populations and vary in how
questions are worded thereby accounting for some of the differences in
opinions. But [[no study has yet to investigate the views of
stakeholders on the use of CRISPR for enhancement for the purpose of
protecting soldiers. Public and stakeholder views may differ when
considering the use of CRISPR technology for military
enhancement]{.underline}]{.mark}. Engagement within DoD and the public
will help DoD research ethicists and leadership understand public and
stakeholder concerns and be able to manage ethical issues of research
involving military personnel as the research is translated into human
applications. [[To promote discourse, several deliberative strategies
and research methods could be employed including town hall meetings,
citizen juries, consensus conferences, polling, and focus groups among
others]{.underline}]{.mark} (Abelson et al. 2003). Deliberation can
focus on a range of ethical questions such as how to translate CRISPR
gene technology for military applications, how best to handle research
ethics issues including informed consent and risk analysis for
first-in-human studies, and when and how to best inform the public to
ensure transparency of gene editing research.

The second point is that [[DoD should consider several research ethics
issues as this technology moves forward]{.underline}]{.mark}. Gene
editing is clearly advancing and as gene modification becomes accepted
in military research, several considerations need to be made to minimize
risks and ensure service members are appropriately informed should they
become research participants. This will include taking steps to reduce
the group pressure that could be a by-product of military cohesiveness
training and making improvements in the consent process such that
service members understand the risks and purpose of these interventions.
The military will likely be watching the first-in-human trials very
closely while simultaneously exhausting all preclinical options in order
to fully evaluate the risks of off-target effects. There will need to be
some certainty from further validated studies prior to initiating any
wide-scale use for military applications. Additionally, researchers and
military leadership alike will need to be cognizant of the potential for
CRISPR applications to be deployed in the military setting prior to
approval of these interventions by the FDA. Prior to invoking the
Interim Rule due to [[a bioterrorist threat]{.underline}]{.mark},
several considerations need to be weighed to ensure appropriate
protections [[to front line military personnel]{.underline}]{.mark}.
From the DoD perspective, ensuring that service members have the best
available protection in a war zone is paramount. However, this [[creates
many ethical issues]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding breach of individual
rights and autonomy. At the same time, [[a consideration could be that
these risks are built into enlisting and recruiting discussions so that
service members understand clearly that this is a possibility under
certain scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the President's Council in
2003 felt that the risks of using gene editing for military enhancement
were too high, it remains unclear given scientific advancements in gene
editing whether similar conclusions would be made.

#### EO subtracking funded now, post brink

\"The US Military Is Genetically Engineering New Life Forms To Detect
Enemy Subs,\" Defense One (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

The Naval Research Laboratory, or [[NRL]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**is**
supporting the research]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here's how it would work:
You [[take]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[abundant]{.underline}]{.mark} sea
organism, like [[Marinobacter]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and change its
genetic makeup to react to]{.underline}]{.mark} certain substances left
by [[enemy vessels]{.underline}]{.mark}, divers, or equipment. These
could be metals, fuel exhaust, human DNA, or some molecule that's not
found naturally in the ocean but is associated with, say, diesel-powered
submarines. The reaction could take the form of electron loss, which
could be detectable to friendly sub drones.

"In an engineered context, we might take the ability of the microbes to
give up electrons, then use \[those electrons\] to talk to something
like an autonomous vehicle. [[Then]{.underline}]{.mark} you can start
imagining that you can [[create an electrical signal when the bacteria
encounters some molecule]{.underline}]{.mark} in their environment," NRL
researcher Sarah Glaven said at a November event put on by the Johns
Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab.

Glaven believes [[the research is **about a year
away**]{.underline}]{.mark} from providing concrete evidence that she
can engineer reactions in abundant marine life forms that could prove
useful for the military. Sub-hunting, in particular, is "what we would
like it to be applicable for," she said.

"The reason we think [[we can accomplish this is because we **have**
this vast database of info we've collected from growing these natural
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. So after experiments where we look at
switching gene potential, gene expression, regulatory networks, we are
finding these sensors," said Glaven.

Geneticists have already shown that it's possible to manipulate the
genes of E. coli bacteria to exhibit all sorts of properties that might
be useful for sub sensing. But, in synthetic biology, E.coli are similar
to lab mice in conventional medical research: they're abundant, cheap,
and easy to work with, but their real-world relevance is limited. What
works in E. coli, or in lab mice, doesn't always work in other organisms
and you just don't find them in the sorts of places you would want to
detect submarines.

[[There's **currently** a \$45 million]{.underline}]{.mark} effort
across the Army, Navy and Air Force, [[dubbed]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Applied Research for the Advancement of Science and Technology
Priorities Program [[on Synthetic Biology]{.underline}]{.mark} for
Military Environments, aimed at giving researchers the tools they need
to engineer genetic responses into organisms that would be useful for
the military.

\"COVID-19 vaccine: How was it developed so fast?,\" Medical News Today
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

Funding for COVID-19 vaccine research

[[Vaccine research is costly]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2018, a study in
The Lancet Global HealthTrusted Source estimated the cost of early
development and initial clinical safety trials for a typical vaccine to
be in the range of \$31--68 million. Large scale trials to determine the
efficacy of a vaccine candidate would add to these figures.

In [[an accelerated timetable]{.underline}]{.mark} with a new
coronavirus, this [[cost might be **higher**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
this reason, [[funding from sources ranging **from** the government
**to** the private sector was **critical**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
making COVID-19 vaccines.

In the United States, Operation Warp Speed
([[OWS]{.underline}]{.mark})Trusted Source [[partnered with **multiple**
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the
National Institutes of Health ([[NIH]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention ([[CDC]{.underline}]{.mark}), to develop, manufacture, and
distribute 300 million doses by early 2021.

"By providing resources and assuming the financial risk, OWS allows
companies to produce and stockpile vaccine doses even before the company
knows if the vaccine is going to work," said Dr. Yager.

"Also, by [[investing in **multiple** companies and vaccine platforms
**at once**]{.underline}]{.mark}, OWS [[increased the odds of having a
vaccine]{.underline}]{.mark}, or vaccines, available by the beginning of
2021," he added.

The [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}an Commission [[has also funded
**several** vaccine candidates]{.underline}]{.mark} and worked with
others in pledging \$8 billion for COVID-19 research.

The United Kingdom government's Vaccine Taskforce has also been a
significant contributor to a wide variety of vaccine research.
Recipients of this funding helped develop the AstraZeneca vaccine. The
designers of this vaccine were the first to publish peer reviewed
efficacy results from phase 3 trials.

[[Novel agent risks are the identification or development of new
biological agents or toxins with the assistance of dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. These risks also encompass "gain of
function" research into pathogenic viruses, including combinatorial
chemistry, high-throughput screening, DNA shuffling, directed evolution
or protein engineering \[3\]. For example, [[gene editing technology,
represented by CRISPER]{.underline}]{.mark}-Cas9, [[can greatly change
the biological traits of pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}, animals and
plants, and even humans in a short time. Gene synthesis technology can
[[artificially resurrect extinct pathogenic
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}, so that bacteria and viruses with higher
pathogenicity can be synthesized, the receptors of [[which may have
unprecedented biological characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} \[9\]. In
2018, Canadian scientists obtained overlapping gene fragments through
mail order, splicing them to synthesize a horse pox virus which was
similar to the smallpox virus \[10\]. [[These artificially synthesized
viruses are more capable of infecting, spreading, killing, and
escaping]{.underline}]{.mark} than natural viruses, [[so it is more
difficult to trace their origins]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, RNA
interference and personal genomics, realized by [[gene
driving]{.underline}]{.mark} technology, [[may not only be used as
crowd-specific weapons to reduce human reproductive
capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} and change the number of specific human
populations, [[but also]{.underline}]{.mark} be used [[to manufacture
insect weapons for]{.underline}]{.mark} transnational transmission of
[[dengue fever, Zika, and other diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}.

(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

[[Normative risks use dual-use biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[to
destroy the framework of international biosafety governance conventions,
including the]{.underline}]{.mark} Biological Weapons Convention
([[BWC]{.underline}]{.mark}). For example, [[new neuropeptide biological
agents]{.underline}]{.mark} that can influence and manipulate specific
wills or emotions have been manufactured. These agents [[can
induce]{.underline}]{.mark} visual or auditory
[[hallucinations]{.underline}]{.mark}, and cause disability or even
extreme hysteria during interrogation, [[violating the human rights of
detainees and breaking international humanitarian
law]{.underline}]{.mark}. Normative risks also concern the
self-regulation of scientists. In 2018, He Jiankui of China's Southern
University of Science and Technology created the world's first
gene-edited infant, in violation of the international regulation that
"gene-edited early human embryos (within 14 days of age) and germ cells
should not be used for pregnancy." Normative risks also involve the
application of dual-use biotechnology to existing international ethical
principles and norms. He Jiankui violated the Helsinki Declaration, the
International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human
Subjects, and other international ethics, and principles and common
views designed to "respect and protect subjects, maximize subject
benefit and avoid subject injury as much as possible" \[14\].

#### Biotech experiments undermine anthropocentrism

(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

Although the public now has a clearer understanding of the risks posed
by [[dual-use biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the international
community has made great efforts to mitigate those risks, disputes over
safety and ethics are still common in formulating governance policies
worldwide. In the field of stem cell research, the Japanese government
revised its "Treatment Policy for Specific Embryos" in 2019, which
[[approved research on cultivating human organs for transplantation in
animals by implanting human stem cells into animal
embryos]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time, [[it lifted restrictions
on the termination of humananimal chimeric embryos within 14 days and
restrictions on implanting those embryos]{.underline}]{.mark} into
surrogate uteruses \[29\]. [[Such embryos may develop into human-animal
chimeras, raising ethical disputes over the blurring of boundaries
between human and non-human animals]{.underline}]{.mark}. The cause of
the governance disputes is that dual-use biotechnology entails
human-made risks that are difficult to control in addition to
information asymmetry risks. As a result, the traditional
self-governance of the biotechnology industry is placed in a predicament
where it is difficult for governance models to keep up with the
development of emerging technologies.

### Solvency

#### Challenges beyond vaccine funding undermine NATO resilience

defense for European and NATO policy and an adjunct senior fellow in the

\"Build resilience for an era of shocks,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-17-2022)

NATO and the Resilience Challenge

[[Resilience is enshrined in NATO's DNA through Article
3]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Washington Treaty,1 and has been developed
through additional guidelines at NATO Summits, namely the 2016 baseline
resilience guidelines (and associated 2017 evaluation criteria).2 These
guidelines are meant to support continuity of government, the provision
of essential services in member states, and civil support to the
military, in the event of a major shock.3 While initially devised to
prepare for traditional military attacks, recent events such as Russian
hybrid activities and terrorist attacks have put a greater emphasis on
civilian preparedness as a key component of resilience.4

[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown,
[[NATO's current resilience architecture cannot cope with multiple
disruptive events, especially those of a non-traditional
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}. In response to the pandemic, NATO jolted
into action its emergency response capabilities to support allies with
logistics and planning, set up field hospitals, transport patients, and
disinfect public areas and border crossings.5 Allied institutions such
as the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) and
the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) helped to coordinate
allied requests for supplies and made military assets available for the
pandemic response. Even though [[NATO's existing
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} helped member states respond to the
crisis, they [[failed to achieve the fundamental aims of resilience:
minimize damage, restore stability quickly, and catalyze improved
strategies for similar challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}.6

[[The pandemic showed that NATO's resilience framework suffers from
several shortcomings. First, it is highly state-centric, while effective
resilience-building measures should employ extensive cooperation with
the private sector]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Businesses]{.underline}]{.mark}, not governments, own many of the
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[could be
deployed]{.underline}]{.mark} to respond to a major strategic shock.
Further, [[civil society's trust]{.underline}]{.mark} and cooperation
[[is essential]{.underline}]{.mark} for any effective disaster response.
[[Second, NATO's current framework uses a traditional security
lens]{.underline}]{.mark}, focuses on states first, [[and stipulates
that the response to a threat should only take place once a certain
level of risk has been met]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the
instability created by pandemics, climate change, or cyber-attacks is
slow-moving, making long-term prevention a more effective strategy than
crisis response. [[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}, even though
[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} has become increasingly relevant, it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[under-resourced. NATO does little to
enforce investment levels]{.underline}]{.mark} or allocation of output,
[[compared to traditional defense spending]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Combined, [[these issues leave NATO with a weak
mandate]{.underline}]{.mark} to task allies [[to enhance prevention and
national preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}, the inability to mitigate
the deep and wide impact of non-traditional security threats, and
insufficient capacity to manage and quickly scale a response to upcoming
strategic shocks.

#### No resilience outside of EU

https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_132722.htm, \"Resilience and
civil preparedness -- Article 3 ,\" NATO (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

Enhancing resilience and civil preparedness is also part of NATO's
support to partners and a way to project stability in the Alliance's
neighbourhood. Examples of practical cooperation include the deployment
of teams of civil preparedness experts in support of Ukraine in 2014,
Jordan in 2015 and Iraq in 2019. The cooperation with Jordan, which runs
from 2019 until 2022, resulted in a joint United Nations-NATO three-year
project to assist Jordan in improving its preparedness in the field of
chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weapons.

Continued [[engagement with the private sector and other international
organisations like the European Union (EU) and the United Nations is
also key to strengthening resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially by
developing shared situational awareness. [[The EU, in particular,
remains a unique and essential partner for the Alliance, particularly
through staff-to-staff consultations and practical cooperation in a
number of resilience-related areas]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A New Conceptualization of Security

To meet this new security environment, [[NATO needs to help allies build
a functional, forward-looking, and funded resilience
architecture]{.underline}]{.mark}. To do so, the next NATO Strategic
Concept should approve a fourth core task focused on resilience. This
would allow the Alliance to help member states strengthen their
resilience at home and acquire national (or NATO-owned) resources to
assist each other in an emergency. This would prepare NATO to respond to
upcoming non-traditional security threats while also reinforcing
conventional defense and deterrence.

The new, strengthened resilience framework should be guided by several
principles. NATO should continue to build on the concept of resilience
as being on the "left side" of a shock7 and shape the security
environment before another catastrophic event takes place. Second,
[[this effort should be more holistic, looking beyond existing
resilience baseline requirements to the protection of coastal areas,
water management systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, etc., [[and enhancing
cooperation with private sector stakeholders and civil
society]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, NATO should conceptualize
resilience as a peacetime effort, which empowers people and societies
within member states to work together continuously to address sources of
vulnerability, especially those areas below the threshold of the use of
force.

In order to move forward, new ministerial guidance must be given to NATO
headquarters to evaluate the cascading effects of non-traditional
threats and assess NATO's level of ambition in implementing this fourth
core task.8 [[However, properly resourcing this new resilience framework
will require the development of resilience capability goals for each
ally to meet, at the national and collective level, as part
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the NATO Defense Planning Process
([[NDPP]{.underline}]{.mark}). [[These goals should then be tailored to
the needs of individual allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, allocated based on
fair share and reasonable burden, and reviewed as part of a process that
holds allies accountable to their commitments. Common funds can also
help allies acquire NATO-owned assets when needed. Finally, the
Framework Nations Concept could be used as a model for developing
resilience capabilities.9

Because non-traditional threats require civil-military coordination,
[[an emphasis on NATO-European Union (EU) cooperation should be at the
heart of the Alliance's efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} to deal with this
adapted approach to the security environment. The European Union already
has strategies and capabilities to prevent and address the underlying
causes of strategic vulnerability, as well as immense civilian
regulatory power in sectors ranging from energy to technology.
Harnessing that capacity and aligning it with NATO's goals is essential
for a strong resilience framework. Therefore, the NATO-EU Joint
Declaration of 201810 should be updated to include resilience in the
face of non-traditional security threats, developed through cooperation
on capability development and operational coordination. The updates
might emphasize, among other issues, aligning investments in innovative
green technologies (which can be transferred across the civil-military
divide) and implementing common standards for public health trainings.

### Vaccine Nationalism Good Turn

#### Vaccine Nationalism good -- cooperation empirically fails

\"Vaccine competition may now be the world's best bet,\" Chatham House
-- International Affairs Think Tank (ermo/sms, Acc:6-19-2022)

[[Relations between the major powers are at their worst for decades with
cooperation thin on the ground, and COVID-19 having deepened suspicions
further]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In April, the US Senate passed the Strategic Competition Act with
bipartisan support, promising to 'counter the malign influence of the
Chinese Communist Party globally'. In front of his American counterpart,
China's top foreign policy official denounced the effrontery of those
who 'smear' Chinese democracy. Joe Biden calls Vladimir Putin 'a
killer', while the Kremlin has put the US at the top of its list of
unfriendly countries. [[Tension between China and India is high, the EU
and UK are involved in repeated spats]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Competition and mistrust are everywhere]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Far from producing greater collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} in
adversity, [[COVID-19 has **exacerbated** global
rivalries]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given that the tensions long pre-dated
the pandemic and are unlikely to improve any time soon, [[it is **hard
to see** how the major powers can be persuaded to cooperate better to
tackle this crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Coronavirus is just the first
test. Other crises will follow.

President Biden calls the relationship with China 'naturally
competitive, sometimes adversarial and, on key issues, necessarily
collaborative'. Managing these competing impulses is proving difficult
to navigate. One route is the established one, focusing on international
institutions and multilateral groups to tackle the big global
challenges. In times of tension they have a restraining role; in times
of cooperation, they can do so much more.

Yet, [[if the disappointing results of the G7 are anything to go by,
expectations should be managed **even lower** than they are
already]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} there is
another way. The present atmosphere of [[intense **competition** can
actually be exploited to the **advantage** of developing
economies]{.underline}]{.mark}\* .

Vaccine competition and the early hopes

A few weeks into the crisis, Ricardo Lagos, former president of Chile
and a member of the Elders group of international leaders wrote:
'Hopefully the international institutions will rise to the challenge of
responding to this pandemic with the force that it demands, because this
crisis will not be overcome by defeating the disease in any one country
alone, but by guaranteeing an end to the affliction throughout the
world.'

[[The first reaction of nation states was to protect their own, hoard,
close borders -- and indulge in nationalist
points-scoring]{.underline}]{.mark}.

This has been a story of extraordinary scientific success and
extraordinary political failure.

Robert Yates, Director, Global Health Programme; Executive Director,
Centre for Universal Health, Chatham House

The more the US and its allies blamed China, both for the outbreak in
Wuhan and for what many considered to be a cover-up, and the more China
refused to provide the necessary access or information, the more
distrustful and disjointed the global response became.

The final year of Donald Trump's 'America First' presidency was
characterized by a COVID-19 policy of denial, denigration of science
and, at that point, the world's highest infection rate. The president
launched repeated broadsides against the World Health Organization
(WHO), denouncing its Director General Tedros Ghebreyesus as a 'puppet'
of China; he announced the termination of the US's WHO membership and
\$400m annual payment, putting its finances in peril just at a time when
the organization was most needed. Trump's approach was borne partly of
ideology, partly of a need to create a distraction from his
administration's incompetence.

Across the rich world, governments floundered in their initial
response\* .

The medical and health community rallied early, creating an initiative
designed to distribute vaccines, even as they were still in the early
stage of development. The aim of COVAX was to produce and make available
two billion vaccines by the end of 2021. 'No-one is safe until everyone
is safe' became the mantra of collaboration.

Solidarity was not the problem among the organizations -- Gavi, the
global vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations (CEPI) worked with the WHO to get access to the COVID -19
Tools Accelerator, ACT-A, up and running.

COVAX was heralded as the 'only truly global solution', but it was a mix
of ambition and acknowledgement of the limited commitment of the big
powers to collaborate to vaccinate the world. Still, vaccinating 'the
priority fifth' of the world's population is better than nothing.

#### Vaccine Nationalism good -- Latin America proves

Vaccine diplomacy and nationalism

[[From the start of the pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the provision
of masks or personal protective equipment (PPE), [[nation states
indulged their competitive instincts. Vaccine diplomacy and its alter
ego vaccine nationalism followed this trend]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Public relations battles were fought out not just between rivals, but
also among supposed allies. The British government juxtaposed its mass
purchase of vaccines with the early failures of the European Union (EU)
as vindication of Brexit. For its part, the EU's definition of
solidarity was largely confined to the bloc.

On taking office in January 2021, [[Biden proclaimed that 'America is
back']{.underline}]{.mark} in the mainstream of global affairs. He
reversed the US decision to leave the WHO and turned around the domestic
response with an impressively fast vaccination programme.

[[Yet the US rhetoric rarely matched the reality]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Health policy was directed inwards: over-order on an industrial scale
and vaccinate until the last person is done.

Americans went from near panic to enjoying an oversupply of life-saving
medicine, while death rates in poorer countries were growing sharply
with vaccines desperately hard to come by. The West failed egregiously
in the competition for goodwill, leaving a gaping vacuum for others to
fill.

China and Russia's vaccine influence

In poorer regions, the vaccines of choice were Sinopharm and Sinovac of
China and Sputnik-V of Russia. Choice is perhaps the wrong term; they
were the only ones made available, even though the Chinese brands had
not yet been certified for use by the WHO. The Russian one has still not
been, although a peer-reviewed paper in the Lancet has demonstrated its
efficacy and safety'.

Chinese vaccines were present in, or pledged to, 90 countries. Each
shipment carried national flags and were accompanied by
photo-opportunities with grateful local dignitaries at the airport of
arrival.

By the end of May, China had sold or donated 700 million doses
worldwide. Chinese vaccines were present in, or pledged to, 90
countries. Each shipment carried national flags and were accompanied by
photo-opportunities with grateful local dignitaries at the airport of
arrival. The biggest deals were geographically and politically disparate
-- from Chile to Egypt, Mexico to the Philippines. Russia was in 80
countries. As Champa Patel, director of Chatham House's Asia-Pacific
programme, notes: 'Russia and China are not new actors on these
continents and are sometimes capitalising on long-established political
or economic relationships.'

[[The key question is why China and Russia were
faster]{.underline}]{.mark}. China's heavily enforced early lockdowns
kept numbers at home far lower than elsewhere in the world. In Russia,
COVID-19 spread rapidly but much of the public was wary of accepting the
home-produced vaccine, leading to one of the lowest take-up rates among
industrialized nations. At least that freed up stocks to enable the
Kremlin to go on a global charm offensive.

The race for vaccine equity in Latin America

By late May, [[Latin America had exceeded one million deaths, the
highest for any region]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world. The region was
long considered to be the United States' backyard. Frustrated at the
lack of vaccines, several leaders took to social media diplomacy to
'vaccine shame' their traditional ally.

In March, president of the Dominican Republic Luis Abinader tweeted:
'President \@JoeBiden, less-developed countries and traditional allies
of the USA, like Dominican Republic, have approved the AstraZeneca
vaccine and we need it urgently' while Paraguay was struggling to get
Chinese vaccines because of its recognition of Taiwan.

[[Latin America didn't help **itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 'The region
has failed to coordinate through existing mechanisms or to act as a
bloc,' says Chris Sabatini, senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham
House. '[[Combined with the absence of the US, this has enabled others
to fill the vacuum and split the region even more
deeply]{.underline}]{.mark}.'

Shortly after delivering 400,000 doses to Bolivia, the Kremlin trumpeted
access to its resources. 'We are sure that Russian-Bolivian ties will
expand, especially in sectors such as energy, mining and the peaceful
use of nuclear technologies,' Vladimir Putin said after meeting
President Luis Arce. Bolivia has the world's largest supply of lithium
-- an indispensable component in batteries for mobile phones -- but has
struggled to attract foreign investment to extract it.

What use is fraternity if now \[the US\] don't give us a reply?

Euclides Acevedo, Foreign Minister of Paraguay

Goodwill was thin on the ground in contract negotiations. The Bureau of
Investigative Journalism alleged in February that Pfizer had insisted to
several Latin American governments that they put up sovereign assets
such as embassy buildings and military bases as collateral against the
cost of potential future legal cases.

Impact of vaccine nationalism in Africa

Africa has received two per cent of vaccines administered globally. The
crisis was worsened by India's decision to divert vaccines from the
Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine manufacturing facility,
which had been earmarked for export to deal with the country's own
COVID-19 emergency.

By May 2021, of 36 countries where death rates were rising, all but four
were low- or middle-income countries. The cumulative effect has been to
eradicate years of development, leading to a further division of wealth
between nations and regions.

The African Union has set a goal of 40 per cent of vaccines to be
produced on the continent within 20 years. Reforms such as these, vital
though they are in the medium-term, will not alleviate the present
crisis.

At first glance, the situation suggests a reversion back to the old
paradigm of dependency. Yet there is another way of way of looking at
Africa's present predicament.

'We are playing out the same thing again -- but this time the politics
are different,' says Yates. This, he says, is reflected in the
leadership of international agencies as three major UN institutions are
now run by Africans. World Trade Organization (WTO) Director General
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is a former Nigerian government minister; UNAIDS'
Executive Director Winnie Byanyima was a Ugandan MP who then ran Oxfam
International. The head of the WHO, Tedros, was an Ethiopian minister.

Alex Vines, director of the Africa Programme, notes a series of regional
summits with Africa planned for 2022 (several of which had been
postponed because of the pandemic), including the EU, China and Turkey.
Everyone is piling into Africa -- and Africa knows it. 'The trend is
towards multi-polarity,' he says.

Discussion of big-power winners and losers may actually be missing the
point. This narrative assumes that [[recipient countries have little or
no agency]{.underline}]{.mark} and are unable to disaggregate the
various motivations and decide for themselves. [[Therefore, it may not
feel like that now, as populations reel, but developing economies have
more agency, more influence, than before]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Vaccine Nationalism good -- rivalries help developing countries

Donating vaccines as an opportunity

Several Chatham House experts argue that if the US and its allies act
quickly and deftly, they may be able to repair some of the damage.
'Helping developing countries to vaccinate their populations represents
a tremendous opportunity for the West to make up lost ground,' Yates
argues. 'Not only will this potentially win over wavering non-aligned
nations; it will accelerate the end of the pandemic and bring
disproportionate benefits to their own economies as the world economy
recovers.'

Vines says of Africa: 'There is plenty of room left for the Americans to
re-engage and be involved. This is also where the EU has a role.' He
adds: 'African countries like choice.'

[[Perhaps developing countries can make a virtue of this unrelenting
soft-power rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark}. Imagine a situation in which
production increases and the competing powers vie to entice recipient
countries. They would compete against each on the efficacy and
reliability of vaccines, on cost and terms -- and on geo-strategic
allegiances.

Who cares where they come from or which political system they belong to
if \[the vaccines\] save lives?

The Right Hon Lord O'Neill, Chair, Chatham House

'[[Is it the end of the world if America, China and the others compete
to ensure vaccinations?']{.underline}]{.mark} asks Chatham House chair
Jim O'Neill, who has been on a number of inter-governmental preparatory
groups for the G7 and G20.

This is not as it should be. [[In a perfect world, multilateral and
cooperation would be the guiding principles]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
where such collaboration exists, it should be promoted and pursued.
[[But this crisis has shown the world at its most imperfect. If rivalry
has to prevail, it can be turned around to the advantage of those who
most need assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Specification Turn

#### Plan hurts resilience -- its vaccine specificity disrupts the "all hazards" 

**NATO**, 6-17-20**22**, North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_132722.htm, \"Resilience and
civil preparedness -- Article 3 ,\" NATO (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

[[NATO's work to improve resilience follows an all-hazards approach,
**not specific** to any single vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
contributes to protecting Alliance territory and populations from all
potential hazards. At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, Allied Leaders
decided to boost NATO's resilience to the full spectrum of threats and
continue developing their countries' individual and NATO's collective
capacity to resist any form of armed attack. [[They agreed seven
baseline requirements for national resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}
against which member states can measure their level of preparedness:

> Assured [[continuity]{.underline}]{.mark} of government and critical
> government services: for instance the ability to make decisions,
> communicate them and enforce them in a crisis;
>
> Resilient [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark} supplies: back-up plans and
> power grids, internally and across borders;
>
> Ability to deal effectively with uncontrolled [[movement of
> people]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to de-conflict these movements from
> NATO's military deployments;
>
> Resilient [[food and water]{.underline}]{.mark} resources: ensuring
> these supplies are safe from disruption or sabotage;
>
> Ability to deal with [[mass casualties]{.underline}]{.mark} and
> disruptive health crises: ensuring that civilian health systems can
> cope and that sufficient medical supplies are stocked and secure;
>
> Resilient civil [[communications]{.underline}]{.mark} systems:
> ensuring that telecommunications and cyber networks function even
> under crisis conditions, with sufficient back-up capacity. This
> requirement was updated in November 2019 by NATO Defence Ministers,
> who stressed the need for reliable communications systems including
> 5G, robust options to restore these systems, priority access to
> national authorities in times of crisis, and the thorough assessments
> of all risks to communications systems;
>
> Resilient [[transport]{.underline}]{.mark} systems: ensuring that NATO
> forces can move across Alliance territory rapidly and that civilian
> services can rely on transportation networks, even in a crisis.

[[These requirements reflect the three core functions of continuity of
government, essential services]{.underline}]{.mark} to the population
[[and civil support]{.underline}]{.mark} to the military, which must be
maintained even under the most demanding circumstances. [[They are all
connected, which means if one area is impacted, another may suffer as a
result]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Transparency Turn

(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

Creating a vaccine in under 1 year is no small feat. While the
coronavirus pandemic made a new normal of mask-wearing and physical
distancing, it also spurred global cooperation for vaccine research and
distribution.

However, [[a vaccine is **only** effective if people are willing to
receive it. With **rapid** research development, some may be concerned
that the vaccine was rushed]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[with these
concerns comes vaccine **hesitancy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A study that appeared in Nature MedicineTrusted Source in October 2020
surveyed 19 countries to investigate the acceptance of COVID-19
vaccines. The researchers found that only 71.5% of the respondents would
consider taking a COVID-19 vaccine and that only 48.1% would take it if
their employer recommended it.

By October 2021, healthcare workers had delivered more than 7 billion
doses of the COVID-19 vaccine globally. However, vaccine hesitancy
remains.

According to an ongoing Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 16% of
respondents will "definitely not" get the vaccine.

Considering that the fastest vaccine --- the mumps vaccine, which is now
part of the MMR vaccine --- took 4 years to develop, [[it is **natural**
to have some apprehension over the safety and effectiveness of a new
vaccine]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Dr. Sam Sun is a chief resident at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
and the director of the inDemic Foundation, a nonprofit organization
that provides information about COVID-19.

He told Medical News Today that [[transparency **throughout** the
vaccine process will be key to debunking misinformation and building the
public's trust]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Rigorous guidelines for clinical trials

In the U.S., the FDATrusted Source meticulously reviews the data from
each clinical trial phase before granting approval or, in the case of
public health emergencies, emergency use authorization.

Dr. Kenyon said that [[before any clinical trial can start, a data
monitoring and safety board must approve a study
protocol]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A [[phase 1]{.underline}]{.mark} trial focuses on the safety of the
vaccine candidate. The researchers [[give escalating doses of the
vaccine to healthy **volunteers**]{.underline}]{.mark} to determine side
effects and tolerability.

[[Phase 2]{.underline}]{.mark} trials expand their recruitment and [[may
include participants with health conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} such as
obesity, cancer, and diabetes. There is also active recruitment for
participants of various demographics. The trial continues to test the
safety of the vaccine and looks at the drug's initial efficacy and how
it affects the immune system.

[[Phase 3 trials recruit **thousands**]{.underline}]{.mark} of
participants to measure the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing
disease.

Clinical trials may combine their phases, which, according to Dr. Yager,
is a common practice that is still held to the same ethical, scientific,
and statistical standards as when each phase takes place separately. He
explained:

"One potential benefit of combined trials, particularly in phase 2/3, is
that since the vaccine is being evaluated in subgroups of individuals,
results from the study expedite the identification of patient factors
that impact vaccine safety or efficacy."

Dr. Yager said that [[a major factor behind the
rapid]{.underline}]{.mark} completion of [[clinical trials was a **high
interest** in volunteers for vaccine studies]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
helped enrollment goals for [[reaching **thousands** of
people]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively quickly.

Another factor was the increased number of testing sites to facilitate
enrollment and collect large amounts of data.

Safety monitoring after vaccination

Even after emergency use authorization has been granted, Dr. Kenyon said
that the scientists will continue to collect safety data, as they will
follow the participants for up to 2 years. This adds another layer of
reassurance as a person shifts from a trial to a real-life setting.

"The trial is tens of thousands of participants, but for the vaccine
program, you are getting into the millions. While unlikely, it may
uncover any undetected toxicities that were not picked up by the trial."

The CDCTrusted Source will monitor safety after vaccination for acute
care and long-term care facilities through the National Healthcare
Safety NetworkTrusted Source. For the general population, there is a
smartphone application called V-safeTrusted Source.

"It is a smartphone-based system where you will be contacted actively by
the CDC to see how you are doing after being vaccinated and \[it will\],
therefore, pick up any adverse events that were not picked up in the
trials," Dr. Kenyon explained.

MNT takeaways

The pandemic has ushered in a new era of vaccine research. The
combination of the global collaboration of scientists and the
development of mRNA vaccines is akin to the "landing-on-the-moon
moment," according to Dr. Yager.

As COVID-19 cases continue to surge in many areas of the world, [[the
**challenge** for widespread vaccine rollout will lie in its **uptake**
by the public]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Focus Turn

#### NATO focus should be limited to military personnel

\"NATO's Role in Pandemic Response,\" Heritage Foundation (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-23-2022)

NATO Must Focus Its Attention on Two Key Tasks

[[As a **military** alliance, NATO's responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}
during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as any future pandemics, [[is
to ensure the readiness of Alliance forces to carry out **combat**
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} at a moment's notice. [[Under this
guiding principle, there are **two** important areas where NATO and its
member states should pay close attention]{.underline}]{.mark} when it
comes to dealing [[with a global pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[Health]{.underline}]{.mark} and Welfare [[of
**Service**]{.underline}]{.mark} Personnel and Their
[[Families]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is the most important
consideration for NATO during a global pandemic. An armed force that is
medically unfit is useless. Also, soldiers who are deployed thousands of
miles from home should not have to worry about the safety and health of
their family members at home. They need to be 100 percent focused on the
mission at hand. During an international pandemic, this is perhaps the
single most important issue for armed forces.

As seen with the current pandemic, viruses do not discriminate between
ranks. Inside NATO, two senior generals tested positive for COVID-19:
the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, Salvatore Farina, and the head
of the Polish Armed Forces, Jarosław Mika. There was even at least one
confirmed case of COVID-19 at NATO headquarters in Brussels. A large
military base in northern Norway near the border with Russia was put on
lockdown after a Norwegian soldier tested positive for the coronavirus,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} another 1,300 soldiers were put into
quarantine.

[[Maintaining Military **Readiness**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Militaries
rely on training. If they cannot train, they will be less prepared to
fight. As seen with the novel coronavirus, its spread throughout Europe
has already affected readiness on both a strategic and a tactical level.
On the strategic level, major NATO exercises were cancelled or
curtailed. A major exercise in Norway focused on arctic security called
"Exercise Cold Response 20" was cancelled. This exercise was supposed to
involve 15,000 NATO troops. Another major exercise called "Defender
Europe 20" was curtailed because of the coronavirus outbreak. This
exercise was originally billed as the largest since the mid-1990s. On a
positive note, at least the planning for these exercises has already
happened, which in itself, is an important part of any training
exercise. On the tactical level, if soldiers cannot do basic training,
such as going to the rifle range because they are restricted to military
bases or to the barracks, their readiness levels go down. This also
leads to low morale.

### Ecology Focus Better for resilience

#### Environment focus prevents pandemics -- better way to channel preparation

\"Fighting COVID-19 could cost 500 times as much as pandemic prevention
measures,\" World Economic Forum (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

[[Significantly reducing transmission of new diseases from tropical
forests would cost, globally, between \$22.2 and \$30.7 billion each
year.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The COVID-19 pandemic will likely end up costing between \$8.1 and
\$15.8 trillion globally]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The failure to protect tropical rainforests has cost trillions of
dollars]{.underline}]{.mark} stemming [[from the]{.underline}]{.mark}
coronavirus [[pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to new research.

The pandemic has wreaked economic havoc and caused historic levels of
unemployment in the United States and around the world.

For decades, scientists and environmental activists have been trying to
draw the world's attention to the many harms caused by the rapid
destruction of tropical forests.

One of these harms is the emergence of new diseases that are transmitted
between wild animals and humans, either through direct contact or
through contact with livestock that is then eaten by humans. The
SARS-CoV-2 virus---which has so far infected more than 15 million people
worldwide---appears to have been transmitted from bats to humans in
China.

"Much of this traces back to our indifference about what has been
occurring at the edges of tropical forests," says Les Kaufman, a
professor of biology at Boston University and coauthor of a policy brief
in Science.

He recently brought together a team of researchers to better understand
the economic costs of reducing transmission of viruses like the novel
coronavirus. Looking at existing research, they made a startling
realization.

The cost of the pandemic

They discovered that significantly reducing transmission of new diseases
from tropical forests would cost, globally, between \$22.2 and \$30.7
billion each year. In stark contrast, they found that the COVID-19
pandemic will likely end up costing between \$8.1 and \$15.8 trillion
globally---roughly 500 times as costly as what it would take to invest
in proposed preventive measures.

To estimate the total financial cost of COVID-19, researchers included
both the lost gross domestic product and the economic and workforce cost
of hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.

The researchers say disease transmission from wild animals to humans
occurs frequently near the edges of tropical forests, where human
incursions increase the likelihood of contact with animals. These
incursions take the form of logging, cattle ranching, and other
livestock businesses, and the exotic animal trade, among others.

[[Tropical forests are often cut down in a patchwork or checkerboard
pattern, increasing the amount of land that lies at the edges of the
forest]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[thus increasing the risk for disease
transmission]{.underline}]{.mark} between species that would normally
live in different ecosystems.

Preventing new pandemics

[[To reduce disease transmission]{.underline}]{.mark}, Kaufman and his
collaborators propose [[expanding wildlife trade
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark} programs, investing in efforts to end
the wild meat trade in China, investing in policies to [[reduce
deforestation by 40%,]{.underline}]{.mark} and fighting the transmission
of disease from wild animals to livestock.

In China alone, wildlife farming (a government-monitored effort to
sustainably hunt wild animals without overhunting them) is an
approximately \$20 billion industry, employing 15 million people, say
Kaufman and his peers. In many communities in China, the purchase of
wildlife and bushmeat---meat from wildlife species---is a status symbol.

The researchers also propose to increase funding for creating an open
source library of the unique genetic signatures of known viruses, which
could help quickly pinpoint the source of emerging diseases and catch
them more quickly, before they can spread.

[[Every year, two new viruses are estimated to transfer from animals to
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}, the researchers say. Historically, these
have included HIV, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, H1N1, and most recently, the
SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Kaufman and his [[colleagues hope
that their report will spur governments around the world, including the
US government, to help fund these preventive
measures]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There are some signs of hope, they say, including the February
announcement by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
that wildlife consumption for food or related trade would be banned in
China.

"[[The pandemic gives an incentive to do something addressing concerns
that are **immediate**]{.underline}]{.mark} and threatening to
individuals, and that's what moves people," says Kaufman.

"There are many people who might object to the United States fronting
money, but it's in our own best interest. Nothing seems more prudent
than to give ourselves time to deal with this pandemic before the next
one comes."

Analysis.11 [[NATO should also examine its own impact on climate change

footprint.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead of waiting to respond to extreme
weather events and drought-enabled conflicts that may take place in
allied countries, NATO could leverage its new core task and expanded
NDPP to prepare for disaster by acquiring and building stockpiles of
emergency equipment and necessary assets. Working alongside the EU and
national emergency management agencies, NATO could help European allies
plan measures ranging from decentralized energy systems to coastal
hazard protection methods to blunt the impact of the next climate
disaster. [[A consistent schedule of natural disaster training exercises
would guarantee that when a crisis does occur, clear responsibilities
and required information exist]{.underline}]{.mark} within the system,

The goal of this essay is to provide a critical assessment of
[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} preparedness and [[response to
COVID-19]{.underline}]{.mark}. By exploring the mechanisms in place, the
support offered, and the measures taken by NATO to avert a security
crisis, it provides reflections on how lessons learned from this
pandemic could help to manage and prevent similar future crises. In
conclusion, this report argues that the alliance has proved capable of
overcoming political tensions and [[has given an important sign of
**resilience and solidarity** at a crucial moment]{.underline}]{.mark}
for its member states. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, more could have
been done with better preparedness in managing health risks and most
importantly with better political coordination between member states.
Despite the disruptive effect COVID-19 had on global economy and
international relations, [[the virus's impact on the future of the
alliance will be **marginal**. NATO's survival]{.underline}]{.mark} and
success in responding to global challenges [[will **ultimately** be
contingent on a **relaunch** of trans-Atlantic
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

## Impact Defense

### Pandemics 

#### Disease can't cause extinction

**[Ord 20]{.underline}** -- Dr. Toby, Senior Research Fellow in
Philosophy at Oxford University, DPhil in Philosophy from the University
of Oxford. "The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of
Humanity,", Hachette Books, pg. 124-126, 03-03-2020

Are we safe now from events like this? Or are we more vulnerable?
**[Could a pandemic threaten humanity's future?]{.underline}**10

The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. In 541 CE the
Plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine Empire. Over three years it
took the lives of roughly 3 percent of the world's people.11

When Europeans reached the Americas in 1492, the two populations exposed
each other to completely novel diseases. Over thousands of years each
population had built up resistance to their own set of diseases, but
were extremely susceptible to the others. The American peoples got by
far the worse end of exchange, through diseases such as measles,
influenza and especially smallpox.

During the next hundred years a combination of invasion and disease took
an immense toll---one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90 percent of the population of the Americas
during that century, though the number could also be much lower.12 And
it is very difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed
to war and occupation, rather than disease. As a rough upper bound, the
Columbian exchange may have killed as many as 10 percent of the world's
people.13

Centuries later, **[the world had become so interconnected that a truly
[global pandemic]{.mark} was possible]{.underline}**. Near the end of
the First World War, a devastating strain of influenza (known as the
1918 flu or Spanish Flu) spread to six continents, and even remote
Pacific islands. At least a third of the world's population were
infected and 3 to 6 percent were killed.14 This death toll outstripped
that of the First World War, and possibly both World Wars combined.

**[Yet even events like these [fall short of]{.mark} being [a threat to
humanity]{.mark}'s longterm potential]{.underline}**.15

\[FOONOTE\]

**[In addition to]{.underline}** this **[historical evidence, there are
some [deep]{.mark}er [biological]{.mark} observations and [theories
suggest]{.mark}ing that [pathogens are unlikely to lead to]{.mark} the
[extinction]{.mark} of their hosts. [These include]{.mark} the empirical
[anti-correlation between infectiousness and lethality]{.mark}, the
[extreme rarity]{.mark} of diseases [that kill more than 75%]{.mark} of
those infected, the observed [tendency]{.mark} of pandemics [to become
less virulent]{.mark} as they progress [and]{.mark} the theory of
[optimal virulence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, there is no
watertight case against pathogens leading to the extinction of their
hosts.

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

**[In the great bubonic plagues we saw [civilization]{.mark} in the
affected areas falter, but [recover]{.mark}. The regional]{.underline}**
25 to **[[50 percent death rate was not enough to precipitate]{.mark} a
continent-wide [collapse]{.mark} of civilization]{.underline}**. It
changed the relative fortunes of empires, and may have altered the
course of history substantially, but **[if anything, [it gives]{.mark}
us [reason to believe]{.mark} that human [civilization is likely to make
it through future events]{.mark} with similar death rates, [even
if]{.mark}]{.underline}** they were **[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
scale.

The 1918 flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little apparent
effect on the world's development despite its global reach. It looks
like it was lost in the wake of the First World War, which despite a
smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the course
of history.16

It is less clear what lesson to draw from the Columbian exchange due to
our lack of good records and its mix of causes. Pandemics were clearly a
part of what led to a regional collapse of civilization, but we don't
know whether this would have occurred had it not been for the
accompanying violence and imperial rule. **[The [strongest]{.mark} case
[against existential risk]{.mark} from natural pandemics [is]{.mark} the
[fossil record]{.mark}]{.underline}** argument from Chapter 3.
**[Extinction [risk]{.mark} from natural causes [above 0.1
percent]{.mark} per century [is incompatible with]{.mark} the evidence
of [how long humanity]{.mark} and similar species have
[lasted]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But this argument only works where the
risk to humanity now is similar or lower than the longterm levels. For
most risks this is clearly true, but not for pandemics. We have done
many things to exacerbate the risk: some that could make pandemics more
likely to occur, and some that could increase their damage. Thus even
"natural" pandemics should be seen as a partly anthropogenic risk.

#### Global travel [decreases lethality]{.underline} and [increases immunity]{.underline}.

3\. DISCUSSION The [large increase in international travel]{.underline}
over the last century [might be assumed to have resulted in a high
chance of]{.underline} a [devastating]{.underline} global
[pandemic]{.underline} (see e.g. \[32\]). Here [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[used a]{.mark} **general epidemiological [model]{.mark}** [to
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[an important]{.underline}**,
yet often **[overlooked, factor]{.underline}** in the dynamics of a
newly introduced high-virulence (HV) pathogen strain is partial immunity
driven by exposures to related pathogen strains. When a HV pathogen
strain arrives in a population following an epidemic of a related but
low virulence (LV) strain, the probability of a major epidemic of the HV
strain is decreased. [[High]{.mark} rates of
[travel]{.mark}]{.underline} between spatially distinct subpopulations
can [[drive **larger outbreaks** of **low virulence
pathogens**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn [[providing]{.mark} **higher
levels of [immunity]{.mark}**]{.underline} if/when a HV strain, which
has the potential to cause a devastating epidemic, appears in the
population (Fig 4a-c). Not only did we find that the probability of a
major epidemic of the HV strain decreases when travel between
subpopulations increases, but the expected final size of the HV strain
outbreak can also be reduced. This was particularly pronounced when the
level of cross-immunity between strains was high (Fig 4i), since lower
cross-immunity levels combined with high travel rates can lead to large
epidemics due to increased mixing between subpopulations (Fig 4g). When
between-subpopulation travel was increased, the reduction in the
probability of a major epidemic of the HV strain, and the expected size,
was largely due to cross-immunity reducing the proportion of outbreaks
that proceeded to become major epidemics. If/when major epidemics
occurred, we found that they were typically larger when there was more
travel between regions (Fig 4d-e), although this was not always the
case, particularly when the level of cross-immunity was very high (Fig
4f). Partial cross-immunity against a highly virulent strain from prior
exposure to a less virulent strain is characteristic of influenza
outbreaks in different seasons. For example, it has been suggested that
individuals born before 1890 were protected against the 1918 H1N1
pandemic due to the outbreak in 1889-90 \[33\] and that individuals
infected with multiple historical seasonal H1N1 influenza strains were
protected against the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic strain \[34\]. Our
[[results suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**cross-immunity** might
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a potential [[explanatory]{.underline}]{.mark}
factor [[as to why]{.mark} there has n[ot]{.mark} been a [pandemic as
devastating as]{.mark} the [1918]{.mark} influenza]{.underline} epidemic
in the century since, despite the emergence of a strain antigenically
similar to the 1918 pandemic strain in 2009. [Travel rates increased
substantially during the 20th century]{.underline}. As a theoretical
exercise, we obtained crude estimates of the travel rates from Europe to
the USA, comparing rates during the early 20th century with current
travel rates. For the early 20th century rates, we used registry
statistics from USA ports from 1914 to 1924 (see Supplementary Material
Section 5). Oceanic travel should approximate overall trans-Atlantic
travel in this time period, as other modes of long-distance travel were
extremely rare. This yielded the approximation λ≈ 3.6· 10-6 per day.
Conversely, when estimating current rates of travel from European
countries to the USA, approximated using data on air travel, we obtain
much higher values of λ≈ 3.7· 10-4 per day. It might be expected that
[such [a significant rise in travel]{.mark}]{.underline} in this time
period [might have **[reduced]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}** of a global
pandemic of a pathogen [with **circulating strains** that **induce
cross-immunity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Cross-immunity is **[known to
affect]{.mark}**]{.underline} the dynamics of
**[[outbreaks]{.underline}]{.mark}** of various pathogens. Vibrio
cholera, for example, exhibits almost complete cross-immunity between
strains (a study by Koelle et al. \[35\] used a cross-immunity level of
α= 0.955). On the other hand, human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV)
has been shown to provide incomplete cross-immunity against infections
from the same virus group (α ≈ 0.6, \[36\]). It also provides low levels
of cross-immunity again hRSV infections from different virus groups (α ≈
0.16, \[36\]), and partial cross-immunity against infections with human
Parainfluenza Virus\[37\]

### Bioterrorism 

#### No [motive]{.underline}

the Departments of War Studies and of Global Health and Social Medicine

really belongs", Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,

07-03-2017

I disagree. **[At a stretch, terrorists taking advantage of advances in
biology might be able to create [a]{.mark} viable [pathogen]{.mark}.
That [does not]{.mark} mean they could create [a
sophisticated]{.mark}]{.underline}** biological
**[[weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and certainly not a weapon that
could kill 30 million]{.underline}** people. **[[Terrorists]{.mark} in
any event [tend to be conservative]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[They [use
readily available weapons]{.mark} that have a proven]{.underline}**
track **[record---[not unconventional]{.mark} weapons that are more
difficult to develop and deploy. Available evidence shows that
[few]{.mark} terrorists have ever [even contemplated using
bio]{.mark}logical agents, and the extremely small number of
bioterrorism incidents in the historical record shows that biological
[agents are difficult to use]{.mark} as weapons. The [skills]{.mark}
required to undertake even the most basic of bioterrorism attacks
[are]{.mark} more [demanding]{.mark} than often assumed. These technical
barriers are likely to persist in the near- and medium-term
future.]{.underline}**

Gates does a disservice to the global health security community when he
draws media and policy attention to amateurs such as terrorists. Where
biological weapons are concerned, the focus should remain on national
militaries and state-sponsored groups. These are the entities that might
have the capability, now or in the near future, to develop dangerous
biological weapons. The real threat is that sophisticated biological
weapons will be used by state actors---or by financially,
scientifically, and militarily well-resourced groups sponsored by
states. So far, **[[state-level use]{.mark} of biology to deliberately
inflict disease or disrupt human functions [has been limited by
the]{.mark} strong international [norm]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[against
biological weapons]{.underline}** enshrined in the 1925 Geneva Protocol
and the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. These two
biological cornerstones of the rules of war uphold the international
prohibition against the development, production, stockpiling, and use of
biological weapons. But this norm may not survive indefinitely.

#### Bioterrror will fail.

**Pinker 18** Steven Arthur Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive
psychologist, Professor at Harvard University. \[Enlightenment Now: The
Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Viking, Penguin
Group\]

[[Biological agents are]{.mark} **particularly [ill-suited]{.mark}** [to
terr]{.mark}orists, whose goal]{.underline}, recall, [is]{.underline}
not damage but **[theater]{.underline}** (chapter 13).58 The biologist
Paul Ewald notes that [[natural selection]{.mark} among pathogens
**[works against]{.mark}**]{.underline} the terrorist's goal of [sudden
and spectacular [devastation]{.mark}]{.underline}. 59 Germs that depend
on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold virus, are
selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can shake
hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy
and kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from
body to body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply
(for cholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918
Spanish flu). Sexually transmitted pathogens, like HIV and syphilis, are
somewhere in between, needing a long and symptomless incubation period
during which hosts can infect their partners, after which the germs do
their damage. [[**Virulence** and **contagion**]{.underline}]{.mark}
thus **[[trade off]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [the **evolution of
germs** will **frustrate the terrorist's aspiration** to launch a
headline-worthy epidemic that is]{.underline} both [swift and
lethal]{.underline}. Theoretically, a bioterrorist could try to bend the
curve with a pathogen that is virulent, contagious, and durable enough
to survive outside bodies. But [breeding]{.underline} such [a
**fine-tuned germ** would require **Nazi-like experiments on living
humans** that even terrorists]{.underline} (to say nothing of teenagers)
[are unlikely to carry off]{.underline}. It may be more than just luck
that [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark} so far [[has seen]{.mark} just
**[one]{.mark} successful bioterror [attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the
1984 tainting of salad with salmonella in an Oregon town by the
Rajneeshee religious cult, **[[which killed no
one]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and one spree killing (the 2001 anthrax
mailings, which killed five).60 To be sure, advances in synthetic
biology, such as the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, make it easier
to tinker with organisms, including pathogens. But [[it's difficult
to]{.mark} re-[engineer a complex]{.mark} evolved [trait by]{.mark}
inserting **[a gene]{.mark} or two**]{.underline}, since the effects of
any gene are intertwined with the rest of the organism's genome. [Ewald
notes, ["**I don't think**]{.mark} **that [we are]{.mark} close** to
understanding how to insert combinations of genetic variants in any
given pathogen that act in concert to generate high transmissibility and
stably high virulence for humans."]{.underline}61 The biotech expert
Robert Carlson adds that "one of the problems with building any flu
virus is that you need to keep your production system (cells or eggs)
alive long enough to make a useful quantity of something that is trying
to kill that production system. . . . Booting up the resulting virus is
still very, very difficult. . . . I would not dismiss this threat
completely, but frankly I am much more worried about what Mother Nature
is throwing at us all the time."62 And crucially, [[advances]{.mark} in
biology work the other way as well: they]{.underline} also [[make it
easier for]{.mark} the good guys \[[public
protectors]{.mark}\]]{.underline} (and there are many more of them) [[to
identify]{.mark} pathogens, [invent antibiotics that overcome]{.mark}
**[a]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic **[r]{.mark}**esistance,
[and]{.mark} **rapidly [develop vaccines]{.mark}**]{.underline}.63 [An
example is]{.underline} the [Ebola]{.underline} vaccine, developed in
the waning days of the 2014--15 emergency, after public health efforts
had capped the toll at twelve thousand deaths rather than the millions
that the media had foreseen. Ebola thus joined a list of other falsely
predicted pandemics such as Lassa fever, hantavirus, SARS, mad cow
disease, bird flu, and swine flu.64 Some of them never had the potential
to go pandemic in the first place because they are contracted from
animals or food rather than in an exponential tree of person-to-person
infections. Others were nipped by medical and public health
interventions. Of course no one knows for sure whether an evil genius
will someday overcome the world's defenses and loose a plague upon the
world for fun, vengeance, or a sacred cause. But [[journalistic habits
and]{.mark} the [Availability and Negativity]{.mark} biases
**[inflate]{.mark} the [odds]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is why I have
taken Sir Martin up on his bet. By the time you read this you may know
who has won.65

### Biosafety 

#### No engineered bioweapons -- can't reliably engineer pathogen characteristics -- tradeoffs mean the more virulent a pathogen, the [less effective]{.underline} it is

that [synth]{.mark}etic [bio]{.mark}logy [could]{.mark} be used to
[enhance]{.mark} the [virulence]{.mark}]{.underline}** or increase the
transmissibility **[of known pathogens]{.underline}**, creating novel
threat agents.

**[Mousepox and [bird flu]{.mark}]{.underline}** (H5N1) experiments
**[[are]{.mark} frequently [cited]{.mark}]{.underline}** to demonstrate
how dangerous new pathogens could be designed. But assessments of this
threat tend to overlook a salient fact: **[In both these
experiments]{.underline}**, **[the [researchers did not actually design
the pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With respect to H5N1, researchers
had indeed been trying to design an air-transmissible virus variant for
some time, without success. The ferret experiment was set up as an
alternative approach, to see whether natural mutations could generate an
air-transmissible variant. **[The [researchers had no influence
on]{.mark} the specific [mutations]{.mark} induced]{.underline}**. In
the mousepox experiment, researchers inserted the gene for interleukin-4
into the mousepox virus to induce infertility in mice and serve as an
infectious contraceptive for pest control. The result---that the altered
virus was lethal to mice---was unanticipated by the researchers. In
other words, it was not planned.

Moreover, some of **[the [key lessons]{.mark} that came out of the
extensive Soviet program to weaponize biological agents [involve]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** **[[trade-offs between improving
characteristics]{.mark} that are "[desired" in]{.mark} the context of a
[bioweapons]{.mark} program]{.underline}**---such as virulence---**[[and
diminishing]{.mark} other [equally "desired"
characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[such as transmissibility or
stability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[Pleiotropic
effects]{.underline}**---that is, **[when a single gene affects more
than one characteristic]{.underline}**---**[and genetic instability are
common in microorganisms]{.underline}**. While it is too simple to say
that **[increased transmissibility will]{.underline}** always **[be
associated with reduced virulence]{.underline}**, this is often the case
**[for strains produced in laboratories]{.underline}**.

and administrative hurdles]{.underline}**]{.mark}:

I. [**[Re-creating]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[n
already existing dangerous [virus]{.mark} for malicious intent is
a]{.underline}** **[complex]{.underline}** scientific
**[endeavor]{.underline}**. (i) **[It [requires
considerable]{.mark}]{.underline}** scientific
**[[knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}** and experience **[[and]{.mark},
more importantly, considerable [financial support]{.mark}. That support
usually comes from government and private agencies]{.underline}** (NIH,
NAF, etc.), organizations **[that carefully screen at multiple levels
all applications for funding of ALL biological research]{.underline}**.
(ii) **[It requires an]{.underline}** **[environment]{.underline}**
**[suitable for experimenting with dangerous infectious
agents]{.underline}** (**[containment]{.underline}**
**[facilities]{.underline}**). **[Any work in containment facilities is
also carefully regulated.]{.underline}**

II\. **[Genetic engineering]{.underline}** to synthesize or modify
organisms **[relies on chemical synthesis of DNA. [Synthesizing DNA
is]{.mark} automated and [carried out with]{.mark} sophisticated,
[expensive instruments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The major
problem]{.underline}** of DNA synthesis, however, **[is that [the
product is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[not error-free.
Any]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[single [mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the sequence of small DNA segments (30--60 nucleotides) or large
segments (\>500 nucleotides) [**[can]{.underline}** **[ruin the

strategies]{.mark} to produce and [deliver error free]{.mark}, synthetic
[DNA]{.mark}, which investigators can order

a]{.underline}** superb and **[easy way to]{.underline}**
**[control]{.underline}** experimental **[procedures]{.underline}**
**[carried out in any laboratory]{.underline}**: the
**[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark}** will **[[automatically scan ordered

relationship to sequences of a]{.underline}** **[select agent. If so,
the order will be]{.underline}** **[stalled]{.underline}** until
sufficient evidence has been provided by the investigator that she/he is
carrying out experiments approved by the authorities. The entire complex
issue of protecting society from the misuse of select agents has been
discussed in two outstanding studies \[11, 12\].

III\. **[Engineering a virus such that it will be]{.underline}**
**[more]{.underline}** **[harmful]{.underline}** (more contagious, more
pathogenic) **[is generally difficult because, in principle,
[viruses]{.mark} have [evolve]{.mark}d [to proliferat]{.mark}ing

[manipulations]{.mark} of a virus often [lead to loss of fitness]{.mark}

### Food 

#### No food wars

It is perhaps surprising, then, that [there is [**little scholarly
merit**]{.mark} in the notion [that a]{.mark} short-term
[reduction]{.mark} in access to **[food increases]{.mark} the
[probability]{.mark} that [conflict]{.mark}** will [break
out.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is because [[to start]{.mark} or
participate in violent [conflict requires]{.mark} people to have both
the [means and]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}. Most [people on the **brink of
starvation are not in the position to resort**]{.mark} **to violence**,
whether against the government or other social groups]{.underline}. In
fact, [the urban middle classes tend to be the most likely to protest
against rises in food prices, since they often have the best
opportunities, the most energy, and the best skills to coordinate and
participate in protests.]{.underline}

Accordingly, [there is a **[widespread misapprehension]{.mark}** that
[social unrest in periods of high]{.mark} food [prices relates]{.mark}
primarily [to]{.mark} food [shortages]{.mark}]{.underline}. In reality,
the [[sources of discontent are]{.mark} considerably **[more
complex]{.mark}** -- linked to [**political structures**,
**land**]{.mark} ownership, **[corruption]{.mark}**, the desire for
[**democratic reforms** and]{.mark} general **[economic
problems]{.mark}** -- where the price of food is seen in the context of

that while the international media have a tendency to seek simple
resource-related explanations -- such as drought or famine -- for
conflicts in the Global South, debates in the local media are permeated
by more complex political relationships.

2\. [[Methodological **issues**]{.mark} relating to food **prices** and
political **instability**]{.underline}

Countries that are affected by food shortages tend to be prone to
conflict, violence or instability. Nineteen countries that the Food and
Agricultural Organisation (FAO) classifies as being in a protracted food
crisis are also affected by conflict and violence (Martin-Shields &
Stojets, 2018). Thus, [[scholars have **pondered**]{.mark} about [the
**relationship** between]{.mark} the [**availability** of food and
**probability** of conflict]{.mark}, **especially** after 2008 when the
media reported on many food related **protests** in
low-and-middle-income **countries**]{.underline} (Van Weezel, 2016).
Furthermore, Smith (2014, p. 679) states that "Dramatic weather events,
diversion of crops for fuel production, and continuing volatility in
international grain markets have led many to postulate that urban food
riots will become more frequent, pervasive and disruptive in the
future."

There is a body of literature which argues that grievances (or relative
deprivation) lead to incentives for conflict. Literature in this vein
argues that rising food prices increase the propensity for protests and
food riots. Young men in particular may join rebel groups to gain access
to food (Brinkman & Hendrix, 2011, Raleigh et al., 2015). However,
[[finding]{.mark} the **[ev]{.mark}**idence to **support** these
assertions [is **difficult**]{.mark} [because]{.mark} the
[relationship]{.mark} between food prices (as an indicator of the
**availability** or **accessibility** of food) and **conflict**
[is]{.mark} both [**complex** and **influenced** by]{.mark} many [other
**factors**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smith 2014, van Weezel, 2016,
Martin-Shields & Stojets, 2018). Therefore, [[it becomes
difficult]{.mark} [to find]{.mark} evidence of [causal linkages between
**food**]{.mark} prices [and **conflict**]{.mark}. Moreover, the
**[ev]{.mark}**idence [may be **contradictory**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This section explores the [methodological issues]{.underline} that [make
the interaction between food prices and political instability difficult
to **conceptualize** and **assess**.]{.underline}

[[Endogeneity challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}

[It is difficult to **study** the causal link between **food prices**
and **political instability** because they are **endogenous** and there
is **limited ev**idence]{.underline}. According to Martin-Shields &
Stojets (2018) [there are two key sources of endogeneity, which are (1)
[**unobserved confounding factors** and]{.mark} (2) **[reverse
causality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Confounding factors are strongly
correlated with both food insecurity and conflict. For example, [there
is much evidence which **suggests** that national income is negatively
**correlated** with violent conflict and positively correlated with food
security. Likewise, state capacity is also related to violence and food
security]{.underline}. [[Reverse causality occurs when it is
**difficult** to ascertain the]{.mark} [**direction** of]{.mark} the
**[causal links]{.mark}**: does food insecurity exacerbate **conflict**
or does conflict **contribute** to **food insecurity**?]{.underline} (De
Winne & Peersman, 2021; Raleigh et al., 2015). [Some scholars have dealt
with reverse causality by focusing their analysis on international food
prices. They argue that **international food prices** are **unlikely**
to be unaffected by local **conflicts** and as such there is less need
for **concern** about endogeneity]{.underline}. However, it is still
possible that [[global food]{.mark} prices can [be **confounded** by
**variables** such as]{.mark} global [**economic activity** or **oil
prices**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smith, 2014). Some quantitative studies
address endogeneity by including fixed effects or instrumental variables
in models, but De Winne and Peersman (2021) are not convinced that this
approach eliminates endogeneity.

### Environment

#### Biodiversity loss won't cause extinction

**Kareiva and Carranza 18** -- Peter, Ph.D. in ecology and applied
mathematics from Cornell University, director of the Institute of the
Environment and Sustainability at UCLA.Valerie, Ph.D. Candidate at
"Existential risk due to ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back",
Futures, Vol. 102, Pg. 39-50,
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.001>, 01-05-2018

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. **[One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich,
2012), with the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than
0.001% per year (Rockström et al., 2009). **[There is little evidence
that this particular 0.001% annual loss is a
threshold]{.underline}**---**[and it is hard to imagine any data that
would allow one to identify where the threshold was]{.underline}**
(Brook, Ellis, Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams,
2013). A better question is whether one can imagine any scenario by
which the loss of too many species leads to the collapse of societies
and environmental disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute
number of extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

**[While [there are data that relate local reductions in species
richness]{.mark} to altered ecosystem function, [these results do not
point to]{.mark} substantial [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The **[data are small-scale experiments in which plant productivity, or
nutrient retention is reduced as species numbers decline
locally]{.underline}** (Vellend, 2017), or are local observations of
increased variability in fisheries yield when stock diversity is lost
(Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those are not existential
risks]{.underline}**. **[To make the link even more tenuous, [there is
little ev]{.mark}idence that [biod]{.mark}iversity [is]{.mark} even
[declining at local scales]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Vellend et al., 2013,
Vellend et al., 2017). **[Total [planetary biod]{.mark}iversity [may be
in decline, but local]{.mark} and regional [biod]{.mark}iversity [is
often staying the same because species from elsewhere replace]{.mark}
local [losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, albeit homogenizing the world in
the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists are likely
to flinch at this conclusion, **[there is growing skepticism regarding
the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss to an
existential risk for humans]{.underline}** (Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014).
**[Obviously [if all biod]{.mark}iversity [disappeared civilization
would end]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[but no one is forecasting]{.mark}
the loss of [all species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It seems plausible that
the loss of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but
not one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic,
but plausible is the possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as
many as half of its species. **[If global biodiversity were halved, but
at the same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable,
what would be the mechanism for an end-of-civilization or even end of
human prosperity scenario?]{.underline}** **[Extinctions and
[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss are ethical]{.mark} and spiritual
[losses]{.mark}, but perhaps [not an existential
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**No environment extinction**

climate change and more. He is also the author of Life is Good:

destruction lead to a global tipping point?",

**[Just over [250 million years ago]{.mark}, [the planet
suffered]{.mark}]{.underline}** what may be described as its greatest
~~holocaust~~ \[mass death\]: ninety-six percent of marine genera
(plural of genus) and seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for
good. Even insects suffered a **[[mass extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals -- like
trilobites -- went out like a match in the wind.

But **[what's arguably most fascinating about this event -- known as the
Permian-Triassic extinction]{.underline}** or more poetically, the Great
Dying -- **[is the fact that anything survived at all.
[Life]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it seems, **[[is]{.mark} so ridiculously
[adaptable]{.mark} that not only did [thousands of species make it
through]{.mark} whatever killed off nearly everything]{.underline}** (no
one knows for certain though theories abound) **[but, somehow, after
millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new
tales.]{.underline}**

Even as **[[the Permian]{.mark}-Triassic
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** event shows the fragility of life, it
also **[[proves its resilience]{.mark} in the long-term]{.underline}**.
**[The lessons of such mass extinctions -- five to date and arguably a
sixth happening as I write -- inform science today]{.underline}**.
**[Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000]{.underline}** (some
even say 10,000**[) times the background rate, researchers have long
worried about our current destruction of biodiversity -- and what that
may mean for our future Earth and ourselves]{.underline}**.

In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for
the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an
uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include
climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes,
biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the
terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it "biosphere
integrity," but that hasn't spared it from critique.

A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked
the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

["**[It makes no sense that there exists a tipping
point]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of biodiversity loss beyond which the
Earth will collapse]{.underline}**," **[said co-author and ecologist,
José Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. "There is no
rationale for this."]{.underline}**

Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity
College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world's leading experts
on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.

Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that **[[there isn't evidence]{.mark} of
a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally
or even locally. If the planet didn't collapse after the
Permian-Triassic extinction event, [it won't collapse
now]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- though our descendants may well curse us
for the damage we've done.

Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But
**[the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden
plunge.]{.underline}** **[[Ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according
to them, **[slowly degrade but [never fail
outright]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"**[[Of]{.mark} more than [600 experiments]{.mark} of biodiversity
effects on various functions, [none showed a
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Montoya said. "In general, the loss of
species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions\...We
progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass,
and many other important functions as we lose species. But **[we never
observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions
collapse."]{.underline}**

### Climate

#### Warming [won't]{.underline} be catastrophic

**Zycher 21** -- Dr. Benjamin, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, Doctorate in Economics from UCLA, Master in Public Policy
from the University of California, Berkeley, and Bachelor of Arts in
Political Science from UCLA, Former Senior Economist at the RAND
Corporation, Former Adjunct Professor of Economics at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and at the California State University

Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. "The Case for Climate
Change Realism", AEI,
<https://www.aei.org/articles/the-case-for-climate-change-realism/>,
06-21-2021

Unable to demonstrate that observed climate trends are due to
anthropogenic climate change --- or even that these events are
particularly unusual or concerning --- **[climate
catastrophists]{.underline}** will often **[turn to [dire
predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}** about prospective climate phenomena.
**[The problem]{.underline}** with such predictions **[is]{.underline}**
that **[they [are]{.mark} almost always [generated by]{.mark} climate
[models driven by highly complex]{.mark} sets of [assumptions]{.mark}
about which there is significant dispute. Worse, these models are
[notorious for failing]{.mark} to accurately predict already documented
changes in climate]{.underline}**. As climatologist Patrick Michaels of
the Competitive Enterprise Institute notes:

**[[During all periods]{.underline}]{.mark}** from 10 years (2006-2015)
to 65 (1951-2015) years in length, **[the [observed temp]{.mark}erature
trend [lies in the]{.mark} lower half of]{.underline}** the collection
of **[climate model simulations, and for several periods it lies very
close]{.underline}** (or even below) **[the [2.5th percentile]{.mark} of
all the model runs]{.underline}**. Over shorter periods, such as the
last two decades, a plethora of mechanisms have been put forth to
explain the observed/modeled divergence, but none do so completely and
many of the explanations are inconsistent with each other.

Similarly, climatologist John Christy of the University of Alabama in
Huntsville observes that **[almost [all]{.mark} of the 102 climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline}** incorporated into the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) --- a tracking effort conducted by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory --- **[[overstate]{.mark} past
and current temperature [trends by a factor of]{.mark} two to
[three]{.mark}, and at times even more]{.underline}**. It seems
axiomatic to say **[we should not rely on climate models]{.underline}**
that are unable to predict the past or the present to make predictions
about the distant future.

The overall temperature trend is not the only parameter the models
predict poorly. As an example, **[every]{.underline}** CMIP **[climate
model predicts that increases in atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gas should create an enhanced heating effect
in]{.underline}** the mid-troposphere **[over the
tropics]{.underline}** --- that is, at an altitude over the tropics of
about 30,000-40,000 feet. The underlying climatology is simple: Most of
the tropics is ocean, and as increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations
warm the Earth slightly, there should be an increase in the evaporation
of ocean water in this region. When the water vapor rises into the
mid-troposphere, it condenses, releasing heat. And **[yet]{.underline}**
the **[satellites cannot find this heating effect --- a reality
suggesting that our understanding of climate and atmospheric phenomena
is not as robust as many seem to assume]{.underline}**.

**[The [poor]{.mark} predictive [record]{.mark} of mainstream climate
models [is exacerbated by]{.mark} the [tendency]{.mark} of the IPCC and
U.S. government agencies [to assume]{.mark} highly [unrealistic]{.mark}
future [increases]{.mark} in greenhouse-gas
concentrations]{.underline}**. The IPCC's 2014 Fifth Assessment Report,
for example, uses four alternative "representative concentration
pathways" to outline scenarios of increased greenhouse-gas
concentrations yielding anthropogenic warming. These scenarios are known
as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. Since 1950, the average annual
increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations has been about 1.6 parts per
million. The average annual increase from 1985 to 2019 was about 1.9
parts per million, and from 2000 to 2019, it was about 2.2 parts per
million. The largest increase that occurred was about 3.4 parts per
million in 2016. But the assumed average annual increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations through 2100 under the four RCPs are 1.1,
3.0, 5.5, and an astounding 11.9 parts per million, respectively.

The studies generating the most alarmist predictions are the IPCC's
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C and the U.S. government's
Fourth National Climate Assessment, both of which were published in
2018. Both assume RCP8.5 as the scenario most relevant for policy
planning. **[The [average]{.mark}]{.underline}** annual
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse-**[g]{.underline}**as
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** under RCP8.5 **[[is]{.mark} over
[five times]{.mark} the [annual]{.mark} average]{.underline}** for
2000-2019 **[and almost four times the single biggest increase on
record]{.underline}**. Climatologist Judith Curry, formerly of the
Georgia Institute of Technology, describes such a scenario as
**[["borderline impossible."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**Even if everyone stopped all emissions today it wouldn't solve
warming**

### China

#### No US-China war.

**Krulak and Friedman 21** -- Charles C, a retired four-star general, is
a former commandant of the US Marine Corps and former president of
Birmingham-Southern College. Alex, co-founder of Jackson Hole Economics
and a former chief financial officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation. "The US and China Are Not Destined for War", Project

First and foremost, any [military conflict]{.underline} between the two
[would quickly turn **nuc**lear]{.underline}. The US thus finds itself
in the same situation that it was in vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. Taiwan
could easily become this century's tripwire, just as the "Fulda Gap" in
Germany was during the Cold War. But the same dynamic of
"[**[m]{.mark}**utual **[a]{.mark}**ssured
**[d]{.mark}**estruction"]{.underline} that limited US-Soviet conflict
**[[applies to the US and China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [the
[international community]{.mark} would do everything]{.underline} in its
power [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that a potential
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear [conflict did not
materialize]{.mark},]{.underline} [given]{.underline} that [the
consequences]{.underline} would be fundamentally transnational and --
unlike climate change -- immediate.

A **[US-China [conflict]{.mark} would]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[[take the form of a proxy war]{.mark}, rather than a major-power
confrontation]{.underline}**. [Each]{.underline} superpower [might take
a different side in a domestic conflict]{.underline} in a country such
as Pakistan, Venezuela, Iran, or North Korea, [and
[deploy]{.mark}]{.underline} some combination of [[economic, cyber, and
diplomatic instruments]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have seen this type of
conflict many times before: from Vietnam to Bosnia, the US faced
surrogates rather than its principal foe.

Second, it is important to remember that, historically, **[[China plays
a long game]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although Chinese military power has
grown dramatically, [it]{.underline} still [[lags behind the US
on]{.mark} almost [every measure]{.mark} that matters]{.underline}. And
while China is investing heavily in [[asymmetric
equalizers]{.underline}]{.mark} (long-range anti-ship and hypersonic
missiles, military applications of cyber, and more), it [[will not
match]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[conventional means]{.underline}]{.mark} such as aircraft and large
ships [for decades, if ever.]{.underline}

A [[head-to-head conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} with the US
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[be **too dangerous for
China**]{.mark} to countenance at its current stage of
development]{.underline}. If such a conflict did occur, China would have
few options but to let the nuclear genie out of the bottle. In thinking
about baseline scenarios, therefore, we should give less weight to any
scenario in which the Chinese consciously precipitate a military
confrontation with America. The US military, however, tends to plan for
worst-case scenarios and is currently focused on a potential direct
conflict with China -- a fixation with overtones of the US-Soviet
dynamic.

This raises the risk of being blindsided by other threats. Time and
again since the Korean War, asymmetric threats have proven the most
problematic to national security. Building a force that can handle the
worst-case scenario does not guarantee success across the spectrum of
warfare.

The third reason to think that a Sino-American conflict can be avoided
is that [China is already [chalking up victories in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} global [[soft-power]{.mark} war]{.underline}.
Notwithstanding accusations that COVID-19 escaped from a virology lab in
Wuhan, [China]{.underline} has [[emerged from the pandemic
looking]{.underline}]{.mark} much [[better than the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [with]{.underline} its [**B**elt and
**R**oad **I**nitiative]{.underline} to finance infrastructure
development around the world, [it]{.underline} has [aggressively stepped
into the void left by US retrenchment]{.underline} during Donald Trump's
four-year presidency. **[China's [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** may
very well **[look at the]{.underline}** current [**s**tatus **quo**
**and [conclude]{.mark}**]{.underline} that **[[they are on the
right]{.mark}]{.underline}** strategic **[[path]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Finally, **[[China and the US are deeply intertwined]{.mark}
economically]{.underline}**. Despite Trump's trade war, Sino-American
bilateral trade in 2020 was around \$650 billion, and [China was
[America's largest]{.mark} [trade partner]{.mark}]{.underline}. The two
countries' [[supply-chain linkages are vast]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[China holds more]{.mark} than \$1 trillion in US
[Treasuries]{.mark}]{.underline}, most of [[which it cannot]{.mark}
easily [unload]{.mark}]{.underline}, lest it reduce their value and
incur massive losses.

To be sure, logic can be undermined by a single act and its unintended
consequences. Something as simple as a miscommunication can escalate a
proxy war into an interstate conflagration. And as the situations in
Afghanistan and Iraq show, America's track record in war-torn countries
is not encouraging. China, meanwhile, has dramatically stepped up its
foreign interventions. Between its expansionist mentality, its growing
foreign-aid program, and rising nationalism at home, China could all too
easily launch a foreign intervention that might threaten US interests.

Cyber mischief, in particular, could undercut conventional military
command-and-control systems, forcing leaders into bad decisions if more
traditional options are no longer on the table. And Sino-American
economic ties may come to matter less than they used to, especially as
China moves from an export-led growth model to one based on domestic
consumption, and as two-way investment flows decline amid escalating
bilateral tensions.

[A "[mistake]{.mark}"]{.underline} on the part of either country
[[is]{.mark} always [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is why
**[[diplomacy is essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Each country needs to
determine its vital national interests vis-à-vis the other, and both
need to consider the same question from the other's perspective. For
example, it may be hard to accept (and unpopular to say), but civil
rights within China might not be a vital US national interest. By the
same token, China should understand that the US does indeed have vital
interests in Taiwan.

By comparison, **[today's [China is]{.mark} a [remarkably
responsible]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[nation on the geopolitical and
military front. [It has not gone to war]{.mark} since]{.underline}**
**[19[79]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It has not used lethal military
force abroad since 1988]{.underline}**. **[[Nor]{.mark} has it
[funded]{.mark} or supported [proxies or]{.mark} armed
[insurgents]{.mark} [anywhere]{.mark} in the world since the early
1980s]{.underline}**. **[[That record]{.mark} of nonintervention [is
unique]{.mark} among the world's great powers]{.underline}**. All the
other permanent members of the UN Security Council have used force many
times in many places over the last few decades---a list led, of course,
by the United States.

**[China has also gone from seeking to undermine the international
system to spending large sums to bolster it.]{.underline}** **[[Beijing
is]{.mark} now [the second-largest funder]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited
[N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}** **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the UN
[peacekeeping]{.mark} program. It has deployed 2,500 peacekeepers, more
than all the other permanent members]{.underline}** of the Security
Council **[combined]{.underline}**. **[Between 2000 and 2018, [it
supported 182 of 190]{.mark} Security Council [resolutions]{.mark}
imposing sanctions [on]{.mark} nations deemed to have violated
international [rules or norms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Granted, the
principles anchoring Beijing's foreign policy today---"respect for
sovereignty," "territorial integrity," and "nonintervention"---are
animated in large part by a desire to fend off Western interference. Yet
**[[they highlight]{.mark} a remarkable shift from a radical agenda of
revolution to a conservative concern for
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Had someone predicted in 1972 that
China would become a guardian of the international status quo, few would
have believed it possible.]{.underline}**

TRADING PLACES The new consensus on China's economic behavior holds that
China has forced multinational companies to transfer their technology,
has subsidized its "national champions," and has placed formal and
informal barriers in the path of foreign firms seeking to enter its
market. Beijing has, in short, used the open international economy to
bolster its own statist and mercantilist system. It is true that these
unfair policies demand attention and action from the rest of the world.
The Trump administration deserves some credit for tackling this
problem---especially in light of Xi's embrace of statism after decades
of liberalization. But how large and permanent is this reversal? How
different are China's practices from those of other emerging market
countries today? And again, what is the right American response?

Almost all economists agree that China owes much of its economic success
to three fundamental factors: the switch from communist economics to a
more market-based approach, a high savings rate that makes possible
large capital investments, and rising productivity. Over the last three
decades, the country has also opened itself up substantially to foreign
investment---more so than many other large emerging markets---allowing
capital to pour in. China is one of only two developing countries to
have ranked in the top 25 markets for foreign direct investment since
1998. Of the BRICS group of large emerging markets (which includes
Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), **[[China is]{.mark}
consistently ranked as [the most open and competitive
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[As for the effect of mercantilist
Chinese policies]{.underline}** on the U.S. economy, former U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has noted that "**[it cannot be
argued seriously that unfair Chinese [trade]{.mark} [practices]{.mark}
have [affected U.S. growth by]{.mark} even]{.underline}** **[[0.1
percent]{.mark} a year]{.underline}**."

It is worth noting that on the economic front, almost every charge
leveled at China today---**[forced [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**
**[[transfers]{.mark}, unfair trade practices, limited access for
foreign firms, regulatory favoritism for locals---[was]{.mark} leveled
at [Japan in the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[19[80s]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and 1990s. At the time, Clyde Prestowitz's influential book Trading
Places: How America Is Surrendering Its Future to Japan and How to Win
It Back explained that the United States had never imagined dealing with
a country in which "industry and trade \[would be\] organized as part of
an effort to achieve specific national goals." Another widely read book
of the era was titled The Coming War With Japan. As Japanese growth
tapered off, so did these exaggerated fears.

China today presents some new challenges, especially given Xi's
determination to have the state play a leading role in helping the
country gain economic dominance in crucial sectors. But in the broad
sweep of history, China's greatest advantage in the global trading
system has come not from its willingness to violate the rules but from
its sheer size. Countries and companies want access to China and are
willing to make concessions to get it. This hardly makes China unusual.
Other countries with similar clout often get away with similar behavior
or worse---none more so than the United States. A 2015 report by the
financial services giant Credit Suisse provides a useful tally of
nontariff barriers against foreign goods put in place by major countries
between 1990 and 2013. With a total count of almost 450, the United
States is in a league of its own. Next is India, then Russia. China
comes in at number five, with one-third as many nontariff barriers
imposed as the United States. The picture hasn't changed much in the
years since.

Most of the recent changes in Beijing's economic policy have been
negative, but even that is not the entire story. China is changing along
several, sometimes contradictory lines. **[Even with the return to
greater state control under Xi,]{.underline}** **[[a wild free market
has flourished]{.mark} in vast spheres such as consumer goods and
services. [There has]{.mark} also [been]{.mark} some real regulatory
liberalization]{.underline}**---**[even [administrative]{.mark} [and
judicial reform]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as the political scientist Yuen
Yuen Ang has detailed. **[Government support for state-owned enterprises
is greater than it was a few years ago, but Beijing has abandoned what
was once a central part of its mercantilist strategy: using an
undervalued currency to boost growth]{.underline}**. The economist
Nicholas Lardy has calculated that the end of currency mercantilism
accounts for "about half of China's growth slowdown since the global
financial crisis."

Or consider what is, according to Peter Navarro, U.S. President Donald
Trump's top trade adviser, issue number one in the United States' trade
dispute with China: "the theft of our intellectual property." That China
engages in rampant theft of intellectual property is a widely accepted
fact---except among U.S. companies doing business in China. In a recent
survey of such companies conducted by the U.S.-China Business Council,
intellectual property protection ranked sixth on a list of pressing
concerns, down from number two in 2014. These companies worry more about
state funding for rival companies and delayed approval of licenses for
their products. Why this shift from 2014? That year, China created its
first specialized courts to handle intellectual property cases. In 2015,
foreign plaintiffs brought 63 cases in the Beijing Intellectual Property
Court. The court ruled for the foreign firms in all 63. Of course,
reforms such as these are often undertaken only in the face of Western
pressure and, even then, because they serve China's own competitive
interests---the largest filer of patents worldwide last year was the
Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. But it is also true that many
Chinese economists and senior policymakers have argued that the country
will modernize and grow its economy only if it pursues further reform.
Failure to do so, they have warned, will get the country stuck in the
"middle-income trap"---the common fate of countries that escape poverty
but hit a wall at a GDP of around \$10,000 per capita, having failed to
modernize their economic, regulatory, and legal systems any further. As
far as China's political development is concerned, the verdict is
unambiguous. China has not opened up its politics to the extent that
many anticipated; it has in fact moved toward greater repression and
control. Beijing's gruesome treatment of the Uighurs in Xinjiang, a
region in northwestern China, has created a human rights crisis. The
state has also begun to use new technologies, such as facial recognition
software and artificial intelligence, to create an Orwellian system of
social control. These realities are a tragedy for the Chinese people and
an obstacle to the country's participation in global leadership. It
would be an exaggeration, however, to adduce them as proof of the
failure of U.S. policy. In truth, few U.S. officials ever argued that
engagement would lead inexorably to liberal democracy in China. They
hoped that it would, even expected it, but their focus was always on
moderating China's external behavior, which they achieved. CROSSING THE
LINE Under Xi, China's foreign policy has become more ambitious and
assertive, from its pursuit of leadership roles in UN agencies to the
vast Belt and Road Initiative and the construction of islands in the
South China Sea. These moves mark a break with the country's erstwhile
passivity on the global stage, captured by the former Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping's adage "Hide your strength, bide your time." China's
military buildup, in particular, has been of a size and designed in a
manner that suggest that a long-term plan is being systematically
executed. But what would an acceptable level of influence for China be,
given its economic weight in the world? If Washington does not first ask
this question, it cannot make serious claims about which uses of Chinese
power cross the line. China is, by some measures, already the world's
largest economy. Within ten to 15 years, it will probably take this spot
by all measures. Deng offered his advice to "bide your time" when the
country's economy represented roughly one percent of global GDP. Today,
it represents over 15 percent. China has indeed bided its time, and now,
a much stronger China naturally seeks a larger regional and global role.

**[Consider the case of another country that was rising in strength,
this one back in the nineteenth century, although not nearly on the
scale of China today.]{.underline}** The United States in 1823 was what
would now be called a developing country---not even among the world's
top five economies---and yet with the Monroe Doctrine, it declared the
entire Western Hemisphere off-limits to the great powers of Europe. The
American case is an imperfect analogy, but it serves as a reminder that
as countries gain economic strength, they seek greater control and
influence over their environment. **[[If Washington defines]{.mark}
every such effort by [China as dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[it
will be]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[setting the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[up against the
natural dynamics of international life and [falling]{.mark}
[into]{.mark}]{.underline}** what **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** scholar
Graham Allison has called "the **[[Thucydides
trap]{.underline}]{.mark}**"---**[the danger of a war between a rising
power and an anxious hegemon.]{.underline}**

For the United States, dealing with such a competitor is a new and
unique challenge. Since 1945, the major states rising to wealth and
prominence have been Washington's closest allies, if not quasi
protectorates: Germany, Japan, and South Korea. A normally disruptive
feature of international life---rising new powers---has thus been
extraordinarily benign for the United States. China, however, is not
only much larger than the rising powers that came before; it has also
always been outside the United States' alliance structures and sphere of
influence. As a result, it will inevitably seek a greater measure of
independent influence. The challenge for the United States, and the West
at large, will be to define a tolerable range for China's growing
influence and accommodate it---so as to have credibility when Beijing's
actions cross the line. So far, the West's track record on adapting to
China's rise has been poor. Both the United States and Europe have, for
example, been reluctant to cede any ground to China in the core
institutions of global economic governance, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, which remain Euro-American clubs. For
years, China sought a larger role in the Asian Development Bank, but the
United States resisted. As a result, in 2015, Beijing created its own
multilateral financial institution, the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank (which Washington opposed, fruitlessly). Pompeo has asserted---in a
patronizing statement that would surely infuriate any Chinese
citizen---that the United States and its allies must keep China in "its
proper place." China's sin, according to Pompeo, is that it spends more
on its military than it needs to for its own defense. But the same, of
course, could be said of the United States---and of France, Russia, the
United Kingdom, and most other large countries. In fact, a useful
definition of a great power is one that is concerned about more than
just its own security. The old order---in which small European countries
act as global heavyweights while behemoths such as China and India are
excluded from the first ranks of global institutions---cannot be
sustained. China will have to be given a place at the table and
genuinely integrated into the structures of decision-making, or it will
freelance and unilaterally create its own new structures and systems.
China's ascension to global power is the most significant new factor in
the international system in centuries. It must be recognized as such.
NEITHER LIBERAL NOR INTERNATIONAL NOR ORDERLY

**[To many, [Beijing's rise]{.mark} has [sounded the death knell of
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[l]{.mark}iberal]{.underline}**
**[[i]{.mark}nternational]{.underline}**
**[[o]{.mark}rder]{.underline}**---the set of policies and institutions,
forged largely by the United States after World War II, that compose a
rules-based system in which interstate war has waned while free trade
and human rights have flourished. **[China's domestic political
character---a one-party state that brooks no opposition or dissent---and
some of its international actions make it an uneasy player in this
system]{.underline}**.

**[It is]{.underline}**, however, **[worth remembering that [the]{.mark}
liberal international [order was never as
liberal]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} as
[**[international]{.underline}**, **[or]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[as]{.underline}** **[[orderly]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[as it is now
nostalgically described]{.underline}**. From the very beginning,
**[[it]{.mark} [faced]{.mark} vociferous opposition from [the Soviet
Union]{.mark}]{.underline}**, followed by a series of
**[[breakdowns]{.mark} of cooperation [among
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** (**[over]{.underline}** the
**[Suez]{.underline}** crisis in 1956, over **[Vietnam]{.underline}** a
decade later) **[and]{.underline}** the partial defection of the United
States under **[[Nixon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[who]{.underline}** in
1971 **[[ended]{.mark} Washington's practice of underwriting [the
international monetary order]{.mark} using U.S. gold
reserves]{.underline}**. A more realistic image is that of a nascent
liberal international order, marred from the start by exceptions,
discord, and fragility. [**[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**, for
its part, **[often [operated outside the rules]{.mark} of this order,
making frequent military interventions with or without UN approval;
in]{.underline}** the years between 1947 and 1989, when the United
States was supposedly building up the liberal international order, **[it
[attempted regime change]{.mark} around the world [72
times]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It reserved the same right in the
economic realm, engaging in protectionism even as it railed against more
modest measures adopted by other countries.]{.underline}**

**[The]{.underline}** truth about the **[liberal international
order]{.underline}**, as with all such concepts, is that
**[there]{.underline}** **[never really was a golden age, but neither
has the order decayed]{.underline}** **[as much as people
claim.]{.underline}** [**[The]{.underline}**
**[core]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[attributes]{.underline}** of this
order---**[peace and stability---[are still in place, with a marked
decline in war and annexation]{.mark}]{.underline}** since 1945.
(Russia's behavior in Ukraine is an important exception.) **[In economic
terms, it is a free-trade world]{.underline}**. **[Average
[tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}** among industrialized countries
**[[are]{.mark} below three percent]{.underline}**,
**[[down]{.underline}]{.mark}** from **[15]{.underline}** percent before
the Kennedy Round of international trade talks, **[in the
1960s]{.underline}**. The last decade has seen backsliding on some
measures of globalization but from an extremely high baseline.
Globalization since 1990 could be described as having moved three steps
forward and only one step back.

[**[China hardly qualifies as a]{.underline}** **[mortal
danger]{.underline}**]{.mark} to this imperfect order. **[Compare its
actions to those of Russia]{.underline}**---**[a country
that]{.underline}** in many arenas simply **[acts as a
spoiler]{.underline}**, **[trying to disrupt the Western democratic
world]{.underline}** and its international objectives, often
**[benefiting directly from instability]{.underline}** **[because it
raises oil prices]{.underline}** (the Kremlin's largest source of
wealth). **[China]{.underline}** plays no such role. When it does bend
the rules and, say, engages in cyberwarfare, it steals military and
economic secrets rather than trying to delegitimize democratic elections
in the United States or Europe. Beijing fears dissent and opposition and
is especially neuralgic on the issues of **[[Hong Kong and
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, using its economic clout to censor
Western companies unless they toe the party line. But these **[[are
attempts to]{.mark} [preserve]{.mark} what Beijing views as its
[sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}**---nothing like Moscow's systematic
efforts to disrupt and delegitimize Western democracy in Canada, the
United States, and Europe. In short, **[[China]{.mark} has
[acted]{.mark} in ways that are [interventionist]{.mark}, mercantilist,
and unilateral---but often far [less]{.mark} so [than other great
powers]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The rise of a one-party state that continues to reject core concepts of
human rights presents a challenge. In certain areas, Beijing's
repressive policies do threaten elements of the liberal international
order, such as its efforts to water down global human rights standards
and its behavior in the South China Sea and other parts of its "near
abroad." Those cases need to be examined honestly. In the former, little
can be said to mitigate the charge. China is keen on defining away its
egregious human rights abuses, and that agenda should be exposed and
resisted. (The Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the UN
Human Rights Council achieved the exact opposite by ceding the field to
Beijing.)

But **[[the]{.mark} liberal international [order has been able to
accommodate]{.mark} itself to a variety of
regimes]{.underline}**---**[from]{.underline}**
**[[Nigeria]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[to]{.underline}**
**[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**
**[[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[and still provide]{.mark} a
rules-based framework that encourages greater
[peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[stability]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[civilized conduct]{.underline}** among states.
**[China's size and policies present a new challenge to the expansion of
human rights that has largely taken place since 1990]{.underline}**. But
**[that one area of potential [regression should not be viewed as a
mortal threat]{.mark} to the much larger project of a rules-based, open,
free-trading international system.]{.underline}**

#### China-Russia alliance and it won't be hostile

**Aron 19** -- Dr. Leon, Resident Scholar and Director of Russian
Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, Ph.D. in Political
Sociology and M.A in Media Sociology from Columbia University, B.A. from
Moscow State Pedagogical Institute. "Are Russia and China Really Forming
an Alliance?", Foreign Affairs,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-04-04/are-russia-and-china-really-forming-alliance>,
04-04-2019

In March of 1969, Chinese troops ambushed and killed a Soviet border
patrol on an island near the Chinese-Russian border. Fighting on and
near the island lasted for months and ended with hundreds of casualties.
Fifty years later, the ferocity of the skirmish between Mao Zedong's
China and Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union seems to belong to a very
distant past---so distant, indeed, that **[[many]{.mark} foreign-policy
experts [are convinced]{.mark} that [an anti-U.S. alliance]{.mark}
between the two countries is [emerging. Yet]{.mark}]{.underline}** even
half a century on, **[such an assessment stretches the evidence beyond
what it can bear. [On]{.mark} closer [inspection]{.mark},
Chinese-Russian economic, foreign policy, and military
[coop]{.mark}eration [is less]{.mark} than [impressive]{.mark}. The
history of relations between the two countries is fraught, and they
[play]{.mark} vastly [different roles]{.mark} in the world economy,
[making]{.mark} a [divergence]{.mark} in their objectives all but
[unavoidable]{.mark}. In short, [reports]{.mark} of a Russian-Chinese
alliance have [been]{.mark} greatly [exaggerated]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

THE ECONOMIC REALITY

**[Economic relations]{.underline}** between Russia and China **[are
rapidly expanding]{.underline}**, and some experts have cited these ties
as evidence of a growing closeness between the two countries. Indeed,
just last year, bilateral trade increased by at least 15 percent
compared to 2017 and reached a record \$100 billion. **[Yet asymmetries
in the scale and structure of bilateral commerce suggest
caution]{.underline}**: although China is Russia's second-largest
trading partner (after the EU) and Russia's largest individual partner
in both exports and imports, for China the Russian market is at best
second-rate. Russia ranks tenth in Chinese exports and does not make it
into the top ten in either imports or total trade.

**[The structure of]{.underline}** the **[[trade
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** similarly **[[skewed]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
More than three-quarters of Russia's exports to China are raw materials,
specifically crude oil, wood, and coal. China's sales to Russia are 45
percent consumer goods and 38 percent electronics and machinery. The
completion this year of the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline will
further widen the disparity by facilitating the export of \$400 billion
worth of Russian raw materials to China over the next 30 years. The
nature of this exchange corresponds quite closely to Karl Marx's and
Vladimir Lenin's description of colonial trade, in which one country
becomes a raw material appendage of another. It is rare for metropolises
to ally themselves with their colonies.

Russia's and China's **[efforts at joint economic development and
investment do not look much like cooperation between]{.underline}** two
**[eager allies]{.underline}**. Even after Moscow's so-called pivot to
the east, spurred by post-Crimea sanctions, from 2014 through 2018 China
directly invested no more than \$24 billion into its northern neighbor's
economy. During the same period, China invested \$148 billion in
sub-Saharan Africa (including \$31 billion in Nigeria alone), and \$88
billion in South America (including \$34 billion just in Brazil). Or
consider the Program of Cooperation in the regions of Far East, Russian
Eastern Siberia, and Chinese North-East in 2009--2018, signed in 2009 by
Chinese President Hu Jintao and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The
initiative included 91 joint investment projects. Six years into the
program, China had financed only 11 of these, while the rest were
delayed, in the words of the Carnegie Moscow Center's Ivan Zuenko, by
"bureaucratic hassles."

**[China's parsimony is evident in both the private and public sectors.
A much-heralded plan for the CEFC China Energy company to purchase a 14
percent stake in Russia's largest]{.underline}**, and majority
state-owned, **[oil company,]{.underline}** Rosneft, **[fell through. So
did a Chinese]{.underline}** government **[pledge to
invest]{.underline}** \$25 billion **[in the Power of Siberia
pipeline]{.underline}**, which cost Russia \$55 billion. Moscow has
celebrated its projected annual delivery of 38 billion cubic meters of
natural gas to China via Power of Siberia as a big step toward economic
interdependence. But to China, the pipeline is no more than a
diversification of the country's energy sources. In 2017, it imported
over 90 billion cubic meters of natural gas, mostly from Australia,
Qatar, and Turkmenistan.

A FOREIGN POLICY MISMATCH

**[[Russia and China are hardly]{.mark} any [closer in foreign
policy]{.mark} than they are in trade]{.underline}**. To be sure, the
two countries stand together in their declared opposition to U.S.
primacy in world affairs. Both advocate a multipolar world and swear to
resist the perceived threat of U.S. intrusion into their spheres of
influence. Beijing and Moscow also see eye to eye with respect to the
threat posed to their regimes by what they see as U.S.-inspired, if not
U.S.-engineered, pro-democracy "color revolutions." They vote almost in
unison at the United Nations.

Yet **[away from the global limelight]{.underline}** and closer to their
shared Eurasian home, **[the two]{.underline}** countries **[are hardly
aligned. [They poach]{.mark} in [each other's s]{.mark}pheres
[o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence, [contest]{.mark} each other's [clients,
and reach fo]{.mark}r each other's economic and geopolitical
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[China]{.mark} has [failed to support]{.mark} Russia [in matters of
great]{.mark} geopolitical [importance]{.mark} to Moscow. Beijing
refused to recognize]{.underline}** the independence of **[Abkhazia and
South Ossetia after the Russian-[Georgia]{.mark}n war]{.underline}** in
2008. **[It abstained from]{.underline}**, instead of voting against,
**[the UN resolution condemning Russia's]{.underline}** 2014 **[seizure
of [Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In another symbolic display that
could not have pleased Moscow, President Xi Jinping chose to inaugurate
the 2013 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Astana, the capital of
Kazakhstan. By choosing to flex Chinese power in the largest of the
former Soviet Central Asian republics---the one that shares the world's
second-longest border with Russia, at 4,250 miles, and is home to the
greatest proportion of ethnic Russians in Central Asia---Xi flagrantly
intruded on Russia's sphere of influence. (A year later, Putin mused
about the fragility of Kazakhstan's statehood during a question and
answer session at Russia's National Youth Forum.) Xi and Putin later
agreed to "coordinat\[e\] cooperation" between the Russia-led Eurasian
Economic Union and Belt and Road. But although some of the subsequent
Chinese- and Kazakh-led infrastructure projects have been completed,
many Russian-led projects have stalled due to financing and negotiation
problems.

For its part, Russia periodically flirts with China's foe, Japan, by
dangling the return of the four Kuril Islands, which the Soviet Union
seized from Japan at the end of World War II and which remain the main
obstacle to a peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo. In the latest round
of that game, during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit this past January
to Moscow, Putin, yet again, held out the possibility of normalizing
relations by giving Japan back at least two of the islands, a gesture
that Beijing likely resented, even though it did not lead to a
breakthrough. Russia also exposed tensions with China within the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization---an international body founded by
Moscow and Beijing to promote economic and security cooperation among
its members---when it invited another Chinese rival, India, to join the
group. China tied the score by inviting India's archrival (and the
largest customer for Chinese weapons), Pakistan, to join.

Chinese-Russian military cooperation in particular is often held up as
evidence of a growing closeness. Much has been made of the fact that
Russia has sold China the latest version of its most advanced
antiaircraft S-400 missile defense system. But India, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, and Turkey are next in line for the same equipment. And although
China was the first to buy Russia's most advanced Su-35 jet fighter, it
will not be the last. Indonesia has contracted for 11 jets, Egypt has
purchased dozens more, and India has reportedly considered buying 114
jets. Overall, from 2013 to 2017, India was a far likelier destination
for Russian defense hardware than China, with 35 percent of Russian arms
exports going to New Delhi, compared with 12 percent to Beijing.

Last year's first joint Russian-Chinese land exercise, Vostok-2018,
pointed to an imbalance in military cooperation not unlike the one in
the two countries' bilateral trade. Russia fielded between 75,000 and
100,000 soldiers and 1,000 aircraft; China contributed just 3,200
soldiers and six planes. Mathieu Boulègue of Chatham House argued that
China was invited to participate not so much to bolster an alliance as
to allay any Chinese concerns about the demonstration of force so close
to its borders.

Indeed, the need for strengthening mutual trust between the putative
allies was evident three years before Vostok-2018, during the Kremlin's
search for Internet policing technology. Following a series of
high-level internal consultations, the Kremlin decided to buy data
storage and servers from the telecom giant Huawei. Then, suddenly, the
deal was off. The security services became so alarmed by the likelihood
of Chinese espionage that they dared to challenge the Kremlin's
decision---and, even more surprisingly, managed to reverse it.

THE PUTIN-XI BROMANCE

In the end, the most promising portent of an alliance might be the
personal relationship between the rulers of the two countries. The
Putin-Xi bonhomie extends beyond surface pleasantries. They have met
more than 25 times, far more frequently than either has with any other
head of state. Xi recently called Putin his "best friend," and his first
visit as president was to Moscow. Putin has extolled his relations with
Xi as the finest personal rapport he has with a foreign leader and
fondly recalled celebrating his sixty-first birthday with Xi, over
slices of sausage and shots of vodka, during the Asian-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in Bali in 2013. Xi presented Putin with China's very
first Order of Friendship, designed to reward foreigners who contributed
"personally to the PRC's cooperation with the world community." Putin
hung a gold chain of the Order of St. Andrew, Russia's highest civilian
award, on Xi's neck.

Sustained mutual affinities between the leaders of great powers almost
always reflect not only overlap in geopolitical objectives but regime
similarities. Both Putin and Xi preside over versions of state
capitalism. Putin's attraction to Xi is not hard to fathom: the Chinese
leader is a fellow authoritarian who controls an enormous economy, which
even in today's downturn posts rates of growth of which Russia can only
dream of. And China does this even while importing huge quantities of
oil and gas.

Xi's alleged respect for Putin likely stems from the Russian president's
deft defusing of several potentially explosive domestic political
problems similar to ones Xi himself has faced. After taking office,
Putin recentralized power within the Russian state, taming the oligarchs
and wiping out the political strongholds of elected governors and
presidents. Then, early in Putin's third term in 2012, as he faced bleak
economic prospects and rapidly declining approval ratings, he rejected
the liberalizing reforms that his minister of finance suggested.
Instead, Putin began to shift the foundation of his regime's legitimacy
from economic progress and income growth to the Kremlin as a defender of
Russia against U.S. aggression and restorer of its past glory as a
global superpower---a formula that the leading Russian political
sociologist Igor Klyamkin has labeled "militarized patriotism."

Concomitantly, Putin cracked down on public displays of dissent, called
for the "patriotic upbringing of the youth," and further intimidated
civil society by signing a law designating many NGOs as "foreign
agents," rendering them social pariahs subject to harassment by the
security and tax authorities. He made the Orthodox Church the guardian
of national mores, and he personally guided the politicization of
history textbooks, which began to whitewash the Soviet experience and
rehabilitate Stalin.

On the road to his own chairmanship---and presidency for life---Xi has
reprised Putin's choices, in spirit if not always letter. He
concentrated policymaking in the office of the party chairman, broke the
baronies of regional party secretaries, and instigated a widespread
"anti-corruption" campaign aimed at eliminating, or intimidating,
potential critics and rivals. He abolished the de facto term limits for
top party and government positions and tightened controls over media and
book publishing.

As Chinese growth rates began to decline, Xi, like his "best friend,"
spurned pro-market reforms and instead opted for his own version of
Putin's militarized patriotism: the reassertion of the Communist Party's
supremacy, the merger of "core socialist values" with "traditions of
Chinese culture," and a war on "spiritual pollution" that has led to
heightened repression in Tibet and Xinjiang.

Similarly, "national rejuvenation" and the pursuit of the "Chinese
dream" became central to the regime's foreign policy discourse. In Xi's
words, China was facing "the most complicated ... external factors in
\[its\] history." Admiral Sun Jianguo, a deputy chief of the General
Staff of the People's Liberation Army, described these factors as
"invasion, subversion," "undermining ... stability," and "interrupting
socialist development." Much as Putin had done, Xi transformed his
country's foreign policy from assertive to aggressively expansionist.
The Chinese leader has militarized territorial disputes in the South and
East China Seas and fortified Chinese-constructed artificial island
chains with missile batteries and aircraft bases.

STILL PREMATURE

**[Putin's and Xi's kinship]{.underline}** is real and formidable, but
**[even it may not be enough to overcome the obstacles to a genuine
alliance. One such [obstacle is]{.mark}]{.underline}** aptly described
by a Russian expression, "istoriya s geografiey." Literally **["a
history with geography,"]{.underline}** the collocation refers to a
seemingly straightforward matter suddenly turned into something involved
and complicated. **[[History and geography]{.mark} militate against an
entente cordiale between the two Eurasian giants. [Authoritarian states
sharing]{.mark} a 2,600-mile [border]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with much
of that boundary first imposed by imperial Russia on a weaker neighbor,
**[[are hardly ideal]{.mark}ly set up [to]{.mark} build mutual
[trust]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Reinforcing that barrier are very significant [structural differences
between]{.mark} the two countries' [economies]{.mark}, which [result
in]{.mark} their holding [divergent stakes]{.mark} in the present world
economic order. Confined largely to]{.underline}** exporting **[oil and
gas, Russia's integration]{.underline}** in the world economy
**[is]{.underline}** at once quite **[secure and quite
limited]{.underline}**. Moscow can afford to rock the boat and to seek
from Beijing a pointedly anti-Western, active, and committed
military-political partnership.

**[China's economy]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[is the world's
second largest]{.underline}**---more than seven times the size of
Russia's---with exports that include advanced communication
technologies, cell phones, computers, and cars. The country's **[trade
with the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and the
E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion **[comes
to]{.underline}** at least five **[times the value of its Russian
account. Because of]{.underline}** its **[greater
interdependence]{.underline}** with other leading world economies,
**[[China's]{.mark} system is]{.underline}** also **[far [more
vulnerable]{.mark} to]{.underline}** geopolitical
**[disruptions]{.underline}** than Russia's. And as a greater
beneficiary of the liberal international economic order than Russia,
**[China is warier of antagonizing]{.underline}** that order's ultimate
guarantor, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
Skillfully promoted optics notwithstanding, **[[China is not likely to
follow]{.mark} Russia [into an anti-Western]{.mark} geopolitical
[crusade, preferring to cooperate]{.mark} with its alleged ally [on
a]{.mark} more [modest scale]{.mark}]{.underline}** economically and
especially militarily.

When I was living in Moscow in the fall of 1969, a rumor circulated
that, returning from Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh's funeral, Chairman
of the Council of Ministers Alexei Kosygin stopped over in the Beijing
airport for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai. When the
Chinese premier moved to embrace him, Kosygin drew back, saying, "Тhis
is premature."

Apocryphal or not, Kosygin's injunction seems applicable today.
**[[Despite claims]{.mark} to the contrary, the notion of [a]{.mark}
Chinese-Russian [alliance is]{.mark} still
[premature]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### CRBN

#### No bio or chemical weapon threat

**Revill 17** -- Dr. James, Research Fellow with the Harvard Sussex
Program at SPRU. "Past as Prologue? The Risk of Adoption of Chemical and
Biological Weapons by Non-State Actors in the EU", Cambridge, pg.
626-642,

The second factor is "the perceived complexity of the innovation in
terms of adoption and use".40 This is important in the innovation
literature, as Rogers remarked, "**[\[t\]he [complexity of]{.mark} an
[innovation]{.mark},]{.underline}** as perceived by members of a social
system, **[[is negatively related to its rate of
adoption]{.underline}]{.mark}**".41 Several **[scholars of terrorist
innovation have also highlighted the issue of
complexity]{.underline}**;42 or, as Cragin et al have stated, "\[h\]ow
simple or complex a technology appears affects perceptions of how risky
it will be to adopt."43

**[In [most]{.mark} cases [terrorist groups]{.mark} appear to have
largely [opted for the simplest pathway]{.mark} towards the achievement
of their goals and]{.underline}** **[the weapons used tend to be
vernacular, functional devices [drawing on local and readily-available
materials, rather than sophisticated]{.mark}, "baroque"
[technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is certainly the case with
IEDs, the history of which is characterised largely by incremental
innovations -- although nevertheless frequently effective ones -- with
many means of delivery recycled from the past.44 Complexity can
therefore be seen as important in the adoption of technology by
terrorists generally, but is perhaps particularly acute in the case of
CBW technology.

Some CBW can be relatively simple: "chlorine-augmented, vehicle-borne
IEDs," as employed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) from 2006 to 2007 are not
sophisticated weapons.45 Attacks on chemical production facilities, an
apparent tactic of Serbian forces in the early to mid-1990s,46 employed
relatively simple technologies -- specifically explosives -- with
toxicity a secondary by-product. Direct contamination of food,47 drink48
or healthcare products49 does not require particularly sophisticated
technology for the purposes of delivery -- although may require some
considerable skill to culture and scale-up a biological agent -- and has
been a common approach in European CBW incidents.50 Similarly, the
contamination of water systems, something familiar to Europe,51 can also
be relatively easily attempted. However, in most cases such methods of
dissemination have generated results that are far short of the "mass
destruction" that CBW are associated with, although this does not mean
such a possibility can be ignored by those working on public health
preparedness.

Although some relatively simple approaches could cause significant harm,
**[[mass casualty attacks]{.mark} still [require considerable
expertise]{.mark}, something [particularly]{.mark} acute [in the context
of bio]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.52 **[The most
effective route to weaponising biology is arguably]{.underline}**
through the process of **[[aerosolising]{.mark} agents]{.underline}**,
something recognised mid-way through the last century as opening up the
theoretical possibility of using biological weapons on a gigantic
scale.53

However, **[realising such theoretical potential [is difficult]{.mark}
and [it took states decades to develop]{.mark} more [predictable
biological weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}**s,54 **[and [even then such
weapons were acutely vulnerable to environmental
factors]{.mark}]{.underline}**.55 **[[For non-state groups such
complexity has proven a significant barrier]{.mark} to CBW
development]{.underline}**. By means of an example, **[one of the
best-resourced biological weapons programs]{.underline}**, that of
**[Aum Shinrikyo, failed variously because the group acquired the wrong
strain, contaminated fermenters and were faced with insurmountable
production and dissemination difficulties]{.underline}**.56 **[There are
of course exceptions, such as the 2001 [anthrax]{.mark} Letter
Attacks]{.underline}** in the US. However, **[if one accepts the
conclusions of the FBI that this sophisticated attack]{.underline}**
with aerosolised anthrax in the US postal system **[was perpetrated by a
US biodefence researcher, Dr]{.underline}** Bruce
**[Ivins,]{.underline}**57 **[it [is an exception that proves the
rule]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[To circumvent]{.underline}** the difficulties with **[aerosolisation,
arguably one could use [human-to-human
transmissible]{.mark}]{.underline}** biological agents as part of a
suicide bioterror operation. There are good reasons for concern over how
crude suicide bioterrorists could employ such a tactic. **[However, the
use of highly contagious agents [is]{.mark} also [poorly
predictable]{.mark} and would have to deal with social factors, such as
the "spatial contact process among individuals"]{.underline}**, which
can spell "out the difference between large-scale epidemics and abortive
ones".58

**[The counter to this argument is the growing access to data and the
changing human geography of the life sciences]{.underline}**. Some 83%
of European households reportedly **[are [online]{.mark}, effectively
allowing access to what is a growing body of available data on CBW,
including so-called bioterrorist "[recipes" and
"blueprints]{.mark}]{.underline}**" that are available in both
mainstream scientific as well as more subversive literatures online. It
is also clear that there is a changing human geography in European life
sciences (for peaceful purposes), with the emergence of 30 DIY-bio
groups located in Europe59 and some 80 European teams in the
international Genetically Engineered Machines (IGEM) competition in
2016.60 **[This is compounded by reports that groups such as Daesh have
deliberately sought to recruit foreign fighters "including some with
degrees in physics, chemistry, and computer science]{.underline}**, who
experts believe have the ability to manufacture lethal weapons from raw
substances".61

Whilst it would be unwise to ignore such developments, **[[there is a
need for caution in looking at the extent to which new
tech]{.mark}nologies [and geographies]{.mark} will [facilitate]{.mark}
the [adoption of chemical and bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** by groups seeking to target European
countries. First, **[[data is not information, and info]{.mark}rmation
[is not knowledge]{.mark}, let alone the tacit knowledge [required for
CBW]{.mark}]{.underline}**.62 In many cases **[a degree of determination
and dedication will be required merely to separate online fantasy from
fact and identify operationally useful information]{.underline}** (of
relevance to the European context) from nonsense (or information
pertinent to contexts other than Europe). Second, with new technologies
there is the potential for such tools to enable some, but certainly not
all, actors, and **[[even then new technologies bring]{.mark} new
[challenges. CRISPR]{.mark}, gene editing technology]{.underline}** is
currently seen as a particular source of promise and peril, **[which
purportedly enables "even largely untrained people to manipulate the
very essence of life]{.underline}**".63 As much may be technically true,
**[yet "untrained people" would nonetheless [require]{.mark} some
[guidance in identifying suitable areas of genetic]{.mark} [structures
to manipulate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[CRISPR [would only
get aspiring weaponeers so far]{.mark}, with the process of culturing,
scaling-up and weaponisation [still requiring considerable attention and
interdisciplinary skills]{.mark}, typically generated through "large
interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, and
technicians]{.underline}**",64 **[in order [to be
effective]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Indeed, **[for all the progress in science and technology, biological
weapons are still not used, in part, because of the complexity of such
weapons]{.underline}**; and the chemical weapons that are used today are
largely the same as the chemical weapons of 100 years ago. As Robinson
noted "It remains the case today that, in the design of CBW,
increasingly severe technological constraint sets in as the
mass-destruction end of the spectrum is approached: **[the greater and
more assured the area-effectiveness sought for the weapon, the greater
the practical difficulties of achieving]{.underline}** it".65

The events required to make that happen comprise a multitude of
Herculean tasks. First, **[a terrorist group has to get a bomb or
fissile material,]{.underline}** perhaps from Russia\'s inventory of
decommissioned warheads. **[[If that were easy, one would have already
gone missing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Besides, **[[those devices
are]{.underline}]{.mark}** probably **[[no longer a danger, since
weapons]{.mark} that are [not scrupulously maintained]{.mark} (as those
have not been) [quickly become]{.mark} what one expert calls

[[Expanded investments in **bilateral** global health security

Agenda and to accelerate the implementation of U.S. Global Health
Security Strategy, the U.S. government will expand the number of global
health security intensive support partner countries by eight this year,
including to three new regions. This [[will improve countries'
capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to future COVID-19 variants
and future health threats]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Expanding dose donation types to include boosters and pediatric doses to

Pfizer dose donation commitment. This [[will help accelerate progress
towards the 70% vaccination target]{.underline}]{.mark} and expand the
availability of doses available [[for those at highest
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} and for children globally.

Improving guidance for vaccine development to enhance protection. The
United States, through the FDA, is committing to help align global
health authorities and the WHO to provide advice to COVID-19 vaccine
producers to inform which strains they use as the basis for vaccines,
using predictions about the predominance of future strains and which
strains will lead to vaccines that provide the broadest protection
against unknown future variants.

Financing facility for COVID-19 vaccine and [[ancillary supply purchases
and delivery through the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. International
Development Finance Corporation ([[DFC]{.underline}]{.mark}). DFC has
set up a vehicle to provide up to \$1 billion to Gavi, the Vaccine
Alliance, to provide bridge financing guaranteeing commitments from
other donors. This [[will allow COVAX to react immediately in a crisis
to purchase and deliver ancillary supplies and
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark} on behalf of developing countries
participating in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment.

Advancing COVID-19 vaccine research and development through the
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). At least \$50
million of the U.S. Government's recent \$150 million, 3-year pledge to
CEPI will support COVID-19 vaccine research in addition to the
development of other vaccines and countermeasures for future emerging
infectious diseases, with the goals of making vaccines more broadly
protective and easier to administer in low-resource settings.

Despite these commitments to combat COVID-19 and enhance future
preparedness against health threats, [[there is more work to be done to
ensure the United States can continue to lead]{.underline}]{.mark}, to
make Americans and the world safer. President
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} [[continues to urge Congress to act
promptly to provide supplemental resources]{.underline}]{.mark}. Without
additional emergency funding, the United States will be unable to
purchase additional life-saving treatments for the American people. The
United States will be less able to stop the spread of possible new
variants from around the world. The United States will be unable to keep
vaccinating the world against COVID-19 and getting shots into arms, to
save lives here at home and abroad.

### Politics Link

#### Panviral is politically contentious -- CEPI solves and avoids the problem

Jennifer **Kahn** 4-21-20**20** UC Berkeley Graduate School of
Journalism "How Scientists Could Stop the Next Pandemic Before It
Starts" New York Times Magazine
<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/magazine/pandemic-vaccine.html>
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

[[Governments]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[have been reluctant to
fund panviral development]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[both because it's
expensive and because the rewards can feel remote, especially as many
diseases originate in other countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. "We don't
prevent well; we respond well," Daszak notes. "[[Remember when Obama got
\$5 billion for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and U.S. troops went
to help fix the problem? That's heroic]{.underline}]{.mark}. How heroic
is it, [[three years **before** Ebola]{.underline}]{.mark}, to say,
'We're going to fund a massive program in West Africa to help these poor
countries get ready in case an outbreak happens?' [[He'd be laughed out
of the room]{.underline}]{.mark}!"

Global nonprofits like the Gates Foundation have tried to step into this
funding void. The foundation has supported GAVI, an international
alliance that helps vaccinate children in poor countries and spearheaded
a fund to fight H.I.V., tuberculosis and malaria worldwide. Mark Suzman,
the chief executive of the Gates Foundation, says that when governments
and companies do pull together, the focus is often on projects like
these rather than "forward-looking" issues like pandemics or climate
change. One exception, he says, has been CEPI, the Coalition for
Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an NGO that was founded in 2017 to
coordinate and finance the development of new vaccines for diseases that
might lead to a pandemic. When it started, Suzman told me, CEPI was a
low-profile project: "It was really a response to the Ebola epidemic of
2014 and 2015. Now, of course, it looks incredibly farsighted."

CEPI works by identifying the most promising research, and then
connecting it to industry and government resources, in order to bring
multiple sets of "candidate" vaccines through initial clinical trials.
The goal is to create a stockpile of potential treatments for known
coronaviruses, hemorrhagic fevers and other global threats that could
quickly go into production in the event of an epidemic. Daszak noted
that CEPI is running a trial for a vaccine against Nipah virus, a
zoonotic virus --- one that exists in animals but can infect people ---
which can cause acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. "This
is the classic example," Daszak says. "So far, there have been only a
few outbreaks, so the market is minuscule: a few thousand people a year
get it, in Malaysia or Bangladesh. But it infects a wide range of
animals, and that means it's likely to keep crossing over into people.
And if it ever broke out, it could be a pandemic with very lethal
consequences."

The group also funds technologies aimed at "Disease X" (the potentially
pandemic viruses that we have yet to discover) with the goal of faster
vaccine development should a totally new threat emerge. As Jake
Glanville, whose company, Distributed Bio, received a grant from Gates
Foundation to create a universal flu vaccine, told me, "This is how we
win the forever war, and not just battles against these pathogens."

CEPI isn't the only group trying to find solutions to the drug and
vaccine problems. In the United States, a federally funded university
collective called the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Center
(AD3C) was created in 2014, with the goal of developing drugs for
influenza, flaviviruses (including West Nile), coronaviruses and
alphaviruses. Like CEPI, AD3C partners with pharmaceutical companies but
focuses on salvaging and reformulating promising drugs that might be
valuable but that the company isn't interested in pursuing. (When Gilead
discovered that remdesivir worked on coronaviruses, for instance, the
treatment was routed to AD3C, which enlisted scientists at Vanderbilt
University and the University of North Carolina to repurpose it.)

3.2. Stage 1: Achieving Consensus on a General Global Governance
Framework with

Open-Ended Principles

[[The first links of the experimental governance model is to invite as
many stakeholders as possible to participate in the discussion, to
construct an authoritative international platform for the discussion, to
set an open-ended principle, and to form a legally binding
agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Biological Weapons Convention of the
United Nations is an open-ended model platform. It can establish
communication among countries, and create opportunities for other
non-state actors to participate in discussions through the mechanism of
experts' meetings, side events and best practice sharing in order to
systematically monitor and review developments in science and
technology. We believe that for the risk of dual-use biotechnology, all
stakeholders need to reach a consensus on three principles: (1) risk
communication, (2) process transparency, and (3) subjectivity.

First, all States Parties should regard multi-party risk communication
as the basic principle of governance. The National Research Council of
the U.S. defines "risk communication" as an "interactive process in
which individuals, groups, and institutions exchange information and
ideas" \[51\]. Risk communication plays an important role in resolving
conflicts caused by differing perceptions, as [[there is generally
disagreement among the public, government officials, scientists and
industries about the nature and severity of risks]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[52\]. [[Under the **media rendering** of dual-use biotechnology in
animal soldiers, genetic weapons, and super soldiers, the public become
**fearful** of these artificial creatures as "unknown, frightening,
uncontrollable, catastrophic and may affect future generations." Due to
this **bias**, politicians and the public tend to pay more attention to
the risk of bioterrorism than to other kinds of
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} \[53\]. [[Therefore, it is essential to
strengthen and extend contact and communication among biotechnologist,
policy makers, social scientists and the public]{.underline}]{.mark}.

3.3. Stage 2: Countries Take Actions Based on Local Conditions Led by
the General Global

Governance Framework

[[Under the framework of the above-mentioned
principles]{.underline}]{.mark} and objectives, the [[experimentalist
governance model requires that **grassroot** practitioner should be
provided with the power to act in accordance with **local
conditions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We believe that [[in view of the
characteristics of dual-use biotechnology risks, **different countries**
need to]{.underline}]{.mark} promote three aspects of [[work according
to their **actual** conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

First, it is important to seek a dynamic balance between "hard law" and
"soft law". Facing the dual-use risk of biotechnology, [[countries need
to find a dynamic balance between "hard law" and "soft law". Soft law
consists of democratic, open, universal and normative rules through the
participation of stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} to regulate the
social relations in biosafety governance, including its guidelines,
codes, standards, and norms. It is therefore necessary to protect social
and public interests, encourage scientific and technological research
and industrial innovation, and ensure that the development of dual-use
biotechnology is in accordance with the law and regulations. [[Due to
the difficulty to meeting the demands for legal adjustment of new social
contradictions caused by the dual-use risk of biotechnology by simply
creating high legislative costs alone]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
existence of complicated biological safety risks, no country has a
panoramic understanding of the possible consequences of such risks, and
some hidden dangers of such risks are far from being fully exposed. It
will be increasingly difficult to supervise biotechnology as it gains
momentum, as it is necessary to keep up with biotechnology through soft
law, improving governance efficiency through "easily adjustable and
easily controlled" mechanisms, and forming a policy reserve of national
governance rules. Noticeably, integrating hard and soft law to create a
prevention network needs a dynamic adjustment mechanism \[54\]. The most
valuable, promising results of dual-use biotechnology are often produced
in the early stage of research. Therefore, application of soft law, such
as a code of conduct and professional rules, should initially
predominate. As new technologies are being industrialized, regulation
through hard law should be strengthened.

Second, [[to develop a dynamic consultant mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark}
with multi-stakeholders [[in accordance with **specific** national
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, the governance of emerging technologies
should be the final outcome of interactions of socio-political
management [[under the **collective consultation** of social
actors]{.underline}]{.mark} \[55\]. This interactive mechanism should
balance and coordinate the views and propositions between scientists and
other stakeholders, thus deepening trust and integration. At the same
time, biotechnologist can be encouraged to discuss issues such as social
risk, which will be an important part of their scientific research
activities in the future \[56\]. When such interactions produce a mutual
understanding and shared vision, these biologists will form an
"autonomous network" in which several entities and regulatory agencies
will pool their social resources, intellectual expertise and interests
\[57\]. With the advancement of dual-use biotechnology, this autonomous
network must have the capability of dynamic learning and adaptive
capacity. Multi-level organizations, including government regulatory
departments, scientific research institutions, and industrial
associations should carry out popularize science to improve the public
understanding of dual-use biotechnology, enhancing enthusiasm for
participating in and supervising the development of dual-use
biotechnology. These activities can build public confidence in dual-use
biotechnology and create a social environment more conducive to its
sustained and healthy development. In short, government supervision
should mobilize social forces, promote the orderly participation in the
governance of the dual-use risk of biotechnology so that those social
forces will jointly assume responsibility, formulate the rules, minimize
risks and share in the outcome.

[[Third, to implement dynamic supervision]{.underline}]{.mark} of
hierarchical management and risk assessment according to actual needs,
[[**each** **country** should]{.underline}]{.mark} engage in
hierarchical management and [[provide dynamic supervision mechanism for
risk assessment]{.underline}]{.mark}. The idea of implementing
hierarchical management of risks in the field of biosafety has become a
common choice of major countries throughout the world yet have different
characteristics. The "Biosafety Law of the People's Republic of China"
of 2020, emphasizes that "the state implements classified management on
biotechnology research and development activities," and that
biotechnology research and development activities should be classified
into high-, mediumand low-risk categories according to the amount of
harm these activities may cause to public health, industry, agriculture,
and the environment \[58\]. The "Dual-Use Research of Concern" (DURC),
conducted by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity
(NSABB), focuses on 15 hazardous biological agents or toxins and seven
types of partial dual-use research \[2\]. Furthermore, according to a
country's own situation, it is necessary to develop risk assessment
models by means of scenario analysis for policy makers to formulate and
revise the laws and regulations \[59,60\]. In 2012, Bansak and Tucker
proposed a 3 × 3 matrix model for risk assessment of dual-use
biotechnology based on two key variables: abuse risk and controllability
(Table 1). They then divided the abuse risk variables into four types:
availability, vulnerability, potential hazard, and potential abuse
crisis. The abuse risk can be high, medium, or low. Countries can modify
the key variables of the model as needed.

Alliance Response to COVID-19

[[Most of the responsibility for maintaining the health and safety of
their armed forces lies with the member states, **not with
NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is not to say that NATO does not have
a role to play in pandemic response, and member states heavily affected
by COVID-19 quickly turned to the Alliance for assistance.

NATO established the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre
(EADRCC) in June 1998 as a "clearing-house mechanism for the
coordination of requests and offers of international assistance amongst
NATO Allies and partners."2 The EADRCC originally covered the
geographical area of 50 countries, including NATO allies and the
signatories of the Partnership for Peace. Over time, its mandate widened
to cover requests for assistance in the event of a major chemical,
biological, radiological, or nuclear incident or attack, and gradually
extended to cover the territories of NATO partners from the
Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, as well
as of other partners across the globe. Currently, the EADRCC's mandate
covers the geographical area of 70 countries.3 The EADRCC has responded
to events including Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina in the U.S., forest
fires in Israel and Latvia, Ebola in West Africa, H1N1 swine flu in
Bulgaria and Ukraine, and flooding in the Balkans.4

[[During the pandemic, the EADRCC is helping to coordinate assistance
based on requests and availability of supplies]{.underline}]{.mark},
such as Czech and Turkish relief aid to Italy and Spain, including
personal protection equipment and disinfectants.5 In April, NATO foreign
ministers directed Supreme Allied Commander Tod Wolters to help
coordinate matching requests for aid with offers of assistance, as well
as to use excess airlift capacity to ease transport of essential
supplies across borders.6 Secretary General Stoltenberg stated: "He
\[Wolters\] will also implement simplified procedures for rapid air
mobility, in coordination with Eurocontrol, using the NATO call sign for
military relief flights."7 Garamone, "NATO Takes Steps to Combat
Coronavirus." Additionally, NATO's Support and Procurement Agency
provided field hospital tents and equipment to Luxembourg to increase
capacity.8

[[NATO's Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC]{.underline}]{.mark}), "a
multinational programme that provides [[assured access to strategic
military airlift capability]{.underline}]{.mark} for its 12 member
nations,"9 was [[leveraged for pandemic response]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Examples include cargo flights from Europe to South Korea to collect
essential medical supplies for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and
Slovakia.10 In April, SAC capabilities helped to transport ICU beds to
the Dutch-controlled part of the Caribbean island Sint Maarten.11 Other
examples of Alliance responses to COVID-19 include an Italian team from
NATO's Support and Procurement Agency working with a private company
that created printed 3-D connectors to convert snorkeling masks to
ventilator masks.12 In April, the NATO Mission in Kosovo (KFOR) helped
to transport gowns, masks, and sanitizers to North and South Mitrovica
in Kosovo.13

[[In addition to NATO facilitation, allies have banded together to
assist one another during the pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Poland and
Albania sent doctors to Italy, the German air force helped to transport
patients from France and Italy to German hospitals for treatment,
Germany donated ventilators to the U.K., the United States donated
medical supplies to Italy, and Estonia donated masks and disinfectant to
Spain and Italy, to name several examples.14

Governments across the alliance have called upon their militaries to
assist with civilian mitigation and pandemic response. A few of the
myriad examples include French armed forces helping to set up additional
capacity in the form of a field hospital,15 with the French air force
even flying some patient transfers.16 In the United States, two U.S.
Navy hospital ships, the USNS Comfort and the USNS Mercy, docked in New
York and Los Angeles to alleviate hospital overcrowding.17

Responding to Pandemics

[[While most of the responsibility for responding to pandemics lies with
individual member states, NATO does have a role to
play]{.underline}]{.mark}---both [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} supporting
member state [[mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark} measures, [[as well
as]{.underline}]{.mark} ensuring the [[readiness]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Alliance forces and responding to the opportunism of adversaries. When
considering its role in responding to pandemics, [[NATO
should]{.underline}]{.mark}:

[[Reaffirm the importance of individual member states keeping their
service members healthy]{.underline}]{.mark} and fit. Ensuring the
health and welfare of service members and their families is the first
essential role of any armed force. This is a responsibility solely in
the hands of the member states. However, if the member states fail at
this task there are serious consequences for the Alliance.

Help the member states to manage the crisis when appropriate. This is
where the EADRCC and NATO's SAC can play a role.

[[Maintain readiness through training]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a
military alliance, NATO's responsibility during any pandemic is to
ensure the readiness of Alliance forces to carry out combat operations
at a moment's notice. If training exercises must be canceled or
curtailed, they must be rescheduled as soon as possible. Also, virtual
training events must replace canceled real-life training.

Consider lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. NATO has
[[take]{.underline}]{.mark}n [[a leading role in helping to facilitate
the transfer of needed equipment, personnel, and
supplie]{.underline}]{.mark}s between member states. This is critically
important work that should continue during the current pandemic. NATO's
upcoming strategic review should recommend an expert review of NATO's
response to COVID-19 to assess the success and timeliness of NATO's
response, and issue recommendations to the Secretary General for
preparing for future pandemics.

[[Prepare for future waves]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the current wave
of the coronavirus pandemic is likely to abate by the summer, the
potential remains for future waves of the virus especially during the
fall and winter. Therefore, NATO should continue to prepare and plan for
additional waves, working with member states should recurring outbreaks
materialize.

Rebut and [[refute]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese and Russian
[[disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The current pandemic has
unleashed sustained efforts by both China and Russia to cast commercial
deals and opportunistic forays as altruistic aid. The Alliance must
immediately and forcefully refute and rebut the prevailing Chinese and
Russian narrative with factual evidence, while highlighting the real and
valuable role that NATO has played in pandemic response, and the true
aid and assistance that allies have provided for one another.

Conclusion

[[NATO's response to the coronavirus pandemic **thus far** has shown
that the Alliance can indeed play a positive
supporting]{.underline}]{.mark} role in helping member states respond to
health emergencies, especially in the transatlantic community. The
lessons of COVID-19 also underscore that pandemics pose a risk to the
health and safety of service members and their families, while posing a
challenge to maintaining military readiness.

NATO's Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic

[[NATO Allies stand in solidarity in response to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[Covid-19]{.underline}]{.mark} pandemic. This is an unprecedented
global challenge, which affects us all.

NATO and Allied [[military personnel **have been** supporting civilian
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} - providing military airlift, setting up
field hospitals, sharing medical expertise, [[and **helping** to develop
innovative responses]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is helping [[to save
lives]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While we continue to take all the necessary measures to protect our
armed forces, NATO's operational readiness remains undiminished. [[The
Alliance **continues to** deliver effective deterrence and defence. Our
forces remain]{.underline}]{.mark} vigilant and [[prepared to respond to
**any** threat]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Measures in place

The Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre
([[EADRCC]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is NATO's main civil emergency
response mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Centre operates on a 24/7 basis, coordinating requests and offers of
assistance. It is helping to coordinate assistance, including medical
and financial support.

In June 2020, NATO Defence Ministers decided on a new Operations Plan to
ensure that the Alliance is ready to help Allies and partners.
[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[established a NATO **Pandemic Response
Trust Fund** to enable us to quickly acquire medical supplies and
services]{.underline}]{.mark}. The NATO International Staff is managing
the NATO Pandemic Response Trust Fund.

The NATO Pandemic Response Trust Fund maintains an established stockpile
of medical equipment and supplies to be able to provide immediate relief
to Allies or partners in need. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency
(NSPA) is managing the purchase and storage of relief items for the
stockpile in the NSPA Southern Operational Centre in Taranto, Italy.
Romania has also offered to host warehousing facilities.

Several [[Allies have made donations of medical equipment to the
stockpile]{.underline}]{.mark}, including ventilators from the United
States, Hungary and Slovakia, personal protective equipment from Germany
and surface disinfectant from Latvia.

Since late last year, NATO Allies Albania, Czech Republic, Montenegro
and North Macedonia received 200 ventilators and ventilators supplies
from the stockpile. The Czech Republic received additional assistance
with the deployment of military medical personnel from the United
Kingdom and Germany. And a total of around 1, 5 Million EUR in medical
supplies is being provided to Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia.
This follows requests for assistance from the four countries to NATO's
EuroAtlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre.

Additionally, Slovakia donated and delivered four pulmonary ventilators
to North Macedonia in response to an urgent request for assistance
received in January 2021. Also partners have benefited from the Pandemic
Response Trust Fund. Medical supplies have been delivered to the
Republic of Moldova, Tunisia and Ukraine, whilst additional packages of
assistance are being provided to Bosnia and Herzegovina an Iraq.

[[Sixteen Allies have already made **financial**
contributions]{.underline}]{.mark} to the NATO Pandemic Response Trust
Fund, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} Albania, Belgium, the Czech
Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Slovakia, Turkey, the United
Kingdom and [[the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\",\" Brookings Institution (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, for the first time in its
history NATO had to face an attack against each of its member states at
once. [[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} the backdrop of [[political
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} within the alliance in the past few years,
[[there were not many reasons to be optimistic about NATO's
response]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially at a moment when
trans-Atlantic allies were failing to coordinate on travel restrictions
and competing over supplies of medical equipment. [[In spite of this,
NATO was able to leverage its experience in crisis management and
disaster relief]{.underline}]{.mark} to provide two kinds of responses.

[[First, NATO focused on ensuring the continuity of its operations while
protecting its personnel, to prevent the health crisis from impacting
readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most NATO missions were preserved, but
some encountered temporary suspensions. Military drillings were
redesigned, including the U.S.-led NATO exercise DEFENDER-Europe 20, to
prevent further spread of the virus through movement of ground troops.
In addition, NATO's public diplomacy branch multiplied efforts to
counter disinformation from China and Russia.

[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, amidst a low point for international
cooperation, [[NATO set up a COVID-19 Task Force aimed at coordinating
the delivery of medical aid across and beyond the territory of the
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such actions, although performed through
the means of NATO member states and relatively limited in scope, were an
important testimony of the reactive capability of the alliance and of
solidarity between member states. Yet, it is reasonable to imagine that
more could have been done if the organization did not have to overcome
political tensions across the Atlantic, and member states had cooperated
from the beginning under the leadership of NATO's strongest member.

From this experience NATO could draw important lessons, from improving
resilience to external threats to investing in readiness for
catastrophic scenarios like a global pandemic. The fact that COVID-19
will continue disrupting the global economy and supply chains will have
a negative impact on countries' defense spending and defense industries.
However, [[given the resilience the alliance has shown so far, COVID-19
will **not** be the **determining factor** for the future of NATO.
Instead, the chances for NATO to operate efficiently vis-à-vis growing
global challenges will ultimately depend on a **relaunch of
transAtlantic relations**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### SQ solves resilience - exercises

**NATO**, 6-17-20**22**, North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_132722.htm, \"Resilience and
civil preparedness -- Article 3 ,\" NATO (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

[[Renewed attention to resilience **is** leading to increased
**collaboration** between civil and military
stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark}. Collaborative arrangements between
them are proving of mutual benefit, both in peacetime and crisis. For
example, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, military assistance to
civil authorities has been of critical support when civilian resources
are under severe stress.

[[Exercises are an effective way to conduct **stress tests** of national
arrangements]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular when it comes to
large-scale contingencies such as an attack with weapons of mass
destruction or dealing with certain aspects of hybrid warfare. In this
respect, resilience is an important area for analysis, and new
assessment tools are being developed in order to improve how the
Alliance and its members identify vulnerabilities, evaluate their
preparedness and improve their capacity. [[To test Allies' responses to
crisis situations, civil preparedness elements **are** being built into
NATO's military exercises at all levels]{.underline}]{.mark}, from
strategic-level crisis management exercises and high-visibility
exercises to lower-level command-post and field exercises.
