Todd Young: Well listen I have to commend the Democratic leadership in
the Senate. I told Senator Schumer we are only going to work together on
this if we make it a very transparent and inclusive process and he has
kept that promise for me, so [[we got buy in]{.underline}]{.mark} from
roughly 70 U.S. senators, bipartisan, and we got a really big vote out
of the Senate and we hope to maintain that moving forward[[.
Unfortunately, the administration and Democratic leadership got
districted along the way]{.underline}]{.mark} with something called
Build Back Better and so for the better part of a year they let our
Senate bill lay dormant essentially, instead of being reconciled with
the House version. [[Right now we are in the negotiation
process]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the House has passed their bill -- it
was kind of a partisan bill -- we still have that Senate bill. We are in
the process of negotiation. I think [[within the next couple of weeks we
are going to end up with a final compromise bill]{.mark}]{.underline}
that will look a lot like the Senate bill and then it will be signed
into law by the President of the United States. So, I'm guardedly
optimistic but its very important that for those that feel strongly we
need to get this done for the good of the country and that this place
can still work in a bipartisan way when it has to. [[We need to press
our senators and our members of Congress to get this thing
don]{.underline}]{.mark}e rather than focusing on election year
politics. David Westin: So senator, let me push you on the guardedly
optimistic and see if I can get you to confident because as a practical
matter isn't there a deadline of this summer of that summer recess given
the fact that we have midterm elections in the fall -- you've got to get
it done by the middle of the summer. Are you confident you can get it
done? Senator Young: [[I know we can get it done as long as President
Biden has the will to press Democrats to get it
done]{.underline}]{.mark}. I know that Republicans here in the US Senate
are on board. I think the Democrats in the Senate are on board. I think
the real challenge will be in the House of Representatives, but [[all of
that can be addressed if the President says "listen we are going to make
sure this thing remains bipartisan, we are going to make sure this is a
priority]{.underline}]{.mark} even during an election year. And I
believe it will happen because, you know what, it has to happen.

"Competition Without Catastrophe: How America Can Both Challenge and
Coexist With China" Foreign Affairs September/October 2019. Business
Insights. Accessed 3/21/21. ARJH

[Even as China emerges as a more formidable competitor]{.underline} than
the Soviet Union, it has also become an essential U.S. partner. [[Global
problems that are difficult enough to solve even when the United States
and China work together will be impossible to solve if they fail to do
so\--climate change foremost among them]{.underline}]{.mark}, given that
the United States and China are the two biggest polluters. A host of
other transnational challenges\--economic crises, nuclear proliferation,
global pandemics\--also demand some degree of joint effort. This
imperative for cooperation has little parallel in the Cold War. While
the notion of a new Cold War has brought calls for an updated version of
containment, resistance to such thinking has come from advocates of an
accommodative \"grand bargain\" with China. Such a bargain would go well
beyond the terms of U.S.-Soviet detente: in this scenario, the United
States would effectively concede to China a sphere of influence in Asia.
Proponents defend this concession as necessary given the United States\'
domestic headwinds and relative decline. This position is sold as
realistic, but it is no more tenable than containment. Ceding the
world\'s most dynamic region to China would do long-term harm to
American workers and businesses. It would damage American allies and
values by turning sovereign partners into bargaining chips. A grand
bargain would also require stark and permanent U.S. concessions, such as
the abrogation of U.S. alliances or even of the right to operate in the
western Pacific, for speculative promises. Not only are these costs
unacceptable; a grand bargain would also be unenforceable. A rising
China would likely violate the agreement when its preferences and power
changed. Advocates of neo-containment tend to see any call for managed
coexistence as an argument for a version of the grand bargain; advocates
of a grand bargain tend to see any suggestion of sustained competition
as a case for a version of containment. That divide obscures a course
between these extremes\--one that is not premised on Chinese
capitulation or on U.S.-Chinese condominium. Instead, [the goal should
be to establish favorable terms of coexistence with Beijing in four key
competitive domains\--military, economic, political, and global
governance]{.underline}\--thereby securing U.S. interests without
triggering the kind of threat perceptions that characterized the
U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Washington should heed the lessons of the Cold War
while rejecting the idea that its logic still applies. TOWARD
SUSTAINABLE DETERRENCE In contrast to the military competition of the
Cold War, which was a truly global struggle, the dangers for Washington
and Beijing are likely to be confined to the Indo-Pacific. Even so, the
region features at least four potential hot spots: the South China Sea,
the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and the Korean Peninsula. Neither
side wishes for conflict, but tensions are rising as both invest in
offensive capabilities, boost their military presence in the region, and
operate in ever-closer proximity. Washington fears that China is trying
to push U.S. forces out of the western Pacific, and Beijing fears that
the United States is trying to hem it in. Given China\'s harassment of
U.S. aircraft and naval vessels, minor incidents risk escalating into
major military confrontations; Admiral Wu Shengli, the former naval
commander of the People\'s Liberation Army, has warned that any such
incident \"could spark war.\" But coexistence in the Indo-Pacific by
both militaries should not be dismissed as impossible. The United States
must accept that military primacy will be difficult to restore, given
the reach of China\'s weapons, and instead focus on deterring China from
interfering with its freedom of maneuver and from physically coercing
U.S. allies and partners. Beijing will have to accept that the United
States will remain a resident power in the region, with a major military
presence, naval operations in its major waterways, and a network of
alliances and partnerships. Taiwan and the South China Sea are likely to
present the most significant challenges to this overall approach. A
military provocation or misunderstanding in either case could easily
trigger a larger conflagration, with devastating consequences, and this
risk must increasingly animate the thinking of senior leaders in both
Washington and Beijing. On Taiwan, a tacit commitment not to
unilaterally alter the status quo is perhaps the best that can be hoped
for given the historical complexities involved. Yet Taiwan is not only a
potential flash point; it is also the greatest unclaimed success in the
history of U.S.-Chinese relations. The island has grown, prospered, and
democratized in the ambiguous space between the United States and China
as a result of the flexible and nuanced approach generally adopted by
both sides. In this way, the diplomacy surrounding Taiwan could serve as
a model for the increasingly challenging diplomacy between Washington
and Beijing on a variety of other issues, which are similarly likely to
include intense engagement, mutual vigilance and a degree of distrust,
and a measure of patience and necessary restraint. Meanwhile, in the
South China Sea, Beijing\'s understanding that threats to freedom of
navigation could have devastating consequences for China\'s own economy
might help\--when combined with U.S. deterrence\--modulate its more
nationalist sentiments. To achieve such coexistence, Washington will
need to enhance both U.S.-Chinese crisis management and its own capacity
for deterrence. Even as Cold War adversaries, the United States and the
Soviet Union worked concertedly to reduce the risk that an accidental
collision would escalate to nuclear war; they set up military hot lines,
established codes of conduct, and signed arms control agreements. The
United States and China lack similar instruments to manage crises at a
time when new domains of potential conflict, such as space and
cyberspace, have increased the risk of escalation. In every military
domain, the two countries need agreements that are at least as formal
and detailed as the U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea Agreement, a 1972 deal
that established a set of specific rules aimed at avoiding maritime
misunderstandings. The United States and China also need more
communication channels and mechanisms to avoid conflict\--especially in
the South China Sea\--to allow each side to quickly clarify the other\'s
intentions during an incident. The bilateral military relationship
should no longer be held hostage to political disagreements, and senior
military officials on both sides should engage in more frequent and
substantive discussions to build personal ties as well as understandings
of each side\'s operations. Historically, progress on some of these
efforts, especially crisis communication, has proved difficult: Chinese
leaders fear that crisis communication could embolden the United States
to act with impunity and would require devolving too much authority to
senior military officers in the field. But these worries may be easing,
given China\'s growing power and military reforms. Effective U.S.
strategy in this domain requires not just reducing the risk of
unintentional conflict but also deterring intentional conflict. Beijing
cannot be allowed to use the threat of force to pursue a fait accompli
in territorial disputes. Yet managing this risk does not require U.S.
military primacy within the region. As the former Trump administration
defense official Elbridge Colby has argued, \"deterrence without
dominance\--even against a very great and fearsome opponent\--is
possible.\" To ensure deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, Washington should
reorient its investments away from expensive and vulnerable platforms,
such as aircraft carriers, and toward cheaper asymmetric capabilities
designed to discourage Chinese adventurism without spending vast sums.
This calls for taking a page from Beijing\'s own playbook. Just as China
has relied on relatively cheap antiship cruise and ballistic missiles,
the United States should embrace long-range unmanned carrier-based
strike aircraft, unmanned underwater vehicles, guided missile
submarines, and high-speed strike weapons. All these weapons could
protect U.S. and allied interests, even as they dent China\'s confidence
that its offensive operations will succeed and reduce the risk of
collision and miscalculation. The United States should also diversify
some of its military presence toward Southeast Asia and the Indian
Ocean, making use of access agreements rather than permanent basing when
necessary. This would place some U.S. forces beyond China\'s
precision-strike complex, preserving their ability to promptly address
crises. It would also preposition them to address a wide range of
contingencies beyond conflicts involving China, including humanitarian
assistance, disaster relief, and antipiracy missions. ESTABLISHING
RECIPROCITY Unlike the Soviet Union, which focused its resources on
military power, China views geoeconomics as the primary arena of
competition. With an eye toward the future, it has invested heavily in
emerging industries and technologies, including artificial intelligence,
robotics, advanced manufacturing, and biotechnology. China seeks
dominance in these fields in part by denying Western companies
reciprocal treatment. The United States granted China permanent normal
trade relations, supported its entry into the World Trade Organization,
and has generally maintained one of the world\'s most open markets. But
through a combination of industrial policy, protectionism, and outright
theft, China has put in place a range of formal and informal barriers to
its markets and has exploited American openness. This structural
imbalance has eroded support for stable U.S.-Chinese economic ties, and
the relationship faces a heightened risk of rupture even if Xi and U.S.
President Donald Trump are able to reach a near-term trade truce. Many
in the American business community are no longer willing to tolerate
China\'s unfair practices, which include employing state hackers to
steal intellectual property, forcing foreign companies to localize their
operations and engage in joint ventures, subsidizing state champions,
and otherwise discriminating against foreign companies. Alleviating
these growing frictions while protecting American workers and innovation
will require making China\'s full access to major markets around the
world contingent on its willingness to adopt economic reforms at home.
Washington, for its part, will have to invest in the core sources of
American economic strength, build a united front of like-minded partners
to help establish reciprocity, and safeguard its technological
leadership while avoiding self-inflicted wounds. [[The most decisive
factor in the economic competition with China is U.S. domestic
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. The notion of a new \"Sputnik
moment\"\--one that galvanizes public research as powerfully as seeing
the Soviet Union launch the world\'s first satellite did\--may be
overstating the point, [but [government does have a role to play in
advancing American economic and technological
leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet the United States has turned away
from precisely the kinds of ambitious public investments it made during
that period\--such as the Interstate Highway System championed by
President Dwight Eisenhower and the basic research initiatives pushed by
the scientist Vannevar Bush\--even as it faces a more challenging
economic competitor. Washington must dramatically increase funds for
basic science research and invest in clean energy, biotechnology,
artificial intelligence, and computing power. At the same time, the
federal government should scale up its investments in education at all
levels and in infrastructure, and it should adopt immigration policies
that continue to enhance the United States\' demographic and skills
advantage. Calling for a tougher line on China while starving public
investments is self-defeating; describing these investments as
\"socialist,\" given the competition, is especially ironic. Indeed, such
strange ideological bedfellows as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of
Massachusetts, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, are
making a convincing case for a new U.S. industrial policy. On top of
this domestic foundation, Washington should work with like-minded
nations to define a new set of standards on issues that the World Trade
Organization does not currently address, from state-owned enterprises to
indigenous innovation policies to digital trade. Ideally, these
standards would connect Asia and Europe. To this end, the United States
should consider starting a rules-setting initiative of market
democracies layered over the WTO system, which would fill these gaps.
The logic is straightforward. If China hopes to enjoy equal access to
this new economic community, its own economic and regulatory frameworks
must meet the same standards. The combined gravitational pull of this
community would present China with a choice: either curb its free-riding
and start complying with trade rules, or accept less favorable terms
from more than half of the global economy. If Beijing chooses to hold to
the line that the necessary reforms amount to economic regime change, it
can certainly do so, but the world would be well within its rights to
offer China reciprocal treatment. In some cases, Washington may still
need to impose reciprocal measures on China unilaterally, by treating
its exports and investments the same way Beijing handles U.S. exports
and investments. These efforts will be challenging and costly, which is
precisely why the Trump administration\'s decision to pick trade fights
with U.S. allies rather than rally them to a common position vis-a-vis
China is such a waste of American leverage. The United States will also
have to safeguard its technological advantages in the face of China\'s
intellectual property theft, targeted industrial policies, and
commingling of its economic and security sectors. Doing so will require
some enhanced restrictions on the flow of technology investment and
trade in both directions, but these efforts should be pursued
selectively rather than wholesale, imposing curbs on technologies that
are critical to national security and human rights and allowing regular
trade and investment to continue for those that are not. Even these
targeted restrictions must be undertaken in consultation with industry
and other governments; failing to do so could Balkanize the global
technology ecosystem by impeding flows of knowledge and talent. Such a
development would neutralize a key U.S. competitive advantage relative
to China: an open economy that can source the best global talent and
synthesize the biggest breakthroughs from around the world. Meanwhile,
overreach on technology restrictions could drive other countries toward
China, especially since China is already the largest trading partner for
most. In this respect, the Trump administration\'s loud and largely
unilateral campaign against the participation of the Chinese company
Huawei in the development of 5G infrastructure may provide a cautionary
lesson. Had the administration coordinated with allies and partners in
advance and tried some creative policymaking\--for example, establishing
a multilateral lending initiative to subsidize the purchase of
alternatives to Huawei\'s equipment\--it might have had more success in
convincing states to consider other vendors. It then might have been
able to make the most of the two-year delay Huawei now faces in rolling
out 5G following its placement on the U.S. Department of Commerce\'s
list of entities that cannot be supplied with American technology.
Future efforts to restrict trade with China in the technology sector
will require careful deliberation, advance planning, and multilateral
support if they are to be successful; otherwise, they will risk
undermining U.S. innovation. PRO-DEMOCRACY, NOT ANTI-CHINA U.S.-Chinese
economic and technological competition suggests an emerging contest of
models. But unlike the Cold War, with its sharp ideological divide
between two rival blocs, the lines of demarcation are fuzzier here.
Although neither Washington nor Beijing is engaging in the kind of
proselytizing characteristic of the Cold War, China may ultimately
present a stronger ideological challenge than the Soviet Union did, even
if it does not explicitly seek to export its system. If the
international order is a reflection of its most powerful states, then
China\'s rise to superpower status will exert a pull toward autocracy.
China\'s fusion of authoritarian capitalism and digital surveillance may
prove more durable and attractive than Marxism, and its support for
autocrats and democratic backsliders will challenge American values and
provide China cover for its own egregious practices, including the
detention of more than one million ethnic Uighurs in northwestern China.
Some may question whether the erosion of democratic governance across
the world matters for U.S. interests; it does. Democratic governments
are more likely to align with American values, pursue good governance,
treat their people well, and respect other open societies, and all of
this tends to make them more trustworthy and transparent and, in turn,
better economic and security partners. Washington can best establish
favorable terms of coexistence with China in the political realm by
focusing on advancing the appeal of these values for their own sake, not
to score points in the context of U.S.-Chinese competition. As China\'s
presence around the world grows, the United States should avoid a
tendency that was all too common during the Cold War: to see third
countries only in terms of their relationship to a rival government.
Some of the Trump administration\'s policies\--such as invoking the
Monroe Doctrine in Latin America and delivering an address on Africa
that is largely about countering China\--echo this old approach. A tack
that intentionally engages states on their own terms would do more to
advance American interests and values than knee-jerk responses to
Chinese initiatives that leave states feeling that Washington cares
about them only as battlegrounds in its competition with Beijing.
China\'s Belt and Road Initiative offers the most obvious opportunity to
apply this principle in practice. Rather than fight China at every
turn\--on every port, bridge, and rail line\--the United States and its
partners should make their own affirmative pitch to countries about the
kinds of high-quality, high-standard investments that will best serve
progress. Supporting investments not because they are anti-Chinese but
because they are pro-growth, pro-sustainability, and pro-freedom will be
much more effective over the long term\--especially because China\'s
state-led investments have provoked a degree of backlash in countries
over cost overruns, no-bid contracts, corruption, environmental
degradation, and poor working conditions. In this light, the best
defense of democracy is to stress the values that are essential to good
governance, especially transparency and accountability, and to support
civil society, independent media, and the free flow of information.
Together, these steps could lower the risk of democratic backsliding,
improve lives in the developing world, and reduce Chinese influence.
This course of action will require an injection of multilateral funding
from the United States and its allies and partners that can give
countries genuine alternatives. But it will require something more
fundamental, too: the United States needs to have greater confidence in
the belief that investing in human capital and good governance will work
out better over the long run than China\'s extractive approach. Focusing
on principles rather than scorekeeping will also be essential for
setting norms for new technologies that raise hard questions about human
ethics. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, autonomous
weapons to gene-edited humans, there will be a crucial struggle in the
years ahead to define appropriate conduct and then pressure laggards to
get in line. Washington should start shaping the parameters of these
debates without further delay. Finally, coexistence with China does not,
and cannot, preclude the United States from speaking out against
China\'s egregious and inhumane treatment of its own citizens and the
arbitrary detention of foreign nongovernmental organization workers. The
West\'s relative silence on Beijing\'s internment of Uighurs has left a
moral stain, and so the United States and its partners should mobilize
international pressure to demand neutral third-party access to those who
are detained and the sanctioning of the individuals and companies that
are complicit in the detention. China may well threaten that such
pressure will destabilize ties. Yet Washington should make speaking out
on human rights abuses a predictable and routine part of the
relationship. SEQUENCING COMPETITION AND COOPERATION [It is often taken
as an article of faith that as the U.S.-Chinese relationship becomes
more competitive, the space for cooperation will shrink, if not
disappear]{.underline}. But [even as adversaries, the United States and
the Soviet Union found ways to cooperate on a number of issues,
including]{.underline} space exploration, contagious diseases, [the
environment, and]{.underline} the [global commons]{.underline}. [The
need for cooperation between Washington and Beijing is far more acute,
given the nature of contemporary challenges]{.underline}. Leaders in
both countries should consider cooperation on such transnational
challenges not as a concession by one party but as an essential need for
both. [To get the balance between cooperation and competition right,
Washington has to consider the sequencing of each. The United States has
historically sought to cooperate first and compete second with
China]{.underline}. Beijing, meanwhile, has become quite comfortable
competing first and cooperating second, linking\--either explicitly or
implicitly\--offers of cooperation to U.S. concessions in areas of
strategic interest. [[Going forward]{.underline}]{.mark}, Washington
should avoid becoming an eager suitor on transnational challenges.
Eagerness can actually limit the scope for cooperation by making it a
bargaining chip. Although it may seem counterintuitive, [[competition is
likely essential to effective cooperation with Beijing]{.underline}. [In
the zero-sum strategic mindset of many Chinese officials, perceptions of
U.S. power]{.underline}]{.mark} [and resolve [matter
enormously]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the Chinese bureaucracy has long
focused on shifts in both. [Given this sensitivity, it can be as
important for Washington to demonstrate an ability to stand firm, and
even to impose costs, as it is for it to speak earnestly about finding
common cause[. The best approach, then, will be to lead with
competition, follow with offers of
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and refuse to negotiate any
linkages between Chinese assistance on global challenges and concessions
on U.S. interests.

### 2NC - Overview

**The plan prevents passage of China competitiveness legislation. This
allows for the dominance of China on the global economic and security
stage. This prevents the cooperation with China necessary to avoid the
extinction level impacts of global warming.**

#### Irreversibility is the metric for weighing impacts- any other impact has a chance of the world returning

**Sunstein 2007** Cass R.---Professor in the Department of Political
Science and at the Law School of the University of Chicago ("Worst-Case
Scenarios", Harvard University Press)

Most worst-case scenarios appear to have an element of irreversibility.
Once a species is lost, it is lost forever. The special concern for
endangered species stems from the permanence of their loss (outside of
Jurassic Park). One of the most serious fears associated with
genetically modified organisms is that they might lead to irreversible
ecological harm. Because some **[greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere
for centuries, the problem of [climate change may be
irreversible,]{.mark} at least for all practical
purposes]{.underline}**. Transgenic crops can impose irreversible losses
too, because they can make pests more resistant to pesticides. If we
invest significant wealth in one source of energy and neglect others, we
may be effectively stuck forever, or at least for a long time. One
objection to capital punishment is that errors cannot be reversed. In
ordinary life, **[our [judgments ]{.mark}]{.underline}**about worst-case
scenarios **[[have everything to do with
irreversibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course an action may be hard
but not impossible to undo, and so there may be a continuum of cases,
with different degrees of difficulty in reversing. A marriage can be
reversed, but divorce is rarely easy; having a child is very close to
irreversible; moving from New York to Paris is reversible, but moving
back may be difficult. People often take steps to avoid courses of
action that are burdensome rather than literally impossible to reverse.
**[In this light, we might identify an Irreversible Harm Precautionary
Principle, applicable to a subset of risks]{.underline}**.\' As a rough
first approximation, the principle says this: **[[Special steps should
be taken to avoid irreversible harms]{.mark}, through precautions that
go well beyond those that would be taken if irreversibility were not a
problem.]{.underline}** The general attitude here is \"act, then
learn**[,\" as opposed to the tempting alternative of \"wait and
learn.\"]{.underline}** In the case of climate change, some people
believe that research should be our first line of defense. In **[their
view, we should refuse to commit substantial resources to the problem
until e]{.underline}**vidence of serious harm is unmistakably clear.\'
But even assuming that the evidence is not so clear, research **[without
action allows greenhouse gas [emissions ]{.mark}]{.underline}**to
continue, which might [**[produce risks that are
irreversible]{.underline}**,]{.mark} or at best difficult and expensive
to reverse. For this reason, **[the best course of action might well be
to [take precautions]{.mark} now as a way of [preserving
flexibility]{.mark} [for future generations]{.mark}. In the
environmental context in general, this principle suggests that
regulators should proceed with far more aggressive measures than would
otherwise seem justified]{.underline}**.

**But also, Chinese tech leadership leads to nuclear war**

**Kroenig 2018**, Deputy Director for Strategy, Scowcroft Center for
Strategy and Security Associate Professor of Government and Foreign
Service, Georgetown University (Matthew, Nov 12, 2018, "Will disruptive
technology cause nuclear war?" *BAS*,
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war>)

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why [[new technology might cause **nuclear
conflict**: by upending the]{.mark} existing [balance of power among
nuclear-armed states]{.mark}.]{.underline} This latter concern is more
probable and dangerous and demands an immediate policy response. For
more than 70 years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and many
attribute this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of
mutually assured destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to
start a conflict because doing so will only result in its own
annihilation. The key to this model of deterrence is the maintenance of
secure second-strike capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy
nuclear attack and respond with a devastating counterattack. Recently
analysts have begun to worry, however, that new strategic military
technologies may make it possible for a state to conduct a successful
first strike on an enemy. For example, Chinese colleagues have
complained to me in Track II dialogues that the United States may decide
to launch a sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear command
and control, essentially turning off China's nuclear forces. Then,
Washington will follow up with a massive strike with conventional cruise
and hypersonic missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if
any Chinese forces happen to survive, the United States can simply mop
up China's ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile defenses.
China will be disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be sitting on
the shelf, untouched. If the United States, or any other state acquires
such a first-strike capability, then the logic of MAD would be
undermined. Washington may be tempted to launch a nuclear first strike.
Or China may choose instead to use its nuclear weapons early in a
conflict before they can be wiped out---the so-called "use 'em or lose
'em" problem. According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy
response would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that
might threaten second-strike capabilities. This way of thinking about
new technology and stability, however, is open to question. Would any US
president truly decide to launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear
attack because he or she thought s/he could get away with it? And why
does it make sense for the country in the inferior position, in this
case China, to intentionally start a nuclear war that it will almost
certainly lose? More important, this conceptualization of how new
technology affects stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how
new military technologies might be used against nuclear forces directly.
Rather, we should think more broadly about how new technology might
affect global politics, and, for this, it is helpful to turn to
scholarly international relations theory. [The **dominant theory** of
the causes of war in the academy is [the]{.mark} "[**bargaining model**
of war.]{.mark}" This theory [**identifies rapid shifts in the balance
of power** as a primary cause of conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}
International politics often presents states with conflicts that they
can settle through peaceful bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down,
war results. [[Shifts in the **balance of power**]{.mark} are
problematic because they **[undermine effective
bargaining.]{.mark}**]{.underline} After all, why agree to a deal today
if your bargaining position will be stronger tomorrow? And, a clear
understanding of the military balance of power can contribute to peace.
(Why start a war you are likely to lose?) But shifts in the balance of
power muddy understandings of which states have the advantage. You may
see where this is going. [[New technologies threaten to create]{.mark}
potentially [**destabilizing shifts** in the balance of power]{.mark}.
[For decades, stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US
military power]{.mark}]{.underline}. In recent years, however, [the
balance of power in Asia has begun to shift]{.underline}, as **[[China
has increased its military capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Already,
[[Beijing has become more assertive]{.mark} in the region]{.underline},
[claiming contested territory in the South China Sea]{.underline}. And
the results of Russia's military modernization have been on full display
in its ongoing intervention in Ukraine. Moreover, [[China may
have]{.mark} the [lead]{.mark} over the United States [in emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies [that could be **decisive** for the future of
**military acquisitions and warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[including
3D printing, hypersonic missiles, quantum computing, 5G wireless
connectivity, and]{.mark} artificial intelligence
[(AI).]{.mark}]{.underline} And Russian President Vladimir Putin is
building new unmanned vehicles while ominously declaring, "Whoever leads
in AI will rule the world." If China or Russia are able to incorporate
new technologies into their militaries before the United States, then
this could lead to the kind of rapid shift in the balance of power that
often causes war. [[If Beijing believes emerging technologies
provide]{.mark} it with [a]{.mark} newfound, local **[military
advantage]{.mark}** over the United States, for example, [it may be more
willing]{.mark} than previously [to initiate **conflict over
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And if Putin thinks new tech has
strengthened his hand, he may be more tempted to launch a Ukraine-style
invasion of a NATO member. [Either scenario could bring these nuclear
powers into direct conflict with the United States, and once nuclear
armed states are at war, **[there is an inherent risk of nuclear
conflict through]{.mark}** limited nuclear war strategies, **[nuclear
brinkmanship, or]{.mark}** simple accident or **[inadvertent
escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This framing of the problem leads to
a different set of policy implications. The concern is not simply
technologies that threaten to undermine nuclear second-strike
capabilities directly, but, rather, any technologies that can result in
a meaningful shift in the broader balance of power. And the solution is
not to preserve second-strike capabilities, but to preserve prevailing
power balances more broadly. When it comes to new technology, this means
that the United States should seek to maintain an innovation edge.
Washington should also work with other states, including its
nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms control and
nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny these newer and
potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially hostile states.
[These are no easy tasks, but [the consequences of Washington losing the
race for tech]{.mark}nological [superiority to its autocratic
challengers]{.mark} just [might mean **nuclear
Armageddon**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

America COMPETES/USICA Act?

You may recall that efforts proposed in 2020 to
[remake](https://www.hpcwire.com/2020/05/27/100b-plan-submitted-for-massive-remake-and-expansion-of-nsf/)
the National Science Foundation (Endless Frontier Act) have since
expanded and morphed into two gigantic bills, the America COMPETES Act
in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act in the U.S. Senate. [[So far, efforts to reconcile the
two pieces of legislation have snagged]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[a
final push to reconcile narrower versions of the competing bills will
occur before recent reports suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the July 4th
break]{.underline}]{.mark}. In late March, the Senate voted 68-28 to
substitute the text of H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES Act of 2022, with
the text of the Senate's U.S. Innovation and Competition (USICA) of
2021, and sent it back to the House, which as expected, rejected the
substituted legislation and requested a conference to reconcile the
differences. It is a sprawling piece of legislation that morphed during
the pandemic to encompass supply chain issues, science security, NSF
priorities, and direct support for the U.S. semiconductor industry to
name just a few of its provisions. Here's the summary of the
[version](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4521)
sent to House for reconciliation, excerpted directly from House
legislation tracking records: "Passed Senate (03/28/2022) "United States
Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 "This bill addresses U.S.
technology and communications, foreign relations and national security,
domestic manufacturing, education, trade, and other matters. "Among
other provisions, the bill provides funding for FY2022-FY2026 to support
U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and supply
chain security; provides funding for wireless supply chain innovation;
establishes a Directorate for Technology and Innovation in the National
Science Foundation; extends through 2025 the authority of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to lease its non-excess real
property and related personal property; authorizes various programs and
policies related to space exploration; authorizes various international
affairs programs and activities, including foreign assistance for the
Indo-Pacific region; requires federal infrastructure programs to provide
for the use of materials produced in the United States; imposes
sanctions on China for cybersecurity and human rights abuses; requires
the Department of Health and Human Services to consider national
security risks associated with sensitive genetic information; includes
initiatives related to elementary and secondary education, including
those to increase computer science education; contains provisions
related to higher education, including those reauthorizing through
FY2027 international education programs and addressing China's influence
on institutions of higher education; modifies and expands the schedule
for graduated merger filing fees; prohibits federal funding for the
Wuhan Institute of Virology; requires the U.S. Trade Representative to
take certain actions related to digital trade and censorship practices;
and extends through 2027 the Generalized System of Preferences." Sorting
through the bill's many provisions is daunting task. Earlier this month,
Science (AAAS) reported on one of the sticking points related to NSF's
EPSCoR program. "\[T\]he bills, which Democratic leaders hope to
reconcile by the end of the month, differ when it comes to how NSF
should address geographic imbalance. The Senate's version, a nearly
2500-page package called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act
(USICA), mandates a 10-fold budget increase for the NSF program that
steers funding to have-not states called EPSCoR (Established Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research). The similarly mammoth House version,
called the America COMPETES Act, would create new competitive NSF
programs targeting poorly funded institutions in any state,"

Commence With Obstacles Looming
https://about.bgov.com/news/china-competition-bill-talks-commence-with-obstacles-looming/

[[House and Senate members]{.underline}]{.mark} will start to [[hash out
their differences]{.underline}]{.mark} Thursday [[on a
multi-billion-dollar manufacturing and innovation
bill]{.underline}]{.mark} that could be one of the last major
legislative accomplishments before the midterm elections. The
negotiations over the final shape of [[the package intended to enhance
US competitiveness with China]{.underline}]{.mark} are likely to touch
on a wide range of subjects including computer chips, trade,
immigration, and even Wisconsin mink farming. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
opening public [[session]{.mark}]{.underline} kicks off what's become
[[an increasingly rare bicameral conference committee
process.]{.underline}]{.mark} Over 100 members of Congress are slated to
give brief opening statements at an hours-long meeting of the conference
committee tasked with coming up with an agreement on a bill ([H.R.
4521](https://www.bgov.com/core/legislation/federal/bills/#!/6986990763783225434))
known in the House as the America COMPETES Act. Sen. Roger Wicker
(R-Miss), the Senate Commerce Committee's ranking member, said the first
meeting gives lawmakers a chance to "touch gloves" before squaring off
over the bill's contents. Negotiators will then be able to debate
individual provisions privately in the coming weeks or months. "There's
about eight different committees with different issues, so probably a
lot of those issues will break out into those smaller groups," said
Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who also heads
the conference committee. Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) said it's been a long time since lawmakers held a formal
conference, and they may struggle with the proceedings. "But I think
[[they're going to get that done and a lot of people are interested in
it because the chip money is there]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Lott, a
principal and director at Crossroads Strategies who represents the
Nissan Motor Co. While there's widespread support for the bill's \$52
billion for computer chip development, there's billions of dollars worth
of authorizations that lawmakers will need to agree on before a final
package wins the approval of both chambers of Congress and President Joe
Biden. Senators of both parties are hoping the base text of negotiations
is the US Innovation and Competition Act ([S.
1260](https://www.bgov.com/core/legislation/federal/bills/#!/6953589245503340555)),
which more than two-thirds of the Senate voted to pass last year. By
contrast, Democrats passed the House version this year with the lone
Republican vote in support coming from retiring Rep. Adam Kinzinger
(R-Ill.). "I think all the Republican conferees are taking the position
that the base bill that we need to negotiate on in the conference is the
Senate bill," said Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the ranking member of the
Finance Committee. "[[It's already been bipartisan and
negotiated]{.underline}]{.mark}."

[President [Biden is planning to **pressure Congress** to pass an
innovation]{.mark} and competition [bill that would **boost the
semiconductor industry**]{.mark}]{.underline}, among others, when he
travels to Greensboro, N.C., on Thursday, Axios has learned. Why it
matters: The administration knows voters want to see it taking action on
inflation and supply-chain issues. It's especially cognizant of the
effect raising food and gas prices are having on voters' pocketbooks in
the buildup to this fall\'s midterms. Recent international sanctions on
Russia have shown how any country that's too reliant on one export ---
energy exports, in Moscow\'s case --- can be hurt economically. [The
bill is meant to **[increase U.S. competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}
globally but especially [[with China.]{.mark}]{.underline} The trip to
North Carolina comes after a visit by the president on Tuesday to Menlo,
Iowa, where he discussed a plan to lower gas prices in part by granting
a waiver to use cheaper ethanol fuel into this summer. The details:
[[**The full force** of the administration will be behind the]{.mark}
innovation and competition [effort]{.mark}. Cabinet members will be
fanning out across the country and airwaves]{.underline} in the upcoming
days and weeks [to campaign for the bill.]{.underline} Labor Secretary
Marty Walsh is traveling to Los Angeles on April 19-21, and to northeast
Ohio on April 29, Axios has learned. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm
will join Walsh on April 21 at a cleantech incubator in Los Angeles.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who\'s been sidelined after a COVID-19
diagnosis, will be holding regional press calls in states like Texas,
Pennsylvania, Utah and Idaho. She\'s played an active role in
shepherding the bill through Congress. That travel and outreach will
follow a visit to Oregon on Wednesday by U.S. Trade Representative
Katherine Tai, during which she talked about the innovation bill. On
Thursday, the president will tour the new Harold L. Martin Sr.
Engineering Research & Innovation Complex at North Carolina Agricultural
and Technical State University. [The big picture:]{.underline} The bill
proposes investments in research and development and advanced
manufacturing. [[Passing it]{.mark}, though, [has been]{.mark} **an
[arduous]{.mark} process.** In June, 19 Senate Republicans voted in
favor of]{.underline} the United States Innovation and Competition Act
\[[USICA]{.underline}\], [raising the prospect of an easy bipartisan
victory for Biden.]{.underline} But after the House debated its version
of the bill, the COMPETES Act, Republican support slipped away.
[[Now]{.mark}, 107 [Democrats and Republicans]{.mark} between the House
and Senate [are **working out the differences**]{.mark} between the two
bills in conference committee. [The goal is to reach **a bipartisan
agreement**]{.mark} that can be forwarded to Biden for his
signature.]{.underline}

#### China competition bill passes now. New legislation weighs down passage and Biden PC is key.

Charles **Cooper 4/20**/22. "China Competition Legislation is Well
Positioned, But Not Without Risk"
<https://signaldc.com/china-competition-legislation-is-well-positioned-but-not-without-risk/>

There has been [[**significant focus** in]{.mark} the 117^th^
[Congress]{.mark} [on]{.mark} finding a legislative solution for
[addressing]{.mark} the U[.S.'s ability to compete​ with China]{.mark} on
a more level playing field -- both economically and in terms of national
security]{.underline}. The Senate introduced the U.S. Innovation &
Competition Act in April last year, which was then passed by a
bipartisan vote of 68-32 in June. The [[House]{.mark} introduced the
America [COMPETES]{.mark} act in July last year, which was then passed
by a party-line vote of 222-210 in February this year. House and Senate
leadership remain optimistic that they will be able to reach a consensus
on a final package by July 4th.]{.underline} [China competition
legislation is the **[most likely near-term bipartisan "win" of]{.mark}
[significance in Congress]{.mark}.**]{.underline} With [**[few other
major bills on the horizon]{.mark}** that have a chance of reaching the
President's desk]{.underline} (the National Defense Authorization Act
being an exception), this [[legislation is **well-positioned to be
prioritized**]{.mark} [by policymakers on both sides]{.mark} of the
aisle who could benefit from a major policy win this year.]{.underline}
**Why [This [Legislation]{.mark} Has [Momentum]{.mark}]{.underline}
Bipartisanship Rules in DC:** Other than reconciliation (which has yet
to be a successful strategy for legislation this Congress), virtually
all other bills require bipartisan support to reach the President's
desk. [In an era where partisanship is at an all-time high, the fact
that a version of this legislation passed with 68 votes in the Senate is
**significant** and an **advantage of many competing
bills.**]{.underline} **Big Funding Opportunities and Industry Wins:**
For those that follow the money, [there are literally billions for
[programs]{.mark} that [would]{.mark} **[increase]{.mark} U.S. [supply
chain resiliency]{.mark}**, [**boost domestic manufacturing**,]{.mark}
**[strengthen]{.mark} the [U.S. economy]{.mark}**, and **[improve
resources for innovation]{.mark}** across all sectors]{.underline}.
Furthermore, reforms to the Section 301 tariff process will help [create
additional certa**inty and transparency around tariffs** on products
imported from China, which has been a major priority for
industry.]{.underline} **A Focus on China:** Policymakers that are on
the far right and the far left (and many in between) share a common
[[focus]{.mark} [around]{.mark} **concerns related to [China]{.mark}**
and an interest in [spurring]{.mark} more **[domestic job
growth]{.mark}**, **[rebuilding]{.mark} a domestic [manufacturing
sector]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **[strengthening national
security]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [From manufacturing incentives to
export controls, this legislation seeks to strengthen our position
domestically through many programs that are broadly supported across
Congress.]{.underline} **The [[President is]{.mark}
[Engaged]{.mark}]{.underline}:** The [President appreciates the
potential for this legislation to be a signature "win" to pair with the
bipartisan infrastructure package he previously signed into law. The
**[White]{.mark} [House]{.mark} remains engaged** and is [using]{.mark}
the **[same platform]{.mark}** [they did to get]{.mark} the
[infrastructure]{.mark} bill over the finish line.]{.underline} Why This
Legislation May Face Hurdles It's Political Season: It goes without
saying that a "win" with only 200 days left until the election may not
be something all policymakers are willing to give to the President.
Given that this is increasingly a time of political risk and
opportunity, this legislation (like every major bill) will be viewed, in
part, through a political lens. Some Provisions Will Be Tough to
Reconcile: The bills include provisions that are both controversial and
not universally supported. Negotiations will be tough and require
significant compromise. The emergence of factions within each party adds
complexities to an already delicate legislative dance. From labor
provisions to technical trade reforms, the potential for a provision(s)
to slow down the process (or stop it altogether) is real. Other Bills
May Weigh It Down: Without question, there are many sponsors of bills
that have less potential for movement that are looking at China
competition legislation as a potential legislative vehicle for their
initiatives. While this is not unusual (especially when there are not
many big bills moving) and often works seamlessly, it does bring
additional risk to China competition legislation. Other Priorities Could
Take Focus Away From China Competition Legislation: There is no shortage
of challenges that Congress and the White House will need to focus on,
including the war in Ukraine, Fiscal Year 2023 funding, and the COVID
Pandemic. It is entirely possible that one of these (or others not yet
on the radar) could cause a significant shift in the agenda, which would
create a significant hurdle for China competition legislation. [As
**negotiations continue for this legislation**, policies are being
ironed out in real time.]{.underline} For those seeking to influence the
process, it is not too late...but the process is already crowded and
noisy. While the July 4^th^ timeline is certainly guiding negotiators,
deadlines are aspirational and are likely to be extended.

#### 

#### Passage is [likely]{.underline}, but [complicated]{.underline}\-\--[focus]{.underline} from White House officials is key. [Any delay]{.underline} risks collapsing negotiations.

Time is running out for a deal on China competitiveness bill [[Congress
has tied]{.mark} itself into [**a Gordian knot**
over]{.mark}]{.underline} one of President [[Biden's **top**]{.mark}
**legislative [priorities]{.mark}**]{.underline}: a bill to bolster
American semiconductor manufacturing and help the country compete
economically with China. [[It\'s]{.mark} Commerce Secretary]{.underline}
Gina [[Raimondo's job to **help cut it** --- but time is **running
out**]{.mark}. Raimondo is working to help lawmakers **reach an
agreement**]{.underline}, which would give Democrats another achievement
in the midterms. She told reporters in January that Congress "can't wait
until April, May" to pass the bill --- a timeline that is now impossible
to meet. In an interview, [Raimondo]{.underline} told The Early she
[thought [the bill could be **done** by **Memorial
Day**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- maybe sooner. "There's no deadline, per
se," Raimondo said. "[[We]{.mark} just [have to **stay focused**]{.mark}
on it [and]{.mark} **do the work**]{.underline} --- sit at the table and
do the work [to [**reconcile** the differences]{.mark}." "I\'m going
to]{.underline} work on this and [talk to members of Congress **every
single day** until it **does pass**,"]{.underline} she added. While
[[the bill is **a top priority**]{.mark} for the White
House]{.underline}, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to help improve Democrats\'
standing ahead of the midterms, the negotiations also serve as a
political opportunity for Raimondo. The former Rhode Island governor
could burnish her reputation as a leading moderate in the party by
showing she can help negotiate a deal with Republicans at a time when
bitter partisanship reigns. "One of the most impressive things about
Secretary Raimondo is that she is as comfortable, willing and happy to
call a progressive member from California as a Republican senator from a
deep-red state," said Scott Mulhauser, who worked as a senior adviser to
Raimondo for several months last year before returning to his consulting
firm. Some Republicans have praised Raimondo\'s work trying to hash out
a compromise. "Amongst many of the Senate Republican staff that I've
spoken with on this matter, she has been very helpful," said Ari
Zimmerman, a Republican lobbyist at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck
who\'s lobbied on the bill. "She understands the problem in and out."
But [it\'s still unclear whether a deal will **actually come
together**.]{.underline} A tough deal [Congress has **been laboring** to
pass the bill]{.underline} for most of Biden\'s presidency. The Senate
cleared its version in June with 19 Republican voters; the House passed
its own bill last month with the support of only a single Republican,
Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.). [The challenge]{.underline} facing Raimondo
and Democratic congressional leaders [now is **how [to strike a
deal]{.mark}** that keeps at least 10 Senate Republicans on board and
still wins the support of wary House Democrats. That task [grows
**harder each day** as]{.mark} the [midterms approach]{.mark} and
[Republicans lose]{.mark} **any [incentive]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **make
[compromise]{.mark}s** that would allow for **passage** of a bill
Democrats could tout]{.underline} ahead of November\'s elections.
Raimondo insists [there is a deal to be had and]{.underline} argued that
[[there's]{.mark} already **bipartisan [agreement]{.mark}** [on "**the
bones**]{.mark} **of the bill**"]{.underline} --- a \$52 billion program
to combat a global shortage of computer chips by subsidizing
manufacturing in the United States. [But lawmakers are at odds over
provisions that fall "outside of the core innovation
package,"]{.underline} as she put it, such as climate change, financial
services and human trafficking. The biggest gap between the two bills is
on trade, according to Raimondo as well as several lobbyists tracking
the legislation. "That's really where the two sides are the farthest
apart," said Brian Pomper, a Democratic lobbyist at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer & Feld who has lobbied on the bill. "And, I mean, they are

without a fight But stripping out the trade provisions could alienate
Senate Republicans whose votes Democrats need to overcome a filibuster.
The trade language in the Senate bill "was the linchpin that was needed"
to pass it last year, said Clete Willems, a former trade negotiator in
Donald Trump's White House who is now a lobbyist tracking the bill. "So
I think it's going to be ultimately included." House Democrats who spent
months pushing to pass their version of the bill, meanwhile, aren\'t
likely to give up without a fight. "The things that we\'re proposing are
good for American manufacturing," said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.),
who backed the trade provisions in the House bill. "They\'re good for
the American consumer. Many of my Republican friends are violently
opposed to giving special concessions to China. I wouldn\'t think this
would be a heavy lift." [[The China bill]{.underline}]{.mark},
Blumenauer added, [[is **likely**]{.underline}]{.mark} the only chance
[[to pass]{.underline}]{.mark} these trade measures [before the

before Congress acts again on gun safety]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly with Democrats on the verge of losing at least one chamber.

#### The real action on gun reform is making little progress in Congress. They bills all stuck or stalled.

Paul **LeBlanc May 25, 2022** "Gun legislation is stalled in Congress.
Here\'s why that won\'t change anytime soon"
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/gun-laws-us-congress/index.html>

[**A House-passed bill**,]{.mark} HR 1446, backed by Democratic Rep. Jim
Clyburn of South Carolina, **[would close what\'s known as the
\"Charleston loophole,]{.mark}\"** which allows some licensed gun sales
to go through before a required background check is done.

Specifically, the legislation would increase the amount of time, from
three business days to a minimum of 10 business days, that a federal
firearms licensee must wait to receive a completed background check
prior to transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person.

Using that loophole, a White gunman was able to legally purchase a
firearm to kill nine people at a historically Black church in
Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.

Senate Democrats took steps Tuesday night to place the bill, called the
Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, onto the legislative calendar so
it can be voted on.

[**It\'s unclear when the Senate will vote on the measure**, **but it
needs 60 votes in the chamber to overcome a filibuster, and it\'s clear
the legislation does not have that support**]{.mark} (at least not right
now) \-- **[nor does it have full Democratic backing to gut the Senate
rule altogether.]{.mark}**

It\'s unclear when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will try to
force a procedural vote to break a filibuster. Unless there\'s an
agreement from all 100 senators, the earliest he could set up the
procedural vote would be Saturday, according to a Democratic aide.

But senators were expected to leave for next week\'s Memorial Day recess
on Thursday afternoon. So they may wait until after the recess to take
that procedural vote, even though leaving town amid the Texas tragedy
would be bad optics.

The aide said Schumer has not indicated when he may try to force the
vote yet.

Still, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who has pushed
for gun safety legislation since the Sandy Hook shooting in his state
nearly 10 years ago, told reporters Tuesday there should be a vote even
if it is doomed to fail.

\"I think we need to hold every member of Congress accountable and vote
so that the public knows where every one of us stand,\" he said. Asked
about the potential for bipartisan agreement, he added, \"I think there
may well be areas of agreement. I have come close to agreement with a
number of my colleagues on a red flag statute.\"

Even bills with bipartisan support can\'t pass the Senate

[**Another bill, HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021,
would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the
country**.]{.mark} Currently, background checks are not required for gun
sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers.

The legislation has bipartisan support, passing the House last year in a
227-203 vote. Eight Republicans supported the bill and one Democrat
voted against it.

Asked Tuesday about this broader House-passed background checks measure,
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia referenced his own,
narrower effort in the Senate, saying, \"If you can\'t pass
Manchin-Toomey, how are you going to get enough votes for anything?\"

In 2013, Manchin and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania pushed a
compromise bill that would have required background checks on all
commercial sales of guns (including private sales at gun shows and all
internet sales), but would have allowed for individuals to sell their
firearms to family, friends and other acquaintances without background
checks.

This failed under Senate filibuster rules, even though it had majority
support. The vote was 54-46, with four Republicans joining most
Democrats in support. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid cast a
\"no\" vote to secure the ability to bring the measure up again. Four
other Democrats voted against the bill.

Manchin has continued to push versions of that legislation in more
recent years.

**[Republicans will argue that background checks chip away at gun rights
and, ultimately, will take away guns.]{.mark}** \"You see Democrats and
a lot of folks in the media whose immediate solution is to try to
restrict the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,\" Sen. Ted
Cruz, a Texas Republican, told reporters Tuesday.

The GOP will also argue that the bills would not stop every shooting.
This is true. The specifics of each shooting are different. We still
don\'t know if any of this legislation would have stopped Tuesday\'s
shooter, identified by Texas officials as Salvador Ramos.

For now, every state has variations on the rules. **[Most action on gun
regulation is happening at the state level because Washington is frozen
on the issue,]{.mark}** as it is on so many others.

## Link Extension

### Block Link Overview

#### Link is four-fold

#### -Political influence: Biden will be able to negotiate deals to sustain his current agenda. The plan is a bolt from the blue insert that will collapse his negotiating credibility and destroys the push for China legislation.

#### -Party infighting and division - plan forces democratic infighting when key moderate dems are on the cusp of bipartisan passage of the bills.

#### -Congressional focus: Biden focus on non-agenda policy issues takes away his ability to keep Dem factions united on his key priorities in the small window of time remaining before midterm election focus starts-- now is necessary for his agenda.

doctrinal purposes but not "armed force" for IHL purposes. Thus, without
knowing more about the operations to which General Nakasone was
referring, and in light of the uncertainty as to the threshold at which
cyber operations initiate an IAC, no definitive conclusion regarding
whether the U.S. operations standing alone initiated an armed conflict
between the United States and Russia is possible (assuming one is not
already underway as a matter of law, see
[here](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/are-we-at-war/)). Second[[, U.S.

Indeed, President Obama's 2012 [Presidential Policy Directive

complex and lengthy interagency legal process before approval of any

August 2018, President Trump rescinded PPD-20 and enacted a new policy
that allows agencies to make the determination on which cyber operations
to pursue and the authority to pursue them[[. Offensive Cyber Operations

praise from both House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael
McCaul (R-Texas) and Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark

QUESTIONS: OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS AND NATO STRATEGY
https://mwi.usma.edu/pressing-questions-offensive-cyber-operations-and-nato-strategy/

[[NATO's shift to incorporating offensive cyber operations into existing
strategy and policy has focused on integrating offensive effects into
conventional military plans and]{.underline}]{.mark} operations in the
context of a [[conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark} While [[NATO's updated
strategy is a positive development]{.underline}]{.mark}, its limited
focus on conflict scenarios for employing cyber power fails to
accurately account for the cyber threat environment NATO
faces---particularly the mismatch between the alliance's clear
distinction between wartime and peacetime and the approach of
adversaries like Russia, who adopt a competition-conflict continuum.
Additionally, the focus on employing offensive cyber during a high-end
conventional fight is also not consistent with how several NATO members
are already engaged in gray zone offensive cyber operations.

The
primary [threat](https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/cyber-threats-and-nato-2030-horizon-scanning-and-analysis/) to
NATO allies in the cyber domain is not from high-end, decisive
cyberattacks. Instead, cyber threats more frequently and effectively
manifest as gray zone tactics designed to have a corrosive effect
without rising to the level of warfare. There are numerous examples of
this type of threat. For instance, in July 2021, NATO
publicly [condemned](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_185863.htm) a
range of malicious cyber behavior, including the Microsoft Exchange hack
(which NATO attributed to China) and ransomware attacks targeting
critical infrastructure[[. Russia has leveraged cyber and disinformation
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} to interfere in democratic elections in
the [United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/us/politics/election-interference-russia-2020-assessment.html) in
2016, 2018, and
2020; [France](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-election-2017-russia-hacked-cyberattacks/) in
2017; and Germany
in [2017](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/) and [2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/europe/germany-russia-hacking-investigation.html)---to
name just a few examples. Russia also conducted distributed
denial-of-service cyberattacks against government websites
in [Montenegro](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_15-06-2021.pdf) during
the lead-up to, and following, Montenegro's ascension to NATO in 2017.
And when NATO forces were positioned in the Baltics beginning in 2017 as
part of NATO's [enhanced forward
presence](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_136388.htm), two
threat
actors, [GhostWriter](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/pdfs/Ghostwriter-Influence-Campaign.pdf) and [Secondary
Infektion](https://secondaryinfektion.org/), conducted
a [range](https://www.cyberscoop.com/russia-disinformation-ghostwriter-secondary-infektion/) of
disinformation campaigns.

Additionally, the reality is that [[several NATO members are already
speaking publicly about offensive cyber operations]{.underline}]{.mark}
below the level of warfare and their statements and actions have an
effect on the entire alliance. In particular, NATO member nations have
not reached a political consensus about the role of offensive cyber
operations. In 2018, the US Department of Defense and US Cyber Command
issued
new [strategy](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF) and
policy [documents](https://www.cybercom.mil/Portals/56/Documents/USCYBERCOM%20Vision%20April%202018.pdf) that
articulated a role for the military in conducting offensive cyber
operations below the level of armed conflict outside of US-controlled
cyberspace (part of the "defend forward" strategy), [[and there has been
some reporting about US offensive cyber operations.]{.underline}]{.mark}
For instance,
in [2018](https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/what-a-u-s-operation-against-russian-trolls-predicts-about-escalation-in-cyberspace/) the
United States disrupted the Russian-linked Internet Research Agency from

**[[The U.S. must]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[stop playing
defense]{.underline}** **[[and go on offense" online in order to avoid a
"cyber Pearl Harbor," according to the]{.underline}]{.mark}** newly
released **[[Republican Party platform.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
"**[Despite their promises to the contrary, Russia and China see cyber
operations as a part of a warfare strategy during peacetime," the
platform states, adding,]{.underline}** "**[[We will ... make clear that
users have a self-defense right to deal with hackers as they see
fit]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Security and policy experts, however, have
serious reservations about the platform which was authored by Republican
lawmakers and party faithful alike, and released in tandem with the GOP
Convention kick-off on Monday night. One scholar fretted that
Republicans would end up "destroy\[ing\] the internet in order to save
it." "There is a distinct lack of clarity about rules of the road for
peacetime, and the norms and laws that do and will govern offensive
cyber operations in peacetime \[are\] still highly malleable," explained
Robert Morgus, a policy analyst with D.C.-based think tank New America.
"This means that operations conducted by the U.S. and others are highly
influential in shaping those rules, and pushing the red line too far ---
while useful for short-term strategic goals like disrupting the Iranian
nuclear program --- may prove detrimental to global stability in the
long run," he added. The platform's ambiguous call to action, noted
Morgus, offers no details about what it defines as going on cyber
offense --- "it's important to draw a line between offensive cyber
operations conducted for espionage or intelligence gathering purposes
and offensive computer network operations," he said. Espionage, Morgus
said, is an expected reality for nation-states but offensive computer
network operations --- like the Stuxnet cyberweapon which crippled
Iran's nuclear program --- could easily cross the threshold into "armed
attack." In international law, nations are permitted to respond
militarily to an armed attack. Moreover, observed former NSA IT
architect Will Ackerly, the platform would give other nations political
cover for launching cyberwar operations. "The way that this section of
**[[the Republican platform is]{.underline}]{.mark}** written sounds as
though it's **[[rationalizing the use of force following a
cyber-attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** by way of defending the country. To
that end, any offensive practice would give everyone else in the room
the latitude to justify their offensive actions based on the United
States' rhetoric," explained Ackerly, who left the NSA to become
co-founder and CTO of cyber start-up Virtru. "It is tempting for the
United States, with its advanced offensive cyber capabilities, to think
the best defense is a good offense, but this is not true when it comes
to our most likely adversaries," said Brown University Academic Director
for Law and Policy Tim Edgar. "Offensive cyber operations carry a host
of risks and unintended consequences for the security and stability of
the internet. The United States is uniquely vulnerable to these risks.
Offensive operations should be tightly controlled," Edgar told FedScoop.
"We don't want to destroy the internet in order to save it." Among other
cybersecurity-related topics addressed, the party platform specifically
advocates for stronger energy infrastructure security, the birth of a
global free market in cyber insurance and for Congress' to lead efforts
to create an encryption "solution." **[[The party platform is drawn up
by the RNC Arrangements Committee]{.mark} whose leadership is appointed
by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus]{.underline}**. The committee is
comprised by roughly 150 elected officials and prominent party allies
who also helped organize other aspects of this year's convention. The
platform is not binding on the president or his appointees.

With the failure of Congress to pass legislation aimed at bolstering the
nation's cybersecurity, the Democratic platform asserts the president's
willingness to act on his own through executive order. "President Obama
has supported comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that would help
business and government protect against risks of cyber attacks while
also safeguarding the privacy rights of our citizens," says the platform
adopted Sept. 4 by the Democratic National Convention. "And, going
forward, the president will continue to take executive action to
strengthen and update our cyber defenses." **[[The Republican

business issue and object to any regulations on industry establishing
requirements for securing IT infrastructure and systems. They would

cybersecurity in the military. The National Security Agency is often
mentioned as the most likely home.

reduced this amount to \$15.6 billion and it was subsequently stripped

lilw-msdi2022

An ominous sign for continued funding of COVID-19 vaccines and
therapeutics came this week when the Biden administration decided to
split off these funds from a bill supplying Ukraine with military aid.
It was an indication that **[[funding COVID
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, once a matter of bipartisan accord,
**[[was losing Republican support.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But this was
merely an indirect measure of the Republican position. A more direct
indication comes from Caitlin Owens, who explains why **[[Senate
Republicans are haggling over spending money on
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}** and therapeutics. The answer is that
**[[they're concerned about wasting money.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Owens's reporting gets into the Republican view in more detail than any
previous report. **[[One Republican concern is that the current funding
strategy prioritizes access over efficiency.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
vaccines are distributed in multidose vials that, once opened, must be
used or thrown away, leading to some spoilage. "**[[Republicans say the
current strategy is wasteful]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Owens reports,
"and it would be better to rein in accessibility so that more doses are
likely to be used." **[[A second concern is that the
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while highly effective against
hospitalization and death, **[[are proving less effective against
transmission.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Therefore, **[[Republicans don't
want to spend too much on them.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "**[[Republicans
are skeptical of using federal money to buy more vaccines]{.mark} that
are proving not to last very long and questions remain if they will work
against future variants,"]{.underline}** a senior GOP Senate aide told
Owens. "**[[We're saying that the current shot and boosters are reducing
in effectiveness.]{.mark} [New vaxx isn't ready and it's unclear where
they are in the plan,]{.mark}]{.underline}**" the aide added. "**[[Since
there is no plan, we don't want to give them \[a\] blank
check."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Republicans oppose pandemic funding

Alan **Fram**, **6-1**-2022,(AP News reporter) \"Congressional stalemate
makes a quick compromise on COVID funding unlikely\", PBS NewsHour,
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/congressional-stalemate-makes-a-quick-compromise-on-covid-funding-unlikely
lilw-msdi2022

The U.S. is headed for "a lot of unnecessary loss of life," the Biden
administration says, if Congress fails to provide billions more dollars
to brace for the pandemic's next wave. Yet the quest for that money is
in limbo, the latest victim of election-year gridlock that's stalled or
killed a host of Democratic priorities. President Joe **[[Biden's appeal
for funds for vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[testing and treatments
[has hit opposition from Republicans]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[who've
fused the fight with the precarious politics of
immigration]{.underline}**. Congress is in recess, and the next steps
are uncertain, despite admonitions from White House COVID-19 coordinator
Dr. Ashish Jha of damaging consequences from "every day we wait."
Administration officials say they're running low on money to stock up
on, or even begin to order, the latest vaccines, tests and treatments.
Also lacking are funds to reimburse doctors treating uninsured patients
and to help poor countries control the pandemic. House and Senate
Democrats have been wrangling over how to resolve the stalemate and even
over which chamber should vote first. It's an open question whether
they'll ever get the GOP votes they'll need to pull the legislation
through the 50-50 Senate, and prospects in the narrowly divided House
are unclear as well. "There is still an urgency to pass a COVID relief
package," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said last week.
"It's very, very much needed." Optimists hope the measure could start
rolling once Congress returns next week. Pessimists say without quick
resolution, Democrats may not have enough leverage to push the money to
passage until early fall. That's when they could stuff it into
legislation that will probably be needed to finance government --- a
bill that would avert a federal shutdown, a pre-election distraction
Republicans will be desperate to avoid. The heap of sidelined Democratic
initiatives has grown this year, a victim of GOP opposition and
rebellions by centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Casualties
include bills on voting rights, health care, environment, taxes, gun
curbs, abortion rights, policing tactics and an investigation of the
2021 Capitol storming by then-President Donald Trump's supporters. While
lawmakers have approved massive packages financing federal agencies
through September and helping Ukraine counter Russia's invasion, other
priorities are dead or drifting, even as Democrats' days running
Congress are likely dwindling. Republicans are favored to win House
control in November's elections and could grab the Senate as well, and
Democrats' frustration is clear. "So far it hasn't moved," Sen. Mazie
Hirono, D-Hawaii, said of Biden's latest \$22.5 billion request for
COVID-19, which he initially sent Congress three months ago. "But then
neither has sensible gun legislation, neither has voting rights." "The
50-50 Senate sucks," she said. The COVID money is needed quickly,
officials say. Their warnings have come with over 1 million U.S. deaths
from the disease and a fresh variant that daily is hospitalizing over
100,000 Americans and killing more than 300. Both numbers are rising.
Officials say that lacking fresh funds, the U.S. is falling behind other
countries that are already lining up for supplies needed for fall and
winter. That's prompted Jha to plan for the chance that Congress
provides no new money at all, threatening painful choices about what to
do if there aren't enough vaccines or therapeutics for all who need
them. "It would be terrible," Jha told reporters recently. "I think we
would see a lot of unnecessary loss of life if that were to happen."
Congress has provided \$370 billion for purchasing supplies, for
research and other public health initiatives to combat the pandemic,
according to administration tallies obtained by The Associated Press.
Around \$14 billion of it was unspent or not committed to contracts as
of April 5, the documents show, serious money but an amount the
administration says falls below the ultimate need. **[[Most Republicans
are skeptical about added pandemic funding]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "I
have a hard time believing that there's not enough money and not enough
flexibility already" to use it, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.

In addition, approximately 30 countries and 165 nongovernmental
organizations have called for a preemptive ban on LAWS due to ethical
concerns, including concerns about operational risk, accountability for
use, and compliance with the proportionality and distinction
requirements of the law of war. [[The U.S. government does not currently

[[Members of Congress and Pentagon officials are increasingly focused on
developing emerging military technologies to enhance U.S. national
security and keep pace with U.S. competitors]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
U.S. military has long relied upon technological superiority to ensure
its dominance in conflict and to underwrite U.S. national security. In
recent years, however, [[technology has both rapidly evolved and rapidly
proliferated]{.underline}]{.mark}---largely as a result of advances in
the commercial sector. As former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
observed, this development has threatened to erode the United States'
traditional sources of military advantage. The Department of Defense
(DOD) has undertaken a number of initiatives to arrest this trend. For
example, in 2014, DOD announced the Third Offset Strategy, an effort to
exploit emerging technologies for military and security purposes as well
as associated strategies, tactics, and concepts of operation. In support
of this strategy, DOD established a number of organizations focused on
defense innovation, including the Defense Innovation Unit and the
Defense Wargaming Alignment Group. More recently, the 2018 National
Defense Strategy echoed the underpinnings of the Third Offset Strategy,
noting that U.S. national security will likely be affected by rapid
technological advancements and the changing character of war.... New
technologies include advanced computing, "big data" analytics,
artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy,
hypersonics, and biotechnology---the very technologies that ensure we
will be able to fight and win the wars of the future. The United States
is the leader in developing many of these technologies. However, China
and Russia---key strategic competitors---are making steady progress in
developing advanced military technologies. [[As these technologies are
integrated]{.underline}]{.mark} into foreign and domestic military
forces [[and deployed, they could hold significant implications for the
future of international security]{.underline}]{.mark} writ large, [[and
will]{.underline}]{.mark} have to [[be a significant focus for
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in terms of funding and program
oversight.

currently being developed but has not yet been deployed on battlefields.
A coalition of nongovernmental organizations, the Campaign to Stop

autonomous weapons. Critics of the technology argue that lethal
autonomous weapons are unethical and unsafe. Some suggest that an arms
race to develop the technology would exacerbate tensions between major
powers; at the same time, non-state actors, including terrorists, could
adopt the technology for malicious uses. **[[Twenty-six countries have

**[[U.S. public's opposition is slightly lower than the opposition by

political messaging can affect American attitudes toward lethal
autonomous weapons. For instance, support for autonomous weapons
increases when the public is told that other states or non-state actors
are developing them. On the other hand, explaining the security risks of
a military AI arms race can reduce support for investment in military
applications of AI. The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots has adopted some
of the publicity strategies that the International Campaign to Ban
Landmines used to successfully lobby for an international ban on
landmines. But researchers point out that **[[persuading the public to

**[[The White House\'s drone program is not going
anywhere.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Obama administration revealed
Thursday that two hostages---including one American---were killed in a
counterterrorism incident earlier this year and two other Americans who
were known to be working with al-Qaida were also killed, accidentally.
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that a drone strike was
responsible for the casualties. On Capitol Hill, the incident has
brought into sharp focus the unintended consequences and risks
associated with the president\'s drone program---a cornerstone of his
counterterrorism strategy in the Middle East. Yet, the same
**[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** that spent years reviewing and
chronicling the enhanced-interrogation techniques administered under the
Bush administration **[[does not appear to be moved to overhaul the
lethal drone program]{.underline}]{.mark}** over Thursday\'s
revelations. Nor, do they seem to think the program is fundamentally
flawed in a major way. \"**[[The collateral damage has been
extraordinarily low,\" says Sen. Dianne
Feinstein]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the ranking member of the Senate\'s
Intelligence Committee. \"That is really a fact. I only wish I could
tell you what it was. That is the irony here. This is all classified.\"
Feinstein says the committee is still reviewing the incident, and other
committees will also consider engaging in reviews. But the CIA\'s drone
program has become such a consequential tool in the country\'s war on
terrorism that even Republicans who are quick to fault Obama for
anything else are extremely hesitant to lodge criticisms against it.
\"We made a mistake. You know I have been a big critic of President
Obama\'s. I am not going to blame him for this. I blame al-Qaida,\"
Republican Sen. **[[Lindsey Graham said]{.underline}]{.mark}** Thursday.
\"**[[We are not going to terminate this drone
program.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[I am sorry]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these **[[innocent people were killed.]{.underline}]{.mark}** I am glad
these two Americans collaborating with the enemy were killed. **[[Please
understand, we are at war. This is the way war
works.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is a nasty, terrible business, but I am
in it to win it.\" Unlike so many other foreign policy decisions the
president has made, from relaxing relations with Cuba to negotiating a
nuclear deal with Iran, Republicans are not lining up to attack the
president over a program they say has proved to be effective at taking
out top targets. \"We are in a war with individuals who are hiding with
civilians,\" says Republican Sen. James Lankford, a member of the
Intelligence Committee. \"\[The administration\] does an extremely good
job of trying to check and recheck their systems, and when they do a
strike, it is not flippant. They are very, very efficient and very, very
careful.\" Even Republican presidential contenders Ted Cruz, Rand Paul,
and Marco Rubio have so far resisted the urge to blame the Obama
administration for the outcomes of the mission. \"It is a tragedy that
these American hostages lost their lives. My prayers and thoughts are
with their families,\" Paul said in a statement from his office. Cruz
said that blame for the death of the hostages sat squarely with \"the
terrorists who kidnapped them and forcibly held them in their command
center.\" Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden---a constant voice of caution when
it comes to America\'s drone program---said in a statement that he
wanted to \"learn more about this operation before arriving at any final
judgements about how it was carried out.\" As the administration has
sought to end the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and scale back
troops on the ground, drones have become one of the essential tools at
the president\'s disposal. \"**[[We are still very much in the
counterterrorism business]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and as long as there
are threats around the world, we will continue to be involved in that,\"
**[[Sen. Richard Burr]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the chairman of the
Senate\'s Intelligence Committee, **[[said]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
role the drone program fills.

drone operation that accidentally killed a U.S. civilian and an Italian
in Pakistan. Hawkish Republicans said Thursday that the death of Warren
Weinstein was tragic but that it was collateral damage in the global war
on terror. **[[Asked]{.underline}]{.mark}** in interviews
**[[whether]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[the killing of an American
citizen should cause]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[the

consequences to war, and we're in one," said Senate Intelligence
Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.). "When you look at our experience with
collateral damage, it's minimal." While Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck
Grassley (R-Iowa) wondered why the White House had waited until April to
announce killings that took place in January, Burr said he had already
reviewed the timeline for the release of the information as well as the
particulars of the drone strike in question and said he will continue to
do so. But everything Burr has seen so far points to a "very
appropriate" use of drones in this instance. Other **[[top
Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[on national security issues
backed]{.underline}]{.mark}** Burr's assertion, along with **[[a war on
terror that increasingly involves]{.underline}]{.mark}** the use of
**[[unmanned drones]{.underline}]{.mark}** to kill top terrorist

#### Voters favor drone strikes compared to other operations

Casualties in the War on Terror\", The Chicago Council,
https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/public-opinion-civilian-casualties-war-terror
lilw-msdi2022

**[[Americans tend to favor airstrikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** against
terror-linked targets, **[[rather than]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[risking
US service members' lives in]{.underline}** **[[ground
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, according to the 2015
Chicago Council Survey, 77 percent of Americans favored the use of
airstrikes against terrorist training camps and other facilities, while
only 60 percent favored using US ground troops against those targets.
However, Americans are still concerned with the civilian casualties that
are more likely to result from increased airstrikes. In a Washington
Post poll conducted in conjunction with YouGov in 2019, 64 percent of
Americans agreed that "The US should NOT use airstrikes if it meant
killing innocent civilians." Although, a notable portion of the
population (36%) disagreed with that statement. Furthermore, a
subsection of voters that identified as supporting Donald Trump in the
2016 primary election held opposite views, with nearly three-quarters
disagreeing with that same statement (74%). This disparity between the
general US population and early Trump voters alludes to a larger
partisan disagreement amongst the American populace concerning
counterterrorism and the tools to combat it. While all Americans have an
aversion to civilian casualties the willingness to use lethal force
differs between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans tend to favor
more military interventions while Democrats are more wary of the use of
force. The type of military intervention does not affect this overall
trend. The 2021 Chicago Council Survey finds that **[[40 percent of
Republicans say the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is not
using]{.underline}]{.mark}** military tools like **[[drone
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** and military interventions
**[[enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nearly double the **[[20 percent of
Democrats]{.mark}]{.underline}** who **[[say the
same]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Democrats are much more likely to say that
the United States uses military tools like drone strikes too much (39%),
while very few Republicans feel this way (14%). This discrepancy relates
to civilian casualties as air and drone strikes are more likely to kill
civilian bystanders. The above Washington Post Poll that finds a
partisan subjection of the population may be more willing to accept some
civilian casualties could be a potential reason as to why political
party seems to affect the preferred amount of air and drone strikes.

#### Republicans support drone strikes

**[[As news broke that an American drone strike killed a major Iranian

**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Meeting with reporters at his West

Baghdad airport]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and kill Maj. Gen. Qassem
Soleimani]{.underline}** "**[[courageous]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Wilson
called Soleimani "one of the great terrorists of our era." The general
was the head of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
and was instrumental in Iranian military and intelligence operations.
**[[Wilson's comments echoed praise offered by other Republican
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[from U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham to
former S.C. governor and ambassador to the United Nations Nikki
Haley.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, the state's top Democrat in Congress
criticized Trump's decision to order the airstrike. U.S. Rep. Jim
Clyburn, a Columbia Democrat and House majority whip, said in a
statement on Twitter on Friday the president's action put the country at
risk. "His failure to even consult Congress---entrusted by the
Constitution to authorize military force---is alarming," Clyburn said.
"Congress must uphold our responsibility to protect national security."
U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-Charleston, called for transparency between
the Trump administration and Congress. "Last night's airstrike was
unprecedented with incalculable consequences that will play out over the
coming days, weeks, and months," Cunningham said, according to a
statement. "Given the immense gravity of this situation, Congress needs
to hear from the Administration about the intelligence that led to this
airstrike and how it fits into our broader strategy to counter Iran's
destabilizing presence in the region, consolidate our gains in Iraq, and
combat violent extremism." The U.S. airstrike is the latest development
in a series of incidents of violence in Iraq. On New Year's Eve,
demonstrators who support the Iranian-backed group Kataib Hezbollah
stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, breaching the exterior walls and
starting fires. The protesters, said to be angered over U.S. airstrikes
that killed members of the group, later retreated as the president
ordered more troops to the region. The U.S. Department of State reported
that U.S. personnel were safe. The drone strike has raised concerns of
further escalation in the United States' conflict with Iran. Wilson also
compared the United States' involvement in the Middle East to the war
against communism, calling it a "generational conflict" that cannot be
ended until America is delivered a decisive victory. "We're at greater
risk today than ever, and that's why the president is taking this firm
action," Wilson said, adding, "It's quite appropriate that President
Trump take the action to rid the world of this person who is a threat to
America's national security and a threat to American families. I'm just
so proud of the president's leadership to act so decisively." After the
news of the airstrike broke, U.S. **[[Sen. Lindsey
Graham]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one of Trump's staunchest allies, had
**[[quickly applauded Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and issued a
warning to the government in Tehran.]{.underline}** "To the Iranian
government: if you want more, you will get more," Graham said, according
to a statement. "If Iranian aggression continues and I worked at an
Iranian oil refinery, I would think about a new career." Graham said
that Trump's actions were in "direct response to Iranian aggression,"
including the recent killing of an American contractor in Iraq. The
rocket attack was aimed at an Iraqi military base, and believed to be
orchestrated by Iran-backed groups. "To the Iranian government: if you
want to stay in the oil business, leave America and our allies alone and
stop being the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world," Graham
said, according to the statement. **[U.S. [Sen. Tim Scott called the
move]{.mark}]{.underline}** "a calculated and
**[[proportional]{.underline}]{.mark}** response to Iran's belligerent
aggression towards the United States and our allies. "Iran and Soleimani
continued to attack and kill Americans, sieged our embassy in Baghdad,
and carried out acts of violence to destabilize the region as a whole,"
Scott said, according to a statement. "The President was absolutely
within his authority to approve this operation and we will not be
deterred when American lives and American interests are in jeopardy."
U.S. **[[Rep. Jeff Duncan also said he approved of Trump's
actions.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "This action shows Iranian attacks and
aggression against Americans will not go unnoticed under President
Trump's leadership," Duncan said, according to a statement. "Our

efforts in making the world a safer place without murderous terrorists
like Qassem Soleimani." U.S. **[[Rep. William

**[[called the president's actions]{.mark}]{.underline}** decisive and
**[[appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "That said, Americans at home

https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/18/democrats-reopened-debate-about-germline-editing/
lilw-msdi2022

WASHINGTON --- A rogue Chinese scientist stunned the world last year
when he announced the birth of genetically modified twin girls,
prompting widespread outcry from the broader scientific community and
calls for a "global moratorium" on editing human embryos that result in
births. Yet months later, **[[Democrats]{.mark} on Capitol Hill
surprised many science policy experts when they [attempted to roll back
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** related, **[[4-year-]{.underline}]{.mark}**old
**[[ban on altering the DNA of embryos]{.mark} intended for
pregnancies.]{.underline}** To many health policy experts here, and
research advocates across the country, the timing --- just months after
the biggest genome editing scandal in world history --- was
inexplicable. Several Republicans criticized the proposal by playing up
concerns of "maverick bioengineers" operating with little oversight and
without ethical norms. And while some scientists supported the effort,
others expressed open confusion, in particular at the breadth of the
change Democrats sought. Within weeks of proposing to eliminate their
plan, Democrats largely backed off. But **[[their sudden effort to
reverse what seemed to some like a basic ethical
protection]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[serves as a case study in
how]{.underline}]{.mark}** Washington regulates science --- and **[[the
immense influence lawmakers, regardless of their scientific expertise,
often wield over federal research.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "In terms of
'Why now,' it does seem odd given there is so much international
conversation in the scientific community about how to limit germline
editing," said Remy Brim, a scientist and former Democratic Capitol Hill
aide who works at the D.C. lobbying firm BGR. The United States has
banned germline editing with the aim of starting a pregnancy since 2015,
the result of bipartisan opposition to the practice and preemptive
scientific concern about the implications of the gene-editing technology
CRISPR. Republicans in particular have supported the ban due to
conscience concerns similar to those surrounding the use of fetal tissue
in research and using federal funds for abortion --- some argue that
germline genome editing requires the creation of human embryos that will
eventually be discarded. **[[When Democrats took control of the
House]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of Representatives in last year's
midterm elections[, they saw an opening to repeal a measure that many
felt was overly restrictive.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As the House
Appropriations Committee considered the spending package that funds the
Food and Drug Administration, lawmakers excluded the brief provision
that has banned the consideration of certain genome-editing trials --- a
change that would have essentially lifted the ban, if the law had
passed. **[[Republicans quickly criticized the
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, calling it hasty and ill-advised --- even
specifically citing China's "CRISPR babies" scandal, in which He Jiankui
drew worldwide criticism for using the technique to alter the genes of
twin girls.

**[[A House committee]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Tuesday
**[[restored]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
**[[pending]{.underline}]{.mark}** legislation a **[[ban on altering the
genomes of human embryos]{.underline}]{.mark}** intended for
pregnancies, despite calls from some scientists to lift the ban and
allow the Food and Drug Administration to review applications for new
technologies. Lifting the prohibition could have opened the door to
clinical trials of babies being made with genetic material from three
people or with genomes that had been changed in ways that would be
passed on to future generations. The ban has been attached to bills that
fund the Food and Drug Administration in the form of an amendment, or
rider, since December 2015. But last month, a subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee dropped the ban from the legislation. At a
hearing Tuesday, supporters of the ban framed it as a necessary barrier
to prevent experiments like the one announced last year in which a
Chinese scientist created the world's first gene-edited babies with the
technology CRISPR. The work drew worldwide condemnation for skirting
ethical and regulatory guidelines and for using scientific tools that
were not yet ready to be used in people. "The ethics hadn't caught up
with the science, and... the science has not caught up with the
science," said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), who introduced the rider
in 2015 and again at Tuesday's hearing. He said that for now,
genetically editing embryos had "too many unknowns, too many unintended
consequences." The rider blocks the Food and Drug Administration from
considering clinical trial applications "in which a human embryo is
intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic
modification." Scientists and ethicists who advocated for dropping it
argued that doing so would simply allow the FDA to review research
requests, as it does any other innovative therapy. Some **[[Democratic
lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** who had **[[appeared supportive of
dropping the ban]{.underline}]{.mark}** earlier ---
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** who had **[[criticized the inclusion of
the ban in 2015 without debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- said **[[they
felt it was time for Congress to debate the
underlying]{.underline}]{.mark}** ethical and **[[scientific
issues.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But they said that should be done
separately from the appropriations process. **[[The chairwoman of the
committee,]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Democrat Nita
Lowey]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of New York]{.underline}**, **[[said she
"reluctantly supported" returning the ban]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the
bill. **[[She acknowledged]{.mark}]{.underline}** that editing embryonic
DNA had some **[[potential risks, but added that it could cure and
prevent genetic disease]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "We have a moral
obligation to allow advances in science so that fewer parents have to
watch a child die," she said. Some scientists had called on Congress to
modify the legislation to allow so-called three-parent embryos but
maintain the ban on the direct editing of embryonic DNA. The
three-parent technology, more precisely called mitochondrial replacement
therapy, or MRT, has the potential to prevent severe diseases that
result from abnormal mitochondria, energy-producing cellular structures.
It involves transferring the nucleus of an unfertilized egg with
defective mitochondria into one with healthy mitochondria and then
fertilizing it via IVF. Because mitochondria have a small bit of their
own DNA, the resulting embryo has genes from three people. The
technology is being studied in some countries, including Britain, as a
way to halt the inheritance of genetic diseases that stem from the DNA
in the mitochondria. Rep. Sanford Bishop Jr. (D-Ga.), who chaired the
subcommittee that approved the bill without the ban last month, said he
wanted Congress to discuss allowing MRT, "but today is not that time,
and this appropriations committee markup is not that place." He
supported adding the ban back to the bill. **[[The committee approved
the amendment to reinsert the ban]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a voice
vote, but **[[one Democrat]{.underline}]{.mark}** who **[[voted against
it]{.underline}]{.mark}** was Rep. **[[Debbie

they carried the mutation. "If we ever have an opportunity when they
have children or when they decide to have a family, to have research
advanced to a point where you could have their genetic material, when
combined with their partner, altered so that that mutation could be cut
off in our family tree and that risk of death and massive health care
implications could be eliminated, that's incredibly important," she
said.]{.underline}**

Affairs---which was then, like the rest of Congress, under Republican
control---held a hearing on this subject. The hearing was titled,
"Undermining Democratic Institutions and Splintering NATO: Russian
Disinformation Aims." Analysts and former officials explained to the
committee how Russia had, in the words of one witness, persistently
funded propaganda in the West to "fracture allied security, stoke public
distrust against democratic institutions, and discredit the alliance
structures that defend Europe."

lilw-msdi2022

Of course, joining NATO isn't just a matter of Finland and Sweden
deciding to become members; it is also about whether current members
would agree to this. The conventional wisdom is that both countries
would be welcomed with open arms**[[. In the
U]{.mark}nited]{.underline}** **[[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**, that
would require at least two-thirds of the Senate voting to ratify their
membership. But exactly how that debate would go down could be quite
interesting --- especially in light of **[[the
GOP]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s slight-but-significant Trump-era **[[drift
into more skepticism of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And the looming
unknown would be Donald Trump himself weighing in on the process --- and
not necessarily in favor. The last two major NATO expansions came in
1999, when Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary joined, and in 2004,
when seven former communist countries and Soviet republics joined. The
latter was utterly uncontroversial, with the Senate voting 96 to 0 to
ratify their membership. But the former presents some important lessons
about how an addition of Finland and Sweden could unfold --- and who
might resist it. The vote wound up being strongly in favor, 80 to 19,
but there was plenty of uncertainty at the outset. Throughout the
debate, senators from both parties worried that the move would be viewed
as provocative by Russia. They warned about Russia perceiving the NATO
expansion as an "iron ring" around its borders. "I do believe this
replaces, symbolically, the Iron Curtain that was established in the
late '40s, which faced west, with now an iron ring of nations that face
east to Russia," Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) said during debate on the
subject. "That causes this senator a great deal of concern." Warner
proposed an amendment that would have barred any new NATO admissions for
three years, and it got 41 votes --- including many proponents of the
expansion being debated. In the years afterward, plenty of prominent
foreign policy observers questioned the wisdom of the expansion, as we
summarized last month: ... You need not look far into the past to see
studied minds cautioning about a situation much like the one we find
ourselves in today. Former Clinton administration defense secretary Bill
Perry said in 2016 that Putin bore most of the blame for Russia's
aggression in Crimea but that "I have to say that the United States
deserves much of the blame" for supporting NATO's expansion in Eastern
Europe. George Kennan, a former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union,
called it "a tragic mistake" after the Senate in 1998 ratified NATO
expansion, even as Russia was still picking up the pieces from the

warned at the same time, "We have no idea what we're getting into."
Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski argued relatively recently that
Ukraine should not join military alliances and instead stick with a
Finland-esque approach of remaining neutral while cooperating with the
West in other ways. All of that plays into the looming debate over
Finland and Sweden joining NATO. Expanding the alliance has been a
consensus issue --- and even a unanimous one in 2003-2004 --- but
**[[Russia's invasion of Ukraine brings into stark relief the prospect
of perceived provocation that critics had warned

strong repudiation of Putin, but it would also no doubt be provocative.
Russia has made clear its strong opposition, saying that NATO "remains a
tool geared towards confrontation" and that Finland and Sweden would
face "serious military and political consequences" if they joined. While
concerns about provocation historically have been bipartisan, the
question today seems to concern how Republicans might respond. Just last

**[[It's "America First]{.underline}]{.mark}**," not "Ukraine First,"

against Russia is all about redirecting taxpayer money to domestic

critical time for Ukraine's war effort. Much of the party, from the

Trump didn't care much about public policy when he was president. But he
did undermine this internationalist consensus, even using the old
"America First" slogan from an isolationist (and anti-Semitic) movement
from the 1930s. And while he had little success actually implementing
his foreign-policy preferences --- as he was repeatedly rolled by
Congress, the bureaucracy and allied nations --- it's quite possible he
could have the last laugh. Earlier this week, **[[an astonishing 63

Republican conference, but **[[it's not exactly a tiny

**[[Article 5.]{.underline}]{.mark}**" The bill couldn't completely bind
Trump, **[but it expressed the sense of Congress that "the President

was "to reject any efforts to withdraw the United States from NATO." It
also prohibited the use of federal funds "to take any action to withdraw
the United States" from the alliance. [Every Democrat voted for the

22 Republicans, **[[Rep. Scott Perry]{.underline}]{.mark}**, explained

voted to repeal this would-be new law." Perry wanted Trump to be free to
pull America out of NATO, on his own. **[[Perry]{.underline}]{.mark}**
also **[[argued that Trump should be free "to negotiate better

that America should hedge its commitments because our allies might screw
us. And that was all Putin needed. He didn't need American lawmakers to
love him the way Trump did. He just needed them to constrain or withhold
support from NATO. **[[Perry's defection was a particularly good sign
for Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The congressman wasn't just an Iraq
war veteran. He had also chaired part of the 2017 hearing on Russia's
strategy to undermine NATO. So he must have known he was doing what
Putin wanted. But he did it anyway, because he thought he was protecting
America from Europe. **[[In the three years since that vote, Congress

**[[Why did so many Republicans vote against the latest pro-NATO
resolution?]{.mark} [Some openly reject the
alliance.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "NATO is a relic of the Cold War," said
Rep. Thomas Massie. "Why should Americans pay for Europe's defense?"
**[[Others said the U.S. should be wary of

support for NATO is unconditional]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Rep.
Warren Davidson. But **[[others]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including Perry,
**[[complained that the resolution threatened American
sovereignty.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In a video statement, Perry told his
constituents that the resolution "politicizes NATO" by saying "if you're
not supporting socialism, then we're going to use NATO against you."
This is a bizarre misrepresentation. The resolution affirmed that NATO
was "founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the
rule of law." Those words are literally in the alliance's founding
treaty. The resolution also called for "unwavering support to the people
of Ukraine." And it endorsed a project, jointly proposed by Democratic
and Republican lawmakers, to build "NATO's capacity to strengthen
democratic institutions within NATO member, partner, and aspirant
countries." To make sure nobody misconstrued that language as an attack
on sovereignty, the resolution stipulated that any NATO monitoring of
"challenges to democracy" within member states would be undertaken only
"when requested." Perry ignored that stipulation and caricatured the
resolution. So did several of his colleagues. Representative Chip Roy
described the resolution as "empowering international organizations to
target the internal activities of sovereign nations." Davidson described
it as "using NATO to try to undermine America's sovereignty." **[[Some
members who opposed the measure also expressed hostility toward
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Davidson said "global commitments" to
accords on climate, banking, and other issues were forcing the U.S. to
adopt the "inferior system" of "the Europeans."

### PC Key to Dem Unity 

#### Biden carefully treading line to keep Dems united now, but future divides can break that

Democrats are destroying one of Trumpism's biggest lies" WaPo March 18,

A funny thing is happening in U.S. politics right now. President
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} and Democratic leaders [are [working
closely with the left]{.mark} on a variety of fronts]{.underline}, and
while complications, challenges and future divisions loom, [it's all
unfolding more smoothly than you might have expected.]{.underline} And
the political sky isn't crashing down on Democrats' heads. In fact,
Americans appear to be concluding that things are getting better. This
wasn't supposed to happen. The GOP's 2020 campaign narrative --- made
especially poisonous by a certain former president --- was that
Democratic rule would run the country into the ground precisely because
Democrats would prove wholly captive to their crazy socialist left
flank. Now [Biden and Democratic leaders actually are working with the
party's left [to a surprising and salutary degree]{.mark}.]{.underline}
And that surely helps explain some of their early successes --- and
those successes' popularity. Politico has a remarkable new report on a
meeting between White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain and progressive
House members. In it, the progressives pressed Klain on numerous fronts,
and the conversation appeared constructive. For instance, progressives
suggested Biden's next big initiative --- infrastructure --- should
include not just transportation projects but also ones on climate change
and health care. The sticking point is that if Biden wants GOP support,
he'll have to confine it to transportation, and progressives don't want
the quest for bipartisanship to water down the outcome. So Klain said
one possibility would be to pursue separate bills --- passing
roads-and-bridges projects with GOP support and others with just
Democrats by simple Senate majority through reconciliation. That
prompted Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) to tell Politico that she thinks
the White House shares the progressive "commitment to addressing
climate." Klain and progressives also discussed a package raising taxes
on corporations and incomes over \$400,000, as Biden is reportedly
mulling. Jayapal called this a "very good discussion." On immigration,
Klain said they're working hard to improve humanitarian conditions at
the border for child migrants, a sticking point on the left. Jayapal
said the White House understands they have to "more quickly work" to
"speed that up." [[The overwhelming takeaway here is that Biden and the
White House are working hard to keep things running smoothly with the
party's left]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, Biden and Democratic
leaders have largely adopted the progressive reading of the folly of
chasing bipartisanship for its own sake. In short, they are talking to
the left, while largely accepting that the GOP is essentially cutting
itself out of the conversation about how to address the country's major
challenges. Take the \$1.9 trillion rescue package. While some outcomes
disappointed the left --- the loss of the minimum wage hike --- the
ultimate result was the most far-reaching piece of progressive
legislation in a half century. Its scale and ambition, secured precisely
because Democrats refused to chase GOP support, unified the party. Sen.
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called it "the most significant legislation for
working people that has passed in decades." Indeed, Sanders himself
played a key role making it both ambitious and unifying. As Jeet Heer
notes, this shows how the left can influence the party via a combination
of advocacy and inside-game playing. But it also shows that Biden and
Democratic leaders see the benefits of this for policy outcomes --- and
for the party. It's hard to overstate how dramatically different all
this is from the 2020 Trumpist/GOP narrative. The story was that a
mentally deteriorating Biden would quickly become captive to the radical
socialist left, and that this would drive the stupendous Trump economy
(soaring after he vanquished covid) into a "depression." The GOP tactic
of lumping together mainstream Democrats and liberals with terrifying
radical elements (such as depicting civil rights liberals as tools of
communism) has a long history. But Trumpism added his own special poison
to the brew. Think back to the Georgia Senate runoffs. Republicans
argued that the radical left threatened to take over the Senate through
the (moderate and unassuming) figures of Jon Ossoff and Raphael G.
Warnock. GOP ads depicted violent, unchecked antifa mobs and non-White
socialist lawmakers plotting to convert the country into a hellscape of
socialist devastation. Now go watch Ossoff on MSNBC, talking soberly
about the benefits the rescue package will deliver to Georgia residents,
and how this passed without any GOP support in Congress but with
extraordinarily broad support among voters, including many Republican
ones. Meanwhile, competent governance has vaccinations on track and may
soon defeat covid-19. A Democratic center-left alliance largely did
that. And the country broadly approves, even as GOP lawmakers sat it out
entirely. All this has important implications for what's next.
Republicans are reduced to admitting we're likely to see an economic
boom while arguing it has nothing to do with Biden or Democrats. But as
Michael Grunwald points out, Trump's prediction of a Biden depression
will make that harder to pull off. That has left Republicans hoping all
this spending produces inflation or that they can fearmonger about the
deficits that they themselves pumped up with tax cuts for the rich and
corporations. [To be clear, [a lot can still go
wrong]{.mark}.]{.underline} Republicans are betting Biden's efforts to
solve our border problems humanely will create long-term chaos, allowing
them to claim Trump had it right all along. Getting the border right is
an extremely difficult task and will make for very tough politics.
[Meanwhile, [more Democratic divisions loom]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
over how to revisit the minimum-wage hike and over whether to end the
filibuster to protect voting rights.

Mr [Biden is no stranger to tough starts]{.underline}, given that he
became vice-president to Barack Obama at the height of the financial
crisis. But the problems now confronting the country are arguably more
severe and multi-faceted than they were in 2009, requiring even more
sure-handed intervention and political skill. Many Democrats believe Mr
Obama spent too much of his first year trying to win bipartisan support
for his plans. They are well aware that to be successful, Mr Biden will
need to show rapid concrete results. "To be able to deliver tangibly in
the near term in ways that all people in the country can see and feel
and know is a critically important thing to do," says Mara Rudman,
vice-president for policy at the Center for American Progress, a
left-leaning Washington think-tank, and a former official in the Clinton
and Obama administrations. "We have had a self-perpetuating cycle in a
very negative direction," she adds. "I think we have the opportunity [to
get to a self-perpetuating cycle in the positive
direction."]{.underline} The president-elect's transition team has
already set out plans for a barrage of unilateral executive orders
during the first 10 days to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and scrap
the travel ban imposed on certain Muslim-majority countries, undoing
some of Mr Trump's most controversial policies. It has also made clear
that Mr Biden wants to rebuild the US's traditional alliances with other
western nations that frayed during the past four years, while being more
focused in confronting strategic rivals such as China and Russia. But Mr
Biden has tried to focus the attention of lawmakers rattled by the
assault on the Capitol --- and an anxious public --- primarily on his
prescriptions to resolve America's health and economic crises, as he
prepares to enter the White House. Nearly 400,000 Americans have died
from Covid-19, and 9.8m fewer Americans are employed compared with last
February. At the Queen, the president-elect called on Congress to pass
his sweeping relief plan, which includes a new round of direct payments
to Americans, aid to cash-strapped states and cities, a top-up of
federal jobless benefits, a beefed-up tax credit for children and more
funding for vaccinations. Securing its passage will be the first big
test of Mr Biden's presidency, and no easy task given his Democratic
party's exceedingly tight edge in both the House of Representatives and
the Senate --- and the toxic climate on Capitol Hill that may be
exacerbated by Mr Trump's second impeachment trial. "There is going to
be a compulsion to get something done and get something done quickly,
but it is definitely under more difficult circumstances given the
political environment, the non-cooperation of the Trump administration,
the severity of the pandemic itself and the close margins in Congress,"
says John Lawrence, former chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi, the House
speaker. "[It is going to be tough."]{.underline} Seizing the agenda Mr
[[Biden's urgency]{.underline}]{.mark} in pushing for a large-scale
coronavirus relief package --- less than a month after another fiscal
stimulus package, worth \$900bn, was agreed by Congress --- [[reflects
the knowledge that new presidents often have a short window to make use
of their political capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} Midterm elections,
where the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate
will be up for grabs, will take place in less than two years, and Mr
Biden's Democratic predecessors, Mr Obama and Bill Clinton, each saw
their agendas curbed and upended after their party lost control of the
House in 2010 and 1994 respectively. "What you really have in American
politics is 18 months. [[Every administration gets 18 months of
policymaking]{.mark} every four years]{.underline}," says Glenn
Hutchins, founder of private equity group Silver Lake Partners and a
former Clinton administration official. "So once you\'ve begun the
process of cleaning up the dystopian nightmare that Trump left behind,
how do you then pivot to addressing the long term underlying issues of
importance? [[What do you choose to focus on]{.mark}? That\'s going to
be the main thing." As the new administration grapples with priorities,
[there has been plenty of debate among Democrats]{.mark} in recent years
about how to make progressive policies more easy to understand and more
popular with the American public]{.underline} --- which Mr Biden's team
has tried to absorb both in crafting its policies and its communication.
"[[The ambitions are at the New Deal scale]{.underline}]{.mark}, they
are about kitchen table, lunch-pail, meat-and-potatoes economic concerns
that people have," says Kenneth Baer, a former senior Obama
administration official and co-founder of Crosscut Strategies, a
consultancy in Washington. "And \[the message is\] we are going to help
you." In addition to the \$1.9tn stimulus package laid out by Mr Biden
last week, he is expected to move quickly in February to present a
second recovery plan involving trillions of dollars in additional
spending centred on infrastructure and green energy. To be at least
partially funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, it is
another hugely ambitious legislative endeavour. Mr Biden's hopes of a
successful first-term agenda did receive a big boost on January 5, the
eve of the assault on the US Capitol, when Raphael Warnock and Jon
Ossoff, two Democrats, won a pair of run-off Senate races in Georgia.
The twin victories handed control of the upper chamber to Mr Biden's
party --- albeit with a 50:50 split and tiebreaking votes cast by Kamala
Harris, the incoming vice-president. Given that the Democrats now get to
decide which proposals can be put up for a vote in the Senate, the
Georgia results ensure that, at the very least, Mr Biden's goals will
not be blocked by Mitch McConnell, the Republican senate leader, at
every turn. Mr [[Biden's ability to enact crucial parts of his agenda
will initially depend on keeping the Democratic party fully united
behind any legislation]{.underline}]{.mark}, marrying the needs of
conservative lawmakers with those of the progressive bloc, [[with very
little room for defection]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[lose]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By winning on more **[roll
calls]{.underline}** because of this [influence]{.underline}, presidents
can affect the [**public policies** produced through **the legislative
process**]{.underline}.

This study conducted several types of analyses to estimate the amount of
presidential influence. Since it can be hard to isolate causal effects
with observational data, [this research paired [regression with]{.mark}
**quasi-[experimental treatment]{.mark} effects [analyses]{.mark}**. The
treatment effects analysis [for]{.mark} **the years 19[53 to]{.mark}
20[12]{.mark}** [suggests]{.mark} that [when the president takes
**a**]{.mark} **roll call [position]{.mark}**[, the]{.mark} president's
[side]{.mark} will [win]{.mark} an **additional [9%]{.mark} of House
floor [votes]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} about five out of the fifty-four
roll call positions that presidents take]{.underline}, on average,
annually. Although **[five additional victories]{.underline}** may not
sound like much, if it [leads to **[five]{.mark} major policy
[enactments]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it may be consequential for the
lives of citizens.2

Moreover, [five additional pieces of legislation add up over the
years---[in **a**]{.mark} **four-year [term]{.mark}**[, there might be
**twenty**]{.mark} **additional [enactments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From
another perspective, Ansolabehere, [Palmer, and Schneer]{.underline}
(2016, 2018) [estimate]{.underline} that [there are **eight or nine
major legislative enactments per Congress**]{.underline} from 1789 to
2010 and about seventeen from 1953 to 2010. [**[The]{.mark} estimated
[five]{.mark} additional pieces of legislation** presidents receive from
position taking [is]{.mark} **nearly [30% of]{.mark} major
[enactments]{.mark}** [in **the**]{.mark} **late [modern
period]{.mark}**]{.underline}, assuming all the additional presidential
wins are on major legislation. Through position taking, presidents can
have consequential impacts on the nation\'s policies.

As conceptualized here, presidential influence is rooted in the office
and in the surrounding political environment, termed \"institutional
presidential influence.\" There is some similarity between this
conceptualization of influence and studies that emphasize the importance
of contextual and political factors for presidential success (Bond and
Fleisher 1990; Edwards 1990). But presidents still must decide whether
to apply those institutional and contextual levers of influence; they
need to be strategic decision makers, too. Hence, [presidential
influence is not]{.underline} merely a matter of [dumb luck]{.underline}
(Rockman 1981). Some presidents may be luckier than others, in that the
office and the political environment provide them with greater
resources, such as party control, upon which they can draw. But
[[presidents]{.mark} still [decide **whether**]{.mark}, **when**,
**how**, and **with whom** [they will exert **effort**, and **how
much**]{.mark}, when trying [to influence Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- A2 PC not finite

#### Biden PC is finite and must be used wisely

**Young 2020** J.T. Young former director of communications in the
Office of Management and Budget under GWB. "Biden\'s political position
is tougher than Trump\'s" The Hill. 11/28/20.
\<https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/527809-bidens-political-position-is-tougher-than-trumps\>
Accessed 1/6/20. ARJH

President-elect Joe [[Biden faces]{.underline}]{.mark} a tougher
political position than President Donald Trump did when he took office.
This is because of Biden's [[thin congressional margins, a fractious
Democratic Party and]{.mark} his [limited political capital]{.mark} to
address these liabilities.]{.underline} Mathematics' transitive property
does not apply in politics. In math, if A is greater than B, and B is
greater than C, then A must be greater than C. In 2016, Hillary Clinton
won more votes than Trump; in 2020, Biden won more votes than Clinton.
Yet when Biden takes office next year, he will be in a tougher political
position than Trump was in 2017. When Trump took office, despite losing
the popular vote by two percentage points, Republicans controlled the
House with a 241 to 194 majority and the Senate with a 51 to 49
majority. When Biden takes office in 2021, at best he will have the
smallest congressional majorities in 20 years. And he may well not even
have that. Should Real Clear Politics's three uncalled races all go to
the Republicans (and they currently lead in all three), Democrats would
hold just 222 of the House's 435 seats --- allowing them to lose four
members on each vote and still pass legislation. In the Senate, Biden
needs Democrats to win both of Georgia's two runoffs to just get to a
50-50 Senate, in which Vice President Kamala Harris could cast the
tie-breaking vote. If Democrats lose even one of those races,
Republicans will control the chamber. Should that happen, Biden would be
the first president since George H. W. Bush in 1989 to enter into office
with his party being in the Senate's minority and without full control
of Congress. Without control of the Senate, Biden's ambitious campaign
agenda could be stymied. [Even [with control]{.mark}]{.underline} by
virtue of Harris, [[Biden could not lose a single Democrat senator's
vote]{.mark} and still pass legislation]{.underline}. In the House,
depending on the currently three undecided races' outcomes, [Biden could
lose anywhere from just four to seven Democrats and still pass
legislation]{.underline}. At best, [those are [extremely tight
squeezes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some argue that lack of Senate control
could help Biden by giving him cover for not achieving the Democratic
Party's left wing's demands. Still, the left --- the biggest block of
the party --- will expect him to deliver, without reducing demands.
After all, Biden promised the left a lot to win the nomination. Coupled
with the Democratic Party's losses in the House and inability to pick up
Senate seats, redistricting following the 2020 Census could cost the
Democrats up to six seats. The 2020 election is more about Trump's loss
than Biden's victory. This one-sided dynamic means that many of those
who voted for Biden did not support him as much as they opposed Trump.
With Trump now dispatched, Biden has his work cut out for him to keep
this disparate marriage of convenience together. Evidence of Biden
supporters' lack of attachment to him was clear from polling. On
Election Day, Morning Consult published a poll in which 44 percent of
Biden voters said their vote was against Trump, while 54 percent said it
was for Biden. In contrast, 75 percent of Trump voters supported the
president and just 22 percent were voting against Biden. [Trump's
presidency proves that [a personal base is an invaluable political
commodity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump's followers supported him through
four years of media and opposition vilification. This year alone, it
stuck with him through impeachment, pandemic, economic collapse and
summer rioting, increasing his popular vote total by 11 million and
leaving him just short of reelection. [[Personal political power
influences politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. So too does its absence. A
president with it can wield it for and against others. Trump was able to
so quickly gain control of the party because he had it. [[Without his
own substantial personal base, Biden is at a tremendous
disadvantage]{.underline}]{.mark} to Trump as he enters office.
Certainly, [[as Biden takes office, there will be an immediate]{.mark},
general good feeling, a desire for normalcy and [hope for
success]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} However it happens though, this
honeymoon ends quickly and, like a couple, the marriage dependent on a
honeymoon for long-term happiness, is in trouble. The question for Biden
is whether he can successfully forge a personal attachment with the
electorate and then use it to aid him with Congress. His difficulty lies
in the fact that this is the opposite of the way the presidential
dynamic usually works.

Third, [**agenda-setting** offers the White House the **opportunity** to
highlight **its priorities**]{.underline}, how they are distributed
across various policy issues, and in which way policies should be
packaged (Rudalevige 2005, 437ff; Wayne 2009b, 317ff). Because [**the
[resources]{.mark}** of **any administration** [to lobby **Congress**
are **not infinite**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the multiple political
arenas are usually heavily crowded with myriad policy items and problems
striving to be solved, [[the White House needs to prioritize
**its**]{.mark} **policy [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This involves,
among other things, [to [select **some issues over others**,
decide]{.mark} about **their [sequencing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, how to
pursue them, [and [how much **p**]{.mark}olitical **[c]{.mark}**apital
it **wants or needs** [to spend on **any**]{.mark} **given
[item]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, [the administration will focus
on **certain policies** with **more attention**, on others **with
less**, depending on the **prioritization** by the
presiden]{.underline}t but also upon other considerations, such as the
overall density of the policy agenda or imminent pressures of the time.
[The trick is to **not overwhelm** Congress with **the president's
initiatives**. As **L**]{.underline}yndon **[B]{.underline}**.
**[J]{.underline}**ohnson famously [quipped, ["Congress is]{.mark} like
**[a]{.mark} Whiskey [drinker]{.mark}**]{.underline}. You can put an

**his throat at one time**, [he'll throw]{.mark} it
[up."]{.mark}]{.underline} (cited in Rudalevige 2002, 113). Thus, [the
failure to prioritize easily leads to overload of Pennsylvania Avenue
with Congress at the one end]{.underline}, and to excessive demands and
exhaustion for the White House at the other end. [**The [rocky
start]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **the [Clinton]{.mark}

the White House did not]{.mark} pursue **a 'rifle-approach'** to
[define]{.mark} **clear policy [priorities]{.mark}** for its **initial
months** and then **execute them**, [it got lost in **numerous**]{.mark}
**legislative [battles]{.mark}** [and **mine-fields**]{.mark} early on

[[The paradox for Biden is that the more successful he

[[the more difficulty he could encounter in building bipartisan

### 2NC A2 Warming inevitable

#### Every bit of mitigation matters.

Look Like?" ThinkProgress

This is Why Reducing Emissions is Critical

[[We're not yet committed to surpassing 2°]{.mark}C]{.underline} global
[warming]{.underline}, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} as Watson noted,
[**[we are]{.mark} quickly [running out of time]{.mark}** to
realistically give ourselves a chance to stay below that 'danger
limit']{.underline}. However, 2°C is not a do-or-die threshold.
**[[Every bit of]{.mark} CO2 [emissions]{.mark} we can reduce [means
that much avoided future warming]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[which
means]{.mark} that much [avoided]{.mark} [climate change]{.mark}
impacts]{.underline}. As Lonnie Thompson noted, [[the more]{.mark}
global warming [we]{.mark} manage to [mitigate]{.mark}, [the
less]{.mark} adaption and [suffering]{.mark} we will be forced to cope
with [in the future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Realistically, based on the current political climate (which we will
explore in another post next week), limiting global warming to 2°C is
probably the best we can do. However, [there is a big difference between
2°C and 3°C]{.underline}, between 3°C [and 4°C]{.underline}, and
**[[anything greater than 4°]{.mark}C [can]{.mark} probably accurately
[be]{.mark} described as [catastrophic]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[since]{.mark} various [tipping points are]{.mark} expected to be
[triggered]{.mark} at this level.]{.underline} Right now, **[we are on
track for the catastrophic consequences]{.underline}** ([widespread
[coral mortality]{.mark}, [mass extinctions]{.mark}, [hundreds of
millions of people]{.mark} adversely [impacted]{.mark} by droughts,
floods, heat waves]{.underline}, etc.). **[[But we're not
stuck]{.underline}]{.mark}** on that track just yet, and [[we need
to]{.mark} move ourselves **[as far off]{.mark}** of it [as
possible]{.mark} by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions **as soon and
as much as possible**.]{.underline}

There are of course many people who believe that the planet will not
warm as much, or that the impacts of the associated climate change will
be as bad as the body of scientific evidence suggests. That is certainly
a possiblity, and we very much hope that their optimistic view is
correct. However, what we have presented here is the best summary of
scientific evidence available, and it paints a very bleak picture if we
fail to rapidly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.

[If we continue forward on our current path, catastrophe is not just a
possible outcome, it is the most probable outcome]{.underline}. And an
[intelligent [risk management]{.mark}]{.underline} approach [[would
involve]{.mark} taking steps to prevent a catastrophic
scenario]{.underline} if it were a mere possibility, let alone the most
probable outcome. [This is especially true since]{.underline} the most
important component of the solution -- [[carbon
pricing]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[can be implemented at a relatively
low cost]{.underline}**, [and a far lower cost than trying to adapt to
the climate change consequences we have discussed here]{.underline}
(Figure 4).

#### Not inevitable -- cuts now have an IMMEDIATE effect

[[Carbon dioxide emission cuts will **immediately affect** the rate of
future global warming]{.underline}]{.mark} Concordia and MIT researchers
show Montreal, April 2, 2013 -- [There is a persistent misconception
among both scientists and the public that there is a delay between
emissions of carbon dioxide]{.underline} (CO2) [and the climate's
response to those emissions]{.underline}. This misconception has led
policy makers to argue that CO2 emission cuts implemented now will not
affect the climate system for many decades. [This **erroneous line of
argument** makes the climate problem **seem more intractable** than it
actually is]{.underline}, say Concordia University's Damon Matthews and
MIT's Susan Solomon in a recent Science article. The researchers show
that [[**immediate decreases** in CO2 emissions would in fact result in
an **immediate decrease** in the rate of climate
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}. Explains Matthews, professor in the
Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, "[If we can
successfully decrease CO2 emissions in the near future, this change will
be felt by the climate system when the emissions reductions are
implemented]{.underline} **[-- not in several decades]{.underline}**.\"
"[The potential for a **quick climate response** to prompt cuts in CO2
emissions opens up the possibility that the climate benefits of
emissions reductions would occur on the same timescale as the political
decisions themselves.]{.underline}" In their paper, Matthews and
Solomon, Ellen Swallow Richards professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and
Climate Science, show that [the onus for slowing the rate of global
warming falls squarely on current efforts at reducing CO2 emissions, and
the resulting future emissions that we produce]{.underline}. This means
that there are critical implications for the equity of carbon emission
choices currently being discussed internationally. Total emissions from
developing countries may soon exceed those from developed nations. But
developed countries are expected to maintain a far higher per-capita
contribution to present and possible future warming. "[This]{.underline}
disparity [clarifies the urgency for low-carbon technology investment
and diffusion]{.underline} to enable developing countries to continue to
develop," says Matthews. "[[Emission **cuts made now** will have an
**immediate effect** on the rate of global
warming]{.underline},"]{.mark} he asserts. "I see more hope for averting
difficult-to-avoid negative impacts by accelerating advances in
technology development and diffusion, than for averting climate system
changes that are already inevitable. Given the enormous scope and
complexity of the climate mitigation challenge, [clarifying these points
of hope is critical to motivate change]{.underline}."

hypothesis [[from]{.mark} [both]{.mark} **[computer
simulations]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[real-world
data]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Starting from a single ancestor digital
organism, the authors let artificial life communities evolve for
hundreds of thousands of generations under different, stable
environmental settings. These simulated communities included both
free-living and \'parasite\' digital organisms that helped researchers
investigate how biodiversity and ecological networks develop over time,
under different environmental conditions. Over several generations, both
hosts and parasites diversified, and their interactions became more
complex. The [authors]{.underline} then investigated how these
communities would respond to different scenarios of biodiversity loss.
They [found]{.underline} that [[when species]{.mark} [become]{.mark}
[extinct]{.mark} in a sequence [consistent with]{.mark} their degree of
adaptation to]{.underline} the [[\'natural\']{.mark} environmental
[conditions]{.mark} within which they had evolved, [their

[Any [deviation from this]{.mark} pattern [however]{.mark}, may
[trigger]{.mark} **[extinction cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline},

network]{.mark}**. The tendency of consuming species to rely and
specialise]{.underline} (develop in a way most suited to the
environment) [on dependable resources]{.underline} has
[enabled]{.underline} the [evolution of complex systems. This basic
mechanism may have doomed many species to extinction]{.underline} \--
the authors demonstrate it by comparing the results of their artificial
life simulations with several empirical host-parasite networks of
different animal groups. Resources that had been largely available in
the past are now becoming increasingly scarce, putting at risk the
species that rely on them.

begin will determine whether the U.S. will have the scientific
wherewithal it needs for the years ahead. Flexible, thoughtful talks
ought to be able to produce an agreement that can be signed into law.
The House and Senate approaches are much more alike than they are
different, and too much is at stake to let this opportunity pass. Both
bills would create a new directorate at the National Science Foundation
--- an agency that has been funding research at universities since 1950.
There are two sets of issues that must be resolved --- both of which
relate to longstanding debates about the role of the federal government
in research. The first concerns the purpose and nature of the research
the federal government should fund. The Senate legislation makes
maintaining U.S. competitiveness the overriding goal for the new
directorate; the House allows work on a wider set of problems. The final
bill should make competitiveness at least one focus for the new
directorate. Competitiveness is, in part, a technological problem that
can be addressed through targeted research investments in basic science.
Moreover, **[[the U.S. will be hard-pressed to solve]{.mark} any other
issues, like [inequity and climate change, if]{.mark} we are [in
relative economic decline.]{.mark} How could a new research program best
deal with competitiveness? By pursuing]{.underline}** a kind of research
federal programs have often neglected called **[use-inspired basic
research]{.underline}**. **[This means [building research around solving
specific problems]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- but problems **[[that
require breakthroughs]{.underline}]{.mark}** in basic understanding of
natural phenomena. **[A classic example is the research that led to the
creation of semiconductors]{.underline}** --- the circuits that are the
basis of our phones and computers. That research was designed to replace
vacuum tubes, which were fragile and ungainly, but it required such
fundamental new knowledge that the work earned a Nobel Prize. This kind
of research is different from basic, curiosity-driven research ---
research driven just by the desire to understand the world better. That
kind of work is essential, but it should not be the sole purpose of
federal funding or university lab work. Use-inspired research is also
different from applied or translational research --- the work to turn
the knowledge we have already at hand into useful processes and
products. That work is also critical, but much of it should be left to
industry to fund and to carry out. The second set of issues relates to
where federally funded research should occur. Since at least the end of
World War II, concerns have been raised that research is concentrated in
too few locations, mostly on the coasts. The concern has intensified as
economic growth has become more closely tied to being near leading
science and technology centers. Both bills take aim at this issue. The
Senate approach is to require fully one-fifth of the National Science
Foundation's money to be distributed through a program that funds work
only in states that have not been the top winners of competitive federal
research grants. The House approach is to try to build expertise at
particular schools that have research programs but are not research
leaders, including schools with large minority enrollments. Mixing these
paths in a balanced way could help create centers of excellence in
specific fields throughout the country and do so without losing the
boost the U.S. as a whole gets by having a few dozen universities that
are world leaders in research. The metric needs to be whether the
distribution will strengthen U.S. research and prosperity around the
country, not just whether everyone is getting some money. Congress has
worked through these issues before when it created the federal agencies,
like the National Science Foundation, that have underwritten so much of
the research that has kept the U.S. prosperous and secure since 1945.
But **[[today we face urgent new challenges]{.mark},]{.underline}**
including a rising China. **[[Congress needs to]{.mark} rise to the
occasion --- as it did after World War II and after the launch of
Sputnik --- and make an investment in new institutions that can [ensure
continued U.S. leadership.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Turns Cyber 

#### China bills reduce cyber threats and protect critical infrastructure

DEJA VU --- [**[If all goes according to plan]{.mark}** for]{.underline}
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this week, we could see some
movement on his closely watched [[China competition
package]{.underline},]{.mark} [which [includes **cyber**]{.mark}
**[provisions]{.mark}** focused [on **cybersecurity** **worker
training**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} battling [disinformation]{.mark}.
**Schumer**]{.underline} [has promised to **bring his bill** to the
**floor this week**]{.underline}. To do that, [he's likely
to]{.underline} just drop the text of the Senate's U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act into the House's America COMPETES Act and [leave it up
to a conference committee to negotiate the difference between the two.
While most of the headlines have focused on the legislation's big-ticket
\$52 billion in funding for]{.underline} **[domestic semiconductor
production]{.underline}**, [cyber-minded lawmakers, lobbyists and
industry leaders will be watching closely to make sure that the
following cyber items remain in the package:]{.underline} --- [Laying a
foundation for funding]{.underline}: [USICA includes a provision
[establishing a program]{.mark} [at the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[D]{.underline}**]{.mark}epartment of
**[[H]{.underline}]{.mark}**omeland **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ecurity

**cyber**]{.mark} **[threats]{.mark}** [facing]{.mark} the different
**U.S. [critical infrastructure sectors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
process]{.underline}, which plays off of a recommendation from the
Cyberspace Solarium Commission, [would give the federal government a
good base point for determining which **critical infrastructure risks**
to **prioritize each year**.]{.underline} --- State Department
disinformation funding: [[Both bills]{.mark} provide the State
Department's Global Engagement Center]{.underline}, [which is designed
to [counter **foreign disinformation**]{.mark} [and
**propaganda**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with **\$150 million** in funding
to increase its ability to fight these campaigns ahead of the midterm
elections.]{.underline} --- CyberCorps investments: [The House bill
expands the budget for an ROTC-like program for the federal cyber
workforce]{.underline}, [known as CyberCorps]{.underline}, from \$60
million to \$90 million. The program awards scholarships to enrollees in
cyber degree programs, and in return, participating students promise to
work for the U.S. government for up to four years in a cyber-related
position. The new funds would allow the CyberCorps to increase the
number of students it accepts as well as the number of universities and
community colleges it can partner with.

#### Bill solves cybersecurity deficiencies.

Line on USICA/COMPETES Chips, Cyber, Innovation Bill", No Publication,

Lawmakers Call for Cyber Provisions to Make the Cut [As Congress moves
closer to beginning the conferencing process, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine,
and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., called for the [final bill]{.mark} to
[include **cybersecurity measures that both**]{.mark} **USICA and
America COMPETES [share]{.mark}**, as well as others contained in one
bill or the other.]{.underline} Sen. King and Rep. Gallagher, who
co-chaired the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, sent a letter to Sen.
Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., voicing their
support for the [**\$52 [billion in]{.mark} CHIPS [funding]{.mark}**
included in the bills, but said that the final bill should reflect the
need for **[enhanced investment in]{.mark} the [cyber
workforce]{.mark}** []{.mark}and the nation's **[cyber posture]{.mark}
as a whole**.]{.underline} "Congress has a critical opportunity to
advance and secure U.S. global technological leadership for the 21st
century," King and Gallagher wrote. "In doing so, it must also invest in
America's cybersecurity and critical infrastructure resilience." [Among
that highlighted legislation is the **Cybersecurity Opportunity
[Act]{.mark}**, which would create a grant program to **[increase
investment in cyber education]{.mark}** at HBCUs and minority-serving
institutions, as well as language that would create rotational learning
opportunities for Federal cyber employees. Additionally, the lawmakers
called for the final inclusion of a measure to expand the ROTC-like
CyberCorps program that is included in the America COMPETES bill. Other
COMPETES provisions the pair argued for include designating **Critical
Technology [Security Centers]{.mark}**, and creating programs designed
to **[build international]{.mark} cyber [capacity for]{.mark} the U.S.
and its [allies]{.mark}**. As far as USICA cyber components the pair
called to make the cut, they pointed to investments in regional
technology hubs, as well as the creation of **a National Risk Management
Cycle**.]{.underline} The latter represents a solution to a problem the
Cyberspace Solarium Commission identified in its March 2020 report. The
commission was then government-chartered but has since transitioned to a
non-profit organization. ["In our March 2020 report, the Cyberspace
Solarium Commission noted that the U.S. [government **'lacks**]{.mark}
**a [rigorous]{.mark}, codified, and routinely exercised
[process']{.mark}** for identifying risk. By creating a National Risk
Management Cycle, Congress would codify an essential capability for
properly **resourcing U.S. government efforts to deter threats and
[mitigate risks to critical infrastructure]{.mark}**," the letter says.
"The cyber threats facing our country have never been greater, and
American technological leadership will depend significantly on our
ability to defend against those threats and recover quickly from
disruptions to critical infrastructure,"]{.underline} they wrote. "As
such, we strongly urge that the provisions we have highlighted here be
included in the final conferenced legislation that crosses President
Biden's desk later this year."

#### Causes [tit-for-tat escalation]{.underline} to nuke war.

**Klare 19** \[Michael T. Klare, professor emeritus of peace and world
security studies at Hampshire College, "Cyber Battles, Nuclear Outcomes?
Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation," Arms Control Association,
November 2019,
armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation\]

Yet [another pathway to [escalation could arise from]{.mark} a
[cascading]{.mark} series of [cyberstrikes and counterstrikes
against]{.mark} vital [national infra]{.mark}structure rather than on
military targets.]{.underline} [All major powers, along with [Iran and
No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea, have [developed and deployed]{.mark}
[cyberweapons]{.mark} designed [to]{.mark} disrupt and
[destroy]{.mark}]{.underline} major elements of an adversary's [key
[economic systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as [power grids, financial
systems, and transportation network]{.underline}s. As noted, Russia has
infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, and it is widely believed that the
United States has done the same in Russia.12 The Pentagon has also
devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus," intended to immobilize the entire
Iranian economy and so force it to capitulate to U.S. demands or, if
that approach failed, to pave the way for a crippling air and missile
attack.13

The danger here is that [economic attacks of this sort, if undertaken
during a period of tension and crisis, [could lead to]{.mark} an
[escalating]{.mark} series of [tit-for-tat attacks against]{.mark} ever
more vital elements of an adversary's critical
[infra]{.mark}structure]{.underline}, producing widespread chaos and
harm and [eventually leading one side to [initiate kinetic attacks
on]{.mark} critical [military targets]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[risking
the [slippery slope to nuclear]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
For example, [a Russian cyberattack on the U.S. power grid]{.underline}
[could trigger U.S. attacks on]{.underline} Russian [energy and
financial systems]{.underline}, causing widespread disorder in both
countries and [[generating an impulse for]{.mark} even [more devastating
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. At some point, such attacks "could [lead
[to]{.mark} major conflict and possibly **[nuc]{.mark}lear
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}."14

These are by no means the only pathways to escalation resulting from the
offensive use of cyberweapons. Others include efforts by third parties,
such as proxy states or terrorist organizations, to provoke a global
nuclear crisis by causing early-warning systems to generate false
readings ("spoofing") of missile launches. Yet, they do provide a clear
indication of the severity of the threat. [As states' reliance on
cyberspace grows and cyberweapons become more powerful, the [dangers
of]{.mark} [unintended or accidental escalation]{.mark} can only
[grow]{.mark} more severe.]{.underline}

### Link Alone Turns Case

#### Domestic pushback to plan guts US leadership -- turns case

(ermo/sms, Acc:7-1-2022)

I want to turn back to the question of how this Ukraine-Russia
interaction plays out in terms of state strategies vis-a-vis economics.
We've seen a lot of economic cooperation, but at the heart of some of
the questions you've been asking is this notion that nation-states are
going to be predisposed to look for national economic security, which
will mean developing a capacity for relative strength---independent
strength---vis a vis global changes. The difficulty is that most states
can't do this, and there's a strong impulse toward economic cooperation
along the technological gradient that will allow states to make up for
their potential deficiencies. We've talked at this conference about
semiconductors and it seems pretty clear that no state, even if it does
make major moves in that direction, is going to be capable of complete
autarky in a whole host of these high-tech areas.

The second piece of this relates to domestic politics in the U.S. [[What
we're seeing in the United States is a growing resistance on the part of
segments of the Republican Party to the development of international
support for Ukraine. We're seeing resistance to U.S.
aid]{.underline}]{.mark} for the military, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
we're seeing [[much broader isolationism that goes back to the MAGA
mentality. This has a ripple effect in terms of how other states will
perceive]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
rely on the United States]{.underline}]{.mark} economically. [[The idea
of the U.S. as a reliable]{.underline}]{.mark} economic and security
[[partner is very much at risk]{.underline}]{.mark}.

## Climate Turns X Impact

### Conflict

#### Climate Turns it- newest studies prove.

**Stanford** **University**, 6-12-20**19**, \"Does climate change cause
armed conflict?,\" Stanford News,

Intensifying [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[increase
the]{.underline}]{.mark} future [[risk of]{.underline}]{.mark} violent
[[armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} within countries, according to a
study published today in the journal Nature. Synthesizing views across
experts, the study estimates [[climate has
influenced]{.underline}]{.mark} between 3% and [[20%
of]{.underline}]{.mark} armed [[conflict risk]{.underline}]{.mark} over
the last century and that the influence [[will likely increase
dramatically.]{.underline}]{.mark} A new study synthesizing views from
experts across several fields indicates climate change will have an
increasing impact on the risk of armed conflict. [In a scenario with 4
degrees Celsius of warming (approximately the path we're on if societies
do not substantially reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases), the
influence of climate on conflicts would increase [more than five
times]{.mark}, leaping to a 26% chance of a substantial increase in
conflict risk, according to the study.]{.underline} Even in a scenario
of 2 degrees Celsius of warming beyond preindustrial levels -- the
stated goal of the Paris Climate Agreement­ -- the influence of climate
on conflicts would more than double, rising to a 13% chance.
"Appreciating the role of climate change and its security impacts is
important not only for understanding the social costs of our continuing
heat-trapping emissions, but for prioritizing responses, which could
include aid and cooperation," said Katharine Mach, director of the
Stanford Environment Assessment Facility and the study's lead author.
[[Climate change-driven extreme weather and related disasters can damage
economies, lower farming and livestock production and intensify
inequality]{.mark} among social groups. These factors, when [combined
with other drivers of conflict,]{.mark} may [increase risks of
violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} "Knowing whether environmental or
climatic changes are important for explaining conflict has implications
for what we can do to reduce the likelihood of future conflict, as well
as for how to make well-informed decisions about how aggressively we
should mitigate future climate change," said Marshall Burke, assistant
professor of Earth system science and a co-author on the study.

#### Warming Turns US-China War

WASHINGTON -- The two greatest challenges for American statecraft in the
21st century are becoming more severe --- and seemingly pulling the
United States in opposing directions. Relations with China are
deteriorating by the day, presaging a prolonged competition over the
shape of global order. Meanwhile, the [worsening effects of climate
change --- demonstrated by the shocking melting of ice in Greenland this
summer --- are invoking the specter of ecological
catastrophe]{.underline}. And while dealing with the changing climate
will undoubtedly require cooperation between Beijing and Washington ---
the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases --- [[winning the
geopolitical struggle with China will require the U.S. to take
a]{.mark}]{.underline} harder-edged, more [[competitive
approach.]{.mark}]{.underline} Statecraft is the art of reconciling the
apparently irreconcilable, and the [U.S. need not abandon either its
environmental or its geopolitical objectives. But Washington must
navigate between two bad strategies to execute the right
one.]{.underline} [The [need to balance climate-change diplomacy
with]{.mark} sharpening geopolitical [rivalry]{.mark} is relatively
new.]{.underline} After the end of the Cold War, climate-change
diplomacy was conducted on the assumption that the geopolitical
conflicts of previous eras had receded, easing the inevitable tradeoffs
created by a process that required asymmetric economic sacrifices. "Most
nations worry about the same global threats," U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton said a few months before the United Nations
climate-change summit in Copenhagen in 2009; the U.S. could lead by
"uniting diverse partners around common concerns." Today, by contrast,
the zero-sum aspects of the U.S.-China relationship are prominent,
forcing thoughtful policymakers to consider how to approach
climate-change diplomacy in a more competitive world. [The
[Trump]{.mark} administration, of course, has largely dodged this
challenge, by [amping up confrontation with China while]{.mark}
essentially [abandoning]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} accords and
international climate-change diplomacy. But denying that a problem
exists will not make it go away, and so Trump's abdication is deferring
the challenge to his successor.]{.underline} At a strategic level, there
are three basic options for managing the simultaneous intensification of
climate change and U.S.-China rivalry. The first (bad) idea, which flows
naturally from the "America First" mentality that brought Trump to
power, is that the U.S. should simply de-emphasize multilateral
diplomacy on climate change. China, the thinking goes, is the world's
largest emitter of carbon dioxide. So it should not be allowed to
transfer the global costs of adaptation to the U.S. by forcing
Washington to make bigger, earlier cuts than China in its own greenhouse
gas emissions, as stipulated in the U.S.-China bilateral agreement of
2014. More important, the long-term effects of climate change will
supposedly hurt a badly polluted China more than a comparatively clean
America. As climate change imposes mounting social and economic costs on
China, the U.S. will reap a competitive advantage. This approach,
however, is short-sighted and wrong-headed. According to one recent
study, the U.S. will actually pay a significantly higher economic price
than China as climate change progresses. In fact, Beijing's
authoritarian system might prove better than America's messy democracy
at undertaking the vast engineering projects --- constructing seawalls,
for instance --- that are needed to mitigate the effects. This approach
would also be diplomatically disastrous: Key allies, especially in
Europe, will not sign up for a counter-China coalition if they perceive
that Washington, rather than Beijing, is thwarting effective
climate-change diplomacy. And even if the U.S. did out-compete China in
a dramatically warming world, the victory would prove Pyrrhic indeed. A
second bad strategy would move to the other extreme, making geopolitical
concessions in hopes of getting Beijing to cooperate on a more
aggressive global program to slow climate change. The Obama
administration was sometimes accused of taking this approach in the
run-up to Copenhagen in 2009 and Paris in 2015, although former
officials have rejected this allegation. But the basic temptation will
be there, particularly for progressives who are inclined to prioritize
environment over geopolitics. In this scenario, a post-Trump president
might mute U.S.-Chinese disputes over Taiwan or the South China Sea as a
way of getting an agreement that would commit Beijing to more
aggressively curb its emissions. Yet this strategy ignores that the
Chinese government is a ruthlessly self-interested, Leninist
party-state. It will address climate change --- or not --- based
primarily on its assessment of whether doing so will bring benefits to
China and the Chinese Communist Party. This calculus probably will lead
--- and already has led --- to greater Chinese concern with climate
issues, given China's enormous environmental problems and the high
economic and social costs that a warming globe will impose on Beijing.
But if the U.S. makes unrelated concessions in hopes of moving Beijing
farther and faster on climate, it will simply give China's rulers
incentive to pocket those concessions while never quite delivering on
climate --- so that they can keep extracting more concessions. A
climate-first strategy may or may not benefit the environment, but it
will cost the U.S. dearly in geopolitical terms. The question, then, is
whether the U.S. can take a third route: [[Competing fiercely while
preserving cooperation where interests align]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
idea may seem counterintuitive. Yet history suggests that, while hard,
is not impossible. During the Cold War, Washington and Moscow clashed
far more dangerously than Washington and Beijing are jousting today. Yet
they worked together on certain shared interests. They pursued smallpox
eradication programs that saved millions of lives. They joined forces to
build a remarkably effective nuclear nonproliferation regime. They
concluded agreements, such as the Helsinki Accords, to reduce tensions
in key regions, and inked arms control treaties to limit the danger of
another sort of ecological catastrophe --- nuclear war. [Achieving
something similar in the U.S.-China relationship would require careful
balancing. U.S. officials would have to show that they will not allow
China to establish linkage between climate and other issues]{.underline}
--- and to demonstrate that they will not go easy on key geopolitical
disputes as the price of "improving the atmosphere" for future
negotiations. Yet [[they would]{.underline}]{.mark} also need to [[keep
open lines of communication on climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[in periods of high tension, and reinforce the
point]{.underline}]{.mark} --- publicly and privately --- that
[[competition is some areas does not preclude collaboration in
others.]{.mark}]{.underline} This sounds obvious, but is critically
important; the momentum toward rivalry can otherwise color all aspects
of the relationship. It may also be helpful to preserve [[scientific
exchanges and international forums]{.mark} where technical experts can
meet in relatively politics-free zones, [just as exchanges of arms
control and disarmament]{.mark} experts helped lay the intellectual
groundwork for certain U.S.-Soviet [agreements.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Most basically, this approach requires [[reviving climate diplomacy as
an American priority]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are legitimate
critiques of the Paris agreement and other Obama-era climate
initiatives. There are legitimate disagreements about how to proceed.
But simply [[absenting the U.S. from international efforts to address
climate change,]{.underline}]{.mark} as Trump has done[[, leaves
Washington diplomatically isolated and dangerously behind the curve
i]{.mark}n dealing with a worsening problem.]{.underline} To its credit,
the Trump administration has shown that it is [[possible to reorient the
American geopolitical debate on China]{.underline}]{.mark}. It will be
up to Trump's successors to show that doing so doesn't require ignoring
the other profound global threat to American well-being in the 21st
century and beyond.

[[Climate change will pose]{.underline}]{.mark} profound [[challenges to

[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates in the coming decades, [[raising the
prospect of military intervention]{.mark} to deal with its
effects]{.underline}, The New York Times reported, citing military and
intelligence analysts. [[Crises such as drought,]{.mark} violent
[storms,]{.mark} mass [migration and pandemics could topple governments,
feed terrorist movements or destabilize]{.mark} entire
[regions.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Times reported that for the first
time, [[intelligence agencies and the Pentagon are taking
a]{.underline}]{.mark} hard [[look at]{.underline}]{.mark} the possible
[[security implications]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting from climate
change. In particular, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South and
Southeast Asia, will face the prospect of food shortages, water
[[crises]{.underline}]{.mark} and catastrophic flooding driven by
climate change that [[could call for U.S. military
response.]{.underline}]{.mark} The [[U.S. military]{.underline}]{.mark}
also faces a direct challenge with climate change, the Times reported,
because many of its [[installations are vulnerable to storm surges and
rising seas]{.underline}]{.mark} and plans to protect naval stations in
Norfolk, Va., and San Diego, Calif., are already underway. \"The sense
that climate change poses security and geopolitical challenges is
central to the thinking of the State Department and the climate
office,\" said Peter Ogden, chief of staff to Todd Stern, the State
Department\'s top climate negotiator. A U.S. government study of
glaciers released Thursday said climate change is melting America\'s
glaciers at the fastest rate in recorded history, exposing the country
to higher risks of drought and rising sea levels. \"The observations
show that the melt rate has definitely increased over the past 10 or 15
years,\" Ed Josberger, a USGS scientist, said. \"This certainly is a
very strong indicator that climate change is occurring and its effects
on glaciers are virtually worldwide.\"

discussed. 28 In the Middle East there are signs that Saudi Arabia is

deliberately so, [with a detrimental impact on the security

### Resource Wars

#### Climate change causes huge resource wars \[and nuclear prolif\]

**Klare 2006** (Michael Klare, professor of peace and world security
studies at Hampshire College, March 10, 2006, "The Coming Resource
Wars," http://goo.gl/sPH9D)

It\'s official[: [the era of resource wars is upon
us.]{.underline}]{.mark} In a major London address, British Defense
Secretary John Reid warned that global climate change and dwindling
natural resources are combining to increase the likelihood of violent
conflict over land, water and energy. [[Climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, he indicated, \"[[will make scarce
resources]{.mark}, clean water, viable agricultural land [even
scarcer]{.mark}\" \-- [and]{.mark} this [will \"make the emergence of
violent conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} more rather than less
[[likely]{.mark}.]{.underline}\" Although not unprecedented, Reid\'s
prediction of an upsurge in resource conflict is significant both
because of his senior rank and the vehemence of his remarks. \"The blunt
truth is that the lack of water and agricultural land is a significant
contributory factor to the tragic conflict we see unfolding in Darfur,\"
he declared. \"We should see this as a warning sign.\" Resource
conflicts of this type are most likely to arise in the developing world,
Reid indicated, but the more advanced and [affluent]{.underline}
countries are not likely to be spared the damaging and destabilizing
effects of global climate change. With sea levels rising, water and
energy becoming increasingly scarce and prime agricultural lands turning
into deserts, internecine warfare over access to vital resources will
become a global phenomenon. Reid\'s speech, delivered at the prestigious
Chatham House in London (Britain\'s equivalent of the Council on Foreign
Relations), is but the most recent expression of a growing trend in
strategic circles to view environmental and resource effects \-- rather
than political orientation and ideology \-- as the most potent source of
armed conflict in the decades to come. With the world population rising,
global consumption rates soaring, energy supplies rapidly disappearing
and climate change eradicating valuable farmland, the stage is being set
for persistent and worldwide struggles over vital resources. Religious
and political strife will not disappear in this scenario, but rather
will be channeled into contests over valuable sources of water, food and
energy. Prior to Reid\'s address, the most significant expression of
this outlook was a report prepared for the U.S. Department of Defense by
a California-based consulting firm in October 2003. Entitled \"An Abrupt
Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National
Security,\" the report warned that global climate change is more likely
to result in sudden, cataclysmic environmental events than a gradual
(and therefore manageable) rise in average temperatures. Such events
could include a substantial increase in global sea levels, intense
storms and hurricanes and continent-wide \"dust bowl\" effects. This
would trigger pitched battles between the survivors of these effects for
access to food, water, habitable land and energy supplies. \"[[Violence
and disruption stemming from]{.mark} the stresses created by abrupt
changes in the [climate pose a different type of threat]{.mark} to
national security than we are accustomed to]{.underline} today,\" the
2003 report noted. \"[[Military confrontation may be triggered
by]{.underline}]{.mark} a desperate [[need fo]{.mark}r]{.underline}
natural resources such as [[energy, food and water]{.mark}
rather]{.underline} than by conflicts over ideology, religion or
national honor.\" Until now, this mode of analysis has failed to command
the attention of top American and British policymakers. For the most
part, they insist that ideological and religious differences \--
notably, the clash between values of tolerance and democracy on one hand
and extremist forms of Islam on the other \-- remain the main drivers of
international conflict. But Reid\'s speech at Chatham House suggests
that a major shift in strategic thinking may be under way.
[Environmental perils may soon dominate the world security
agenda.]{.underline} This shift is due in part to the growing weight of
evidence pointing to a significant human role in altering the planet\'s
basic climate systems. Recent studies showing the rapid shrinkage of the
polar ice caps, the accelerated melting of North American glaciers, the
increased frequency of severe hurricanes and a number of other such
effects all suggest that dramatic and potentially harmful changes to the
global climate have begun to occur. More importantly, they conclude that
human behavior \-- most importantly, the burning of fossil fuels in
factories, power plants, and motor vehicles \-- is the most likely cause
of these changes. This assessment may not have yet penetrated the White
House and other bastions of head-in-the-sand thinking, but it is clearly
gaining ground among scientists and thoughtful analysts around the
world. For the most part, public discussion of global climate change has
tended to describe its effects as an environmental problem \-- as a
threat to safe water, arable soil, temperate forests, certain species
and so on. And, of course, climate change is a potent threat to the
environment; in fact, the greatest threat imaginable. But viewing
climate change as an environmental problem fails to do justice to the
magnitude of the peril it poses. As Reid\'s speech and the 2003 Pentagon
study make clear, the greatest danger posed by global climate change is
not the degradation of ecosystems per se, but rather the disintegration
of entire human societies, producing wholesale starvation, mass
migrations and recurring conflict over resources. \"As famine, disease,
and weather-related disasters strike due to abrupt [[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark},\" the Pentagon report notes, \"many
countries\' needs will exceed their carrying capacity\" \-- that is,
their ability to provide the minimum requirements for human survival.
This \"[[will create a sense of desperation,]{.mark} which is
[likely]{.mark} to lead [to offensive aggression]{.mark}\" against
countries with a greater stock of vital resources.]{.underline}
\"Imagine eastern European countries, struggling to feed their
populations with a falling supply of food, water, and energy, eyeing
Russia, whose population is already in decline, for access to its grain,
minerals, and energy supply.\" Similar scenarios will be replicated all
across the planet, as [those without the means to survival invade or
migrate to those with greater abundance \-- producing endless struggles
between resource \"]{.underline}haves[\" and \"have-nots.\"]{.underline}
It is this prospect, more than anything, that worries John Reid. In
particular, he expressed concern over the inadequate capacity of poor
and unstable countries to cope with the effects of climate change, and
the resulting risk of state collapse, civil war and mass migration.
\"More than 300 million people in Africa currently lack access to safe
water,\" he observed, and \"climate change will worsen this dire
situation\" \-- provoking more wars like Darfur. And even if these
social disasters will occur primarily in the developing world, the
wealthier countries will also be caught up in them, whether by
participating in peacekeeping and humanitarian aid operations, by
fending off unwanted migrants or by fighting for access to overseas
supplies of food, oil, and minerals. When reading of these nightmarish
scenarios, it is easy to conjure up images of desperate, starving people
killing one another with knives, staves and clubs \-- as was certainly
often the case in the past, and could easily prove to be so again. But
these scenarios also envision the use of more deadly weapons. \"[In this
world of warring states]{.underline},\" the 2003 Pentagon report
predicted, \"[**[nuclear arms proliferation is inevitable]{.mark}.\" As
oil and natural gas disappears, [more and more countries will rely on
nuclear power]{.mark} to meet their energy needs \-- [and this \"will
accelerate nuclear proliferation]{.mark}** as countries develop
enrichment and reprocessing capabilities]{.underline} to ensure their
national security.\" Although speculative, these reports make one thing
clear: when thinking about the calamitous effects of global climate
change, we must emphasize its social and political consequences as much
as its purely environmental effects. Drought, flooding and storms can
kill us, and surely will \-- but so will wars among the survivors of
these catastrophes over what remains of food, water and shelter. As
Reid\'s comments indicate, [no society, however affluent, will escape
involvement in these forms of conflict.]{.underline}

### Russia

#### Climate change is the biggest internal link to Russia strategic decisions.

3.25.2021

When [U.S. policymakers ponder Russia's trajectory]{.underline}, they
[tend to focus on the leadership]{.underline} and longevity of President
Vladimir Putin and the nature of his regime, on the Kremlin's growing
[authoritarian tendencies]{.underline} at home and the poisoning of
opposition figures, on Russia's [[nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and [cyber capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} on
[[Russia's projection of power]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad, from
election interference to military interventions in Ukraine and Syria.
**[Rarely does climate change make the shortlist.]{.underline}** [[Yet
it is climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, as much as any one politician
or set of policies, [[that will exert the strongest force on
Russia]{.mark}'s strategic future, reshaping its politics, economy, and
society for decades to come. Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the
rest of the world.]{.underline} In 2020, regions across Russia have
experienced the hottest temperatures on record, contributing to forest
fires that burned through acreage the size of Greece and emitted
one-third more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than in 2019 (Russian
forests account for one-fifth of the world's total). Flash floods in
Siberia destroyed entire villages and displaced thousands of residents.
Snow coverage was at a record low in 2020, and Arctic sea ice coverage
shrank to its second-lowest extent in over 40 years.
[[Permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}, which covers nearly two-thirds of
Russian territory, is [rapidly thawing]{.underline}. More dramatic
freeze-thaw cycles in the subsoil are eroding urban infrastructure in
Russia's Arctic cities, [home to over 2 million people]{.underline}, and
[[pose a]{.mark} mounting risk [to]{.mark} Russia's]{.underline} 200,000
kilometers of [[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} and gas pipelines, not to
mention thousands of miles of roads and rail lines bridging some of
Russia's widest rivers. Permafrost thaw recently toppled a diesel
storage tank near the Arctic city of Norilsk, spilling 21,000 tons of
diesel into the Ambarnaya river and surrounding subsoil. It has been
linked to outbreaks of anthrax and the discovery of vast methane
craters. At its current rate of thaw---about 1 degree Celsius per
decade---[Russia's permafrost layer will stop freezing completely in
three decades]{.underline}. This could result in a **[potentially
catastrophic]{.underline}**, one-off release of carbon into the
atmosphere which will no longer be Russia's problem alone. According to
one study, a 30 to 99 percent reduction in near-surface permafrost would
release an additional 10 to 240 billion tons of carbon and methane into
the atmosphere and potentially put the globe "over the brink" by 2100.
Russia is already the fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases,
accounting for 4.6 percent of all global emissions. Its per capita
emissions are among the highest in the world---53 percent higher than
China, and 79 percent higher than the European Union. Dramatic shifts in
global weather patterns, accelerated by warming Arctic waters and a
diminishing ice cap, are expected to [[increase droughts in]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}'s rich southern agricultural ["bread
basket"]{.mark}]{.underline} regions encompassing Stavropol and Rostov.
This could [pose food security risks and threaten a primary Russian
export: wheat.]{.underline} Though climate change will [expand arable
land in Russia]{.underline} in its northern latitudes, the [northern
topsoil]{.underline} tends to be [thin]{.underline}ner and [more
acidic]{.underline} than in Russia's most productive southern regions
and would not make up for its losses. In fact, [arable land
shrank]{.underline} by more than half to just 120,000 acres in 2017. In
June of this year, regional officials in Stravopol, one of Russia's
major wheat regions, projected a remarkable [40 percent decline in wheat
crop in 2020 as a result of droughts]{.underline}. This too has global
implications: [Russia is a core part of global food chains, accounting
for 20 percent of global wheat expo]{.underline}rts, so climate
disruption to Russian agricultural output will have strong effects well
beyond Russia's borders and budget coffers. As agriculture shifts north,
scientists are concerned that the cultivation of carbon-rich soils will
create a separate carbon feedback loop and expedite global warming. The
Economics of Climate Change in Russia The threat to the Russian economy
from climate change is twofold. An increase in droughts, floods,
wildfires, permafrost damage, and disease could lower GDP by 3 percent
annually in the next decade, according to Russia's Audit Chamber.
Climate damage to buildings and infrastructure alone could cost Russia
up to 9 trillion rubles (\$99 billion) by 2050, according to Deputy
Minister for the Development of the Russian Far East and Arctic
Alexander Krutikov. Meanwhile, Russia's overreliance on hydrocarbon
production is a conspicuous vulnerability as the world shifts toward
low-carbon sources of energy and carbon neutrality. Natural gas and
Arctic liquified natural gas may serve as bridge for Russia into a
lower-carbon future, but global demand for gas is expected to be in
sharp decline by mid-century. Russia's top-down federal policy strongly
favors state-led and managed industrial oil and gas giants. Though
Russia has immense potential as a source of renewable energy, the share
of renewables in Russia's energy mix is negligible---under 0.1 percent
for wind, solar, and geothermal---and there are no clear plans to invest
significantly in their growth. Nor do current strategy documents foresee
a major growth in nuclear and hydropower, which currently account for 36
percent of Russia's electricity mix but under current plans will only
climb to 43 percent by 2050. (To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees
Celsius, renewables must account for 70-85 percent of global electricity
by 2050.) How Is the Russian Government Responding? Russian climate
policy at the federal and regional level is nascent and is handicapped
by thinly stretched budgets. The need to respond to more environmental
disasters with less money is becoming a growing friction point between
regional governments and Moscow. An expected increase in extreme weather
events and infrastructure degradation requires proactive planning and
significant long-term investments into infrastructure modernization and
resilience, forest management, and other adaptive measures, but regional
governments are chronically under resourced and heavily in debt (some
regions have begun to fall into bankruptcy). A reduction in
international hydrocarbon demand will further constrict the federal
budget just as the material costs of climate change will begin a
parabolic ascent. This shrinking budget is abetted by chronic corruption
and public service mismanagement---issues which, unlike climate change,
are politically front and center in the minds of Russians. All of these
dynamics fuel a very public blame game between regional political elite,
business, and federal authorities over who bears the financial and moral
responsibility for managing the consequences of climate change. Putin
himself has offered mixed messaging on global warming, acknowledging for
the first time only in October 2019 that global warming was a result of
human activities, but just a month later he cast doubt on the prospects
of a global shift to renewable energy, stating, "When these ideas of
reducing energy production to zero or relying only on solar or wind
power are promoted, I think humanity could once again end up in caves,
simply because it won't consume anything." Though a growing chorus of
officials are voicing concern about the economic consequences of a
changing climate for Russia, the prevailing view remains one of passive
resignation or misguided optimism. Some officials recognize the reality
of climate change but contend that it is beyond Russia's means to
resolve and that Russia should therefore extract revenue from its
abundant hydrocarbon resources while there is still global demand.
Others believe Russia will benefit economically from warmer temperatures
by way of an increase in arable land and greater use the Northern Sea
Route for commercial shipping---a bet that makes dangerous assumptions
about the ability of Russia to replace energy exports with agriculture
and presumes as-yet-unproven sustained commercial interest in an Arctic
shipping route. This policy ambivalence is encapsulated in Russia's
approach to the Paris climate accord. Russia signed on to the agreement
in 2019 in an apparent recognition of the threat, but because it used
1990 as its benchmark, a year when the country was still part of the
Soviet Union and emitted nearly 2.4 billion tons of carbon, Russia can
effectively increase its emissions over the next decade and still meet
its 30 percent reduction target. Russia's emissions are set to rise
through the next decade, according to a Ministry of Economic Development
strategy document published in March 2020. Legislation introduced in
2019 as part of Russia's ratification of the Paris Agreement would have
instituted emissions quotas and carbon pricing, but lobbying efforts by
the influential Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs
significantly diluted the bill, resulting in weaker provisions on
emissions reporting and the elimination of a national carbon trading
system and penalties for polluters. How Is Russian Society Responding?
The environment is front of mind for Russians. According to a January
2020 survey by the independent Levada Center, environmental degradation
was named the biggest threat to humanity in the twenty-first century (48
percent), followed by international terrorism (42 percent) and wars (37
percent). Of Russia's environmental challenges, respondents viewed air
pollution as the most important in a year that set new records for
instances of hazardous air quality in Russia, due in part to wildfires
and industrial pollution. Yet the immediacy of local environmental
challenges in Russia---from air pollution to waste management practice
to wildfires---has not translated into broader apprehension about global
warming or activism to change public policy. An April 2020 Ipsos survey
found that only 13 percent of Russians ranked climate as the most
important environmental issue facing their country---well below the
world average of 37 percent. Russians were also comparatively less
concerned about future energy sources and choices and held the lowest
overall levels of support for government action to combat climate
change. One contributing factor to this seeming contradiction is likely
the tightening of Russia's civic space. The imposition of "foreign
agent" laws has hollowed out environmental nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) in Russia and muffled voices sounding the alarm on global
warming. Public support for environmental NGOs has declined in recent
years even as a growing number of Russians are ready to protest over
local environmental issues. Economic realities also contribute. Years of
anemic economic growth, the dual shocks of Covid-19 and low oil prices,
and a tight-fisted approach to fiscal stimulus has reduced the average
Russian's household wealth. The Kremlin is prioritizing jumpstarting the
economy by supercharging its hydrocarbon and industrial model. For many
Russians who are just getting by financially, issues such as price
hikes, unemployment, and inequality supplant concern over climate
change. Despite a more repressive political climate, there has been an
uptick in environment-related protests in recent years. In April 2019,
thousands turned out in the Arctic region of Arkhangelsk to protest the
construction of a new landfill for Moscow's ballooning waste. That
summer, over 2,000 people turned out in the Ural city of Yekaterinburg
to protest the construction of a church in one of the city's few
remaining green spaces. More recently, in Bashktorstan, in Russia's
southern Urals region, protests erupted over a local company's plans to
mine a rare limestone hill regarded as sacred by local residents. In
general, the landscape for environmental activism in Russia is more
fluid and decentralized than in the West, with informal protest groups
springing up around specific, local issues and then dissipating. But
though protests have been local, it is not coincidental that Russia's
Arctic, Siberian, and Far East regions---where the impacts of climate
change will be concentrated---are also bearing the brunt of chronic
economic underdevelopment. Importantly, these same regions are
traditionally more independently political minded and less supportive of
Kremlin-backed initiatives. Change Is Coming to Russia Externally
Although many Russian officials will continue to emphasize the economic
opportunities of climate change and downplay its consequences for
Russia, they are growing concerned about the sweeping changes being made
to the climate policies of major export markets, particularly the
European Union, with its ambitious plans for a New Green Deal and target
for carbon neutrality by 2050. An EU plan to introduce a carbon border
adjustment tax, which in a baseline scenario would cost Russian
exporters 33 billion euros by 2030, has forced Russian firms to confront
the reality of a global shift toward low-carbon development and the
rising the cost of their emissions. China, meanwhile, has pledged to be
carbon neutral by 2060. A new economic reality is gaining a toehold: in
December 2020, Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev acknowledged
that global peak oil demand may have passed and indicated his ministry
was preparing for extended lower budget revenues (oil and gas sales
account for roughly one-third of federal budget revenue). The Russian
energy and industrial lobby remain influential voices against carbon
emission quotas and are a primary cause of domestic climate policy
stasis, but a growing number of Russian companies, including some
hydrocarbon producers such as Novatek and more internationally exposed
firms such as Lukoil, are moving ahead of the government to cut
emissions and address sustainability issues. They have been given a push
by international financial institutions and growing investor
requirements for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics.
Some of Russia's largest companies are making expensive investments into
improving their sustainability ranking as low scores hit others in the
pocket. Polyus, Russia's largest gold producer, and Novatek were
upgraded to an ESG ranking of "A" in 2020---ahead of many industry
peers. Change Has Already Arrived [[Climate]{.underline}]{.mark} change
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[compel change within
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} whether its leaders acknowledge the issue or
not. The most immediate and significant thrust for change within Russia
will come from the outside, as major energy export markets accelerate
their environmental policies. [[This poses an existential
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russia's economic model of hydrocarbon
and mineral export, a threat heightened by years of weak domestic growth
and a global economy suppressed by the pandemic. But change is also
occurring from within, as climate-linked environmental disasters take
their toil and as scarce state resources fail to address the growing
frequency and magnitude of infrastructure decay, wildfires, local
pollution, and other climate-related challenges,
[[fuel]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[protests]{.underline}]{.mark} and
**[[increasing tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** between regional
governors and Moscow. The Russian Arctic, in particular, will be a case
study in how climate change, regional political dynamics, and Russia's
economic ambitions interact, as businessmen, regional officials, and
federal ministers, including key members of the Kremlin's inner circle,
jockey for state development resources but defer responsibility for
funding disaster recovery and climate resilience. Our research and
analysis must determine how climate change and [[climate
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}---both internally and externally---[[will
shape Russia's future,]{.underline}]{.mark} and, in the near term, how
the Kremlin and its fossil fuel export-based economy will---or will
not---respond.

Information Dominance (!) and currently Director of Penn State's [Center
for Solutions to Weather and Climate
Risks](http://solutions2wxrisk.psu.edu/). --- with O'Malley's ([video
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKfYq24eWGg)): ["One of the things
that preceded]{.underline} the failure of the nation-state of Syria and
[[the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}
and the mega-drought [that]{.underline} affected that region, [[wiped
out farmers]{.mark}, [drove people to cities]{.mark}, [created a
humanitarian crisis that created the symptoms]{.mark} --- or rather, the
conditions --- [of extreme poverty that has led now to the rise of
ISIL]{.mark}]{.underline} and this extreme violence." Let's run through
the science underpinning what O'Malley, Admiral Titley, and others have
said. We know that the Syrian civil war that helped drive the rise of
the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) was itself
spawned in large part by what [one
expert](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/03/03/437051/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/)
called perhaps "the worst long-term drought and most severe set of crop
failures since agricultural civilizations began in the Fertile
Crescent," from 2006 to 2010. That drought destroyed the livelihood of
800,000 people according to the U.N. and sent vastly more into poverty.
The poor and displaced fled to cities, "where poverty, government
mismanagement and other factors created unrest that exploded in spring
2011," as the study's [news
release](http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2015/015046/perfect-storm) explains.
The [March 2015
study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/02/23/1421533112),
"Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent
Syrian drought," found that [[global warming made Syria's 2006 to 2010
drought two to three times more likely.]{.mark} "]{.underline}While
we're not saying the drought caused the war," lead author Dr. Colin
Kelley explained. "We are saying that it certainly contributed to other
factors --- agricultural collapse and mass migration among them --- that
caused the uprising." [The study identifies "a pretty convincing climate
fingerprint]{.underline}" for the Syrian drought, Admiral Titley told
[Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/03/02/study_climate_change_helped_spark_syrian_civil_war.html)
at the time. Titley is the former COO of NOAA. In particular, the study
finds that [climate change is already drying the region]{.underline} out
in two ways: "First, weakening wind patterns that bring rain-laden air
from the Mediterranean reduced precipitation during the usual
November-to-April wet season. In addition, higher temperatures increased
moisture evaporation from soils during the usually hot summers." [This
study and others make clear that for large parts of the
not-terribly-stable region around Syria --- including Lebanon, Israel,
Jordan, and parts of Turkey and Iraq --- [brutal multi-year droughts are
poised to become the norm in the coming decades if we don't reverse
carbon pollution trends ASAP. ]{.mark}]{.underline}Climate models had
long predicted that the countries surrounding the Mediterranean would
start drying out. In general, climate science says dry areas will get
dryer and wet areas wetter. In 2011, a major NOAA study
[concluded](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/10/27/355639/noaa-climate-change-mediterranean-droughts/)
that "human-caused climate change \[is now\] a major factor in more
frequent Mediterranean droughts." Reds and oranges highlight lands
around the Mediterranean that experienced significantly drier winters
during 1971--2010 than the comparison period of 1902--2010. Via NOAA
\[Click to enlarge\]. "The magnitude and frequency of the drying that
has occurred is too great to be explained by natural variability alone,"
explained Dr. Martin Hoerling of NOAA's Earth System Research
Laboratory, the lead author of the 2011 study. [The connection between
the conflict in Syria and climate change is not new]{.underline}. In
March 2012, Climate Progress
[published](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/03/03/437051/syria-climate-change-drought-social-unrest/)
a piece by Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell, co-founders and
directors of the Center for Climate and Security, which made the case
for the link between climate change and events in Syria. In 2013, Tom
Friedman went to Syria to learn firsthand about the connection between
the drought and the civil war. His New York Times column, "[Without
Water,
Revolution](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/opinion/sunday/friedman-without-water-revolution.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),"
explains what he discovered. Friedman also filmed his visit, where he
talked to actual Syrians about the causes of the civil war. It was for
the premiere episode in April 2014 of the Emmy-winning Showtime series,
"[Years of Living Dangerously](http://yearsoflivingdangerously.com/),"
which can be viewed on Netflix [right
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brvhCnYvxQQ). Many other recent
studies have been done on this subject, such as "[Water, Drought,
Climate Change, and Conflict in
Syria](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/WCAS-D-13-00059.1?journalCode=wcas)"
by climate and water expert Peter Gleick. Perhaps [[the central
takeaway]{.underline}]{.mark} from this area of research [is that **[the
greatest danger to humanity this century from human-caused climate
change is
[Dust-Bowlification](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/10/02/3572205/warming-dust-bowlify/)
and the threat to our food supplies and hence global security.
]{.mark}**]{.underline}That's because [large parts of the most inhabited
and arable parts of the planet --- including the U.S.
breadbasket --- face the exact same heating and drying that have already
affected the Mediterranean]{.underline}. The 2014 study, "[Global
warming and 21st century
drying](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~bc9z/cook_pdsi_clidyn_REV_v01.pdf),"
projected this bleak future: The bottom line: Homo sapiens is currently
on track to make drought and extreme drying the normal condition for the
Southwest, Central Plains, the Amazon, southern Europe, the entire
region around the Mediterranean, and many other key areas post-2050. As
Femia bluntly told an interviewer in 2013, the time to act is now: "[if
you let this problem get out of hand you're going to have a number of
situations in the future, whether they're major disasters or conflicts,
that our security forces may have to respond to. [It will cost us a lot
more in the long term if we do nothing now."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Returning to O'Malley's comments, it's pretty clear that they are quite
reasonable and defensible. Personally, because the causes of war and
terrorism are so complicated and interconnected, I prefer to say things
like "climate change HELPED create conditions for rise of ISIS." Not
that nuanced phrasing will not spare anyone the attacks from the
anti-science crowd.

### Failed States

#### Sea level rise and resource depletion foster failed states.

editor-in-chief of the Mail & Guardian\], \"​Climate change brings failed
states and violent conflict,\" Mail & Guardian,

Xoxo 8/10/2020

[With [states struggling to respond to]{.mark} rapid [changes in
climate]{.mark}, capturing [ever more scarce resources]{.mark} such as
Tabqa is becoming a powerful weapon for their enemies.]{.underline} This
is according to a new report, Insurgency, Terrorism and Organised Crime
in a Warming Climate, by the German think-tank, Adelphi. [The report
looks at how "[non-state armed groups"]{.mark} are [capitalis]{.mark}ing
[on]{.mark} the rapidly [shifting climate to exercise more
control]{.mark} over parts of the world.]{.underline} The report comes
as Islamic State and Kurdish forces fight over control of the dam, which
has been central to the Islamic State's control of northern Syria for
much of this decade. It goes back to the outbreak of civil war in the
country in 2011. [In part, the civil war itself has been attributed to
changes in Syria's climate]{.underline}. Ten of the 12 driest years in
the area have been in the past 20 years. By 2007, [water use in Syria
exceeded supply by 20%. Then came [a five-year drought]{.mark}, the
worst in recorded history. [Crops failed]{.mark}. [Herders lost 85% of
their livestock]{.mark}. More than a [million people moved to
cities.]{.mark} The [combination]{.mark} of social pressure and
political repression [led to civil war]{.mark}. The Adelphi report says
this can be attributed to "[climatic changes]{.mark} and the way they
contributed to [erod]{.mark}ing [the social contract]{.mark} in
Syria".]{.underline} Since then, [water has played a key role in the way
the different sides have fought the war.]{.underline} In 2014, many
[reports said both the regime and opposition forces were cutting water
to Aleppo to weaken each other.]{.underline} Adelphi says: "In other
cases, rebel groups diverted water to supply only those neighbourhoods
that they controlled, causing severe harm \[to\] civilians and farmers
dependent on irrigation." The Islamic State, which controlled territory
along Syria's major rivers, used water to both harm and control
communities. In 2015, the group closed the gates of the Ramadi Dam to
dry up land for an offensive. In other cases, it has flooded areas to
force people to move out. In 2014, when it was pushed out of Iraqi
towns, it poisoned drinking water with crude oil. [When the group does
control areas, it uses water to raise income. Adelphi's research says:
"Control over and effective distribution of water can also help Islamic
State gain legitimacy and work towards its goal of establishing a
caliphate."]{.underline} Syria and its Tabqa Dam is just one example of
how [[armed groups]{.mark} are using the [control]{.mark} of
[water]{.mark} --- a resource becoming ever more scarce because of
climate change --- [to gain power.]{.mark} These groups have also grown
in number since the end of the Cold War. The United Nations says, since
2004, the number of non-state armed groups involved in civil conflicts
has increased fourfold.]{.underline} Several different [[groups]{.mark}
have [link]{.mark}ed this [rise to the inability of states]{.mark} to
respond to changing climate [and]{.mark} the [collapse]{.mark} of
ecosystems that people rely on.]{.underline} The United States
department of defence, in its 2014 climate change adaptation road map,
referred to [[climate change as a "threat
multiplier".]{.mark}]{.underline} The department says this is because
climate change "[has the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges
we are dealing with today --- from infectious disease to terrorism. We
are already beginning to see some of these impacts]{.underline}." The G7
group of countries has made similar statements, as has the UN. Its
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said [[climate change will
add pressure to existing problems]{.mark}, with [dire
consequences]{.mark} for communities who are [close to breaking
point.]{.mark} [States that are already weak are most at risk]{.mark}
but nowhere is safe. "Seemingly [stable states can be overburdened
by]{.mark} the combined pressures of [climate
change,]{.mark}]{.underline} population growth, urbanisation,
environmental degradation and rising socioeconomic inequalities", the
Adelphi report says. And when states are overburdened, it is non-state
armed groups such as the Islamic State and Boko Haram that have tended
to benefit. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the five African
countries, containing about 38-million people, that rely on the clean
waters of Lake Chad, around which Boko Haram is active. Nigeria's
environment ministry says its northeastern provinces, which experience
frequent drought and rely on the lake to act as a buffer, used to get
rain for 150 days a year in the 1970s. They only now get 120 days of
rain. The average temperature in those provinces has increased by 0.8˚C,
and the Sahara is moving south at between one kilometre and 10km a year.
The annual fish catch from the lake has also dropped from 140 000 tonnes
a year in 1970 to just 80 000 tonnes. Lake Chad is now 10% of the size
that it was five decades ago, which, Adelphi's research says, has
resulted in fewer resources and has made livelihoods less secure. It has
"exacerbated tensions between pastoralists, farmers and fishers". [These
groups have all crowded in on each other in an attempt to get to the
lake's dwindling water. Traditional authorities, which used to resolve
disputes over access to land and water, have fallen apart with the
creation of local government in countries such as Nigeria.]{.underline}
But, Adelphi says, these new authorities have not stepped in to resolve
the crisis. Instead, [Boko Haram has moved into the vacuum, creating
local governance structures to replace the failing state.]{.underline}
When this doesn't work, it has --- like the Islamic State in Syria ---
resorted to a stranglehold on natural resources "as a weapon". In Niger,
this has been catastrophic. Fishing communities are going hungry because
they cannot get food from Lake Chad, because Boko Haram uses the lake as
a base from which to launch attacks. Farmers have also been affected,
with the group cutting off their access to water and fertiliser. When
the government sends forces to an area, Boko Haram has poisoned wells
and streams, according to reports. Acts such as this are projected to
become the new normal. Adelphi says [[climate change]{.mark} is
[creat]{.mark}ing "vicious cycles of increasing climate impacts[,
vulnerability,]{.mark} violence, [conflict and
fragility".]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Democracy

#### Warming turns democracy

National [[crises make governments vulnerable to
autocracy]{.underline}]{.mark}---a rather obvious assessment, perhaps,
but one rarely seen in debates about climate change. Take the Maldives,
an atoll nation in the Indian Ocean. [Rising []{.mark}seawater is
projected to consume most, if not all, of the country this century. In
2008, the Maldives chose its first democratically elected president,
Mohamed Nasheed. Almost immediately, he made climate change preparations
central to his administration.]{.underline} He announced plans to move
360,000 Maldivian citizens to new homelands in Sri Lanka, India, or
Australia, and he promised to make the Maldives the world's first
carbon-neutral country. Nasheed also demonstrated a flair for the
dramatic, staging an underwater Cabinet meeting that turned him into a
viral climate celebrity. "What we need to do is nothing short of
decarbonizing the entire global economy," he said. "If man can walk on
the moon, we can unite to defeat our common carbon enemy." In 2012, the
military deposed Nasheed, forcing him to flee the country at gunpoint
after mass protests over economic stagnation and spikes in commodity
prices. His eventual successor, Abdulla Yameen, has since suspended
parts of the constitution, giving himself sweeping powers to arrest and
detain opponents, including two of the country's five Supreme Court
justices and even his own half-brother. Meanwhile, Yameen has tossed out
Nasheed's climate adaptation plans and rejected renewable energy
programs, proposing instead to build new islands and economic free zones
attractive to a global elite. "We do not need cabinet meetings
underwater," his environment minister told The Guardian. "We do not need
to go anywhere. We need development." If any lesson can be drawn from
the power struggle in the Maldives, it is that [[people who feel
threatened by]{.underline}]{.mark} an outside force, be it foreign
invaders or [[rising tides, often seek reassurance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
That reassurance may come in the form of [[a strongman
leader]{.underline}]{.mark}, someone who tells them all will be well,
the economy will soar, the sea walls hold. People must only
[[surrender]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[elections]{.underline}]{.mark},
or their due process, until the crisis is resolved. This is perhaps the
[[most overlooked threat of climate change:]{.mark} Major [shifts
in]{.mark} the global [climate]{.mark} could [give rise to]{.mark} a new
generation of [authoritarian rulers]{.mark}, not just in poorer
countries or those with weak democratic institutions, but in wealthy
industrialized nations, too.]{.underline} Number of the Maldives'
inhabited islands that flood annually: 37 of 185 Number that will
eventually need to be abandoned: 61 The Maldives' Freedom House Rating:
Dropped 20 percentage points since Nasheed was deposed Sources: The
United Nations; The Guardian; Freedom House Refugee crises, famine,
drought---these are materials strongmen can use to build power. Already,
strife and civil instability are spreading throughout the global South,
with droughts and floods stoking conflict and refugee crises in parts of
Africa and the Middle East. According to a 2016 paper in Science,
climate change will increase the risk of armed conflict across Africa by
50 percent by 2030. [Eastern Africa is particularly vulnerable. The
genocidal strife in Darfur is one of the bloodiest examples, but even
countries with robust economies and democracies are
susceptible.]{.underline} In Kenya, for example, a crippling drought has
led to rapid inflation of food prices, doubling the number of
food-insecure people since 2014. That, and disputes over who owns land
in the Laikipia region, north of Nairobi, has contributed to violent
clashes there, threatening the political stability of the country. This
has enabled Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta to tighten his grip on
power. In October, amid reports that he'd rigged a recent presidential
election, [Kenyatta declared the drought a national disaster---this,
just weeks before the next round of voting. He was reelected and, amid
continued chaos, has cracked down on his opponents in the
media.]{.underline} It's not just [developing nations that are at risk
of opportunistic climate-fueled authoritarianism]{.underline}. [Wealthy
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} may [possess the resources to insulate
themselves from the near-term physical impacts of climate change---they
can afford sea walls, emergency services, and air
conditioning]{.underline}. But when [[conflicts over resources break out
in the developing world,]{.underline}]{.mark} they are bound to generate
crises that [[spill into wealthier countries.]{.mark} [Refugee crises,
famine, drought]{.mark}]{.underline}---these are materials strongmen can
use to build power. [[Civil instability is already
spreading]{.underline}]{.mark} in the global South. A study published in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015 drew a
direct link between the 2007--2010 drought in the greater Fertile
Crescent, which "exacerbated existing water and agricultural insecurity
and caused massive agricultural failures and livestock mortality," and
[Syria's 2011 civil war, which has forced millions of people to seek
refuge in Europe. Their arrival has helped [fuel antidemocratic
movements]{.mark} throughout the continent]{.underline}. "Even the
[[specter of refugee crises]{.underline}]{.mark} and population
movements can [[impact attitudes toward
authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Jonathan Weiler, co-author
of Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics. These fears
aren't going away: According to a 2017 study published in The Lancet,
[extreme weather could displace up to a billion people around the world
by the middle of the twenty-first century---an unprecedented human
migration will undoubtedly influence the politics of wealthy countries,
pushing them to the right.]{.underline} The best way to counteract this
phenomenon is naturally to halt, or at least slow, the effects of
climate change. So far, the [[Paris agreement is the only tangible
result of those efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}, and its fate is far from
certain, with the United States threatening to withdraw. But this might
change, if the problems caused by climate change---not just stronger
hurricanes, droughts, and rising seas, but political rupture---keep
washing up on the disappearing shorelines of wealthy governments.

### Structural Violence

#### Climate turns structural violence.

There is a high-profile body of work asserting [[a link between]{.mark}
anthropogenic [climate change and]{.mark} increased rates of
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is also an expanding literature
that is highly skeptical of this research. Critics point out that (1)
this research has so far produced widely divergent findings, and that
there is no consensus on a causal link between climate and the incidence
of conflict. Critics also argue that much climate violence research (2)
draws upon a longdiscredited environmental determinism, (3) rehashes
colonial stereotypes of the global South, (4) naturalizes and
depoliticizes inequalities within and between nations, and (5)
potentially creates new rationales for militarism and intervention from
more powerful states. In the following essay, I build on these
critiques, arguing that orthodox climate conflict [research also
[focuses]{.mark} unduly [on the]{.mark} potential [climate-related
violence of the poor]{.mark}, overlooking the [violence of the
powerful]{.mark}]{.underline}. Drawing from a climate justice
perspective, I advocate for more study on the [[structural violence of
climate change.]{.underline}]{.mark} To make this case, I focus on the
world's largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies. Keywords: climate
conflict, climate justice, fossil fuel corporations, fossil fuel
divestment, structural violence Introduction Will climate change make
the world a more violent place? This is one of the more important
questions of our time. [There are a growing number of warnings coming
from influential places about the relationship between climate change
and violence. The United States government, for instance, has
increasingly labeled global warming a "threat multiplier]{.underline}"
(Banusiewicz, 2014; CNA, 2007). 1 Author contact: ebonds@umw.edu. Human
Ecology Review, Volume 22, Number 2, 2016 4 [Additionally, prominent
journalists and policy analysts at important think tanks and advocacy
groups have worked to highlight potential connections between global
warming and conflict]{.underline} (see for instance EJF, 2014; Friedman,
2013; Werrell & Fernia, 2013). And headlines at major newspapers, for
example in the Washington Post, report "[[there's a surprisingly strong
link between climate change and violence]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Mooney,
2014). But how we answer the question---"will climate change create a
more violent future?"---has much to do with the definitions we use. On
one hand, the jury is very much out in terms of proving a causal
relationship between climate change and increasing conflict. While some
research, published in some of the world's most prestigious journals,
has found what the authors describe as a strong link between climatic
changes and rates of violence (see Burke et al., 2009; Hsiang et al.,
2013), other research, sometimes published in the same journals, has
found no such correlation (Buhaug, 2010a, 2010b; Wischnath & Buhaug,
2014). There is, in fact, no consensus among quantitative researchers
about the existence of a causal link between changes in temperature and
rainfall and increasing violence (Buhaug, 2015; Selby, 2014). As the
body of research on a potential climate violence relationship has grown,
so too has the number of its critics. An increasing number of authors
worry that quantitative climate conflict research, as the next
reincarnation of a long-discredited environmental determinism, is simply
old wine in a new bottle (Hartmann, 2014; Raleigh et al., 2014).
Moreover, according to critics, this research draws upon colonial
stereotypes of the global South, implying that its peoples are somehow
more predisposed to violence than those of European ancestry
(Livingstone, 2015; Raleigh et al., 2014; Selby, 2014; Verhoeven, 2014).
Finally, this research implies that the violence of poor people in the
most peripheral areas of the global economy is "natural," hiding from
view the ways that histories of colonialism and the contemporary global
political economy have conditioned and produced violent conflict
(Hartmann, 2010, 2014; Verhoeven, 2011, 2014). Why, given all these
problems, has orthodox climate conflict research continued to flourish,
and to enjoy such a high public profile? Critics warn that this is
because the perspective so closely matches, and is so useful to,
governments that are securitizing the issue of [[climate change and
using it as a means to legitimate militarism]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[ongoing interventions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the global South
(Hartmann, 2010, 2014; Selby, 2014; Verhoeven, 2014). Given all the
problems with orthodox climate violence research, does this mean that it
is safe to say that climate change will not make the world a more
violent place? Hardly. I advance instead that anthropogenic **[[climate
change is itself a kind of violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Solnit,
2014). After all, [[it will certainly cause early deaths and it will
drive people from their homes and homelands, all of which will cause
untold suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drawing upon a climate justice
perspective, I provide here a brief overview of orthodox climate
conflict research and further describe its Upending Climate Violence
Research 5 critics' concerns. I add to their critique by arguing that
this body of research, as a whole, focuses almost exclusively on the
potential violence of the poor, overlooking the violence of the
[[wealthy]{.underline}]{.mark} and powerful [[groups
who]{.underline}]{.mark} benefit most from, and actively [[work to
sustain]{.underline}]{.mark}, a fossil fuel--dependent [[neoliberal
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. To begin amending this bias in the
climate violence literature, I draw upon work in sociology, green
criminology, and geography to argue that major fossil fuel companies are
disproportionately responsible for, and have disproportionately
benefited from, the structural violence of climate change.

## A2 Theory

### 2NC -- A2 intrinsic

#### Our politics DA is intrinsic

**1. We read links that prove the plan will have political consequences
that affect agenda items. Congress isn't a single actor.**

**2. Their interpretation kills negative ground-they can cross apply the
same argument to trade-off and spending arguments.**

**3. Empirical intrinsicness checks-running arguments that a
congressperson would pass both is fine-but you can't advocate that it
should or could happen.**

### 2NC -- AT: Fiat Solves the Link

#### Fiat doesn't solve the link

#### Our interpretation of fiat is that the plan will be put at the top of the agenda and pass the next time congress is in session, its normal means which the plan endorses. This is best for debate-

#### Education-our interpretation allows education on the political process, while preserving the benefits of other plan-specific education

#### Most real world-no policy is magically enacted overnight without any political discussion, this would make the plan the most extraordinary event in the history of parliamentary process

#### Still links-the plan would cause democratic congressional backlash and collapse focus.

## Affirmative Answers

### Won't pass

#### Won't pass -- Dems will insist on including immigration provisions in the final reconciliation which Republicans won't accept.

JEFFREY **MERVIS JUN 22 2022**
https://www.science.org/content/article/democrats-lobby-high-tech-immigration-reforms-innovation-bill-congress

[[The COMPETES Act passed the House with the support of only one
Republican lawmaker]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[And there are
no]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[immigration provisions in the Senate
version]{.underline}]{.mark}, which won significant Republican support.
That means Lofgren and her Democratic colleagues must convince enough
Senate Republicans that these narrowly focused changes to current
immigration policy belong in the final bill because they are essential
to sustaining U.S. innovation. A hearing last week by a Senate judiciary
subcommittee on immigration made public those deep partisan divisions.
The 14 June hearing focused on the plight of so-called
Dreamers---undocumented immigrants living in the United States since
they were children who have been given a temporary reprieve from
deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)
program. But that program, created in 2012, faces legal challenges that
could soon lead to its termination. Some DACA recipients are
early-career scientists, like Dalia Larios, a resident in radiation
oncology at Harvard Medical School who came to the United States from
Mexico at the age of 10. Larios was the first DACA recipient to enter
Harvard Medical School, and she testified about how students like her
are eager to remain and apply their talents to bolster U.S. economic
growth. The panel's Republicans readily acknowledged the contributions
of immigrant scientists and engineers to U.S. innovation. But some
suggested it was premature to make new rules for foreign-born
researchers before deciding how to deal with other groups, such as the
Dreamers. "Between DACA and STEM entrepreneurs, what should be
Congress's priority?" Senator John Cornyn (R--TX), a key backer of the
Senate innovation bill, asked Larios, who declined to choose. Speaking
to ScienceInsider after the hearing, Cornyn said he's worried that
adding the House immigration provisions to the final product would put
the entire bill in jeopardy. "Immigration is not the primary purpose of
\[the Senate innovation bill\]," Cornyn said. "And based on my
experience here, I think that [[the more it deals with immigration, the
harder it will be to get it passed]{.underline}]{.mark}." Other
Republican senators believe border security must come first, and they
don't trust U.S. universities hosting foreign-born scientists to
safeguard national security. If anything, said Senator Marsha Blackburn
(R--TN), the new visa category and other provisions will make it easier
for enemies of the United States to pilfer emerging technologies.
Bernard Burrola, a senior officer at the 230-member Association of
Public and Land-grant Universities, which backs a pathway to citizenship
for DACA recipients and Lofgren's provisions, rejected Blackburn's
premise. "We take this topic incredibly seriously," he told Blackburn

#### China bill won't pass -- no agreement on loophole language and tech giants.

Cristiano **Lima** **June 10 2022** Pelosi fears tech giants will
exploit wrinkle in China competition bill, sources say
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/10/pelosi-fears-tech-giants-will-exploit-wrinkle-china-competition-bill-sources-say/

For weeks, [[consumer advocates have sounded the alarm that trade
language in the massive China competition bill under
negotiation]{.underline}]{.mark} on Capitol Hill [[could be
exploited]{.underline}]{.mark} by the tech giants to target regulations
overseas, including Europe's sweeping new digital rules. It's [[a
concern that's shared by]{.underline}]{.mark} House Speaker Nancy
[[Pelosi]{.underline}]{.mark} (D-Calif.), people familiar with the
matter told The Technology 202. At odds is a portion of the legislation
that's ostensibly aimed at "addressing censorship and barriers to
digital trade" in countries like China, but one that groups fear
contains loopholes that could be co-opted by major corporations. Under
the Senate version of the bill, the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) would be required to identify and report on
countries "that engage in acts, policies, or practices that disrupt
digital trade activities," including censorship. It's a process that can
lead to tariffs, and that advocates say could be weaponized to exert
pressure on tech regulations overseas. On Friday, a transatlantic
coalition of consumer groups wrote a letter to congressional leadership
warning that the language has been crafted too broadly and could be used
by tech companies to claim that rules overseas seeking to promote online
safety or crack down on competitive abuses qualify as "censorship" or as
"barriers to digital trade." The groups said in the letter shared
exclusively with The Technology 202 that it may "undermine the European
Union's superior regulatory framework to protect consumers online." The
Coalition for App Fairness, a group of smaller app developers including
Match Group and Basecamp that is pushing for new tech regulations, also
voiced concern last month in a separate letter obtained by The
Technology 202 that the language "could be interpreted to undermine
critical efforts to restore fairness and competition to the digital app
economy." Another coalition of consumer and anti-monopoly groups took
aim at the language last month. [[The provision is a key point of
contention]{.underline}]{.mark} for consumer advocates [[as talks enter
a pivotal stretch on Capitol Hill, where the House and Senate will need
to hammer out differences]{.mark}]{.underline} between their versions of
the bill, aimed at boosting competitiveness with China. The concerns are
shared by key House lawmakers, including Pelosi, said the people
familiar with the matter, who spoke anonymously to discuss private
talks. It could emerge as a flash point in negotiations as the two
chambers look to finalize the highly watched package. During a hearing
last June, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) urged colleagues to reject what
she called the "effort to entrench Big Tech's ... failed \[business\]
models" in the bill by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mike Crapo
(R-Idaho), who authored part of the Senate trade title. Schakowsky
confirmed the remarks were in reference to the section on censorship and
barriers to digital trade, among other provisions. "This is exactly the
wrong approach, and as a conferee I will fight to make sure this bad
approach stays out," Schakowsky, who is in the group negotiating the
bill, said in a statement. Pelosi\'s staff has told House members she
shares the concerns, according to two people familiar with the matter. A
senior congressional aide added "there's no daylight" between Schakowsky
and Pelosi. Another senior congressional aide, who was not authorized to
speak on the record, said the "House position is reflected in what is
and what isn't included in the trade-related measures which were
carefully crafted to have the votes to be able to pass the House."

### PC Spent Already

#### PC on China bills is already spent\-\--the bills have been debated for over a year

Joseph **Clark March 22 2022** The Washington Times, "China competition
bill set to advance to final negotiations in Congress after months of
delays",
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/mar/22/china-competition-bill-set-advance-final-negotiati/

[[The [Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) has
forged ahead with a long-stalled bill to promote
U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}. production of microprocessor chips [[to better
compete with China]{.underline}]{.mark}, preparing to inch the
legislation forward and into a tough round of negotiations with the
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/). [[President
Biden has pressed Congress for quick passage of the sweeping
legislation]{.underline}]{.mark} but key differences remain between the
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) and
[Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) versions. The
[Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) version is the
\$250 billion U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. The
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) counterpart is
the \$335 billion America COMPETES Act. After months of stalls,
[Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) Majority Leader
Charles E. Schumer set up the votes to get the legislation into a
bicameral conference committee to begin reconciling the two bills.
"[[This legislation has been dissected and debated for well over a year
now,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat, said on the
[Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) floor Tuesday.
"But the need to pass this bill really boils down to two simple words:
J-O-B-S, jobs and C-O-S-T-S costs." Both the
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) and
[Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) versions
include a \$52 billion boost for semiconductor manufacturing to combat a
chip shortage. "There's nothing abstract about the shortage of chips,"
Mr. Schumer said. "It impacts Americans' abilities to buy cars,
refrigerators, phones, and other household items. By passing bipartisan
legislation that invests in domestic chip production, we can help
alleviate this vexing chips crisis." The
[Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) version first
passed in June with the support of 18 Republicans and 50 Democrats. But
the nearly 3,000-page
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) version also
includes a hodgepodge of spending including \$8 billion to help
developing countries address climate change, funding to make the U.S.
less reliant on Chinese solar technology and \$45 billion to shore up
U.S. supply chains.
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) Republicans
railed against the bill, which passed 222 to 210 last month, as a
"foreign policy failure" that funnels taxpayer dollars into an
"unaccountable U.N. slush fund" without addressing threats to U.S.
national security posed by China.
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) Republicans also
voiced frustration with the process, saying they were sidelined while
Democrats wrote the bill. Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who
worked on the [Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/)
version, said he is committed to making the final bill more palatable
for [House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) Republicans.
The bill is a priority for Democrats and its passage would be a big win
for Mr. Biden, who has been hobbled by a string of legislative defeats.
Mr. Biden also has struggled to untangle a global supply chain hobbled
by shipping delays and backlogs. And, the U.S. has been edged out of
semiconductor manufacturing in recent decades by overseas producers. On
Monday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urged lawmakers to quickly move
the legislation through Congress. "The situation as it relates to
semiconductors is quite dire," Ms. Raimondo said in a call with senators
of both parties. Ms. Raimondo brought in former Trump administration
officials, for the call including former national security adviser H.R.
McMaster, to help sway lawmakers. During the call, Mr. Young said he
welcomed the start of formal negotiations between the
[House](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house/) and
[Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) but wanted an
open process "with input from all of my colleagues and consistent with
what we call around here regular order." "[[I know the vote will not be
unanimous and that both parties and members of both parties are going to
have to make principled compromises, principled
concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}, in order to get an agreement done," he
said. "That's always what happens when you approach a negotiating table.
But America and the world will be better off with a bipartisan, broadly
supported final product."

### Winners win

#### Winners win

Paul **Kane 2021**, Senior Congressional Correspondent and Columnist at
the Washington Post, "Day-to-day, Biden's Agenda Looks Rocky. But
Congressional Democrats Say Things Are Far Rosier If You Take The Long
View.", Washington Post, 7/24/2021,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/biden-agenda-democrats-congress/2021/07/24/83b776be-ebc0-11eb-ba5d-55d3b5ffcaf1_story.html

There is, so far at least, little fear that Democrats are spreading
themselves too thin by eschewing the traditional practice of focusing on
a handful of domestic policy issues in the first two years of an
administration. "[[Political momentum and political capital is like a
muscle]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The more you exercise it, the more of it
you have. It is not like a finite resource that you can run out of if
you spend too much of it. What happens is that if we do a lot of
positive things, then we've got more political clout to do even more
positive things]{.underline}]{.mark}," Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii)
said.

#### Winners win\-\--legislative successes continue and build

Phil **Mattingly 2021**, "Biden wanted to remind Democrats what it was
like to win. Now he\'s aiming to capitalize on that momentum.," CNN,
11-9-2021,
https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/joe-biden-infrastructure-bill-momentum/index.html

When President Joe Biden worked the phones for hours late into Friday
night to push through his massive infrastructure bill, what he really
wanted was to show Democrats what it felt like to win. After months of
missed deadlines, simmering distrust and political fallout, White House
officials now hope [[success can breed success]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
victory came at a critical moment for a party and a President mired in
months of internecine legislative warfare that had largely overshadowed
the actual policies in question. Getting the \$1.2 trillion package over
the line is viewed by the White House and its Democratic allies as a
moment where some trust \-- however fragile \-- has been established
between the party\'s different factions, giving Democrats the chance to
finally turn the corner. \"[[It helps when you succeed on something and
everybody sees and figures out what it feels like to win and get
something done,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} a senior administration official
said. [[\"It creates momentum.\"]{.underline}]{.mark} \"Momentum\" is
hardly a scientific concept, and there aren\'t any misconceptions inside
the West Wing about the complicated high-wire act required in the weeks
ahead to clinch the \$2 trillion economic and climate package that makes
up the second piece of Biden\'s domestic agenda, officials say. But the
hours of frenzied Friday night negotiations, in close coordination with
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, led to something that has been missing
throughout weeks of fits and starts, missed deadlines and delicate
balancing act between moderates and progressives: An outcome. [[Biden is
planning to capitalize on]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[victory]{.underline}]{.mark} by inviting scores of lawmakers to the
White House for a formal signing ceremony next week, officials say.
It\'s the type of event where eager members of Congress angle for a
photo-op or signing pen \-- something that has remained out of reach on
Biden\'s central agenda items until now. In isolation, it doesn\'t
resolve the existing policy divides facing Democrats on both sides of
Pennsylvania Avenue on the second piece of Biden\'s agenda. But it does
give lawmakers, who for months have clashed over the direction of the
bills, something to celebrate \-- and sell back home. \"Now comes the
hard part,\" one House Democrat told CNN early Saturday morning. It was
a sentiment largely echoed by more than a dozen participants in the
process throughout the weekend. But if the need to reconcile a series of
policy thickets remains, there is a sense that the party dynamics may
have, in fact, shifted in the frenzied final late-night hours that
cleared the way to pass Biden\'s \$1.2 trillion infrastructure proposal.
\"You see that whatever the things that are dividing you or separating
you, it helps to clarify that actually we agree on a hell of a lot
more,\" the official said. That process, arduous and painful as it may
have been \-- both politically and in terms of the caucus dynamics \--
finally led to a breakthrough. Now that breakthrough needs to translate
into action on the broader and more transformational economic and
climate package. That\'s exactly what White House officials are banking
on. \"It ain\'t over yet as they say the old expression goes, but I feel
good,\" Biden told reporters on Monday after an event celebrating the
defending NBA Champion Milwaukee Bucks. \"I think people have realized,
are beginning to realize it\'s important to get it done.\" Biden draws a
line in the sand The agreement drove the players leading those clashes
together to reach a deal, culminating in a massive piece of legislation
passing the House. In a party driven \-- in the words of one House
Democrat \-- \"not by mistrust, but by no trust,\" it was an important
development. It also came at a critical moment for Biden, with his poll
numbers sitting at their lowest point of his first year in office and
just days after Democrats emerged from an election night that saw their
nominee for governor in Virginia \-- a state Biden won by 10 points just
one year ago \-- lose. [[\"I think the one message that came across was:
Get something done,]{.underline}]{.mark}\" Biden told reporters of the
role in the Virginia governor\'s race in the outcome. \"It\'s time to
get something done. \" Biden, who for weeks took quiet criticism from
House Democrats for not publicly drawing a harder line on what he
wanted, pivoted hard to do exactly that during those final hours \--
something Pelosi explicitly called for, people involved told CNN. [[But
reaching that point was a progression]{.underline}]{.mark}, officials
said, developed over months of negotiations, private conversations,
blown deadlines, intraparty recriminations and \-- in some cases \--
what many Democrats viewed as missed opportunities. It was, for better
or worse, all part of the process for a new administration and
congressional Democrats adjusting to full control in Washington for the
first time in decade. \"It\'s getting to know a lot of these people, to
build trust,\" Biden told reporters the day after the bill passed.
\"Because everything I say I\'m going to try to do, I will try to do.
And I think that\'s also part of the process.\" A Senate veteran learns
more about the House Biden\'s point is a window into the last several
months, where a 36-year veteran of the Senate \-- who often makes clear
in private settings his view that he has an innate sense for Capitol
Hill \-- faced his own learning curve, particularly in the House. [[The
party dynamics have shifted, with progressives carrying not just a
voice, but the votes to dictate what will or won\'t
advance.]{.underline}]{.mark} Many came to office in the four years
after Biden left Washington. Even more had never served in the majority
with a Democratic president. Exacerbating it all were the barest of
majorities in the House and Senate, making Biden\'s ambitious policy
agenda \-- which progressives overwhelmingly supported \-- even more
complicated to advance. Biden has sought to reintroduce himself to the
dynamics by hosting scores of lawmakers in the Oval Office, crowding
lawmakers onto couches and hearing them out over the course of dozens of
meetings since taking office. While each meeting usually has an
officially stated purpose, they have served more generally as
get-to-know-you sessions, during which Biden is able to gain greater
insight into each member\'s particular needs. For many, it is their
first visit to the White House; Biden\'s predecessor Donald Trump did
not habitually invite Democrats to meet with him. They often leave with
White House-baked chocolate chip cookies or, more recently, specially
commissioned ice cream bars bearing Biden\'s presidential seal. A
lightning-fast, at least by congressional standards, win on Biden\'s
\$1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief proposal in his first few months in
office was \-- to a degree \-- misleading. The urgency mattered, with
the country still mired in the worst of the pandemic. Democrats were
exceedingly careful not to undercut their new president \-- or their new
Senate majority. The path on his \$3 trillion, dual-pronged domestic
agenda has been significantly less seamless. Even for the self-professed
\"congenital optimist\" in the Oval Office, navigating the divides has
proved frustrating in recent weeks as his negotiators and Democratic
leaders sought to thread the needle through compromises and self-imposed
deadlines, to no avail. \"We have to develop the will, and develop the
will means putting aside personal agenda,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, the House
Democratic whip form South Carolina and a close Biden ally, said on
\"Fox News Sunday.\" \"That to me has been a problem for us.\" It also
takes a recognition that any single member can create a new problem to
resolve. Those problems appeared to perpetually win the day \-- until
late Friday night. \"This, in terms of degree of difficulty is very,
very high,\" the official said. \"Which makes succeeding all the more
satisfying and fulfilling.\" Working the phones Still, the plans for
that victory were quickly thrown off track Friday morning by a small
group of House moderates who refused to move forward without a full
Congressional Budget Office accounting of whether the second package
would be financed. With that off the table for at least a week and maybe
longer, Pelosi shifted course. The decision to move the infrastructure
bill without the second proposal, pitched by members of the
Congressional Black Caucus and moved on by Pelosi, initially ran into
the same progressive roadblock that had sidetracked the prior two
deadlines. But unlike those moments \-- when Biden was regularly on the
phone with members but cautious not to corner or jam any member \-- the
President went all in to find a path forward, according to people
familiar with the calls. He and his team worked in close coordination
with Pelosi on who to call and what to float as potential options to
reconcile the differences. The two spoke by phone four times, with
Pelosi giving Biden names of lawmakers to call and working closely with
his top negotiators as they worked through the process of laying the
groundwork to move forward. Biden made calls to moderate members. He
made calls to progressive members. He talked to most of Pelosi\'s
leadership team over the course of the day. It wasn\'t immediately
effective. Biden was explicitly told \"no\" in a call with at least one
progressive \-- Rep. Pramila Jayapl, the chair of the Congressional
Progressive Caucus \-- sources said. Jayapal initially rejected the
effort publicly as well. In a conference call with dozens of
progressives, there was palpable frustration on Biden\'s part when the
reticence to move forward on infrastructure without the second proposal
was made clear, according to participants. An official acknowledged that
some of the conversations \"were a little bumpy\" and not everyone was
on board at the beginning. But the decision was made to continue to
press forward. The result \-- after hours of calls, negotiations, an
official statement from Biden \-- was progressive and moderate leaders
coming together to craft statements committing to move forward on the
economic and climate package once the CBO score was in hand.

### Political Capital Fails

#### PC fails

Ryan **Telingator** B.A. in Political Science and Government from
Bowdoin University, **May 20 2021**, "When is Change Possible?
Presidential Power as Shaped by Political Context, Constitutional Tools,
and Legislative Skills",
https://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/honorsprojects/258/

My research does not support Greenstein's theory. Instead, my findings
align more closely with those of George Edwards in At the Margins, where
he argues that the "[[national preoccupation with the chief executive is
misplaced]{.underline}]{.mark}," and that [[presidential power
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, [[limited]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Constitution's "purposefully inefficient system in which the founding
fathers' handiwork in decentralizing power defeats even the most capable
leaders."50 Instead of focusing on legislative skills as a source of
presidential influence, Edwards argues that party support and public
support are more important. [[Legislative skills are only critical for
"members of Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} who remain open to change
after other influences have had their impact."51 In a time as polarized
as today, where very few members of Congress are "open to chang\[ing\]"
their vote, these skills play a minor role in legislative negotiations.
Similar assertions are made in another book by Edwards, Predicting the
Presidency. He argues that exploiting existing opportunities
(consolidating existing party and public support) is much more important
for presidential success than creating opportunities (convincing
legislators to change their vote vis a vis legislative skills).52 Both
Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan are remembered for their exemplary
political skills. The Johnson Treatment, a legislating strategy in which
Johnson used his imposing 6'4", 240-pound figure -- literally physically
and verbally bullying, cajoling, lobbying, and threatening -- to get
what he wanted out of people,53 remains infamous in presidential
political literature. Similarly, Ronald Reagan, "The Great
Communicator," is still revered for his oratorial prestige. Although
these legislative skills were useful in passing the pieces of
legislation outlined in the case studies -- Johnson gaining support from
southern Democrats on the EOA and Reagan compellingly speaking in favor
of the ERTA -- they proved impotent in political contexts not conducive
to change. After Vietnam for Johnson and after the passage of the ERTA
for Reagan (in conjunction with the recession in 1982), the presidents'
policy windows closed. Their renowned legislative skills could not
overcome an inopportune political context. The case studies thus
demonstrate the value of skills at the margins, but also exemplify their
unsubstantial influence as the major factor driving policy. Again, the
research suggests that political context is the most important factor in
legislative change. 5.4 Applying Lessons to the Present: Predicting
Biden's Success With an understanding that the political context largely
drives a president's potential for change, with skills helping on the
margins, it is important to assess the 2021 political climate in order
make an informed prediction about Biden's prospects. The COVID-19
pandemic opened a significant policy window for Biden. With a U.S. death
toll nearing 580,000, massive unemployment, and a severe economic
contraction, the pandemic was an all-encompassing problem that the
entire country wanted addressed. Thus, the three streams of problem,
policy, and politics converged to open the opportunity for the Biden
administration to pass the American Rescue Plan. The Rescue Plan was
signed into law in March and has received bipartisan support from the
American public.54 President Biden claimed a mandate from his election,
arguing that "millions of Americans" "voted for \[his\] vision," giving
"a clear victory" and tasking him to make his "vision real."55
However[[, based on the extreme polarization in D.C., it is unlikely to
become a quantifiable mandate that changes Congressional voting
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}.[[56 Polarization has made it impossible
to win cross-party support,]{.underline}]{.mark} or, in Edwardsian
terms, create new opportunities. [[There is deep political antagonism
between parties, and even within parties,57 making any sort of
bipartisanship near impossible.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The best evidence is that [[presidential persuasion is effective only at
the margins]{.underline}]{.mark} of congressional decision making.
[[Presidential legislative leadership operates in an environment largely
beyond the president's control]{.underline}]{.mark} and must compete
with other, more stable factors that affect voting in Congress in
addition to party. [[These include ideology]{.underline}]{.mark},
personal views and commitments on specific policies, and the interests

### China bills fail

#### Bills fail \-\--private investments solve

Tom **Lee Feb 1 2022** \"Industrial Policy: America COMPETES Act and

While CHIPS is very popular on both sides of the aisle[[, it may not
relieve current shortages as intended. It takes many years to build a
physical semiconductor production facility]{.underline}]{.mark}, so [[by
the time]{.underline}]{.mark} CHIPS became law and it [[funds were spent
on building production facilities in the United States,
the]{.underline}]{.mark} COVID-19-induced [[global semiconductor
shortage would be over]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, the semiconductor
industry, like many other capital-intensive industries, is cyclical in
nature because it is logistically difficult and expensive for
manufacturing facilities to rapidly increase production to meet sudden
surges in demand. It is thus best for market mechanisms, not government

#### Bill not needed -- companies have plenty of cash/incentive and any shortages ease before the bill can have an impact

**Lizz Peek Feb 10 2022** \"GOP: Don't fall for the America Competes
Act,\"
<https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/593676-gop-dont-fall-for-the-america-competes-act/>

But, back to the widely publicized core of the bill, which purports to
boost semiconductor manufacturing at home. Legislators are concerned
that the U.S., the birthplace of advanced silicon and once the dominant
supplier of the widely used electronic components, only accounted for 12
percent of global production in 2020, down from 37 percent in 1990.
Advocates neglect to mention that [[the U.S. has enjoyed a steady rise
in chip output, and in investment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This comes at a time when chips are in short supply, [[the industry
consequently is operating full out and reaping record
profits.]{.underline}]{.mark} After decades during which technology
gains made chips cheaper and prices dropped, companies have been raising
prices aggressively. TSMC announced last year that it would raise prices
up to 20 percent, its largest hike in a decade. Other companies have
done the same, with the prices of some chips soaring as much as 40
percent.

In other words, [[semiconductor providers are in an excellent position
to expand, and surely don't need taxpayer help to do
so]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In fact, [[major manufacturers are doing just that.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Intel recently broke ground on a new plant in Arizona and has announced
that it will build a \$20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in
Ohio, saying it wants to expand capacity and bring more production home.
Interestingly, it has not set a timetable for the Ohio construction,
indicating that it is waiting to see what Congress will offer in the way
of incentives.

TSMC, the leading producer of high-end chips, is already building a \$12
billion facility in Arizona, the first leg of an announced \$100 billion
investment program. Samsung, the biggest supplier, is building a \$17
billion fabricating plant in Texas, its largest-ever investment in the
U.S.

These companies understand the risks and rewards of manufacturing in the
U.S. and are voting with their feet. Even the bill's backers acknowledge
that [[the shortage will likely ease before the subsidies in the America
Competes Act kick in. Taxpayers should not fund what could turn into a
boom-bust cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Warming defense

#### Extinction from warming requires [12 degrees]{.underline}, [far greater]{.underline} than their internal link, and intervening actors will solve before then 

Sebastian **Farquhar 17** leads the Global Priorities Project (GPP) at
the Centre for Effective Altruism, et al., 2017, "Existential Risk:
Diplomacy and Governance,"
https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf

[The [most likely levels of]{.mark} global [warming are very unlikely to
cause]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 The
[[existential risks]{.mark} of climate change]{.underline} instead
[[stem from tail risk]{.underline}]{.mark} climate change -- [[the low
probability of extreme]{.mark} levels of [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- [and interaction with other sources of risk]{.underline}. It is
impossible to say with confidence at what point global warming would
become severe enough to pose an existential threat. Research has
suggested that [warming of 11-[12°C would render]{.mark} most of [the
planet uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline},16 and would completely
devastate agriculture.17 This would pose an extreme threat to human
civilisation as we know it.18 Warming of around 7°C or more could
potentially produce conflict and instability on such a scale that the
indirect effects could be an existential risk, although it is extremely
uncertain how likely such scenarios are.19 Moreover, [the
[timescales]{.mark} over which such changes might happen could
[mean]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[humanity is able to
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark} enough [[to avoid extinction in even]{.mark}
very [extreme scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}. The probability of these
levels of warming depends on eventual greenhouse gas concentrations.
According to some experts, [unless strong action is taken soon by major
emitters]{.underline}, it is likely that [we will pursue a medium-high
emissions pathway]{.underline}.20 If we do, the chance of extreme
warming is highly uncertain but appears non-negligible. Current
concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher than they have been for
hundreds of thousands of years,21 which means that there are significant
unknown unknowns about how the climate system will respond. Particularly
concerning is the risk of positive feedback loops, such as the release
of vast amounts of methane from melting of the arctic permafrost, which
would cause rapid and disastrous warming.22 The economists Gernot Wagner
and Martin Weitzman have used IPCC figures (which do not include
modelling of feedback loops such as those from melting permafrost) to
estimate that [if we continue to pursue a medium-high emissions
pathway]{.underline}, the [[probability of]{.mark} eventual warming of
[6°C is]{.mark} around [10%]{.mark}]{.underline},23
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[10°C is]{.underline}]{.mark} around
[[3%]{.underline}]{.mark}.24 [[These]{.mark} estimates
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} of course [[highly
uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is likely]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the world will take action]{.mark} against climate change [once it
begins to impose]{.mark} large [costs]{.mark}]{.underline} on human
society, [[long before]{.mark} there is [warming of
10°C]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, there is significant inertia
in the climate system: there is a 25 to 50 year lag between CO2
emissions and eventual warming,25 and it is expected that 40% of the
peak concentration of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere 1,000 years
after the peak is reached.26 Consequently, it is impossible to reduce
temperatures quickly by reducing CO2 emissions. If the world does start
to face costly warming, the international community will therefore face
strong incentives to find other ways to reduce global temperatures.

#### Climate change is inevitable -- even ending emissions won't solve

Zing **Tsjeng, 19**, 2-27-2019, executive editor and the author of the
Forgotten Women book series, \"The Climate Change Paper So Depressing
It\'s Sending People to Therapy\",

AVD

\"Deep Adaptation\" is quite unlike any other academic paper. There\'s
the language (\"we are about to play Russian Roulette with the entire
human race with already two bullets loaded\"). There\'s the flashes of
dark humor (\"I was only partly joking earlier when I questioned why I
was even writing this paper\"). But most of all[, there\'s the stark
conclusions that it draws about the future]{.underline}. Chiefly, [that
[it\'s too late to stop climate change from devastating our world---and
that \"climate-induced societal collapse is now inevitable in the near
term]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} How near? About a decade. Professor Jem
Bendell, a sustainability academic at the University of Cumbria, wrote
the paper after taking a sabbatical at the end of 2017 to review and
understand the latest climate science \"properly---not sitting on the
fence anymore,\" as he puts it on the phone to me. What he found
terrified him. \"[The evidence before us suggests that we are set for
disruptive and uncontrollable levels of climate change, bringing
starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and war]{.underline},\" he
writes in the paper. \"Our norms of behavior---that we call our
\'civilization\'---may also degrade.\" \"[[It is time]{.mark},\" he
adds, \"[we consider]{.mark} the implications of [it]{.mark} being [too
late to avert a global environmental catastrophe]{.mark} in the
lifetimes of people alive today]{.underline}.\" Even a schmuck like me
is familiar with some of the evidence Bendell sets out to prove his
point. [You only needed to step outside during the record-breaking
heatwave last year to acknowledge that 17 of the 18 hottest years on the
planet have occurred since 2000. [Scientists]{.mark} already
[believe]{.mark} [we]{.mark} [are]{.mark} soon [on course for an
**ice-free Arctic**]{.mark}, [which will]{.mark} only [accelerate global
warming]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Back in 2017, even Fox News
reported [scientists\' warn]{.mark}ings that [the Earth\'s sixth mass
extinction was underway]{.mark}.]{.underline} Erik Buitenhuis, a senior
researcher at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, tells me
that Bendell\'s conclusions may sound extreme, but he agrees with the
report\'s overall assessment. \"I think societal collapse is indeed
inevitable,\" he says, though adds that \"the process is likely to take
decades to centuries.\" [The important thing, Buitenhuis says, is to
realize that the negative effects of climate change have already been
with us for some time: \"Further gradual deterioration looks much more
likely to me than a disaster within the next ten years that will be big
enough that, after that, everybody will agree the status quo is
doomed.\"]{.underline} \"Jem\'s paper is in the main well-researched and
supported by relatively mainstream climate science,\" says Professor
Rupert Read, chair of the Green House think-tank and a philosophy
academic at the University of East Anglia. \"That\'s why I\'m with him
on the fundamentals. And more and more people are.\" Read\'s key
disagreement with Bendell is his belief that we still have time to
snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, saying, \"[I think it\'s hubris
to think that we know the future.\" But that doesn\'t mean Bendell\'s
premise is wrong: \"The way I see it, [deep adaptation is]{.mark}
insurance **[against the possibility]{.mark}**---or rather, the
probability---[of]{.mark} some kind of [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
says Read. \"\'Deep Adaptation\' is saying, \'What do we need to do if
collapse is something we need to realistically plan for?\'\" [When I
speak to Bendell, he tells me he thinks of \"Deep Adaptation\" as more
of an ethical and philosophical framework, rather than a prophecy about
the future of the planet]{.underline}. \"The longer we refuse to talk
about climate change as already here and screwing with our way of
life---because we don\'t want to think like that because it\'s too
frightening or will somehow demotivate people---the less time we have to
reduce harm,\" he says with deliberation. What does he mean by harm?
\"Starvation is the first one,\" he answers, pointing to lowering
harvests of grain in Europe in 2018 due to drought that saw the EU reap
6 million tons less wheat. \"In the scientific community at the moment,
the appropriate thing is to say that 2018 was an anomaly. However, if
you look at what\'s been happening over the last few years, it isn\'t an
anomaly. There\'s a possibility that 2018 is the new best case
scenario.\" [That means, in Bendell\'s view, that governments need to
start planning emergency responses to climate change, including growing
and stockpiling food.]{.underline} He minces his words even less in his
paper: \"When I say starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and
war, I mean in your own life. With the power down, soon you won\'t have
water coming out of your tap. [You will depend on your neighbors for
food and some warmth. You will become malnourished. You won\'t know
whether to stay or go. You will fear being violently killed before
starving to death.\"]{.underline} Should people start building bunkers
and buying bulletproof vests? \"There\'s no way of getting through this
unless we try together,\" he says. \"We need to help people stay fed and
watered where they live already to reduce disruption and reduce civil
unrest as much as we can.\" Of the Silicon Valley financiers prepping
for the apocalypse in New Zealand, he says: \"Once money doesn\'t matter
anymore and the armed guards are trying to feed their starving children,
what do you think they\'ll do? The billionaires doing that are just
deluded.\" [Bendell wasn\'t always this gloomy about the state of the
world. He once worked for WWF, one of the biggest environmental
charities in the world, and in 2012 founded the Institute for Leadership
and Sustainability (IFLAS) at the University of Cumbria. [The World
Economic Forum]{.mark} named him a Young Global Leader for his work. So
how did he [end up writing]{.mark} a paper that determined [that
civilization]{.mark}---and environmental sustainability as we currently
understand it---[is doomed]{.mark}?]{.underline} \"Since the age of 15,
I\'ve been an environmentalist,\" he tells me. \"I\'ve given my life
professionally and personally. I\'m a workaholic, and it was all about
sustainability.\" Once he sat down with the data, however, he realized
that his field was quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of oncoming
climate catastrophe. \"It would mean not getting super excited about the
expansion of your recycling program in a major multinational,\" he says.
\"It\'s a completely different paradigm of what we should be looking
at.\" What he didn't expect was for the paper to take off online. \"It
was aimed at those people in my professional community and why we\'re in
denial,\" he says. \"When I put it out there, I didn't expect
15-year-olds in schools in Indonesia to be reading it with their
teachers.\" He says that \"Deep Adaptation\" has been downloaded over
110,000 times since it was released by IFLAS as an occasional paper[.
\"Someone in the alternative economics and bitcoin crowd told me, \'Oh,
everyone\'s talking about deep adaptation in London at all the dinner
parties,\'\" he laughs.]{.underline} Researchers from the Institute for
Public Policy Research (IPPR), an established progressive think-tank,
consulted Bendell\'s paper in the process of writing its new report,
\"This is a crisis: Facing up to the age of environmental breakdown.\"
Laurie Laybourn-Langton, its lead author, told me via email: \"I
appreciated the frankness of the report in facing up to issues that so
many in research and policy communities seem unwilling to. We don\'t
subscribe to the view that social collapse is inevitable, however.\" He
explains: [\"This is partly because it\'s so hard to predict the
outcomes of the complex and uncertain process of environmental shocks
interacting with social and economic systems. We simply don\'t know.
That said, they shouldn't be disregarded as a potential outcome, and so
we are calling for greater levels of preparedness to these
shocks.\"]{.underline} Not everyone was so taken with the paper. Bendell
submitted it to a well-respected academic journal for publication, with
little success. Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal
(SAMPJ) told me that the paper was in need of \"major revisions\" before
it would be ready for publication. Bendell ended up publishing it
through IFLAS and his blog. \"The academic process is such that I took
that as an effective rejection,\" he explains, saying that the reviewers
wanted him to fundamentally alter his conclusions. \"I couldn\'t
completely rewrite the paper to say that I don\'t think collapse is
inevitable. It was asking for a different paper.\" Emerald, the
scholarly publisher that owns SAMPJ, says it takes issue with how
Bendell frames its reception of its paper on his blog: \"[the study on
collapse they thought you should not read---yet.\" A spokesperson told
me: \"The decision was arrived at based on the merit of the submitted
article and the double blind peer review process integral to academia
and the advancement of knowledge]{.underline}. SAMPJ, and \[editor Carol
Adams\] are proud members of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)
and adhere to the highest ethical standards in publishing. We see no
evidence that the decision of Major Revision was politically motivated.
\"Emerald requested the author correct their blog post to reflect the
facts. This request was unfortunately ignored. The post continues to
imply the paper was rejected because it was deemed too controversial.
The paper was not rejected, and was given a Major Revision due to the
rigorous standards of the scholarly output of the journal.\" Bendell
says he did reply to Emerald\'s request to amend his blog post---but
only if they would consider telling him the decisions of those who
reviewed his paper. (Under the double blind peer review, reviewers\'
decisions are anonymous.) \"That title can be read in a number of
ways,\" he says. \"It is a paper that the reviewers didn\'t want you to
read. They didn\'t want it published.\" Climate gloom and doom is
nothing new---doomsday preppers have been stockpiling their freeze-dried
food rations for decades now. But Bendell\'s paper appears to have hit a
unique nerve, especially given that the average scientific paper is
estimated to be read by only three or so people. Rupert Read tells me
that he was sent it simultaneously by three other academics when it was
published. But it hasn't trended on Twitter[. It hasn\'t been pushed by
a celebrity. It was briefly mentioned in a Bloomberg Businessweek
article, but that\'s it. \"Deep Adaptation\" is that unique social
phenomenon: an academic paper that has gone viral through word of mouth.
Nathan Savelli, a 31-year-old high school life coach from Hamilton,
Canada, was recommended the paper by a local environmental activist.
Reading it sent him spiraling into depression. \"I guess in some ways it
felt like I was diagnosed with a terminal illness,\" he tells me. \"If
I\'m being honest, it was a mix of heartbreaking sadness and extreme
anger]{.underline}.\" Savelli felt so low that he sought help from a
climate grief support group organized by 350.org, the global grassroots
climate movement. \"I had attended counseling in the past for other
issues, but never a group session, and thought it might be something
helpful for me,\" he tells me. Did it help? \"I\'m not sure I\'d say it
alleviated my grief, but it was definitely comforting to be around
people who understood what I was feeling.\" And therein lies the problem
with \"Deep Adaptation:\" if you accept that the paper is entirely
correct in its prediction of collapse, how do you move on with your
life? How do you even get out of bed in the morning? \"I\'m aware of
what difficult emotions it triggers,\" Bendell acknowledges. \"I do
believe that if you've come across this \[paper\], then absolutely some
grief and despair is very natural. Why isn\'t that OK? We all die in the
end. Life is about impermanence.\" On his blog, he lists several sources
for psychological support, including several groups on Facebook and
LinkedIn that discuss collapse and offer help to those struggling to
come to terms with the conclusions of his paper. But, Bendell adds,
reading the paper has been \"transformative\" for some. \"People find a
new boldness about living life on their own terms---actually connecting
to their heart\'s desire. How do they wish to live, and why don\'t they
live that way now rather than postponing it?\" In one case, it even
helped prompt one high-ranking academic to quit her job and the city.
[In December of 2017, Dr. Alison Green left her post as the pro
vice-chancellor of Arden University. She had read [the **IPCC report
warn**]{.mark}ing [that the world is **nowhere near** averting global
temperature increases]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as the 1,656-page
National Climate Assessment on how climate change is now dramatically
affecting our lives---and then she read Bendell\'s paper.

### China War defense

#### No US-China war

Charles C. **Krulak &** Alex **Friedman 21**, former President of
Birmingham-Southern College, former Commandant of the US Marine Corps,
M.S. from George Washington University; former Chief Financial Officer
of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, J.D. from Columbia University,
"The US and China Are Not Destined for War," Project Syndicate,

https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-china-not-destined-for-war-by-charles-c-krulak-and-alex-friedman-1-2021-08

True, throughout history, when a rising power has challenged a ruling
one, war has often been the result. But there are notable exceptions. [A
war between the US and China]{.underline} today [is no more inevitable
than]{.underline} was war between [the]{.underline} rising [US
and]{.underline} the declining [**U**nited **K**ingdom a century
ago]{.underline}. And in today's context, there are four compelling
reasons to believe that war between the US and China can be avoided.

First and foremost, any [military conflict]{.underline} between the two
[would quickly turn **nuc**lear]{.underline}. The US thus finds itself
in the same situation that it was in vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. Taiwan
could easily become this century's tripwire, just as the "Fulda Gap" in
Germany was during the Cold War. But the same dynamic of
"[**[m]{.mark}**utual **[a]{.mark}**ssured
**[d]{.mark}**estruction"]{.underline} that limited US-Soviet conflict
**[[applies to the US and China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [the
[international community]{.mark} would do everything]{.underline} in its
power [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that a potential
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear [conflict did not
materialize]{.mark},]{.underline} [given]{.underline} that [the
consequences]{.underline} would be fundamentally transnational and --
unlike climate change -- immediate.

A **[US-China [conflict]{.mark} would]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[[take the form of a proxy war]{.mark}, rather than a major-power
confrontation]{.underline}**. [Each]{.underline} superpower [might take
a different side in a domestic conflict]{.underline} in a country such
as Pakistan, Venezuela, Iran, or North Korea, [and
[deploy]{.mark}]{.underline} some combination of [[economic, cyber, and
diplomatic instruments]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have seen this type of
conflict many times before: from Vietnam to Bosnia, the US faced
surrogates rather than its principal foe.

Second, it is important to remember that, historically, **[[China plays
a long game]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although Chinese military power has
grown dramatically, [it]{.underline} still [[lags behind the US
on]{.mark} almost [every measure]{.mark} that matters]{.underline}. And
while China is investing heavily in [[asymmetric
equalizers]{.underline}]{.mark} (long-range anti-ship and hypersonic
missiles, military applications of cyber, and more), it [[will not
match]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[conventional means]{.underline}]{.mark} such as aircraft and large
ships [for decades, if ever.]{.underline}

A [[head-to-head conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} with the US
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[be **too dangerous for
China**]{.mark} to countenance at its current stage of
development]{.underline}. If such a conflict did occur, China would have
few options but to let the nuclear genie out of the bottle. In thinking
about baseline scenarios, therefore, we should give less weight to any
scenario in which the Chinese consciously precipitate a military
confrontation with America. The US military, however, tends to plan for
worst-case scenarios and is currently focused on a potential direct
conflict with China -- a fixation with overtones of the US-Soviet
dynamic.

This raises the risk of being blindsided by other threats. Time and
again since the Korean War, asymmetric threats have proven the most
problematic to national security. Building a force that can handle the
worst-case scenario does not guarantee success across the spectrum of
warfare.

The third reason to think that a Sino-American conflict can be avoided
is that [China is already [chalking up victories in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} global [[soft-power]{.mark} war]{.underline}.
Notwithstanding accusations that COVID-19 escaped from a virology lab in
Wuhan, [China]{.underline} has [[emerged from the pandemic
looking]{.underline}]{.mark} much [[better than the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [with]{.underline} its [**B**elt and
**R**oad **I**nitiative]{.underline} to finance infrastructure
development around the world, [it]{.underline} has [aggressively stepped
into the void left by US retrenchment]{.underline} during Donald Trump's
four-year presidency. **[China's [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** may
very well **[look at the]{.underline}** current [**s**tatus **quo**
**and [conclude]{.mark}**]{.underline} that **[[they are on the
right]{.mark}]{.underline}** strategic **[[path]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Finally, **[[China and the US are deeply intertwined]{.mark}
economically]{.underline}**. Despite Trump's trade war, Sino-American
bilateral trade in 2020 was around \$650 billion, and [China was
[America's largest]{.mark} [trade partner]{.mark}]{.underline}. The two
countries' [[supply-chain linkages are vast]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[China holds more]{.mark} than \$1 trillion in US
[Treasuries]{.mark}]{.underline}, most of [[which it cannot]{.mark}
easily [unload]{.mark}]{.underline}, lest it reduce their value and
incur massive losses.

To be sure, logic can be undermined by a single act and its unintended
consequences. Something as simple as a miscommunication can escalate a
proxy war into an interstate conflagration. And as the situations in
Afghanistan and Iraq show, America's track record in war-torn countries
is not encouraging. China, meanwhile, has dramatically stepped up its
foreign interventions. Between its expansionist mentality, its growing
foreign-aid program, and rising nationalism at home, China could all too
easily launch a foreign intervention that might threaten US interests.

Cyber mischief, in particular, could undercut conventional military
command-and-control systems, forcing leaders into bad decisions if more
traditional options are no longer on the table. And Sino-American
economic ties may come to matter less than they used to, especially as
China moves from an export-led growth model to one based on domestic
consumption, and as two-way investment flows decline amid escalating
bilateral tensions.

[A "[mistake]{.mark}"]{.underline} on the part of either country
[[is]{.mark} always [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is why
**[[diplomacy is essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Each country needs to
determine its vital national interests vis-à-vis the other, and both
need to consider the same question from the other's perspective. For
example, it may be hard to accept (and unpopular to say), but civil
rights within China might not be a vital US national interest. By the
same token, China should understand that the US does indeed have vital
interests in Taiwan.

[The US and China are destined to clash in many ways.]{.underline} But a
direct, **[interstate war need not be one of them]{.underline}**.

**[The question is whether China would risk losing its achievements and
recognition of being part of]{.underline}** the **[international
leadership for a relevant 'domestic' matter of geographical territory.
The answer can be found in history. [Waging war does not bring
popularity]{.mark} or]{.underline}** more **[power.]{.underline}**
Conflicts do not bring **[progress]{.underline}** and **[prosperity
[and]{.mark} certainly not a [leadership]{.mark} role for]{.underline}**
the **[countries leading their nations to destruction]{.underline}** and

geopolitical and military global leader after initiating and staging two

leadership is the most qualified reassurance that discourages wars.

\'arms race\' is not quite what it seems,\" World Economic Forum,

**[Increased military spending and arms purchasing by regional countries
are often identified as key indicators of a deteriorating regional
security predicament]{.underline}**. Almost as a reflex, some
commentators point to the growing dangers of a supposed Asian 'regional
arms race'; this piece from the South China Morning Post is typical.
**[[There is]{.mark} a [widespread impression]{.mark} that [regional
states']{.mark} escalating military spending and reckless development of
offensive military capabilities [are increasing]{.mark} the [risk of
conflict. Closer examination]{.mark}, though, [reveals]{.mark} that the
[hard evidence of]{.mark} [military developments]{.mark} in the region
[does not come close to]{.mark} the intense bilateral rivalry and speed
of [classic arms races]{.mark} involving major offensive
capabilities]{.underline}**, such as the contest for naval superiority
between Great Britain and Germany at the start of the twentieth century,
or that between the US and the Soviet Union for strategic nuclear
superiority in the 1950s and 1960s. As shown in this graphic
illustrating International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)
figures on defence spending in what American officials and others
increasingly refer to as the 'Indo-Pacific region', **[[China is a long
way from competing with the US]{.mark} in terms of military effort. At
the same time, [no]{.mark} other [regional state comes close to
competing with China]{.mark}. And while many Asian governments are
increasing their defence spending at quite a rate, they are mainly doing
this commensurately with their economic growth]{.underline}**, **[which
has been famously rapid for most of the current century.]{.underline}**
This graphic -- also using IISS figures - focuses on Southeast Asian
states' military efforts as a percentage of GDP over the last 25 years,
but a similar picture of defence effort shadowing economic growth is
apparent across Asia. **[Many factors go into the formation of defence
policy and levels of defence spending by Asian governments, but it seems
clear that the sheer availability of greater resources is an important
one]{.underline}**. **[And regional states do not, apparently, generally
feel compelled to increase their defence efforts more quickly than their
economies are growing. Media reports often highlight expensive arms
purchases by Asian governments]{.underline}**. **[But [military
capability is complex, and]{.mark} [buying new 'kit' does not provide
countries with instant capabilities]{.mark}, as is often
inferred]{.underline}**. Other important elements of capability include
appropriate doctrine, suitable training, inspiring leadership, high
morale, vital logistic support (including defence-industrial capacity),
relevant combat experience and a high level of operational integration
between military branches and services. Besides, mastery of the cyber
domain may be emerging as the sine qua non of military capability,
potentially providing the capacity to take down an opponent's ability
and will to fight even before a shot is fired. **[[Only a minority
of]{.mark} Asian armed [forces possess all]{.mark} these [key
capability]{.mark} elements]{.underline}**. **[In many cases, while they
might be able to hold domestic insurgents or other forms of unrest at
bay, or engage in border skirmishes]{.underline}**, **[their [forces
would be unable to mount sustained op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} those of [other countries.]{.mark} Moreover, most of
the military [capabilities]{.mark} under development in the region
[remain]{.mark} essentially [defensive]{.mark}. This applies not least
to China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). China's major, sustained,
long-term defence effort is certainly enhancing the capabilities of the
PLA, which would in any conflict now be able to complicate US
operational planning and activities severely]{.underline}**. **[But
China's long-range offensive capabilities]{.underline}** -- its nuclear
deterrent aside - remain limited. **[[The PLA is]{.mark} still [a long
way from matching]{.mark} [American capabilities, and]{.mark} it [would
have little hope of winning]{.mark} any [conflict with the
US,]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[whose military presence]{.mark} and
commitments [continue to ensure the security of the whole
region]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
