compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from
key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis,
these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData\'s
thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company
information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather
the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which
include big data, are chosen to cover \"any issue that keeps a CEO awake

#### gene editing is key to innovation

Claire **O'Connell**, 11-14-20**19**, Claire O\'Connell is a contributor
to The Irish Times who writes about health, science and innovation \"Why
gene editing is decade's most significant innovation\", Irish Times,

**[[gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark}** (like the other innovations) has
been in the works for a while, the last seven years have seen major
developments in our ability to specifically edit DNA in living cells. It
is not without controversy. Recent claims that human embryos in China
had been genetically edited and had resulted in twin babies prompted
widespread condemnation from scientists, as well as discussions about
safety and ethics and calls for effective regulation. But as a
[[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, the ability to alter a gene in a
living cell [[**offers** many]{.underline}]{.mark} potential
[**[benefits]{.mark}**, including treating]{.underline} inherited
[diseases, understanding what specific genes do]{.underline}, generating
more resilient crops and even detecting species in the environment.
\"The field is amazing,\" says Jane Farrar, a professor of genetics at
Trinity College Dublin. \"I have had some very late nights updating my
lecture slides for undergraduates, because so much in gene technology is
happening so quickly.\" Gene editing -- which directly changes the
"letters" of the genome -- is becoming more of a feature of gene
therapy, notes Farrar, but it is the new kid on the block. "The ability
to edit specific genes in living cells is relatively new," she says.
"That means many forms of gene therapy that have by now reached the
clinic or are under late-stage development don't use these new
gene-editing techniques. They deliver the gene into the cell, rather
than correcting or editing the DNA," she notes. Farrar was one of the
pioneers of gene therapy research in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s,
when the patient-led charity Fighting Blindness supported work to find
the genetic changes linked to inherited forms of vision loss. "The eye
is really an ideal place for gene therapy," she explains. "It is
accessible, it can tolerate the viruses used to deliver genes and you
have a natural control -- if you put the gene therapy in one eye you can
compare it to the other over time." Rare eye disease Farrar, Prof Pete
Humphries and colleagues identified gene changes involved in a rare eye
disease called retinitis pigmentosa, and developed a system to
\"rescue\" the gene function by suppressing the mutant gene and
delivering a new gene into the cell. The technology was acquired by
Spark Therapeutics in 2016. In 2017, the FDA in the USA approved a
different Spark therapy, Luxturna, which replaces the function of gene
changes associated with progressive sight loss. It was the first gene
therapy of its kind to be approved in the US. ["In general, [there's a
**huge amount of commercial interest** in new gene
therapies]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Farrar. "[Plenty more are in the
works]{.underline}, not just for inherited eye diseases but also [for
rare diseases that affect how cells break down cellular components to
recycle them, conditions that damage the mitochondria]{.underline}
\[which act as "batteries" in cells\] and spinal and central nervous
system disorders, [among others]{.underline}." She believes that [[gene
editing will become]{.mark} more [common in gene therapy
approaches]{.mark} in the coming years,]{.underline} particularly as we
work out how to do it safely and effectively. "With gene editing, there
is the potential risk of 'off-targets', where editing a target gene
could bring about unintentional changes in the genome or cell function,
so some researchers are looking for 'safe harbours' in DNA," she
explains. "These are stretches of DNA where in principle you could add
different genes targeting different disorders, while avoiding negative
off-target effects." The availability of gene editing in recent years
also means that scientists can now use it as a research tool to target
specific stretches of DNA relatively easily, according to Prof Breandan
Kennedy, a senior lecturer at University College Dublin. Probably the
best known gene-editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, which was made
commercially available in 2012. A little like having a sat-nav and a
scissors, CRISPR-Cas systems allows you target a specific sequence of
DNA "letters" in a living cell, then cut the sequence at that point.
'Very powerful' "By doing this, we can inactivate a specific gene, and
this gives us a lot of information about what that gene normally does,"
says Kennedy, whose work at UCD school of biomolecular and biomedical
science uses gene editing technology on microscopic worms, zebrafish and
human cells in the lab. "By inactivating specific genes, which we can do
much more quickly and easily now with CRISPR-Cas systems, our group has
been able to identify genes that are important for vision, for eye
development and for blood vessels in the eye to grow and work properly.
We are also using the approach to validate in the lab whether particular
DNA change in patients are involved in inherited eye disease. Ten years
ago if you said such a technology would be widespread, people would have
laughed, but now labs around the world can do this. It's very powerful."
Plant science, too, is reaping the rewards of being able to target
specific stretches of DNA in living cells. \"What is possible now is
what was impossible five years ago,\" says Dr Ewen Mullins, head of the
crop science department at Teagasc, Oak Park. "The holy grail for plant
breeding is to be able to control the activity of a single gene, or
several linked genes, and now gene editing allows us to do that," he
says. "And crucially, we are not necessarily adding a gene in from
another species. With CRISPR-Cas systems, we can edit the genes already
in the plant." This could help to make crop plants more resilient in the
face of droughts, fluctuating temperatures and agents of disease, notes
Mullins: "These are becoming issues for farmers in Ireland and other
parts of the world now, and in the face of climate change we need to
reduce those susceptibilities where we can into the future." Identifying
species Gene-editing technology can even help us to identify what
species are living in a particular environment, as Dr Anne
Parle-McDermott from Dublin City University is finding out. \"We are
looking at the different species of salmon that live in rivers and
aquaculture, but we are doing that by analysing the DNA they shed, also
known as environmental or e-DNA,\" she explains. \"We can take a sample
of water, then we add CRISPR to find unique stretches of DNA that tell
us about the species it came from. The associated Cas protein then cuts
a reporter DNA and we can detect that cutting activity, so we know that
stretch of DNA is present in the sample. It gives us a whole new way of
knowing what DNA is present in the environment.\" Dr Ciaran Seoighe,
deputy director general at Science Foundation Ireland, is impressed that
gene technology won the reader vote for the innovation of the decade.
\"CRISPR-Cas9 is a case of a discovery turned into an innovation,\" he
says. \"Decades ago, researchers were discovering that bacteria had this
system of being able to find and cut DNA in viruses and so stop them
attacking, and the innovation was to take that and use it to
specifically edit genes ourselves. It was a case of finding something
interesting and then doing something different with it. Now it provides
a tool for researchers to work on more personalised approaches to
medicine.\" Farrar is also impressed by the winning vote. "I think the
readers are very insightful," she says. "[[Gene tech]{.mark}nology [has
matured in the last decade]{.mark}, and [thanks to]{.mark} gene-editing
[tech]{.mark}nology [we can]{.mark} also now [get far more understanding
about disease. This is really a story of fundamental biology enabling a
new tech]{.mark}nology. [Without that]{.mark} curiosity, [we **might not
have**]{.mark}]{.underline} these exciting
**[[innovations]{.underline}]{.mark}** now."

#### The biotech industry solves for food shortages brought on by climate change via innovation

[Food Shortage Fears]{.underline} Frustratingly, **[[climate change
threatens to damage and lessen]{.underline}]{.mark}** the planet's
**[[food supply]{.mark} at a time when we need more food than
ever]{.underline}**. The worldwide [population continues to explode,
meaning]{.underline} that [[it's not just about]{.underline}]{.mark}
protecting [[the current supply]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[but also being
prepared to grow it substantially]{.underline}]{.mark}** to meet an
ever-greater global demand. The United Nations has declared that
**[[food production must double by 2050 in order to feed the burgeoning
population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one billion of whom are already
suffering from hunger. [[This is a concern that is raised again and
again]{.underline}]{.mark} among those working [[in
agrochemicals]{.underline}]{.mark}, who feel a great responsibility
**[[to see their industry meet this vital need]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Biotech to the Rescue "I'm a **[[big believer in biotech and the doors
that it can open]{.underline}]{.mark}**," says Madden, who was working
at Asgrow (a seed company owned by Monsanto) when the first
biotechnology products were introduced in the 1990s. "[[Humanity is
dependent on]{.mark} crop breeding in combination with
[biotech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[to keep up with climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}." [[Advances in
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[have made it possible
to]{.underline}]{.mark} genetically [[modify crops]{.underline}]{.mark}
with traits **[[that make them resistant to pests and
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This not only helps]{.underline}**
farmers [fight off problems that]{.underline} may [result from climate
change, but it also means that they contribute less to it
themselves]{.underline}. Why? [When farmers get better yields, they need
less land to grow on]{.underline} -- therefore **[[slowing deforestation
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that come with it. And **[[there is so
much more that biotech could do to actively fight climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a piece in The Berkeley Blog, author
David Zilberman suggests that one such innovation could be **[to make GM
soybean crops with improved digestibility, so that the cattle eating
them release fewer greenhouse gases]{.underline}**. Researchers are
working on biotechnology that could solve any number of problems related
to climate change, but it can be a long and arduous process of trial and
error, as they attempt to find effective solutions. GM [crops that are
resistant to drought,]{.underline} for example, would be a godsend for
farmers, but Madden explains that though "drought tolerance has been
worked on for quite a while, early gene products have been somewhat
disappointing to companies based on what is offered and achieved. "He
points out that regional differences in rainfall and soil type, as well
as climate shifts, can complicate matters.

#### Food price increases causes scarcity and war over the remaining food and land 

Ore **Koren, 16**, (Ore Koren, Ore Koren is a PhD candidate at the
University of Minnesota and a Jennings Randolph Fellow at the United
States Institute of Peace., 11-23-2016, Washington Post, Food scarcity

For a new U.S. administration facing global security challenges, [[the
relationship between food security]{.underline}]{.mark} --- what **[the
World Bank defines as "access to enough food for an active, healthy
life]{.underline}**" --- [[and armed conflict deserves serious
consideration]{.underline}]{.mark}. As new research shows, even an
abundance of food resources can cause conflict. [Recent studies theorize
that in Syria, where]{.underline} an estimated 250,000 to [400,000
people have died since 2011]{.underline}, [[the drought that preceded
the]{.underline}]{.mark} civil [[war played a significant role in
fueling]{.underline}]{.mark} political [[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Increases in food prices]{.mark}]{.underline}** caused by drought
**[[were]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[a factor in the 2011 Arab
Spring]{.underline}]{.mark}** uprisings **[in Tunisia, Jordan, Yemen and
Egypt]{.underline}**. The fact that [[prolonged food
shortages]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[lead to
drastic]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[violent **behavior** ]{.mark}**is
becoming increasingly evident**]{.underline}. The relationship between
food and war is both complex and multidimensional, though. [The links
between food scarcity and war]{.underline} Warmer countries are more
war-prone --- that's what researchers studying the relationships between
environmental factors and civil war argue. [[As global temperatures
increase]{.underline}]{.mark}, prolonged [[heat waves reduce crop
yields]{.underline}]{.mark}. The impact is **[[strongest in tropical
regions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which are more likely to experience the
harshest effects of global warming. **[[Lower crop yields
increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[competition for remaining
crops]{.underline}]{.mark}. And rising prices mean that many people
cannot afford to buy food to compensate for resources lost because of
climatic shifts. In countries that lack a social "safety net," [[the
only alternative]{.underline}]{.mark} in many cases **[[is to obtain
food through stealing, looting and]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- frequently
--- **[[fighting over fertile land.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Anecdotal
evidence from eastern Africa and the Middle East, at least, supports
this theory. Attempts to measure the linkages between climate change and
armed conflict, however, have yielded mixed results, with some studies
at least partly reaffirming these connections and others debunking them.
Some regions adapt to climate conditions better than others Studies of
the "Green Revolution" movement of the 1960s suggest that regions such
as Asia were far more successful than Africa at adopting
drought-resistant crops, which improved food security and helped offset
the risk of war. Similar efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle
East were weak and generally unsuccessful until the late 1980s. These
efforts met with limited success because of the types of grain available
and other socioeconomic complexities, which left these regions food
insecure. Had Syria successfully adopted drought-resistant crops, for
instance, the social unrest of 2011 might have taken a different,
less-violent course. As researchers continue to debate how climate
change and its effects on global food stocks will impact food security
in future decades, short-term environmental "shocks" such as droughts or
floods have become more frequent in many parts of the world and are a
potentially salient cause of armed conflict. These **[[environmental
disturbances]{.underline}]{.mark}** can **[[lead to sharp price
increases that]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in turn, can
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} another well-established tradition: [[the
food riot]{.underline}]{.mark}, [when civilians take to the streets to
protest high food prices. **[Low-income countries are particularly
susceptible]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[because high food
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}** in these situations **[[have an especially
destabilizing effect]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In these countries, high
food prices expose the government's lack of ability to shield consumers.
They also [create opportunities for civilians to mobilize]{.underline}
against the regime. **[[Even in locations where food is sourced
locally]{.underline}]{.mark}**, drought-induced **[[shocks may incite
violence against civilians]{.underline}]{.mark}** when rebel groups seek
to appropriate local food supplies. My research documents this happening
not only in the Syrian conflict but also in India and Thailand during a
2004 drought. [[Riots, protests and massacres are]{.underline}]{.mark}
among **[[the types of unrest that]{.underline}]{.mark}** can **[[lead
to civil war]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and **[[all can be linked to
food conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In 2017, [[the worldwide pharmaceutical market reached 1 trillion
Euro]{.underline}]{.mark}, an increase of 6.7 percent over 2016. This
market is expected to continue to growth at 4 percent CAGR and exceed
1.1 trillion euros by 2020. [Four main [growth drivers are]{.mark}
behind this evolution, which occurred in spite of bad and challenging
market conditions---growing health spending in emerging countries, drug
price increases in some key markets, [growing demand for]{.mark}
generics in a context of high patent expiries, and [innovative drugs and
new treatments]{.mark}, especially in the field of oncology, which
accounted for 27 percent of active global R&D pipelines in 2017, ahead
of neurology and virology]{.underline}. [**[For decades, pharmaceutical
companies have been bringing innovative drugs to market for the benefit
of the patients and the society]{.underline}**.]{.mark} However, this
process is not straightforward. The average time for a new drug to reach
the market is between eight and 12 years. On average, from 10,000
compounds at the discovery phase, only one is approved and reaches the
market. With more than 14 percent of its revenues allocated to R&D, the
pharmaceutical industry is a leading contender in terms of R&D spending.
From 2007 to 2016, the industry invested more than \$1.3 trillion in R&D
and forecasts predict an annual investment of \$204 billion by 2024,
with the U.S. leading the pack. This huge investment in R&D is necessary
for pharmaceutical companies to launch new drugs, to sustain growth and
profit. [[However, in recent years declining productivity has become a
concern for pharmaceutical companies]{.underline}]{.mark}. R&D returns
declined to 2 percent in 2018, down from 10 percent in 2010, with
figures showing a steady decline. Moreover, during the past decades, the
average drug development costs has been multiplied by more than 13, from
160 million euros in 1970 to 2.3 billion in 2010. **[[This evolution is
due to many factors, such as higher technical, regulatory and economic
constraints]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but also the search of innovative
drugs by companies facing competition. For many experts, this situation
raises questions on the capacity of the industry to innovate and to
create growth in the future. Furthermore, 160 drugs lost patents in
recent years, and this number is expected to reach more than 40 between
2017 and 2020. The new landscape opens the door to generic and
biosimilar drugs and creates more opportunity for more competition,
between existing players and new ones. New business models This
situation has a big impact on the big pharmaceutical blockbuster
business model, which is based on top selling drugs that generated over
1 billion USD in annual sales. Large pharmaceutical companies are
changing and adapting their capabilities by focusing on external growth,
more precisely mergers and acquisitions (M&A), to increase R&D
capabilities and boost portfolio with biotech companies as preferred
targets. In the past 10 years, merger and acquisition activities have
significantly increased, with a high in 2015 when the total value
reached more than 345 billion USD. 2019 started with the same strength,
a mega merger between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene of 95 billion USD
(including debt recovery)---an astronomical amount which confirms the
growing interest in biotech. Beyond M&A, partnerships with biotech
companies are also appealing to big pharmaceutical companies. We have
observed an increase in partnerships between biotech companies and
pharmaceutical companies as a way to feed their pipeline and minimize
risks and costs. For example, through a strategic partnership, Genentech
and AbbVie developed Venclexta, an oncology drug. It is jointly
commercialized by Genentech in the United States and commercialized by
AbbVie outside of the United States. Big pharmaceutical companies are
looking at biotech companies for many reasons. First, biotechnology
companies clearly dominate new drug pipelines. Secondly, they are
characterized by a very specific know-how and high value-added research
involving patented technologies. They participate strongly in
therapeutic innovation and are structures of interest for large
pharmaceutical companies. Finally, biotech companies can bring more
efficiency and responsiveness through licensing agreements to
pharmaceutical companies. Put all together, biotech startups can help
pharmaceutical companies to strengthen and revitalize portfolios in a
challenging landscape where innovation is key. At the same time large
companies bring financial support and expertise to put drugs on the
market through enhancement of clinical development, market access and
regulatory affairs. This strategic shift by large pharmaceutical
companies toward biotech through M&A and partnering is bearing fruit.
During the past 10 years, the number of new molecular entities has
increased steadily. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had
approved 84 (vs 94 in 2017) new drugs with 42 (vs 35 in 2017) of these
being new active substances. At the same time, the U S Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) had approved 59 novel drugs and biologics in 2018
(vs 46 in 2017). Moreover, biotechnology drugs are contributing to sales
at a large scale. For EvaluatePharma, these products will represent 31
percent of the market in 2024 in comparison to 25 percent in 2017. This
heavy role played by biotech companies is more visible when the top 100
products sales are put in the spotlight; biotech drugs are predicted to
account for 52 percent of sales in 2024 (vs 49 percent in 2017). Based
on this forecast, the dependency of the industry on biotech is clear. In
this landscape, Roche has a leading position build through continued
investment, the acquisition of Genentech, a biotechnology pioneer, in
2009 for \$46.8 billion or Ignyta, a biotech in oncology, for \$ 1.7
billion in 2017 in order to foster the company's position in oncology. A
new strategic roadmap [[Biotech]{.mark}nology [companies can be a
strategic pillar to help pharmaceutical giants redesign
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the past decades, many groups have
been defining a new strategic roadmap from diversification strategy to
focus on core areas. In the case of Sanofi, the company is remaining on
a diversification strategy, but started since 2016 restructuring a plan
and discarded non-strategic activities. Sanofi sold its animal health
business (Merial) and withdrew from some of its generic business by
selling its subsidiary Zentiva, which manufactures generic drugs for the
European market. In order to position itself on the strategic areas of
oncology, immunology and multiple sclerosis, Sanofi have been using
external growth strategy. Between 2017 and 2018, Sanofi bought three
biotechnology companies, which allow it to reinforce its presence in the
specialty medicine landscape. The first was Protein Sciences in 2017 for
\$750 million, through the acquisition of the biotech, Sanofi Pasteur,
the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi. This adds a promising
product, based on recombinant proteins, to its influenza vaccine
portfolio. The second acquisition is Ablynx, a Belgian biotech company
for \$4.8 billion. Ablynx is engaged in the development of nanobodies,
proprietary therapeutic proteins based on single-domain antibody
fragments, which combine the advantages of conventional antibody drugs
with some of the features of small-molecule drugs. Ablynx has more than
45 proprietary and partnered programs in development in various
therapeutic areas, including inflammation, hematology, immuno-oncology,
oncology and respiratory disease. Finally, Sanofi purchased Bioverativ
for \$11.6 billion, a U.S. biotech company focusing on therapies for
hemophilia and other rare blood disorders. This acquisition should have
two upsides or benefits---it helps Sanofi build a leading hemophilia
portfolio and strengthens Sanofi's portfolio in specialty care. [[The
decline in R&D productivity, the increase in costs of drugs, the tough
competition between existing and new players, and expertise of biotech
companies has created an undeniable and undisputable incentive for a
marriage between big pharma and biotech companies]{.mark}. Even if, the
path to success is not guaranteed, [the opportunity need to be taken for
a brighter and exciting future for patients, large pharma players and in
the end, creation of shareholder value]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, because [[genetic engineering of humans has a place in the
biotech industry, the infuence of leading scientists must still vie with
the influence of business. Companies built on the very foundation of
genome editing tools are being funded]{.mark}]{.underline} 22 Royal Road
[[by wealthy investors and intrinsically propelled by eager
scientists]{.mark}]{.underline} who wish to expand the horizons of
genetic engineering[. [In]{.mark}]{.underline} April [[2015, the market
for biotechnology companies utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system within the
human health sector was estimated to be \$46
billion]{.mark}]{.underline} (van Erp et al. 88). The main interests of
these markets include "gene-therapy, cell-therapy, immunotherapy, fast
and efcient development of transgenic research animals, drug discovery,
as well as target validation and screening" (88). At least 14 diferent
companies have been identified in furthering these interests---not
including the accessory companies like Twist Bioscience that actually
synthesize DNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 targeting. Many of these
companies have predicted the advancements of genetic engineering in
human cells and have been accruing capital since before human
applications of CRISPR/Cas9 have even been published. Similar to how
business has dominated the pharmaceutical industry, its influence is
closing in on the newly established market of genetic engineering. [[The
looming threat of business's influence on genetic engineering industries
presents further complexity for the establishment regulation. Since the
biotech industry is in its infancy, critically relevant healthcare and
business policies have not yet been set.]{.underline}]{.mark} For
example, in terms of novel drug discovery, the pharmaceutical industry
requires rigorous conditions to be met before drug approval (Eisenberg
477-491). Furthermore, high demands for new therapies have resulted in
noncompliance to existing standards. In his book, Corporate Crime in the
Pharmaceutical Industry, John Braithwaite---an expert on business
regulation and a distinguished professor at Australian National
University---writes about issues such as these. Braithwaite states, "The
pharmaceutical industry has a worse record of international bribery and
corruption than any other industry, a history of fraud in the safety
testing of drugs, and a disturbing record of criminal negligence in the
unsafe manufacture of drugs" (5-6). Criminal behavior in an industry
responsible for the health of human beings is reprehensible. The
pharmaceutical industry parallels genetic engineering of human beings in
how they both affect human health. Since health concerns cannot deter
criminal behavior in the pharmaceutical industry, it is possible a
similar trend will be observed in the human health sector of the biotech
industry. Moreover, [[infringement of business]{.underline}]{.mark} may
not always be illegal even if it [[is inherently
wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recall when Mylan, the manufacturer of the
EpiPen---a treatment necessary to save lives---risked many lives in
raising the price of the emergency treatment to \$600 in order to
maximize proft during a lag in FDA approval for alternative, generic
forms (\"O\'Toole Calls on FDA to Approve Generic EpiPens to Combat
Mylan\'s Monopoly on Market\"). Dr. James Baker, the CEO and chief
medical ofcer of the advocacy group Food Allergy and Research Education,
reluctantly reports, "Is Mylan doing anything illegal? No, it\'s taking
advantage of all these things to take the market and basically push it
to an extreme" (qtd. in Lupkin). Problems like these mirror future
expectations for the market of genetic engineering. Once businesses have
leverage in a particular market, it is their goal to maximize proft,
even if it is at the expense of others' lives. An economist from Indiana
University and Ameritech Chair of Economic Development, David B.
Audretsch, suggests: To generate a successful regional cluster, the
existence of world class scientific talent is a necessary condition.
However, it is not a sufficient condition. The ancillary or
complementary factors must also be available to translate this knowledge
into a commercialized product[[. The complementary factors include the
presence of venture capital and other forms of finance, the existence of
an entrepreneurial culture, and transparent and minimal regulations
fostering the start-up and growth processes.]{.underline}]{.mark} (3)
Since science sparked the market of genetic engineering, businesses now
have the capacity to continue without the impediment of harsh, legal
restrictions. Also, since gene-editing technology is democratizing the
practice of genetic engineering, it will only require a degree of
training for basic procedures to be accomplished. [[In conclusion, the
open market or "laissez faire"]{.underline}]{.mark} 24 Royal Road
[[approach to business in America conflicts with any progress made to
reduce democratization of CRISPR.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Given the broad scope and scale of this growing threat, **[the United
States should take a series of actions to mitigate the
risks]{.underline}**, without unduly stunting the growth of the
biotechnology field. [To date, bioterrorist attacks have been low-risk,
high-impact events]{.underline}. **[While they have been extremely rare,
their frequency will only increase as will their
ramifications]{.underline}**. However, **[[overregulating the spread of
biotechnological tools could stunt innovation and the profound potential
of this increasingly important]{.mark} sector]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, [existing methods of preventing bioterrorism may no longer
be effective]{.underline}. [The government could previously monitor the
purchase of expensive and dangerous biotechnology tools and the
laboratories that owned them in large quantities. **This is no longer
possible**]{.underline} to the same degree when such tools are
increasingly cheap, widespread, and usable in a garage. The FBI is
currently attempting to address this risk by building relationships with
the iGEM community and with life scientists so that they can report
suspicious behavior. These [efforts]{.underline} should continue, but
[are wildly insufficient]{.underline}, since some bioterrorists may have
minimal contact with the larger community of biologists and biology
hobbyists. The [release of a bioweapon by a terrorist]{.underline}, if
left unchecked, **[could spread throughout the globe]{.underline}**,
[just as a naturally occurring pandemic would]{.underline}. Thus, one
major step that the United States should take is to establish improved
responses to disease outbreaks, particularly learning from COVID-19.
This should include building a larger stockpile of PPE and establishing
a set of clear step-by-step actions to be taken in the event of an
attack. Building resilience in this fashion will not prevent
bioterrorism, but it will mitigate its effects, and may slightly
disincentivize utilizing bioweapons to cause terror. Beyond this, [the
United States should secure its laboratories and the data
within,]{.underline} as terrorists could leverage that knowledge to
build bioweapons. For example, **[new technology allows pathogens to be
synthesized from the data describing their genetic
sequences]{.underline}**. In a recent controversial study, scientists
published a methodology that would allow horsepox virus, a virus very
similar to one that causes smallpox, to be synthesized. This [research
was conducted with a noble]{.underline} [goal]{.underline}:
[understanding]{.underline} how [the horsepox virus]{.underline} could
be used as a potential treatment for cancer. **[However, it had
significant dual-use implications]{.underline}**. [[Research like this
should not be banned outright]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates should establish norms to
evaluate whether it is worth the risk before such research is conducted,
and then ensure that it is conducted and the results published in the
most secure ways. Replicability is an important part of science, but the
general public should not be able to replicate the most dangerous
experiments. Where building resilience would reduce the impact of a
bioterror incident, restricting access to dual-use methodologies will
reduce the likelihood of one occurring in the first place. Finally,
enforcing domestic standards is not enough. Pathogens spread across
borders, and the spillover effects of even a targeted bioterrorist
attack could kill many unintended victims. Thus, the United States must
work with other countries to protect against the bioterrorist threat,
monitor the emergence of new viruses and bacteria that could be
leveraged for a bioweapon, limit access to the most dangerous pathogens
(and data associated with those), and build global response networks in
the event of an attack. Importantly, this collaboration should emphasize
working with allies, but should also include adversaries: if China or
Russia remain unregulated, an attack within their borders would still
affect the United States and its allies. **[[Emerging biotechnology will
result in new medicines and medical techniques]{.mark}, a greater
understanding of how pathogens function and spread (and thus a better
understanding of how to combat them), [a healthier populace, innovative
new capabilities that could transform daily life, and greater engagement
with the biological sciences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While ensuring that
these benefits are maintained, the United States and its allies and
partners must take logical steps to protect themselves from the
worst-case scenarios. The risk of bioterrorism is growing, and the
United States must be prepared to face the future.

#### Big pharma and biotech partnerships are necessary to maintain innovation in drugs and medicine

[[Strategic partnerships have long been an important contributor to how
drugs are discovered]{.underline}]{.mark}. For decades, [[big pharma
companies have been forming alliances with smaller biotech innovators
**to increase R&D productivity**. From the biotech's perspective pharma
expands the geographical reach of a drug and aids in better managing
late-stage development and commercialization costs]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Greg Wiederrecht, Ph.D., Managing Director in the Global Healthcare
Investment Banking Group at RBC Capital Markets, is no stranger to the
importance of these deals. Before moving to the banking world in 2015,
Wiederrecht was the Vice President and Head of External Scientific
Affairs (ESA) at Merck, where his group of 85 physicians and scientists
was responsible for the identification and scientific assessment of all
licensing, collaboration, partnership, and acquisition opportunities for
Merck worldwide. Wiederrecht's experience gives him a unique perspective
on why partnerships are vital for both biotech and big pharma companies.
A question of scale "It's impossible for large pharma companies to work
in every single sub-therapeutic area out there," explains Wiederrecht.
"In today\'s markets, the vast majority of approved drugs are associated
with some type of licensing partnership or acquisition component. Even
the largest companies can only work on so many targets at once, whereas
there are hundreds of thousands of researchers in academia and biotechs
out there who can specialize in vastly more diseases and afflictions. If
one of them makes a discovery that satisfies an unmet medical need, then
large pharma can form some type of strategic partnership or
collaboration to provide a jump start on their competitors." The path to
innovation So, what exactly does a strategic partnership entail?
According to Wiederrecht, partnerships can take many forms. "It can be
something as minor as a feasibility study on a potential partner\'s
asset, or something more significant like a research collaboration,
patent license, development commercialization agreement, or even an
acquisition. In fact, many acquisitions begin with a collaboration that
went so well the pharma wants to acquire the entire biotech. We\'ve
certainly seen some examples of that recently." Evaluating potential
Clearly, **[[big pharma is dependent on collaborative
alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But from a biotech perspective, when
is a strategic partnership the best path forward? "[[Strategic
partnerships can be essential]{.mark} to a biotech for several reasons.
A biotech may have a patent position on a novel target. However, it may
not have the volume of chemists and preclinical development experts that
a big pharma can muster to get through what we call the 'zone of chaos'
in drug development, which largely involves solving toxicity issues that
can lead to unwanted surprises in clinical development]{.underline}."
[["Also, if a biotech is working on a project in a large-scale
indication that afflicts hundreds of thousands of people, the clinical
trial costs may be too much for them to endure", continues Wiederrecht.
"Commercialization -- particularly for those larger indications -- is
something big pharma excels in. They have established infrastructures in
most countries around the world to sell the
product."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### It is imperative to maintain the symbiotic relationship of biotech and pharma

Robin **Robinson**, 1-1-20**20**, "Small Pharma Driving Big Pharma
Innovation", PharmaVoice,
https://www.pharmavoice.com/news/2020-01-pharma-innovation/612330/,
7-3-2022, //ms

[["The future R&D model will leverage the synergy that develops between
those small companies, the grassroots innovators, and]{.mark} the
remaining [big pharma companies]{.mark},]{.underline}" Mr. Munos, who is
also a fellow at FasterCures, a Center of the Milken Institute, says.
"There will still be challenges that will require scale to be overcome[.
[Small entrepreneurial companies can do quite a lot, but they won't be
able to completely replace the capabilities of their big pharma
counterparts."]{.mark}]{.underline} Mr. Davé predicts that small,
innovative companies will continue to "do what they do best" in terms of
science and be funded by large capital coming from the large pharma. Not
only do big pharma companies have deep pockets but they also have the
salesforces and the marketing muscle to get new drugs out to the masses.
"[It's a very nice dynamic for the future and I see this model
continuing to grow and get stronger and stronger]{.underline}," he says.
[[Large pharma companies will never lose the marketing and sales muscle
they have to drive the product to the marketplace, and that works well
for the small biotech companies. "**The relationship that we have now is
very symbiotic and it's advantageous when everyone continues to work in
their own individual ecosystems**]{.underline},]{.mark}" Mr. Davé says.
He provides a real-life example of how this new symbiotic relationship
and the ecosystem works. In the rare disease space, a small biotech
company was developing a biologic that would treat only 700 people
worldwide. The science was solid but getting funding was a struggle.
"There weren't a lot of people lining up to support a product that was
going to have only 700 customers in the world," Mr. Davé says. "And the
price tag for development is the same whether developing a rare disease
drug or a traditional hypertensive drug." Enter a large pharma partner
operating in the oncology space. The pharma company was interested
because the rare disease being addressed was a precursor to cancer, and
the large pharma company saw funding the innovation as an opportunity.
With that funding relationship came access to the biotech's voucher that
can be used to accelerate the timeline of any drug in the pipeline,
which would prove very valuable to the large pharma partner. Mr. Davé
says the infusion of money from the large pharma company allowed the
small biotech to produce a solution for 700 patients in the world and
keep the price tag of the drug to a respectable level where it is still
affordable and able to be reimbursed. Over time, [[the]{.mark} budding
[relationships between large and small pharma]{.mark} may [evolve
to]{.mark} the point of a new business and R&D model across the entire
industry. "We have started to witness a shift in the balance of power
over the past decade, **with [a burst of innovation]{.mark}** from the
early-stage and emerging biotech companies]{.underline}," says Naheed
Kurji, CEO, Cyclica. "As the market landscape for drug discovery
evolves, early-stage biotechs are increasingly entering the spotlight
with a combination of subject-matter expertise in the science and the
benefits of a lean organization conducive to rapid innovation." "The
industry has become more open-minded about its business model, and more
companies are getting bolder and starting to implement new ways of doing
business," Mr. Munos says. "The pharmaceutical industry used to be built
on proprietary knowledge, tools, science, and data. This has changed."
**[[Innovation is now being energized by countless "mad
scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}**," as Mr. Munos calls them, who work
out of academia, incubators, or virtual companies. "They add up to a
giant grassroots innovation movement that operates on a shoestring," he
says. "Together, they explore emerging biology, and are quick to embark
on translation when they spot an opportunity. It used to be that a
biotech startup would need \$50 million to get going because it had to
recreate all the functions of a big company --- HR, legal, and
everything else. Today, companies don't need this type of
infrastructure. They can turn to crowdsourcing platforms, like
scientist.com, for example. So, if you're a chemist you focus on
chemistry and procure everything else from the crowdsourcing platform
when you need it. This flexibility has changed the dynamics of
innovation. Startups now have the opportunity to grow without adding
scale. This is a pretty valuable feature." Crowdsourcing a Startup "The
crowdsourcing model is remarkable because it used to be that if someone
wanted to start up a company, he or she needed to excel in everything,
because the expertise was needed inside the company; procuring resources
wasn't very easy and the market was not transparent or efficient," Mr.
Munos says. "Today, if a company wants somebody to design a trial, clone
a peptide, do a toxicology study, or synthesize one gram of a molecule,
it can be easily resourced. All someone has to do is send an email to a
crowd-sourcing platform and say, 'Hey, I need that. Can you help?'"
There are several factors that have inspired and validated this model,
effectively changing the pipeline in which medicines are brought to
market. First, the patent cliff, as well as a significant decrease in
new R&D returns, and the lack of discovery of more blockbuster drugs, to
name a few. All of these factors led to big pharma looking toward
smaller biopharma companies to develop innovations that it could not.
"Early-stage biotech companies are seizing the opportunity to grab their
share of the market, with recent data from IQVIA suggesting that
emerging biotech companies now account for more than 70% of the total
R&D pipeline, up from 52% in 2003," Mr. Kurji says. "Emerging and
innovative biotechs will continue to decentralize the drug discovery
pipeline and develop breakthrough treatments that offer greater benefits
beyond incremental improvements and reshape the way medicines are
discovered and brought to market." Funding Gets Easier [[This emerging
paradigm makes it easier for small or emerging companies to get funding,
whereas before it was one of their biggest hurdles.]{.mark}]{.underline}
When small biotechnology companies had to rely on venture capital only,
funding was difficult. If the VC-driven environment lost confidence in
the biotechnology space or if fund managers lost confidence in certain
medical innovations then the money stopped flowing in. "Now, there is
another player that has come to the table and that is large pharma,
which has very deep pockets," Mr. Davé says. "So, when a VC will not
fund an innovative company or innovative product, these companies have
at least another suitor that can fill that gap --- big pharma."
According to Mr. Kurji, large pharmaceutical companies are definitely
supporting the creation, early-seed financing, and later-stage
investment in biotech companies through their venture arms, but he also
sees the venture capital ecosystem warming up to small pharma. "There
has been considerable interest in the small pharma and biotech industry,
which has certainly captured the attention of VCs," he says. "StartUp
Health in its Q3 insights reports that there has been a considerable
increase in both the funding amount and deal counts in the healthcare
and pharma space. In 2010, there was \$1.1 billion with 152 deal counts,
which is in stark comparison to the \$10.4 billion and 556 deals by Q3
of 2019, with the largest amount of funding focused on earlier stage
healthcare companies." Not only has there been an increase in the number
of deals and funding, there has also been an increase in the pool of
investors supporting smaller biotechs and healthcare companies, with
1,061 unique investors participating in the industry, compared with 299
in 2012. A large proportion of these investors are based in the United
States, and most venture investments are focused around companies in
Silicon Valley and Boston. There also has been recent growth in the
Asian markets, particularly in China. ["As the market evolves, we will
see a greater decentralization of resources as big pharma, non-profit
organizations, and venture capital firms seek further innovation
opportunities," Mr. Kurji says.]{.underline} Pharma Spinoffs Spur
Innovation [In addition to funding innovation from outside sources,
sometimes large pharmaceutical companies create their own spinoffs to
discover and develop innovative products as an independent arm of the
larger business.]{.underline} This model may operate differently from an
independent startup, but there are many advantages over the cumbersome
R&D model of big pharma. "There are a number of pharma spinoffs that
have emerged over the past decade," Mr. Kurji says. "These spinoff
companies typically take programs that have been discontinued or slowed
down within the larger pharma company's operations, and progress those
programs independently with the appropriate rights and licenses. Cerevel
is a great example, which spun out of Pfizer and is funded by Bain
Capital. Cerevel is pursuing neurodegenerative disease, a therapeutic
area that Pfizer recently divested its internal efforts." According to a
company release, Pfizer is contributing a portfolio of precommercial
neuroscience assets to Cerevel, which includes three clinical-stage
compounds and several preclinical compounds designed to target a broad
range of CNS disorders, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, epilepsy,
schizophrenia, and addiction. Funds affiliated with Bain Capital Private
Equity and Bain Capital Life Sciences have committed \$350 million with
the ability to provide additional capital should it be needed in the
future. Bain Capital and Pfizer will support Cerevel in building a
dedicated team of CNS scientists and life-sciences executives with
extensive experience in clinical development of potential therapies for
patients who have neurological and neuropsychological diseases.
"Unquestionably, pharma spinoffs operate differently from independent
startups in two critical ways," Mr. Kurji adds. "One, from the ideation
of a pharma spinoff, there is a clear objective and strategy, and a
visibility back to the pharma company, and two, the venture arms of a
big pharma company are key as they financially support the ideation and
creation of new companies that are strategically aligned to the pharma
company's mandates." While the hurdles that independent startups face
are much higher than those of pharma spinoffs, there are advantages to
being independent, he says. "An independent startup has more freedom to
operate and try new things and pivot along the journey," Mr. Kurji says.
Mr. Davé says the incubator concept within large pharma started gaining
ground about three years ago. ["[Large pharma companies started to
create their own incubators and attract talent to those
incubators]{.mark}," he says. "I've seen many cases where top scientists
from the academic space have shifted over to large pharma incubators
where they're still doing the same thing but the opportunities to
advance their science and technology are better, because of the
infrastructure that a large pharma company can provide." **[Many large
pharma companies have started to move in this
direction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, realizing that it was a way to thrive
and prepare for the transformation that is taking place in the industry.
"I'd say half of the top 12 pharma companies have a pretty good
understanding of what's going on," Mr. Munos says. "They started long
ago to prepare themselves for the transformation that is taking place.
For instance, I remember when I first met Dr. Stoffels 10 years ago he
would tell anyone who cared to listen that the model was broken and
needed changing." Not surprisingly, years later, Dr. Stoffels was
instrumental in developing JLABS at J&J, which now comprises 12 pharma
incubators which are mentored but not funded by J&J, according to Mr.
Munos. "This allows JLABS to explore emerging biology in 400 directions,
something that could never be done within the company because it would
raise its risk profile to unacceptable levels," he says. "But the
purpose is to unleash innovation and it is working great guns." Mr.
Munos also notes that Novartis, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Takeda, Boehringer
Ingelheim, and Merck KGaA have retooled themselves in ways that have
re-energized innovation. The round up in his own words: "Novartis has
gone through various iterations or versions of its innovation model.
This was one of the first companies to return to scientists the freedom
to innovate and the company has become one of the most prolific
innovators, with 20 drugs approved in the last 10 years. AstraZeneca had
a difficult transition, but its new drug output is rejoining the company
to the leading innovators. Interestingly the mid-size companies such as
Bayer, Takeda, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck KGaA, seemed to have felt the
heat a little sooner than their larger peers. But they all came to the
realization that they needed to act in order to thrive in the new
environment and they came up with new innovation models that have been
remarkable. Takeda is a prime example of what we're discussing because
it used to be a rather staid company. Likewise, Boehringer Ingelheim
came up with its own approach after realizing that much of the
high-value innovation comes from outside. So it created a
"research-beyond-borders" model that aims at harnessing new innovation
ripples before they become waves. And its leadership has been pretty
savvy at doing this. And Merck KGaA has taken multiple initiatives to
basically implement open source R&D within its corporate structure. "All
this is taking place as we speak and it is changing the dynamics of
research by boosting new drug approvals while harnessing the shoestring
economics of startups," Mr. Munos continues. "Basically, this is opening
pathways to overcome the pricing and affordability challenges that
companies have been facing. It is putting the industry back on a
sustainable course." "When large pharma companies started to turn their
attention to smaller biotech and emerging companies, innovation finally
had a stage and an opportunity to be accelerated," Mr. Davé says. "While
we're not producing \$1 billion drugs, we are producing many more drugs
that are providing solutions to a wider range of patients who were
ignored or unattended to from a therapeutic perspective. Large pharma's
shift in focus away from billion-dollar drugs to more innovative drugs
has proved beneficial to patients." With more companies and people
engaging in innovation, there will be more ideas, more hypotheses, and
more drug candidates that make it to the clinic. Scientific
breakthroughs are quickly followed by the creation of multiple
well-funded startup companies to exploit the new opportunities. "This
wasn't the case 10 years ago, but now it's become routine," Mr. Munos
says. "The reality is that if innovation is getting cheaper, we're going
to see more of it, and that's exactly what is happening." Mr. Munos adds
**[[this as a "very exciting time" in the industry and there are many
reasons to be optimistic about the future of the pharmaceutical
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He anticipates that entrepreneur
scientists and small companies will have a much easier route to
achieving their goals than they have in the past. "There will be a lot
of turbulence in the near term, but in another five to 10 years or so,
the industry will be on much better footing," Mr. Munos says.(PV)

#### CRISPR goes beyond germline\-\--but banning it stops innovation

Since 2012, CRISPR has become the genome-editing platform of choice for
life scientists around the world, largely due to its simplicity,
efficiency, and low cost. Often described as "molecular scissors,"
CRISPR systems typically have two fundamental components: a strand of
guide RNA (gRNA) and a CRISPR-associated endonuclease (e.g., Cas9).
Together, they form a search-and-snip complex in which the gRNA takes on
a hairpin shape. While one end of that hairpin dangles free to interact
with nearby DNA, the other lugs along its endonuclease counterpart. As
the complex encounters DNA, it bumps into short sequences (protospacer
adjacent motifs), using them as footholds to quickly unzip the double
helix and check for a gRNA-DNA match. Upon finding one, the complex
undergoes a conformational change that causes its Cas9 component to cut
the target DNA. (Put differently, gRNA searches and Cas9 snips.)
Otherwise, the complex lets go and continues to hunt. CRISPR's
search-and-snip functionality is especially useful in the presence of
natural repair enzymes that lurk near DNA, looking for and patching up
breaks. By delivering beneficial DNA fragments to the vicinity of
sequences that are targeted and cut, scientists can leverage those
repair enzymes to rewrite the genome. In light of this capacity to
rapidly create specific mutations, [[CRISPR has been hailed as "an
unprecedented tool" for identifying the genetic basis of disease and
reprogramming cellular
behavior.]{.underline}]{.mark}[[2](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#2)
[CRISPR's beauty lies also in its versatility, which does not stop with
genome editing]{.mark}. Researchers have developed alternative, "broken
scissors" techniques that focus on delivering molecular cargo rather
than cutting. That cargo might serve a simple role, like latching onto a
gene and blocking transcription, or it might do more, like inducing gene
expression in response to external stimuli (e.g., light or chemicals).
CRISPR can also be used to target RNA (which is continuously produced
from DNA), greatly reducing any risk of permanent mistakes.]{.underline}
From what we have seen so far, **[[CRISPR has stunning potential to
change the future of medicine]{.underline}]{.mark}**---some even
speculate that "in the not-too-distant future it will cure genetic
disease."[3](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#3)
Still, hurdles remain. For example, scientists have voiced concerns
about possible problems with
immunogenicity,[4](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#4)
unintended
mutations,[5](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#5)
and genetic variation across
patients.[6](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#6)
As those concerns are addressed, enthusiasm has mounted over preclinical
studies (i.e., studies conducted in animals), which suggest that CRISPR
may be used to cure muscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease,
hemophilia, and many other genetic diseases, as well as to eliminate
antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses (e.g., HIV and PERV, the
latter of which has long frustrated developments in
xenotransplantation). Given those promising results, researchers around
the globe are cautiously pressing ahead and have at least 20 clinical
trials in the
works.[7](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#7)
[[Enthusiasm for CRISPR has also gained steam in other
industries]{.underline}]{.mark}. In agriculture, for example, hopes are
high that CRISPR will pave the way to hardier livestock and crops (e.g.,
tuberculosis-resistant cows and canker-resistant oranges). In fact, you
might have already seen CRISPR'd, browning-resistant mushrooms at your
local
grocery.[8](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#8)
CRISPR has also begun to make its mark on industrial biotechnology. For
instance, one company recently began using CRISPR to make hydrogen
peroxide for a new line of cleaning wipes, praising the technique as not
just environmentally friendly, but also "cheaper and more efficient"
than chemical
syntheses.[9](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#9)
Others have made strides toward modifying small organisms such as algae
and E. coli into tiny biofuel factories. This broad range of
applications sets the stage for wide-ranging and rapid advancements over
the coming decades. In fact, recent estimates peg the revenue potential
from CRISPR/Cas9 tools at \$25--\$30 billion by
2030.[10](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#10)
The IP Landscape Despite its promise, CRISPR remains hampered by a
complex, uncertain IP landscape. In the United States, two key players
are locked in an epic battle over how to divvy up foundational patent
rights (i.e., those not focused on a specific gene or use), and there
may be more to come. Meanwhile, storm clouds are gathering overseas,
with foreign patent offices signaling that they may go in different
directions. To further complicate domestic matters, some commentators
have begun to call for government intervention in licensing. And while
early discussion of patent pools brings hope, their viability is another
open question. Finally, the FDA may be gearing up for announcements on
how it will regulate CRISPR innovations in human therapeutics. Though
true clarity in the CRISPR patent landscape is years away, important
developments are on the horizon in 2018. CRISPR Battle Lines Life
sciences patent attorneys might remember 2017 as the year they finally
took notice of CRISPR. At the center of their attention was the US
Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO's) Patent Trial and Appeal Board
(PTAB), which in February 2017 surprised many by terminating a closely
watched patent
interference[11](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#11)
between the University of California (UC, with collaborators University
of Vienna and Emmanuelle
Charpentier[12](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#12))
and the Broad Institute (Broad, with collaborators Harvard and MIT).
Central to that dispute, which the USPTO initiated at UC's request, is
the question of which team first invented the claimed applications of
CRISPR/Cas9 systems in eukaryotic environments (e.g., human cells). For
example, UC argues that its application describes CRISPR/Cas9 systems
and how they can be used for gene editing in any
environment.[13](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#13)
Broad counters that, among other things, a person of ordinary skill in
the art would have had no reasonable expectation that such systems could
be successfully applied to eukaryotic cells, as claimed in its own
application and
patents.[14](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#14)
Ultimately, the PTAB was persuaded by Broad's arguments and found that
neither party's claims, if considered to be prior art, would have
rendered the opposing claims anticipated or
obvious,[15](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#15)
meaning there was no "interference in fact," a threshold requirement
rooted in 37 C.F.R. § 41.203(a). The PTAB therefore terminated the
proceeding. That the PTAB did not cancel or finally refuse any claims,
however, has not stopped some commentators from speculating that the
patent landscape will ultimately play out with UC and Broad owning
CRISPR rights in prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
respectively.[16](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#16)
The countervailing view, set out in layperson's terms by one of UC's
named inventors, boils down to this: "the Broad Institute's patent is
for green tennis balls but the patent \[UC\] will have is for all tennis
balls."[17](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#17)
In any event, UC appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit,[18](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#18)
which will likely hear oral arguments in April or May of 2018. As the
UC-Broad interference winds down, CRISPR watchers should not lose sight
of the USPTO, where more challenges may wait in the wings. For example,
at least one ex parte reexamination against a foundational patent owned
by Broad has already been granted (and suspended until the interference
concludes). There is also a looming threat of additional interferences,
as mentioned in recent USPTO
communications[19](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#19)
and acknowledged in the pre-IPO disclosures of all three CRISPR-centric
biotechnology companies publicly traded in the United States (i.e.,
CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Editas Medicine Inc., and Intellia Therapeutics
Inc.). Potential dark horses identified in those filings include: (1)
Rockefeller University, a joint applicant on certain Broad applications;
(2) ToolGen Inc., whose suggestions of interference against Broad are
still pending; and (3) Vilnius University, which has its own US patent
for use of CRISPR/Cas9 systems and is party to a cross-licensing
agreement with one of UC's licensees. Other entities may also come out
of the woodwork with freedom-to-operate strategies that challenge key
patents via inter partes review or post-grant review. Additional CRISPR
disputes will happen overseas in 2018---and if patent grants are any
indicator, foreign agencies might not simply follow the USPTO's lead.
The European Patent Office's (EPO's) Opposition Division (OD) will kick
things off on January 16, when it hears oral arguments in oppositions
lodged against a foundational patent owned by Broad. Among other things,
challengers have attacked the purported novelty of Broad's claims, a
determination that may hinge on whether Broad validly claimed priority
to two of its early applications. If it did not, at least seven of
Broad's other opposed patents may be vulnerable too. The OD has already
issued a preliminary opinion indicating that it expects the oppositions
to
succeed.[20](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#20)
While that opinion is nonbinding, European analysts have stressed that
it is usually "very difficult" to sway the OD from its preliminary
views.[21](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#21)
In any event, Broad will not be the only foundational patent holder
fighting to keep its rights alive across the pond in 2018, as the EPO
has also granted noteworthy patent rights to UC, Sigma-Aldrich, and
Cellectis, thus opening nine-month windows for would-be challengers to
file post-grant oppositions. The fight over UC's patent, which
controversially covers use of CRISPR in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
may be especially heated. It has already withstood over a half dozen
third-party observations (including some filed by
Broad),[22](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#22)
and at least two groups have now filed post-grant
oppositions.[23](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#23)
China, home to the world's second-busiest CRISPR patent landscape (after
the United States), may host similar turf wars in 2018. UC and Broad,
among many others, are already on the scene and may be drawing up battle
plans. While Broad's applications remain pending, China's State
Intellectual Property Office announced in June its intention to grant UC
a patent covering CRISPR/Cas9 methods and compositions for applications
in any environment. One of UC's key licensees in human therapeutics
praised the decision as "further global recognition that \[UC and its
collaborators\] are the pioneers in the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in
all cell
types."[24](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#24)
Not missing a beat, Broad issued an ominous reminder that "\[i\]n China,
patents are subject to invalidation proceedings after they are
issued."[25](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#25)
Agency Invasion [[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark} tangles in the United
States have already sparked calls for government intervention per the
Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. This law generally allows recipients of federal
funds to license the fruits of their labor, [[providing
commercialization opportunities that **fuel
innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark} and public access to technologies made
possible by taxpayer dollars. A more controversial aspect of Bayh-Dole,
however, provides federal agencies with "march-in rights." Under
specific circumstances, those rights---which have never been
exercised[26](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#26)---confer
on the executive branch the power to compel "nonexclusive, partially
exclusive, or exclusive license\[s\]" to "responsible
applicant\[s\]."[27](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#27)
Other commentators have more generally advocated for "updating
Bayh-Dole's pro-commercialization safeguards," apparently out of concern
"that courts \[will\] let overly broad patent rights
emerge."[28](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#28)
Their critics, however, ponder how agencies would properly determine
whether patents are "overly
broad,"[29](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#29)
also pointing out a placid statement from the federal government's
premier funder of medical research, the National Institutes of Health
(NIH): While we have not received any inquiries or complaints about lack
of access to the CRISPR-CAS9 technology for research or commercial
development from those who are in a position to use the technology, we
continue to monitor access and use of the CRISPR technology that was
funded by NIH with respect to public access and compliance with NIH
principles and policies. At this time, we do not believe that a new NIH
policy to address the licensing of CRISPR patented technology is
necessary.[30](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#30)
In arriving at that conclusion, the NIH considered and reported no
violation of its long-standing "Principles and Guidelines for Recipients
of NIH Research Grants and Contracts on Obtaining and Disseminating
Biomedical Research Resources." Among other things, those
recommendations discourage exclusive licensing, "except in cases where
the licensee undertakes to make the research tool widely available to
researchers through unrestricted sale, or \[where\] the licensor retains
rights to make the research tool widely
available."[31](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#31)
Patent Pool: Oasis or Mirage? [[As CRISPR marches on, there may be an
elegant solution for making it widely available without government
intervention in licensing: patent pools]{.underline}]{.mark}. These
joint licensing platforms enable owners to combine their IP rights into
bundles that are made accessible, nonexclusively, to a broad range of
users via a single transaction with predictable terms. As a result,
licensors and licensees can concentrate on innovation and commercial
development, respectively, while minimizing transaction costs and
litigation
risk.[32](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#32)
This model was popularized in the 1990s, when the consumer electronics
industry adopted it to facilitate deployment of the MPEG-2 digital video
standard, which has yielded about \$5 trillion in worldwide product
sales since
1997.[33](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#33)
A key coordinator of that effort, MPEG LA LLC, now invites CRISPR/Cas9
patent holders to participate in their own pool. MPEG LA has been
gauging interest from CRISPR rights holders since at least April
2017.[34](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#34)
Broad and Rockefeller University announced that they had submitted
nearly two dozen "key CRISPR-Cas9
patents,"[35](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#35)
from 10 families, "for evaluation of eligibility to participate in
discussions facilitated by MPEG LA regarding creation of a CRISPR Joint
Licensing
Platform."[36](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#36)
UC reportedly has no plans to follow suit, citing potential conflicts
with its existing
licenses.[37](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#37)
The effect that pooling would have on such arrangements may remain
unclear until contributors finalize pool terms, which could take years.
Early efforts might focus on pooling foundational patents, and there has
also been speculation about specialized pools geared toward particular
CRISPR applications (e.g., agriculture and industrial
biotechnology).[38](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#38)
Pooling may prove to be more of a challenge with respect to human
therapeutics, a field where rights holders typically expect exclusivity
as a reward for their enormous investment in rigorous clinical trials.
Toward the Clinic In June 2017, an FDA senior policy advisor announced
that the agency has begun building the capacity to regulate treatments
that use CRISPR/Cas9
technologies.[39](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#39)
Hammering out the details will take time, but related approvals, market
exclusivities, and patent scuffles may be governed by the Biologics
Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). Though gene therapies are
not expressly included in the BPCIA's definition of "biological
product\[s\],"[40](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#40)
the FDA has made clear that marketing of "genetic material to modify or
manipulate the expression of a gene product or to alter the biological
properties of living cells for therapeutic use" requires an approved
biologics license
application.[41](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#41)
As regulatory channels take shape, do-it-yourself CRISPR kits have
already become available for purchase, pitched with a warning that they
are "not injectable or meant for direct human
use."[42](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#42)
The CEO founder of one such vendor recently made headlines by publicly
injecting a CRISPR concoction after announcing: "This will modify my
muscle genes to give me bigger
muscles."[43](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#43)
The FDA quickly responded with a statement expressing its "concern\[\]
about the safety risks" of such products and noting that their sale "is
against the
law."[44](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2017-18/january-february/crispr-new-frontier-biotechnology-innovation-digital-feature/#44)
It said nothing, though, of whether or how it would enforce that law.
Either way, heavily invested patent owners may see traditional
infringement litigation as a means to shield their nascent technologies
from bad press as they wind their way toward the market. Conclusion All
things considered, 2018 is poised to be another defining year for the
CRISPR patent landscape. While the interference saga between UC and
Broad may be nearing an end, it might be replaced by a similarly
important ex parte reexamination and perhaps more interferences. Tremors
may be felt overseas too, with high-profile opposition proceedings set
to begin at the EPO and additional post-grant battles looming in Europe
and possibly China. Adding to that uncertainty are (1) the possibility
of government intervention in licensing, and (2) lingering questions
about patent pooling efforts, which have been successful in other
contexts and could dramatically simplify [[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}
licensing. Finally, the FDA may soon issue guidelines for human
therapeutics, which could either fuel or dampen enthusiasm for
CRISPR-based medicine. While many of these questions (and others)
[[will]{.mark} likely [remain]{.mark}]{.underline} at the end of 2018,
what happens between now and then may fundamentally shape the evolution
of what many consider to be [[**one of the most important scientific
discoveries** of the twenty-first century]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[[The democratization of the CRISPR/Cas9 system paired with its
fallibility may threaten the safety of society]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Researchers Doudna and Charpentier recognize that there are errors
associated with CRISPR/Cas9, although many other research scientists
have declared that it is the quickest and most efficient of common
genome-editing tools such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and
transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (1081). [[The
maximum efficiency for genetic engineering in humans, depending on
target genes, is approximately 80%,]{.mark} which is higher than
observed with other genome editing tools[. However, the efficiency is
still not high enough.]{.mark}]{.underline} Dr. Emily Leproust, an
expert in synthetic biology and CEO of Twist Bioscience, states,
"Critical to genome editing are precision and 100% guide representation.
[[Precision (brought about by sequence accuracy of the guides) and
effective guide representation are possible only through highly uniform
synthesis"]{.mark}]{.underline} (34). CRISPR is also cheaper and easier
to assemble than other gene editing tools; and its mechanisms are
universal to organisms within all three domains of life (Doudna and
Charpentier 1078). Some laboratory procedures using CRISPR/Cas9
techniques are reported to cost as little as \$30 (Ledford 21). Its
unprecedented affordability and ease of use incited what seemed instant
discoveries in the field of genetic engineering. Alternatively, the fact
that CRISPR/Cas9 is quick, easy, and affordable may also be the reason
for serious mistakes because the system 20 Royal Road lacks the
precision necessary for any real-world applications.

Incredibly, no one has disputed effective jurisdiction over the
experimental use of the CRISPR system. Although officials have enacted
countrywide bans in 40 nations, these restrictions are globally
insignificant because [[the most progressive research in the human
genetic engineering occurs in countries that lack any official
ban---such as the United States and China]{.underline}]{.mark} (König
502-506). At present, valid concerns for genetic engineering with
gene-editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 involve its democratization
combined with its fallibility. The risks associated with these issues
can manifest at any point in the near future, [**[because legal
interventions have yet to be made]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In addition,
the increasing use of CRISPR/Cas9 calls for legal intervention for the
sake of impending issues, such as healthcare inequality and inevitably
inspired nonmedical applications. The imminent problems contingent on
CRISPR/Cas9's popular use are anticipated to be palpable in the near
future unless regulations are instituted for their effective prevention.
This paper discusses some of the situational issues that the world is
bound to deal with moving forward with the global democratization of
CRISPR/Cas9.

The rate at which biological opportunities enter the market will
fluctuate sharply in response to regulatory pressures. [[Regional
variations of regulation can have significant impact on the potential to
scale and commercialize biological technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Companies will need to sharpen their capabilities for engaging with
national and supranational agencies. Public opinion and perception can
lead to regulation changes and are therefore vital factors in how the
Bio Revolution proceeds. [[We have seen this]{.underline}]{.mark}
pattern before, [[with the regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} of the first
wave [[of genetically modified crops. The United States took a
permissive regulatory stance, Europe put in place a near-total ban, and
China recently came out somewhere in the middle by banning the farming
of genetically modified crops but not the import of selected varieties
of harvested genetically modified crops]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beyond
general sentiment, trust is a critical factor. People must have a degree
of trust in companies that propose to sequence and analyze a person's
genome, edit children's genes, or connect to a brain--machine interface.
Within consumer markets alone, as the mining of personal genetic data
increases, businesses will need to understand the trade-offs between
advancing commercial opportunities and protecting public and social
welfare.14 For example, the data-sharing practices of some
direct-to-consumer genetic-testing companies with pharma companies and
app developers have been called into question by consumers and media,
revealing just how precious trust is---and how easy it is to damage it
with just a few poorly handled mistakes.

We've been forced to identify the difference between wants and needs for
ourselves and others around us. We've realized what real needs are, such
as life-saving tools and resources for front-line workers to help combat
the coronavirus. From ventilators to surgical gowns to N95-equivalent
masks to even hand sanitizer. There was and continues to be a need and
demand for these items. [[Being a critical part of producing everyday
essentials]{.underline}]{.mark} for people [[isn't new to the chemical
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. Touching [[96% of all manufactured
goods]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the chemical industry]{.underline}]{.mark}
was **[[deemed "essential critical
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**" by the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security. Companies and leaders are stepping up to be part of
the solution, donating money and supplies. Even more impressive is the
companies finding ways to think and operate differently, to be a part of
the solution in ways they never thought they would have to. Using
critical-thinking skills in a different manner, they've developed new
ways to continue operations, be it remotely or otherwise in some cases,
to get the job done in the face of adversity. [This demand]{.underline}
--- the need --- [to produce goods for a greater cause has induced
wonderful innovation]{.underline}. It's innovation at its finest.
[Innovation]{.underline} --- thinking in new and different ways.
[Developing new processes. Identifying new products or services. Acting
differently based on new inputs. Adapting a supply chain. Finding a way
to be a part of the solution]{.underline}. **[[The innovation occurring
in the science, technology and manufacturing industries is for the good
of all]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and it's inspiring to experience. [[It is
occurring at a pace that]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in recent years, has
been stymied by lack of resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly the
lack of a true rallying need or by a thought process that was not driven
to move with decisive speed and effect. [The chemical]{.underline} and
discreet manufacturing [sectors]{.underline}, working in unison for a
common purpose, [are delivering needed goods they do not normally make,
and they're doing so at a staggering pace.]{.underline} Companies such
as Dow are manufacturing much-needed hand sanitizer for emergency
responders in a safe and environmentally sound manner by repurposing
reaction trains that were never intended to manufacture this product.
Companies like Eagle Manufacturing, part of the Justrite Safety Group,
are working day and night to help deliver much-needed personal
protective equipment in the form of masks to our National Guard. This is
something they've never made before. And I've seen parts for face
shields and masks being produced on 3D printers, something that would
not have even been possible just a few short years ago. There are
millions of other people and **[[thousands of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
other **[[companies making change happen to help us win against this

the people who work at MATRIC, everyone from our most senior leaders to

help?" Innovation matters to --- and for --- us all. [[Innovation in all
its forms allows]{.underline}]{.mark} critical thinkers to make

#### Stable U.S. ag key to prevent great power wars---multiple hotspots

Strategy Is Essential to Our National Security," 5/1/17,

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces]{.mark} many
[threats]{.mark} to our National Security. These threats include
continuing wars with extremist elements [such as **ISIS** and]{.mark}
potential [wars with]{.mark} rogue state [**North Korea** or]{.mark}
regional nuclear power **[Iran.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [The heated
economic and diplomatic [competition with **Russia** and]{.mark} a
surging [**China** could spiral out of control.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Concurrently, we face threats to our future security posed by growing
civil strife, famine, and refugee and migration challenges which create
incubators for extremist and anti-American government factions. Our
response cannot be one dimensional but instead must be a nuanced and
comprehensive National Security Strategy combining all elements of
National Power including a Food Security Strategy. [An **American Food
Security Strategy** is an imperative factor in **reducing the multiple
threats impacting our National wellbeing.**]{.underline} [Recent history
has shown that **[reliable food supplies and stable prices
produce]{.mark} more [stable]{.mark} and secure [countries.]{.mark}**
Conversely, food insecurity, particularly in poorer countries, can lead
to instability, unrest, and violence. [**Food insecurity** drives mass
migration]{.mark} around the world from the Middle East, to Africa, to
Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring populations, **[generating
conflicts]{.mark}**, and threatening our own security by
[disrupting]{.mark} our [economic, military, and diplomatic
relationships.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Food system shocks from extreme
food-price volatility can be correlated with protests and
riots.]{.underline} Food price related protests toppled governments in
Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010 and in 2011, food prices
and grievances related to food policy were one of the major drivers of
the Arab Spring uprisings. Repeatedly, history has taught us that a
strong agricultural sector is an unquestionable requirement for
inclusive and sustainable growth, broad-based development progress, and
long-term stability. The impact can be remarkable and far reaching.
[[Rising income]{.mark}, in addition to reducing the opportunities for
an upsurge in extremism, leads to changes in diet, [producing demand
for]{.mark} more diverse and nutritious [foods provided]{.mark}, in many
cases, [from **American farmers**]{.mark} and ranchers.]{.underline}
[**[Emerging markets]{.mark}** currently [purchase 20 percent of U.S.
ag]{.mark}riculture [exports and that]{.mark} figure [is **expected to
grow**]{.mark} as populations boom.]{.underline} Moving early to ensure
stability in strategically significant regions requires long term
planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current
threats and work to prevent future ones, our national leadership must
employ the entire spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic,
and cultural elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the
resulting instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of
instability before it occurs. This is not rocket science. We know where
the instability is most likely to occur. The world population will grow
by 2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population
boom is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food
insecure countries. This alarming math is not just about total numbers.
Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age groups most
vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million people in
Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed in Africa
are young people. Too often **[[these]{.mark} situations [deteriorate
into shooting wars]{.mark}]{.underline}** requiring the deployment of
our military forces. We should be continually mindful that the price we
pay for committing military forces is measured in our most precious
national resource, the blood of those who serve. For those who live in
rural America, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of those
who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and non-urban
communities that make up only 16% of our population. Actions taken now
to increase agricultural sector jobs can provide economic opportunity
and stability for those unemployed youths while helping to feed people.
A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs identifies
agriculture development as the core essential for providing greater food
security, economic growth, and population well-being. [Our active
support for food security, including agriculture development, has helped
stabilize key regions over the past 60 years. A robust food security
strategy, as a part of our overall security strategy, can mitigate the
growth of terrorism, build important relationships, and support
continued American economic and agricultural prosperity while materially
contributing to our Nation's and the world's security.]{.underline}

All of the stars are aligned for there to be a flurry of deals activity

**[[biotech valuations have been normalizing after years of a boom

[[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[broader labor changes, supply

on goal in order to make up for revenues lost to generic competition in
the remainder of the decade. However, don't rule out the potential for
larger deals ⁠--- consolidation is good for the health ecosystem and
drives broader efficiency. Expect to see big pharma picking up earlier
stage companies to try and fill the pipeline gaps that are likely to
start in 2024. While market conditions suggest bargain prices for
biotech are possible, recent transactions indicate that pharma companies
are still paying significantly above current trading prices (ranging
from approximately 50 to 100% of current trading), but below the peak
valuations of recent memory. In the first few months of the year,
semi-annualized deal value was down 58% from the same period last year,
with companies investing just \$61.7 billion so far. Only 137 deals were
announced during that time, compared to 204 in the year-prior period.
[[Talk of drug pricing regulations]{.underline}]{.mark} continues in
Washington as Congress bats around a pared down version of the Build

and continue to deal with a **[greater impact from semiconductor

medical device space is down 85% from the same period the prior year,
expect these companies to remain focused on M&A as the subsector

[[Pharma mergers might boost short-term profits. But long-term value?
Think again, because everyone knows that **big mergers hurt
innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That's the claim, at least, repeated
by critics every time a major pharma combo hits the news. Problem is,
those complaints tend to be based on anecdotal evidence, from scientists
who've seen their work hit the slough of despond as one big R&D
operation integrated with another. But now, the Harvard Business Review
has some
[empirical](https://hbr.org/2016/08/research-innovation-suffers-when-drug-companies-merge)
[evidence](https://hbr.org/2016/08/research-innovation-suffers-when-drug-companies-merge).
Two researchers from the Institute for Competition Economics in Germany
set out to address drug mergers from an antitrust perspective. All well
and good for competition watchdogs to look at overlaps in companies'
marketed products and pipelines, they figured. What about the drugs that
might have The researchers analyzed 65 pharma deals, comparing the
participating companies before and after they combined. They also
analyzed companies that were developing drugs in similar therapeutic
areas, but hadn't merged. "Our results very clearly show that R&D and
patenting within the merged entity decline substantially after a merger,
compared to the same activity in both companies beforehand," the
authors, Justus Haucap and Joel Stiebale, wrote in the HBR. That's to be
expected, the authors posit, because merger-minded companies often
target rivals with similar pipeline assets, to gain strength in
particular drug markets. But here's what else the authors found: "On
average, patenting and R&D expenditures of non-merging competitors also
fell\--by more than 20%\--within four years after a merger. Therefore,
pharmaceutical mergers seem to substantially reduce innovation
activities in the relevant market as a whole.\" Haucap and Stiebale's
[paper](https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/dicedp/218.html) includes patent
counts and R&D spending numbers, and they conclude that "innovation
output" by the merged company decreases, on average, by more than 30%.
Among the merged company's competitors, output declined by 7%, on
average, they found. The men's research "is the first to show that there
are follow-on effects across the industry,"
[wrote](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/08/24/drug-mergers-hurt-in-every-direction-save-one)
Derek Lowe at In The Pipeline, which has sliced and diced pharma M&A for
years. "[[Inside the merged companies, there's a great deal of
disruption]{.mark}, as many readers here can testify,"]{.underline} Lowe
wrote. "But across the industry as a whole, things get less competitive
the fewer players there are and the fewer the approaches being tried."
As for the business effects? Profitability increased post-merger, for
the merged companies and for their competitors, too. For the merged
company, the profits may depend on cost cuts; in integrating, the
post-merger company "decreases its scale" compared to the two merger
partners, pre-acquisition. For "non-merging rivals," profits tended to
grow on increased sales. "**[[What we have, then, is probably a perverse
incentive\--companies can improve their numbers by doing mergers and
acquisitions, but that very activity hurts their long-term prospects and
those of the entire industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Lowe observes.
McKinsey & Co. analysts
[emphasized](http://www.fiercepharma.com/m-a/thumbs-up-or-down-on-megamergers-depends-on-your-point-of-view)
the "shareholder value" effects of megamergers in a 2014 study, and they
found that, reductively speaking, the deals worked. Lowe picked apart
that research, as did ex-Pfizer R&D chief John LaMattina, who wrote up
his own

trends]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[defining the
chem]{.underline}]{.mark}ical [[industry,]{.underline}]{.mark} each
affecting a different element of business, from operations through
production and compliance.

**[Mergers and acquisitions]{.underline}**: The last couple of years saw
[[notable consolidation in the form of multiple mergers and
acquisitions]{.underline}]{.mark}. A result of slow overall industry
growth and a desire to consolidate resources and capabilities in the
areas with the most promising growth, M&A is also being driven by
growing pressure to gather the resources needed for digital
transformation. Mega [[mergers are radically altering
the]{.underline}]{.mark} top of the [[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}­­--a
fact that has not escaped the attention of farmers, legislators, and
regulatory bodies.

**[A new regulatory environment]{.underline}**: Governments and
[[regulatory bodies around the world are overhauling chemical
regulations]{.underline}]{.mark} for the first time in decades. Both
environmental and industry groups note that [[these changes could signal
a kind of détente between the chemical industry and its
watchdogs]{.underline}]{.mark} over the next few years. In other parts
of the world, however, the relationship between the industry, activist
groups, and regulatory bodies remains more acrimonious.

**[Investment]{.underline}**: After decades of taking a back seat to
emerging markets, [**[North America saw a significant wave of
investments in]{.mark}** new multi-billion-dollar **[production
facilities from]{.mark}**]{.underline} a number of [[chemical

this growth **[include the considerable size and strength of the
regional market, and favorable political and regulatory environments in
American states with significant chemical production
segments]{.underline}**.

**[Digital transformation]{.underline}**: [[Rising demand
and]{.underline}]{.mark} growing [[competition]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[pressure on]{.underline}]{.mark}
all [[chem]{.underline}]{.mark}ical m[[anufacturers to adopt advanced

drive down prices while at the same time filling top spots in his
administration with industry insiders. [[This administration's culture
of corruption, which continues a decadeslong practice of political
pandering to the pharmaceutical industry, carries a real cost; Americans
spent \$535 billion]{.mark}1 [on prescription drugs in 2018, an increase
of 50 percent since 2010. These price increases far surpass inflation,
with Big Pharma increasing prices on its most-prescribed medications by
anywhere from 40 percent to 71 percent from 2011 to
2015]{.mark}.2]{.underline} Moreover, [pharmaceutical companies receive
substantial U.S. government assistance in the form of publicly funded
basic research and tax breaks, yet they continue to charge exorbitant
prices for medications. But the issue goes beyond cost]{.underline}. In
America, more than 1 million individuals suffer from Type 1 diabetes3, a
condition where the body cannot make insulin, which is essential for
getting glucose (also known as blood sugar) into cells from the
bloodstream. Without insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream4,
causing dangerously high blood sugar levels. Among all Americans
suffering from diabetes, at least 1 in 45 have said that they engaged in
insulin rationing---a tactic of using less insulin than is needed in
order to make the doses last longer---as a direct result of the
skyrocketing price of the drug. A vial of insulin, which is the only
life-sustaining option for Type 1 diabetics, retails at around \$300.6 A
2018 study commissioned by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus found that
the price of insulin has doubled since 20127; in the 10 years prior, the
price of insulin nearly tripled. Despite the dangers of insulin
rationing, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a fatal condition,
many Americans have no other choice. That was the case for Antroinette8,
whose daughter was rationing insulin due to the high cost and died at
the age of 22 as a result. Insulin facts Access to insulin for patients
with Type 1 diabetes is a matter of life or death.9 While insulin has
existed since the1920s10, the price since then has skyrocketed,
especially in recent years. Prices for insulin increased by 197 percent
between 2002 and 2013, from \$4.34 per milliliter to \$12.92 per
milliliter.11 There are three insulin manufacturers serving the United
States: Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S, and Sanofi SA. Eli
Lillyannounced12 in March 2019 that it would begin selling a generic
version of its Humalog insulin at half the price. The medication, known
as lispro, will cost \$137.35 per vial. To compare pricing, a 2018
study13 estimated that the cost of making a year's worth of insulin for
one patient ranges from \$78 to \$133. Ahead of its hearing on drug
pricing in February 2019, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance sent
aletter14 to Eli Lilly asking why insulin is priced so astonishingly
high. A vial of NovoLog, one type of insulin, costs15 anywhere from \$14
to \$300 in the United States but only \$48 in Singapore, \$14 in India,
\$6 in Austria, and \$0 in Italy. American taxpayers fund basic research
Billions of taxpayer dollars go into the creation and marketing16 of new
drugs. The Los Angeles Times reports that, "Since the 1930s, the
National Institutes of Health has invested close to \$90017 billion in
the basic and applied research that formed both the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology sectors." Despite taxpayers' crucial investment, U.S.
consumers are increasingly paying more for their prescription drugs. A
2018 study18 on the National Institute of Health's (NIH) financial
contributions to new drug approvals found that the agency "contributed
to published research associated with every one of the 210 new drugs
approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010--2016." More than
\$100 billion in NIH funding went toward research that contributed
directly or indirectly to the 210 drugs approved during that six-year
period. The NIH Research Project Grant (R01)19---which supports
health-related research---was by far the most common kind of grant used
to fund the science that supported the new drugs. In all, NIH gave out
nearly 118,00020 R01 grants related to those drugs from 2010 to 2016.
Federal perks for Big Pharma add up **[[Pharmaceutical companies also
benefit from research and development tax
credits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The federal R&D tax credit was first
introduced in 1981 to encourage private sector investment in pioneering
research.21 This tax credit is available to businesses that attempt to
develop new, improved, or technologically advanced products or trade
processes.22 In 2015, former President Barack Obama signed into law the
Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act23, which made these tax credits
permanent and extended them to small businesses and startup companies.
Pharmaceutical industries also receive a tax deduction for their
marketing and advertising expenses. According to a report in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, "From 1997 through 2016, medical
marketing expanded substantially, and spending increased from \$17.7 to
\$29.9 billion,24 with direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription
drugs and health services accounting for the most rapid growth, and
pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals accounting for most
promotional spending." The report also found that from 1997 through
2016, "the number of advertisements ... increased from 79,000 (including
72,000 television commercials) in 1997 to 4.6 million (663,000
television25 commercials) in 2016." Big Pharma's drug pricing maximizes
profits Despite these taxpayer subsidies, prescription drug prices are
nonetheless increasing at an alarming rate. In 2019, price increases
from drug manufacturers affected more than 3,40026 drugs. For example,
Allergan, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, raised prices on 51
drugs, just more than half its portfolio. Some medications that Allergan
manufactures saw a 9.5 percent jump in cost, while others saw a 4.9
percent increase in cost.27 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the
largest generic drug manufacturer in the world, increased its drug
prices by more than 9 percent.28 These sharp increases in price occur as
companies continue to report millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018,
Allergan reported \$15.8 million29 in revenue, while Teva
Pharmaceuticals reported \$18.8 million30 in revenue. Pharmaceutical
companies' profit margins receive significant bumps when they launch new
drugs, specifically specialty drugs, used to treat life-threatening
conditions. These drugs often cost more than most Americans can afford.
Pharmaceutical companies have stated that the prices are high because
the drugs are difficult to manufacture. In 2013, for example, industry
giant Gilead Sciences launched Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug, at \$1,000
per pill31, or \$84,00032 per treatment, which could last 12 to 24
weeks.33 After an 18-month investigation into the company's pricing, the
Senate Finance Committee concluded that Gilead had pursued a marketing
and pricing strategy designed to "maximize revenue with little concern
for access or affordability."34 [[Drug companies also benefit from
patents, which give them monopoly power for their on-patent products.
These patents ensure that prices remain high by reducing competition.
Drug patents last for 20 years after the filing date. Pharmaceutical
companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing
to prolong a drug's exclusivity]{.mark}.]{.underline} When evergreening,
pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as
changing its35 chemical composition slightly or making an external
change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill36 in order to preserve
their patents. A 2018 study in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences
found that 78 percent37 of new drug patents awarded in the past decade
went to drugs that already existed. Seventy percent 38 of the nearly 100
bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once,
and 50 percent extended their patents more than once. The second
tactic---thicketing---involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it
difficult for competing firms to secure patents. These tactics help
preserve pharmaceutical companies' monopolies and ensure that drug
prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday
Americans. While consumers continue to pay the price of this market
manipulation, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the
pharmaceutical industry found that these unfair practices are
significantly enriching manufacturers. As the report stated, "Among the
largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between 15
and 20 percent."39 The GAO contextualizes these profits by comparing the
pharmaceutical industry's profits with those of its counterparts,
stating that "the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies
among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent." In
2018 alone, the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies Allergan, Johnson
& Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. made a total of \$90 million.40 Meanwhile,
according to a CBS News report, Americans spent \$535 billion41 on
prescription drugs in 2018---an increase of 50 percent since 2010.42 As
pharmaceutical industry profits increase43, everyday Americans---whose
tax dollars play a critical role in funding the research and development
of these medications---are not receiving anything close to a fair return
on their investment. A recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found that
Americans spent \$65.8 billion44 out of pocket in 2016 for retail
prescription drugs, up from \$59.5 billion in 2012. The high cost of
prescription drugs is a significant driver of medical debt45 because
Americans are increasingly reliant on medication to manage long-term
chronic conditions.46 Additionally, the high cost of prescription drugs
has forced many Americans to take drastic measures, including foregoing
taking their medications as prescribed or traveling abroad in order to
save on medications. A 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
study found that 11.4 percent47 of adults aged 18 to 64 did not take
their prescription drugs as prescribed in order to reduce how much they
spent on their medications. And, as NPR recently reported, "The U.S
government estimates that close to 1 million48 Americans in California
alone go to Mexico annually for health care, including to buy
prescription drugs." In May 2019, a group of Americans49 living with
Type 1 diabetes traveled to Canada to purchase insulin and call on the
U.S. government to regulate the cost of lifesaving drugs. The costs
associated with traveling abroad make it logistically and financially
impractical for most Americans. Further, traveling abroad presents
certain health risks given that some countries have lax drug
certification standards compared with FDA standards. President Trump's
broken promises on drug pricing In an interview with Time magazine ahead
of being chosen as its Person of the Year in 2016, Trump said, "I'm
going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what's happened with drug
prices."50 He promised to bring Americans' drug spending down to \$0 by
negotiating drug prices.51 Trump made grandiose promises on drug pricing
but almost three years later has only managed to deliver a handful of
half-measures, illustrating his administration's lack of commitment to
lowering drug prices. One of Trump's proposals from his so-called
presidential blueprint52 included eliminating some rebates paid by drug
companies53 that hide the true cost of drugs. However, the Congressional
Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal
spending on Medicare and Medicaid by \$177 billion.54 The Trump
administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for
drugs to include the list price.55 Some experts believe this policy will
be ineffective56 at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or
end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers
rather than help them.57 These half-measures, combined with Trump
surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly
communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs
for Americans. Congress has done little to address the problem of high
drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy cozy relationships
with the pharmaceutical industry. The industry spent more than \$62
million in the 2016 congressional elections---the most it has ever spent
on political campaigns.58 The massive influx of campaign cash benefited
members of both parties, including those that sit on committees with
jurisdiction over drug pricing.59 Big Pharma's investment has paid off
as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to
pass an amendment on the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of
2019, which would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with
manufacturers.60 Medicare's ability to negotiate on drug prices, which
is currently prohibited by law, "would provide the leverage needed to
lower drug costs."61 Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma,
President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry. Big Pharma
officials have filled at least 1662 current or former positions in the
Trump administration, and many of Trump's top health advisers have been
industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies. Trump's
first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price
(R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry63 in Congress, where he
not only pushed Big Pharma's agenda but also benefited from it
financially.64 Price, who drew scrutiny for more than \$300,000 in
health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 201765 as a
result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers' dime. In
2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan66 to a top position at the U.S. Office
of Management and Budget. Grogan spent five years as a lobbyist for
Gilead---the pharmaceutical company that is infamous for its sky-high
prices on a cure for hepatitis C.67 Since joining the administration,
Grogan has led drug-pricing proposals and participated in Trump's Drug
Pricing and Innovation Working Group."68 However, the working group has
proposed pharma-friendly measures such as implementing monopoly rights
outside of the United States, speeding up approval from the FDA for new
drugs, and eliminating price cuts for hospitals in impoverished areas.
President Trump chose to replace Price with Alex Azar, the former
president of Eli Lilly---one of the companies that is working to keep
drug prices high while everyday Americans suffer---to oversee his
efforts to address drug pricing as secretary of health and human
services. In 2018, pharmaceutical companies spent more than \$283
million in lobbying dollars69, with Eli Lilly spending just less than
\$6.8 million in 2018.70 While Azar, Trump's chief health adviser, was
president of Eli Lilly, the company drastically increased insulin
prices. Eli Lilly is currently defending itself against a class-action
lawsuit71 accusing the company of colluding with pharmacy benefit
managers---individuals who negotiate drug pricing and availability with
drug companies for the government and other insurance plans---to
increase prices. Big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers have been
playing a blame game72 while lawmakers---who have held several hearings
in the U.S. House of Representatives73 and the U.S. Senate74---try to
find the source of America's drug pricing problem. Given the sway that
Big Pharma has with the administration, the industry has no plans to
reduce prescription drug prices or reverse past price gouging. For his
part, President Trump tried but failed to pass the American Health Care
Act of 2017, which would have hurt millions of Americans while
benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, among others. However, he was
successful in signing into law a new tax bill that lowered the corporate
tax rate by 14 percent, allowing pharmaceutical companies, including
those with ties to the Trump administration, to save a total of \$76
billion.75 After the tax law was enacted, Eli Lilly received a tax cut
of nearly \$4.5 billion on offshore profits.76 Instead of using these
tax savings to lower drug prices, big pharmaceutical companies such as
Eli Lilly together used \$45 billion of their total tax savings77 to
benefit shareholders via stock buyback programs. After President Trump
helped Eli Lilly save billions, Azar, the company's top executive, was
confirmed to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services78 at
the beginning of the following year. Conclusion Although the Trump
administration keeps promising to lower drug prices, [[drug costs
continue to climb as Americans su]{.mark}ffer and pharmaceutical
companies profit and their CEOs line their pockets. [The
government-funded research and major tax benefits that these
pharmaceutical companies enjoy help them stay profitable. Meanwhile,
they continue to hike up the costs of drugs, particularly
life-sustaining drugs such as insulin. **Big Pharma can play this game
indefinitely, benefiting from this culture of
corruption**]{.mark}]{.underline}, using allies in the administration
and in Congress to grow their profit margins while everyday people
suffer. But there are steps lawmakers can take to reduce the influence
of special interests, including Big Pharma.79 For example, lobbyists are
currently allowed to fundraise for candidates for federal office---and
many of them provide far more financial support beyond the \$2,800 per
candidate limit by hosting fundraising events and bundling
contributions. Banning lobbyists from fundraising80 for candidates would
reduce special-interest influence over the legislative process. Another
way to limit corrupting conflicts of interest is to ban members of
Congress from accepting campaign donations from entities under the
jurisdiction of the committees on which the serve. It is understood that
conflicts can easily arise from committee contributions, which explains
why 88 percent of voters support this prohibition.81 Additionally,
Washington's infamous revolving door between private industry and
government must be closed. Proposals to do so include a lifetime
lobbying ban on members of Congress and a five-year lobbying ban on
senior congressional staffers.82 As Americans are caught trying to
decide whether to pay for rent or medicine, pharmaceutical companies
continue to reap government benefits. Reducing drug prices and the costs
that everyday people must pay is not possible without fixing the broken
system in Washington.

It is perhaps surprising, then, that [there is [**little scholarly
merit**]{.mark} in the notion [that a]{.mark} short-term
[reduction]{.mark} in access to **[food increases]{.mark} the
[probability]{.mark} that [conflict]{.mark}** will [break
out.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is because [[to start]{.mark} or
participate in violent [conflict requires]{.mark} people to have both
the [means and]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}. Most [people on the **brink of
starvation are not in the position to resort**]{.mark} **to violence**,
whether against the government or other social groups]{.underline}. In
fact, [the urban middle classes tend to be the most likely to protest
against rises in food prices, since they often have the best
opportunities, the most energy, and the best skills to coordinate and
participate in protests.]{.underline}

Accordingly, [there is a **[widespread misapprehension]{.mark}** that
[social unrest in periods of high]{.mark} food [prices relates]{.mark}
primarily [to]{.mark} food [shortages]{.mark}]{.underline}. In reality,
the [[sources of discontent are]{.mark} considerably **[more
complex]{.mark}** -- linked to [**political structures**,
**land**]{.mark} ownership, **[corruption]{.mark}**, the desire for
[**democratic reforms** and]{.mark} general **[economic
problems]{.mark}** -- where the price of food is seen in the context of
general increases in the cost of living]{.underline}. Research has shown
that while the international media have a tendency to seek simple
resource-related explanations -- such as drought or famine -- for
conflicts in the Global South, debates in the local media are permeated
by more complex political relationships.

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [**[disruption]{.mark}** to
the agriculture and food supply chains,]{.underline} particularly in the
first half of 2020, most [**sector [shocks]{.mark}** were **[absorbed
rapidly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with trade and markets recovering during
the year. Average gross farm receipts for OECD and emerging economies
actually increased in 2020, and the sector was the best performing or
least affected economically in several countries. At the same time,
restricting measures impacted the food security of many low income or
unemployed consumers.

This relative [**economic [resilience]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[ag]{.mark}riculture]{.underline} and food sector [was largely [due
to]{.mark}]{.underline} sector specific policy measures undertaken by
governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
restrictions. Many [[governments **moved**]{.mark} **swiftly** [to
keep]{.mark} agricultural [supply chains]{.mark}
functioning]{.underline}, including by [[designating ag]{.mark}riculture
and food as an **[essential]{.mark} sector**]{.underline} and by
ensuring international co-operation to limit trade disruptions.

An estimated 776 unique policy response measures were adopted by
governments of 54 OECD and emerging economies in 2020. These measures
were widely diverse, highlighting the breadth and responsiveness of
public actions to address the impact of the crisis. Close to 20% of the
total were urgent measures, adopted in order to contain the pandemic
while keeping food and agriculture supply chains working. Just under 70%
of measures took the form of temporary relief, seeking to contain the
impact of the crisis on agriculture and food sector actors, and should
be phased out as the crisis recedes. Most of the remaining measures
(10%) were "no regrets" policies with the potential to improve the
long-term resilience of the agro-food sector, and which have the
potential to be scaled up further. At the same time, 11% of measures had
the potential to distort markets or be harmful to the environment.

A first assessment of budgetary expenditures in response to the COVID-19
crisis suggests that a [minimum of USD [157 billion]{.mark} was
[**earmarked** in funding]{.mark} or]{.underline} offered in
[financing]{.underline} means [to the sector]{.underline} in 2020,
including USD 75 billion in OECD countries and USD 82 billion in
emerging economies. [Actual disbursements have so far been
**lower**]{.underline}, partly [[reflecting]{.mark} the **overall
[resilience]{.mark}** of agriculture]{.underline} to the COVID-19 shock,
and the fact that recovery packages in several countries include
multi-year investments.

#### Increased food production is bad -- more likely to cause conflict 

Ore **Koren, 16**, (Ore Koren, Ore Koren is a PhD candidate at the
University of Minnesota and a Jennings Randolph Fellow at the United
States Institute of Peace., 11-23-2016, Washington Post, Food scarcity

[How can an abundance of food lead to war]{.underline}? Food scarcity,
however, is only one aspect of food security. **[[Whether people have
easy access to food resources is also important]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
So **[[even in countries where plenty of food is
available]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a **[[large share of the population
might still go hungry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Nobel Laureate Amartya
Sen notes, "[[Starvation is]{.underline}]{.mark} the characteristic of
[[some people not having enough food to eat]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[It
is not]{.underline}]{.mark}** the characteristic of **[[there being not
enough food to eat]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [[Grievances over
food]{.underline}]{.mark} and the necessity to secure access to food
resources [can [motivate marginalized groups to]{.mark} participate in
[rebellions and wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. A number of scholars are
researching how [[inequitable access to food]{.mark} affects violence
within the state]{.underline}. As Ben Bagozzi and I show in a recent
paper, armed actors worldwide are motivated to fight over local food
resources. Here's why **[[these conflicts tend to happen in regions with
more food crops, not less]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[For rebel
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, securing --- and [[controlling --- food
resources is vital for the insurgency to advance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And [when the government is slow]{.underline} or unable [to
supply]{.underline} combat [rations]{.underline}, [[state
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} also may be forced to **[[extract food
supplies from the local population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, So scarce
[[food]{.underline}]{.mark} resources in a region locked in conflict
[[act as both fuel and reward]{.underline}]{.mark} for hungry
combatants. **[[Access to more local food]{.underline}]{.mark}**
resources, [especially in the case of rebel groups]{.underline},
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be used to attract
recruits]{.underline}]{.mark}, as happened in Sierra Leone and Somalia.
Regions where wheat and barley are grown are also an important source of
support for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The focus on how the
demand for food resources influences armed conflict complements the
research done on the effects of food scarcity. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark}
also **[[explains why agricultural areas see more
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In these regions, individuals live
largely on locally grown food. If the government's safety nets are
mismanaged or weak, those who control access to food can more easily
recruit individuals and operate for a longer period of time. And this
also explains why **[[there is an uptick in violence during times of
more rainfall]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- for instance, in sub-Saharan
Africa. By [[providing armed groups with]{.underline}]{.mark} an added
[[motivation to fight]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as the ability to
expand their numbers and strength, **[[local food
security]{.underline}]{.mark}** can **[[therefore shape global conflict
patterns]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
