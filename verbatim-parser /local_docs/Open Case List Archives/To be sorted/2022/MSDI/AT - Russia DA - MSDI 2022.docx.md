### Thumpers

#### Ukraine war will thump for years into the future

**RFE/RL**\'s Ukrainian Service, 6-19-20**22**,

\"NATO Says Ukraine Fighting Could Last Years As Russians Pound Eastern
Cities,\" RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

NATO\'s secretary-general has warned that [[the war in Ukraine could go
on for years]{.underline}]{.mark} and urged the supply of
state-of-the-art weapons to Kyiv even if \"costs are high,\" as
[[Ukraine\'s allies sought to preempt any international
\"fatigue\"]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly four months into Russia\'s
unprovoked invasion.

The cautions came as Russia stepped up its offensives against
Syevyerodonetsk and other eastern Ukrainian cities, and with the
European Union readying for a recommendation next week to
[make]{.underline} Ukraine a candidate to join the bloc.

\"We must prepare for the fact that it could take years. We must not let
up in supporting Ukraine,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told
Germany\'s Bild am Sonntag newspaper in comments published on June 19.

\"Even if the costs are high, not only for military support, also
because of rising energy and food prices.\"

Following his visit to Kyiv on June 18 to show support for Ukraine,
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in London\'s Sunday Times
that \"time is the vital factor\" and \"everything will depend on
whether Ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster
than Russia can renew its capacity to attack.\"

Johnson spoke of the need to avoid \"Ukraine fatigue\" from a conflict
that has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians and displaced more than
10 million others since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his
troops across the border on February 24.

Syevyerodonetsk, the focus of Russia's offensive to capture full control
of the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, remained under heavy
artillery fire on June 19, as did the sister city of Lysychansk, just
across the Severskiy Donets River.

The Ukrainian General Staff said early on June 19 that Russian troops
eere concentrating their main efforts in the direction of
Syevyerodonetsk and Bakhmut.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it had taken control of Metyolkine, a
town about 6 kilometers southeast of Syevyerodonetsk that had a
population of about 800 before the war. TASS reported that many
Ukrainian fighters had surrendered there.

Ukraine\'s military said Russia had \"partial success\" in the area, but
Serhiy Hayday, the military governor of Luhansk, told Ukrainian
television that the Russians\' claims that they control Syevyerodonetsk
are false.

\"They control the main part of the town but not the whole town,\" he
said, adding that the fighting made evacuations from the city
impossible.

Despite heavy shelling of Syevyerodonestk\'s twin city, Lysychansk, it
was possible to evacuate 19 people from there, Hayday said.

\"Today, 19 residents of Lysychansk have already exhaled with relief and
are in a place where shells do not fly overhead,\" Hayday said on
Telegram.

The British Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update on June 19
that there was \"little change in the front line\" in recent days in the
so-called Syevyerodonetsk pocket where Russian forces are hoping to
encircle Ukraine\'s defenders.

But the ministry also warned that Ukrainian and Russian combat units
\"committed to intense combat in the Donbas\" are probably suffering
\"variable morale,\" citing information from U.K. intelligence services.

Ukrainian and Western intelligence have pointed for months to signs of
poor morale and even fragging among invading Russian soldiers since the
February 24 invasion began.

But the British statement is among the strongest indications so far of
morale problems among Ukrainians, who mobilized military and civilian
defenders to resist the Russians.

\"Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks,\"
the Defense Ministry said in its latest intelligence update on Ukraine.
\"Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled. Cases of
whole Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between
officers and their troops continue to occur.\"

Reliable casualty estimates from either side have been difficult to come
by.

The Ukrainian side suggests more than 30,000 Russian soldiers have been
killed, although Western intelligence has suggested the number is
considerably lower.

The Ukrainian side has not said how many of its troops or other
defenders have died, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy
recently suggested as many as 100 Ukrainian soldiers are being killed
every day.

#### NATO expansion to Finland/Sweden thumps

\",\" IAI TV - Changing how the world thinks (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Finally, [[the expansion of NATO into Sweden and Finland has poignantly
demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark} that despite the war, Ukraine remains
a third-rank citizen in the West. Sweden and Finland were warmly
welcomed by NATO even before they formally applied.
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[despite all its efforts to
join NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, was designated by Boris Johnson on 6
March 2022 as the country that "[[had no serious prospects of NATO
membership]{.underline}]{.mark} in the near future." This was echoed, on
11 March 2022, by Josep Borrell, who reflectively admitted with regards
to Ukraine's NATO membership that "it's a mistake to make promises that
you can't keep."

The limits of the West's support of Ukraine are crystal clear to Putin
and the rest of the world. Regardless of what Russia does in Ukraine,
there will be no NATO membership and no collective security guarantees
for Ukraine. Moreover, [[this round of NATO expansion brings the "enemy"
to the gate of Russia and corroborates Putin's besieged-fortress
ideology]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, Putin has managed to create the
world he has been warning Russians and Russia's allies about: the West
is indeed fully out to encircle Russia. Th[[is self-fulfilling prophecy
shores up Putin's rhetoric within Russia and signals to China that the
West]{.underline}]{.mark} does pose a danger to Russia and [[is more
interested in harming Russia's geopolitical interests than helping
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} recognition
[[strengthens China-Russia alignment]{.underline}]{.mark} which will
further buttress Russia's capacity to carry on in Ukraine.

[[In response to the invasion of Ukraine, the West has imposed stinging
sanctions, disrupting the Russian economy and forcing the Kremlin to
burn through its financial reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}. Major Russian
banks have been disconnected from SWIFT, the international system that
facilitates financial transactions, while some oligarchs have been
sanctioned. Many [[allies and partners have provided massive financial
and material aid]{.underline}]{.mark}---in the form of
[[funding]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as [[anti-tank and
air-defense]{.underline}]{.mark} systems [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
other [[military equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}---to bolster Ukrainian
resistance. This assistance has helped to stiffen an already stout
Ukrainian defense, which has inflicted heavy losses on the Russian
military. Vladimir Putin now faces the real possibility of a stalled
offensive, or even outright defeat.

Balance of power

[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} the war erupted in [[Ukraine, there has
been]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing [[caution in EU and
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} headquarters in Brussels [[about how
to]{.underline}]{.mark} deal best with the Kremlin's strategy and to
[[avoid any armed confrontation in eastern Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Military historian Rick Atkinson conceives the new order of battle in
Europe as very fluid. He points out, "in less than three months, [[the
strategic landscape has changed profoundly]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[**invigorating** a NATO military alliance that had seemed nearly
**moribund**]{.underline}]{.mark}, undermining if not neutering Russian
imperial ambitions, [[and **reasserting** American
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} in a robust coalition of like-minded
liberal democracies." (27)

Henry [[Kissinger]{.underline}]{.mark}, former U.S. secretary of state
and so-called 'master of grand strategy' said at a Financial Times forum
held in June 2022, "We are now living in a totally new era." He also
[[argued]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}
"obviously [[miscalculated]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's capabilities to
sustain a major enterprise --- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} when the time
comes for settlement ... [[we are **not** going back to the previous
relationship but to a position for Russia that will be
different]{.underline}]{.mark} because of this --- and not because we
demanded it but [[because they **produced** it]{.underline}]{.mark}."

in 2014. Including with military and financial aid. And training for
tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces. All of this is [[making a
difference on the battlefield every day]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} the invasion in
[[February]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Allies have stepped up even
more]{.underline}]{.mark}. With billions of euros' worth of military,
financial, and humanitarian assistance. At the Summit, we will agree a
strengthened Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine. This will
include substantial deliveries of support. In areas like secure
communications, anti-drone systems, and fuel. Over the longer term, we
will help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era military equipment, to
modern NATO equipment. And further strengthen its defence and security
institutions. At the Summit, we will also take decisions to continue
adapting NATO."

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[eight times increase in NATO
Response Force troops]{.underline}]{.mark} is due to the threat posed by
Russia, say the Alliance.

For clarity, the NATO Response Force is a highly ready and
technologically advanced multinational combat force made up of land,
air, maritime and Special Operations Forces components that the Alliance
can deploy quickly, wherever needed.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg gave a speech today ahead of a
meeting in Madrid amongst NATO allies set to adopt a new strategy for
the Alliance. The [[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} reportedly [[describes
Moscow as a **direct threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Stoltenberg said:

"Our NATO Summit in Madrid this week will be transformative. With many
important decisions. Including on a new Strategic Concept for a new
security reality. A fundamental shift in NATO's deterrence and defence.
And support to Ukraine now, and for the future.

Our new Concept will guide us in an era of strategic competition. I
expect it will make clear that Allies consider Russia as the most
significant and direct threat to our security. It will address China for
the first time. And the challenges that Beijing poses to our security,
interests, and values. It will also cover our evolving approach to a
number of other threats and challenges. Including terrorism, cyber, and
hybrid. At the Summit, we will strengthen our forward defences.

We will enhance our battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance up
to brigade-levels. We will transform the NATO Response Force. And
increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000.

We will also boost our ability to reinforce in crisis and
conflict.Including with:

> More pre-positioned equipment, and stockpiles of military supplies.
>
> More forward-deployed capabilities, like air defence.
>
> Strengthened command and control.
>
> And upgraded defence plans, with forces pre-assigned to defend
> specific Allies.
>
> These troops will exercise together with home defence forces.

And they will become familiar with local terrain, facilities, and our
new pre-positioned stocks. So that they can respond smoothly and swiftly
to any emergency. Together, this constitutes the biggest overhaul of our
collective deterrence and defence since the Cold War. And to do this, we
will need to invest more. Today, we are releasing new defence spending
figures. They show that [[2022 will be the eighth consecutive year of
increases across European Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and Canada. By the
end of the year, [[they will have invested well over 350
billion]{.underline}]{.mark} US dollars extra since we agreed our
defence investment pledge in 2014. [[Nine Allies now
reach]{.underline}]{.mark} -- or exceed -- the [[2%]{.underline}]{.mark}
target. [[Nineteen]{.underline}]{.mark} Allies have clear plans to
[[reach it by 2024]{.underline}]{.mark}. And an additional five have
concrete commitments to meet it thereafter. Two percent is increasingly
considered a floor, not a ceiling. We will also agree to invest more
together in NATO. For the benefit of our security.

### Turn -- Plan Helps Ukraine

#### NATO unity checks Ukraine escalation

Preventing and controlling escalation

[[What can NATO and the European Union do to prevent Russia from
escalating]{.underline}]{.mark} the conflict to unacceptable levels?
What follows are a few principles to guide NATO's assessment of
preventing and avoiding escalation.

Keep Ukraine in the fight. [[The first]{.underline}]{.mark}, and most
immediate, curative [[is to keep Ukraine in the
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. This means continued financial assistance,
shipments of lethal aid, and real-time intelligence sharing, as well as
humanitarian assistance and help with absorption and resettlement of
refugees. The United States and Europe have shown unity and concerted
action in responding swiftly to Russian aggression in Ukraine and this
must continue, even as Putin seeks to find and drive wedges between
transatlantic allies and partners. [[In this struggle, a **coherent
narrative**, shared and articulated in **common**, will be
critical]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In this regard, [[continuous references to the danger of escalation to
"World War III"]{.underline}]{.mark} and a steady drumbeat of measures
not to be taken can only serve to reassure Putin that he has a free hand
in Ukraine. A degree of strategic ambiguity and the possibility of US
and NATO intervention should he go too far can be helpful in moderating
Russian excesses and controlling escalation. An "all measures on the
table" approach will force Russian planners to consider, and prepare
for, multiple response scenarios, complicating resource allocation and
inducing uncertainty. While deterrence is more art than science,
signaling to one's opponent that one is too frightened to engage [[is
more likely to encourage than to deter]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The most effective way to prevent spillover onto NATO territory and
other forms of future Russian aggression is to help defeat Russian
forces in the field inside Ukraine. Supplying Ukraine with food, fuel,
spare parts, and modern equipment is the best way to do that, while
still avoiding direct intervention by NATO. This means combat aircraft,
main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled and rocket
artillery, mobile air defense, secure radios, unmanned aerial vehicles,
target-acquisition radars, spare parts, and ammunition, including
precision-guided munitions. Many of these combat systems exist in
storage in great numbers in the United States and in Europe. The
Ukrainian military has shown remarkable versatility in adapting to
unfamiliar systems such as the Javelin and Stinger, but exportable
training packages, and even training sites in Europe for selected
specialists, also warrant consideration.

#### Only resilience and persistence can check Putin in Ukraine

Use [[economic tools as a primary "offensive"
weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the military campaign progresses,
sanctions [[will continue to strangle the Russian
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. This pressure must continue---and, if
possible, intensify---[[in order to force Russia]{.underline}]{.mark},
not just to the negotiating table, but [[to withdraw altogether from
Ukrainian territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. To date, not all Russian banks
have been banned from SWIFT, and many oligarchs remain unsanctioned.
Though painful and difficult, weaning Europe from Russian energy,
divesting from Russian businesses, and closing European markets are
powerful weapons the EU can wield in its own right. (While 37 percent of
Russian trade is with Europe, only 4 percent of the EU's goods exports
go to Russia.) Today, Russian energy remains exempt from EU sanctions.
Developing alternate sources of energy, in particular, will take time
and investment, but continued reliance on Russian oil and natural gas
can only enable Putin to continue to finance the war in Ukraine.

In March 2022, the EU imposed its fourth tranche of trade sanctions on
Russia, tightening export restrictions on dual-use technologies,
expanding the list of sanctioned persons related to defense industries;
imposing further trade restrictions for steel, iron, and luxury goods;
and prohibiting transactions with specific state-owned enterprises.
[[The challenge now will be to maintain the full range of sanctions
until they bear fruit. Global food shortages, rising energy prices, and
scarcities]{.underline}]{.mark} among certain commodities [[will
challenge the sanctions regime. Much depends on the]{.underline}]{.mark}
persistence and [[**resolve** of Western leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Properly understood, [[comprehensive economic sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}---what the French finance minister has
called "total economic and financial war on Russia"---[[can be a
**major** tool, denying Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} the financial
[[resources to carry on the war and generating internal
pressures]{.underline}]{.mark} on elites [[that could lead to his
**removal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By themselves, however, they will
probably not end the war. China, Brazil, and India remain open markets
and suppliers, if not active supporters, while Hungary and Serbia retain
close ties. As former Deputy National Security Adviser General Rick
Waddell has pointed out to the author, "An economy that is
self-sufficient in energy and food takes a lot of killing." In concert
with diplomacy, aggressive information operations, and the military
instrument of power, sanctions can be a vital component of an overall
strategy to control and limit escalation and drive conflict termination
by draining Russia of the financial resources it needs to carry on the
war.

#### Only solidification solves Ukraine and avoids Russian expansionism

Maintain unity on the diplomatic front. In the midst of aggressive
warfare, [[diplomacy may not capture the headlines]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}, it must remain in play, above all because
[[political objectives]{.underline}]{.mark} in the end must
[[govern]{.underline}]{.mark} what happens on [[the
battlefield]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here there are minefields.
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the EU [[may be tempted to intervene in
negotiations and offer]{.underline}]{.mark} solutions[[---"**off
ramps**"]{.underline}]{.mark} is au courant---[[to more quickly achieve
a cessation of hostilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. These could take the
form of sanctions relief and acknowledgement of Russian sovereignty over
parts of Ukraine in exchange for "peace." [[This would be a **fatal
error**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Practitioners of realpolitik may minimize Zelenskyy's emphasis on shared
values and the ongoing contest between democracy and autocracy, but his
citizenry and millions in Europe and the United States won't. Despite
the leverage the West has over Ukraine as its storehouse and
quartermaster, [[the Ukrainian people will decide "how this
ends]{.underline}]{.mark}." The political endgame---the definition of
"victory"---must reflect outcomes they deem worthy of the enormous
sacrifices they have made. The trap here is that [[Putin will not give
up his aspirations if allowed to keep some of his
gains]{.underline}]{.mark}, restore his finances, rebuild his forces,
and try again.

The West has an opportunity to rule out that future altogether. [[That
outcome rests on continued pressure, assistance to Ukraine, a **resolute
and united front**, and the willingness to confront Russia decisively
should Putin expand the conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Western diplomacy
must be based on more than "stopping the fighting." [[The United States
and its allies must **see through** and beyond the endgame to a stable
and lasting peace. That means the **comprehensive de**feat of the
Russian military in Ukraine, **before** the conflict metastasizes
further and spreads into Europe and beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Throughout, [[diplomacy should leverage the strong, worldwide opposition
to Russian aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}---as expressed in the UN
General Assembly's overwhelming vote of March 2---[[in all international
forums]{.underline}]{.mark}. Traditional neutrals such as Sweden,
Finland, and Austria have joined in strongly condemning Putin's actions
and have a growing voice. [[**Building and sustaining this coalition**
should remain a **top diplomatic priority**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Conclusion

The Russian invasion of [[Ukraine is the **most dangerous**
event]{.underline}]{.mark} to occur [[in Europe
since]{.underline}]{.mark} the end of [[the Second World
War]{.underline}]{.mark}. In [[its potential for enormous
casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}, destruction on an epic scale, [[and
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} to unthinkable extremes, it
[[demands]{.underline}]{.mark} the attention and [[considered action of
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, the European Union, and the whole world. No
one can see clearly exactly how the crisis will play out. This "strange
voyage," in Winston Churchill's words, is a journey into the unknown, as
all wars are. [[The **best** the West can do is
prepare]{.underline}]{.mark} for the worst, keep its nerve, [[and employ
all its resources]{.underline}]{.mark} when its vital interests and most
cherished values are attacked. Things are very close to that stage
now[**. [At stake]{.mark}** [is an **international order** founded on
something other than brute force, imperial ambition, and autocratic
self-help. A Russian victory in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, even at
great cost, [[places a vengeful Putin on Europe's
**doorstep**]{.underline}]{.mark}, his ambitions partially achieved but
still unrealized. [[The **next blow** will fall on **NATO's eastern
flank**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now is the time to ensure that never
happens.

**Decline ensures [transition wars]{.underline}, not peaceful
multilateralism\-\--the US could launch a [pre-emptive
attack]{.underline} or [China]{.underline} could strike first**

Underlying these arguments for an inevitable war between the two
superpowers is PTT. PTT originally formulated by Organski (1958) posits
that [[**war is likely** when the power of the]{.mark} dominant state in
the international system (i.e. [hegemon]{.mark}) [is **declining**
and]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} dissatisfied rising [challenger]{.mark}
**substantially [reduces the power gap]{.mark} between the hegemon and
itself**.]{.underline} Unlike balance of power theory, PTT argues that
the war is most likely when there is near power parity between a
dominant state and a rising and dissatisfied challenger (Organski and
Kugler, 1980, pp. 19-20)\[5\]. [[A rising power]{.mark} here is
generally dissatisfied with the existing international order and
**[initiates war against a declining hegemon]{.mark} in order [to impose
orders]{.mark} that are [more favorable]{.mark} to itself**]{.underline}
(Organski 1958, pp. 364-367). Layne (2018, p. 110) put these power
transition dynamics quite succinctly as follows: "Over time, however,
the relative power of states changes, and eventually the international
order no longer reflects the actual distribution of power between or
among the leading Great Powers. When that happens, [the legitimacy of
the prevailing order is called into question, and it will be challenged
by the rising power]{.underline}(s)." And [[when the balance of power
between a dominant state and a rising challenger changes sufficiently, a
new order replaces]{.mark} an old one]{.underline} typically
**[[by]{.mark} a [hegemonic war]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2018, p. 104).
[[Paying]{.mark} close [attention to the **growing Sino--US
competition** over hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline} in the twenty-first
century, therefore, Shirk (2007, p. 4), China specialist, argues that
["[History teaches us]{.mark} that [rising powers are likely to provoke
war]{.mark}."]{.underline} On the other hand, scholars like Gilpin
(1981) contend that the [power [transition war]{.mark} between great
powers is [likely to occur when a hegemonic state]{.mark}]{.underline}
whose power is declining due to imperial overstretch\[6\] [[views
"**preventive war as the most attractive means of eliminating the
threat**]{.mark} posed by challengers"]{.underline} (Ned Lebow and
Valentino, 2009, p. 391), although they do acknowledge that there might
be some "ways to prolong the period of its power preponderance vis-à-vis
the rising challenger, so that the rapidly rising power will not dare to
challenge the hegemonic leadership" (Kim and Gates, 2015, p. 221). In
this case, the initiator of war is a declining hegemon, rather than a
rising challenger. [[The declining hegemon]{.mark} who fears a rising
challenger's overtaking its power in the near future **[sees war as a
better option]{.mark}** than other options of maintaining its hegemony
such as reducing its commitments abroad and appeasing a rising
challenger.]{.underline}

If NATO intervenes, do it decisively. [[Several European
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Poland, Denmark, and Belgium,
[[are considering]{.underline}]{.mark} [[some form of "peacekeeping"
intervention in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, while [[calls for a no-fly
zone are mounting]{.underline}]{.mark} as the civilian death toll rises.
This suggests [[a critical mass of support may be
forming]{.underline}]{.mark} for outside intervention under certain
circumstances. Strong material and financial aid may enable Ukraine to
hold on, and even advance to retake occupied territory, but Russia
remains a far larger and stronger opponent. [[If the logic that it is
better to defeat Putin in Ukraine than on NATO territory is sound,
intervention to prevent the fall of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} or its
dismemberment [[must be considered]{.underline}]{.mark}. The prospect of
[[actual genocide of Ukrainian civilians, or use of weapons of mass
destruction, might also trigger NATO intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Ukraine Impact -- Asia Pivot

#### Weakening Russia in Ukraine enables Asia Pivot

Another difference is that this is the first conflict involving
quasi-alliances. NATO and the EU are not participants in the war, but
they're clearly involved and not neutral. Russia has a series of
partnerships--- the cooperative treaty organization and its strategic
partnership with China---which are also in play.

One of the questions this war raises is: what does the war's outcome
mean for the U.S. pivot toward Asia? And I think that raises two other
questions. One is: how diminished will Russia be at the end?
[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} Barack [[Obama, the U.S. has been trying to
pivot towards Asia because China is clearly the larger and more
significant long-term competitor. But]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir
[[Putin is]{.underline}]{.mark} sticking around Eastern Europe and
[[kicking the Western order in the shins. That has made it very
difficult to pivot towards Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the other hand,
[[if this war ends with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} being a
[[crippled]{.underline}]{.mark} power, then, in that sense, [[pivoting
towards Asia is going to be **much**]{.mark} were
[easier]{.mark}]{.underline} if what one is dealing with in Europe is a
very weakened Vladimir Putin with a decrepit military that can't
reconstitute itself.

### Ukraine Impact - Food

#### Ukraine puts food security on brink

[[Poorer countries are currently facing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
prospect of [[a major food crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. While much
attention has been paid to [[the Russian blockade of Ukrainian
ports]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[disrupts
supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if the ports become operational
again the problem will remain. First, rising energy prices are already
translating to higher transportation costs of basic goods, driving up
the prices of basic foodstuffs. Second, [[Ukraine and Russia are major
exporters]{.underline}]{.mark} of basic foodstuffs---together they
supply almost 29% of the world's exports of wheat brands, 20% of corn,
and 80% of sunflower oil. While the Western economies have enough
margins to address these rising prices, the situation in the poorer
corners of the world is different---as indicated by the Economist front
page showing human skulls in a sheaf of grain. According to David
Beasley, the executive director of the [[UN World
Food]{.underline}]{.mark} Programme, [[50%]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
wheat supplied by the organization [[was coming from
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia is also a prime exporter of
indispensable ingredients in fertilizers---potash and phosphate. When
Ukrainian farmers are preoccupied with defending their land in the
beginning of the seeding season, and when Russian farmers cannot be paid
due to the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system, [[rising food
prices threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} to bring [[more
instability]{.underline}]{.mark} into already unstable countries. Just a
few weeks into the conflict and the spiraling prices of food and other
basic commodities ignited protests and rallies in Iraq and Morocco.
According to the Financial Times, "a jump in grain prices in 2009-10 is
regarded as one of the triggers of the Arab Spring in the Middle East."
The looming global food crisis threatens to have yet more destructive
consequences, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[conflicts
and]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[refugees]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Many in the West have praised the decisiveness of the EU's effort to
protect Ukrainian refugees escaping the war. While the unprecedented
deal---that grants Ukrainians instant rights to live and work within the
EU---is more than welcome in itself, many human rights groups and
organizations have been clamoring that it demonstrates the EU's "double
standards" in comparison to the 2015 refugee crisis. "The Ukraine
refugee crisis," argues the Global Detention Project (GDP), a
Geneva-based nonprofit organization, "presents Europe with . . . a
critical moment of reflection: Can the peoples of Europe overcome their
widespread racism and animosity and embrace the universalist spirit of
the 1951 Refugee Conventions?" This question might become pivotal once
food shortages start to affect societies [[in the Middle East and North
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. This may expose not only the West's moral
bias but also systemic weaknesses of contemporary institutions that have
shaped globalization processes during the last decades, such as
migration regimes.

### Ukraine Impact - Economy

#### Ukraine war risks global supply chain collapse

Western societies and economies will have to address these urgent
sociopolitical challenges, which may arrive in tandem with other threats
to the global order. The disruption caused by the war to the global
economic model led Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock and one
of the world's leading hedge fund investors, to write that "the Russian
invasion of Ukraine has put an end to the globalization we have
experienced over the last three decades." Fink is worried about two
further expected shockwaves. First, [[the globalized economy is amidst a
supply chain crisis, which the war in Ukraine is aggravating
further]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since the start of the coronavirus
pandemic, shippers have tried to bypass the uncertainty of fraught
container shipping by turning to rail transport as an alternative route
for the Asia--Europe trade. Rail operators ran more than 1,200 freight
trains per month between China and Europe, transiting through Russia,
Ukraine, and Belarus, and transporting almost 1.5 million containers.
The disruption caused by the [[blocking of land routes may result
in]{.underline}]{.mark} more permanent and painful [[retreat by
manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark} from reliance on global supply
chains. Second, [[the war in Ukraine may also disrupt technological
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, much of the world's
[[neon]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is crucial [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
the production of [[computer chips, originates in
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} 50% of this [[is
purified in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[interruption to supply
chains]{.underline}]{.mark} and possible deficit of microchips
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} daunting scenarios [[for global economic
development]{.underline}]{.mark}. But they may also come as a natural
and much needed trend to cool down a radically decentralized,
overcomplicated, and hence venerable global system of trade.

#### Decline [cascades]{.underline} -- nuclear war.

[[Economic stressors]{.underline}]{.mark}, in transcendent VUCA fashion,
[may]{.underline} also [[induce]{.mark} **radical [geopolitical
realignments]{.mark}**. Bullions now carry more weight than NATO's
**security guarantees** in **Eastern Europe**]{.underline}. After Poland
repatriated 100 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2019, Slovakia,
Serbia and Hungary quickly followed suit.

According to former Slovak Premier Robert Fico, [this **erosion** in
**regional trust** was based on historical precedents]{.underline} -- in
particular the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded Czechoslovakia's
Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. As Fico reiterated (Dudik & Tomek, 2019):

> "You can hardly trust even the closest allies after the Munich
> Agreement... I guarantee that if something happens, we won't see a
> single gram of this (offshore-held) gold. Let's do it (repatriation)
> as quickly as possible." (Parenthesis added by author).

President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia (a non-NATO nation) justified his
central bank's gold-repatriation program by hinting at economic
headwinds ahead: "We see in which direction the crisis in the world is
moving" (Dudik & Tomek, 2019). Indeed, [[with]{.mark} two global
Titanics -- the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and China]{.underline}]{.mark} --
set [on a **collision course**]{.underline} with a
quadrillions-denominated iceberg in the middle, and a viral outbreak on
its tip, [the **seismic [ripples]{.mark}** [will be felt]{.mark}
**far**, **wide** and for a **considerable period**]{.underline}.

A reality check is nonetheless needed here: Can additional bullions
realistically circumvallate the economies of 80 million plus peoples in
these Eastern European nations, worth a collective \$1.8 trillion by
purchasing power parity? Gold however is a potent psychological symbol
as it represents national sovereignty and economic reassurance in a
potentially hyperinflationary world. The portents are clear: The current
global economic system will be weakened by rising nationalism and
autarkic demands. Much uncertainty remains ahead. Mauldin (2018)
proposes the introduction of Old Testament-style debt jubilees to
facilitate gradual national recoveries. The World Economic Forum, on the
other hand, has long proposed a "Great Reset" by 2030; a socialist
utopia where "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy" (WEF, 2016).

In the final analysis, COVID-19 is not the root cause of the current
global economic turmoil; it is merely an accelerant to a burning house
of cards that was left smouldering since the 2008 Great Recession
(Maavak, 2020a). We also see how the four main pillars of systems
thinking (diversity, interconnectivity, interactivity and "adaptivity")
form the mise en scene in a VUCA decade.

ENVIRONMENTAL

[What happens to the **environment** when our **economies implode**?
[Think of]{.mark} a [**debt-laden** workforce at]{.mark} sensitive
[**nuclear** and **chemical plants**]{.mark}, along [with a]{.mark}
concomitant [**surge** in]{.mark} **industrial [accidents]{.mark}**?
**Economic stressors**]{.underline}, workforce demoralization and
rampant profiteering -- rather than manmade climate change -- arguably
[pose the **biggest threats** to the environment]{.underline}. In a WEF
report, Buehler et al (2017) made the following pre-COVID-19
observation:

> The ILO estimates that the annual cost to the global economy from
> accidents and work-related diseases alone is a staggering \$3
> trillion. Moreover, a recent report suggests the world's 3.2 billion
> workers are increasingly unwell, with the vast majority facing
> significant economic insecurity: 77% work in part-time, temporary,
> "vulnerable" or unpaid jobs.

Shouldn't this phenomenon be better categorized as a societal or
economic risk rather than an environmental one? In line with the systems
thinking approach, however, [global risks can no longer be boxed into a
**taxonomical silo**]{.underline}. Frazzled workforces may precipitate
another Bhopal (1984), Chernobyl (1986), Deepwater Horizon (2010) or
Flint water crisis (2014). These disasters were notably not the result
of manmade climate change. Neither was the Fukushima nuclear disaster
(2011) nor the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004). Indeed, the combustion of a
long-overlooked cargo of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had nearly
levelled the city of Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug 4 2020. The explosion left
204 dead; 7,500 injured; US\$15 billion in property damages; and an
estimated 300,000 people homeless (Urbina, 2020). The environmental
costs have yet to be adequately tabulated.

Environmental disasters are more attributable to Black Swan events,
systems breakdowns and corporate greed rather than to mundane human
activity.

[Our JIT world aggravates the **cascading potential** of
risks]{.underline} (Korowicz, 2012). [Production and delivery
delays]{.underline}, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, [will eventually
require industrial **overcompensation**]{.underline}. This will further
stress senior executives, workers, machines and a variety of
computerized systems. The trickle-down effects will likely include
substandard products, contaminated food and a general lowering in health
and safety standards (Maavak, 2019a). Unpaid or demoralized sanitation
workers may also resort to indiscriminate waste dumping. Many cities
across the United States (and elsewhere in the world) are no longer
recycling wastes due to prohibitive costs in the global corona-economy
(Liacko, 2021).

Even in good times, strict protocols on waste disposals were routinely
ignored. While Sweden championed the global climate change narrative,
its clothing flagship H&M was busy covering up toxic effluences
disgorged by vendors along the Citarum River in Java, Indonesia. As a
result, countless children among 14 million Indonesians straddling the
"world's most polluted river" began to suffer from dermatitis,
intestinal problems, developmental disorders, renal failure, chronic
bronchitis and cancer (DW, 2020). It is also in cauldrons like the
Citarum River where pathogens may mutate with emergent ramifications.

On an equally alarming note, depressed economic conditions have
traditionally provided a waste disposal boon for organized crime
elements. Throughout 1980s, the Calabriabased 'Ndrangheta mafia -- in
collusion with governments in Europe and North America -- began to dump
radioactive wastes along the coast of Somalia. Reeling from pollution
and revenue loss, Somali fisherman eventually resorted to mass piracy
(Knaup, 2008).

The coast of Somalia is now a maritime hotspot, and exemplifies an
entwined form of economic-environmental-geopolitical-societal emergence.
In a VUCA world, indiscriminate waste dumping can unexpectedly morph
into a Black Hawk Down incident. The laws of unintended consequences are
governed by actors, interconnections, interactions and adaptations in a
system under study -- as outlined in the methodology section.

Environmentally-devastating industrial sabotages -- whether by
disgruntled workers, industrial competitors, ideological maniacs or
terrorist groups -- cannot be discounted in a VUCA world. Immiserated
societies, in stark defiance of climate change diktats, may resort to
dirty coal plants and wood stoves for survival. [Interlinked
ecosystems]{.underline}, particularly water resources, [may be
**hijacked**]{.underline} by nationalist sentiments. [The
**environmental fallouts**]{.underline} of critical infrastructure (CI)
breakdowns [loom like a **Sword of Damocles** over this
decade]{.underline}.

GEOPOLITICAL

[The **primary [catalyst]{.mark}** [behind **WWII** was]{.mark} the
**Great [Depression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since [[history]{.mark}
often **[repeats itself]{.mark}**, expect **familiar bogeymen** to
**reappear**]{.underline} [in societies roiling with
**impoverishment**]{.underline} and ideological clefts.
[[Anti-Semitism]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a societal risk on its own --
[[may]{.mark} reach alarming proportions]{.underline} in the West
(Reuters, 2019), [possibly **[forc]{.mark}**ing [Israel]{.mark} to
undertake **[reprisal]{.mark} operations**]{.underline} inside allied
nations. If that happens, [how will **affected nations**
react?]{.underline} Will security resources be reallocated to protect
certain minorities (or the Top 1%) while larger segments of society are
exposed to restive forces? **[[Balloon effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**
like these [present a classic]{.underline} VUCA
[problematic]{.underline}.

[Contemporary geopolitical risks [include]{.mark} a possible
**[Iran]{.mark}-Israel [war]{.mark}**[; **US-China**]{.mark} **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** [over **Taiwan** or]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea; **North [Korean
prolif]{.mark}eration** of **nuclear** and **missile technologies**; an
**[India-Pak]{.mark}istan [nuclear war]{.mark}**; an **Iranian closure**
of the Straits of **Hormuz**; **fundamentalist-driven implosion in the
Islamic world**; [or]{.mark} a [**nuclear confrontation** between
**NATO** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fears that the Jan 3 2020
assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani might lead to WWIII
were grossly overblown. From a systems perspective, the killing of
Soleimani did not fundamentally change the
actor-interconnection-interaction adaptivity equation in the Middle
East. Soleimani was simply a cog who got replaced.

### Ukraine Impact - Democracy

#### Russia losing in Ukraine -- will take down the authoritarian model

I want to add just one thing, which is that, [[if this war goes
on]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it looks like it will, [[Russia's economy
could start to collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} for lack of spare parts.
The demonstration value of that collapse might be that, in two or three
years, people will look back and say: this was a war that was won by the
sanctions --an unprecedented event.

Granted, there was a period in between the World Wars where trade
embargoes were strong, but trade in intermediate goods, and financial
markets make economies more interlinked now, and more vulnerable. We're
in a world where the hundred designers of chip manufacturing facilities
in Taiwan are critical to global supply chains. Russia is no longer the
simple command economy that the neo-Stalinists want to make great again.
Its consumers use imported smartphones and cars, full of chips. Its
military is also dependent on imported parts and components.

[[People are going to]{.underline}]{.mark} look back and
[[say]{.underline}]{.mark}: Wow, the [[authoritarians really killed that
place]{.underline}]{.mark}, didn't they? [[It was an economy with
remarkable human capital and now it's a dinosaur]{.underline}]{.mark},
like North Korea. I think [[that's going to make
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} reconsider not just their economic
models, but also the [[models of authoritarian regimes, because of the
effect on human capital]{.underline}]{.mark}. Refugees from Russia who
you see now everywhere, not just in Europe, but also in Israel, are
highly educated, angry, and disappointed people whose lives fell apart.
Just like that. They thought that they could deal with the regime but
now that hope is gone. They're very, very talented people. [[The
demonstration value of this authoritarian debacle may end up being the
most important part]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Ukraine outcome controls trajectory of global democracy

Policy Research Institute. He is a former Paramilitary Case Officer who
had a 31-year career in the Directorate of Operations of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

\"The Evolving Political-Military Aims in the War in Ukraine After 100
Days,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

[[Both nations]{.underline}]{.mark} have suffered severe losses and
[[need to regenerate military strength. The winner will be the one who
is **quickest** to reconstitute]{.underline}]{.mark} its combat forces
at the tactical level and whose leader best motivates his country to
fight and manages to enlarge and equip his armed forces, and the
logistics to sustain those forces, at the strategic level.

Twenty-first century Russia is using twentieth-century weapons to fight
a nineteenth-century war of attrition, combined with eighteenth-century
pillaging. Currently, Russia's numerical advantage in Donbas allows it
to grind out a slow advance toward a pointless objective. Even if
Russian forces advance to the administrative borders of both oblasts, it
will not end the war as long as Ukraine still has the will to fight and
the means to do so. If Putin plans to declare victory once his army has
cleared Ukraine out of Donbas, he is building on sand. Unlike Georgia or
Moldova, Ukraine has the resources and international support to refuse
to accept a "frozen conflict." Instead, the incoming tide of a rebuilt
and expanded Ukrainian army will eventually wash those gains away---be
it months or years from now.

For a short-lived propaganda victory in Donbas, Putin is destroying the
Russian army. If that army revolts in self-defense or collapses under
Ukrainian counterattacks, Putin will face the same fate as other Russian
rulers who have lost wars. Can the gap between Russian war aims and
military capabilities be closed with nuclear weapons? In theory,
possibly---but in practice, such an outcome is unlikely. There is no
silver bullet to overturn poor strategy, leadership, tactics, and
logistics and a lack of will in the face of a motivated opponent.

Despite the prediction two decades ago by political scientist Samuel
Huntington that future conflicts would be clashes between different
cultural civilizations, we are seeing a clash within a cultural
civilization---Orthodox civilization---whose cultural boundaries have
been formed by its Eastern Orthodox confession, Byzantine heritage, and
Slavic ancestry and languages.\[33\] This war between the world's two
largest Orthodox states is about more than Ukraine's ability to join
NATO or the European Union. [[It's]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a fight
between two ideas of how people should be governed]{.underline}]{.mark}.
One side believes it should be by the decree of the powerful and the
other by the consent of the governed. One believes it is entitled to a
sphere of influence; the other believes it is entitled to chart its own
political future.

[[A Russian victory in this conflict could serve as a template or
inspiration for other revisionist or ideological powers. A Ukrainian
victory would do the same for those societies struggling with the
challenges of democracy. On the broadest of scales, that is what this
war is about]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Nuclear Deterrence Turn

#### NATO credibility is vital to effective nuclear deterrence

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Take an unambiguous stance on nuclear policy. [[To relieve the threat of
a Russian first-use nuclear strike]{.underline}]{.mark} and regain
freedom of action, the United States and [[NATO must return to core
deterrence principles]{.underline}]{.mark}. As it has for many decades,
nuclear [[deterrence rests on **both** capability **and** credibility.
NATO nuclear forces]{.underline}]{.mark}, though much reduced since the
Cold War (especially with respect to theater nuclear systems) [[are
redundant, survivable, and absolutely capable]{.underline}]{.mark} of
destroying Russia from end to end. [[NATO's
credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[is **constantly
undermined** when leaders publicly express palpable **fears** that Putin
will employ his nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}, for unclear
reasons and in unclear ways, and that they must at all costs avoid
pushing him into a corner. [[A resolve **not to be bullied** is
essential. Deterrence works best when leaders are direct, unambiguous,
resolute, and calm]{.underline}]{.mark}, as John Kennedy was during the
Cuban Missile Crisis. As President Emmanuel Macron reminded his public
recently, [[the West has nuclear weapons, too]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Resolve Turn

#### Only firm resolve deters Putin -- reasoning like the DA guts deterrence

Bolster forward presence. As a hedge against further Russian aggression
and to reassure allies, the US deployed two additional heavy brigades to
Poland in February and early March, along with an airborne brigade,
bringing the US rotational "heel-to-toe" brigade there to divisional
strength. US divisional and corps-level headquarters were also sent. The
US 2nd Cavalry Regiment based in Germany (actually a Stryker brigade)
was relocated to Romania at the same time. Additional air units and
ground troops from a number of allies have also been deployed to NATO's
eastern flank, while the forty-thousand-soldier NATO Response Force
(NRF) has been alerted for the first time in its history.

[[Putin's rhetoric and aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark} disinformation
and [[subversion]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts [[have, for years,
targeted the Baltic States]{.underline}]{.mark}, which stand between
Kaliningrad and contiguous Russia and extend almost to the suburbs of
St. Petersburg. [[To forestall future aggression and cement firm
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, these forces should remain in eastern
Europe at least for the near term (i.e., 3--5 years).
[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} the campaign in [[Ukraine unfolds, Putin
should understand clearly that NATO is **postured** to respond
**strongly** to further escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. For many years,
[[policymakers have argued strenuously against]{.underline}]{.mark}
providing the Baltic States, and NATO's eastern flank in general, with
an [[adequate defense for fear of "**provoking**"
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and to "maintain Alliance unity." [[Measures
to build up Ukraine's defensive capacity were resisted for the **same
reasons**]{.underline}]{.mark}; the Barack Obama administration opposed
lethal aid, even after the invasions of Crimea and the Donbas, while the
Donald Trump administration provided only a trickle. [[The invasion of
Ukraine has demonstrated the **pitfalls** of this
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}. Putin's threats were intended to keep his
neighbors weak, but recent events have proven that it is the perception
of weakness, not strength, that provokes him most. Accordingly, [[a firm
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} from the borders of Finnmark to the Black
Sea [[can prevent spillover or regional escalation, communicate resolve,
and reassure]{.mark}]{.underline} host-nation publics [[that the
conflict in Ukraine will not land on their
doorstep]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is under way with the recent
announcement that NATO battlegroups will be posted in Romania, Bulgaria,
Hungary, and Slovakia. Meanwhile, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK),
Denmark, and others have also pledged to increase their forces in the
Baltic States.

To further strengthen deterrence and head off escalation, NATO should
thoughtfully consider how best to help the Baltic States help
themselves. Though proud members of the 2-percent club, their small
economies prevent them from acquiring the air defense and heavy forces
they need to deter future Russian aggression. Estonia and Latvia field
only a single light brigade each, while Lithuania fields a mechanized
brigade with no tanks and a motorized brigade. Using security-assistance
funds (such as the European Deterrence Initiative), the United States
and NATO could equip existing Baltic formations with modern tanks,
self-propelled artillery, and air defense from reserve stocks, along
with the training, spare parts, and ammunition needed to make them
viable. [[The Alliance should also strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark} the
enhanced Forward Presence ([[eFP]{.underline}]{.mark}) formations [[in
the Baltic States]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg has suggested. These forces are too small to pose a credible
offensive threat, but can defend long enough for other NATO forces, such
as the NRF and US armored units in Poland, to move up to assist.

### No Ukraine Escalation

#### Treat Ukraine escalation risk as low -- threat fears are self fulfilling

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

In this regard, [[continuous references to the danger of escalation to
"World War III" and a steady drumbeat of measures not to be taken can
only serve to reassure Putin that he has a free hand in
Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} A degree of strategic ambiguity and the
possibility of US and NATO intervention should he go too far can be
helpful in moderating Russian excesses and controlling escalation. [[An
"all measures on the table" approach will force Russian planners
to]{.underline}]{.mark} consider, and [[prepare
for]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[multiple response scenarios, complicating
resource allocation and inducing uncertainty. While deterrence is more

#### No nuclear escalation from Ukraine -- Russia can't find a use that helps its position -- but spurs prolif

There's a third question: what does this mean for nuclear proliferation?
There's been an implicit bargain [[since the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark} that a lot of state[[s agree not to acquire
nuclear weapons in exchange for nuclear states agreeing not to use them
against non-nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} states. And [[this was
a]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[specific part of the Budapest
Memo]{.underline}]{.mark}randum [[with Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Russia has breached that]{.underline}]{.mark} agreement
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly [[threatening to use nuclear
weapons, which could be an argument for other states to want to acquire
nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the other hand, [[Russia has
not used these nuclear weapons likely because it can't figure out an
advantageous way to do so]{.underline}]{.mark}. So I can see the war
either incentivizing proliferation because states look at this and say,
"The only way not to be threatened by nuclear weapons is to have them
ourselves," or I could see states saying, "Here we have a country that
has repeatedly made nuclear weapons central to its National Security
Strategy, has the world's largest nuclear arsenal, and what do they get
from for it? Almost nothing."

### Hardline Good Turn

#### Concessions to Putin fail

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

In short, while these more extreme escalatory options deserve
consideration, most would leave Russia in even worse shape and at
greater risk. Russian elites almost certainly see this. The more
moderate and sensible approach---[[to **withdraw** to pre-war
boundaries, offer concessions to Ukraine and the West, and open Russia
to economic integration and improved relations with the international
community---is highly improbable as long as Putin remains in
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. The most probable outcome is that [[Putin
will **continue to escalate** until he is defeated outright, removed
from power, or offered concessions he can accept as
victory]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Baltics Turn

#### Russia consolidation leads to Baltic escalation

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

The fourth rung

Consolidating gains. [[Six months into the campaign, Russia will face
one of two outcomes. The first is gradual progress]{.underline}]{.mark}
through a combination of mounting Ukrainian losses---both military and
civilian---that lead to the loss of major urban centers and major
groupings of regular forces. [[Shortages]{.underline}]{.mark} of food,
fuel, spare parts, and precision-guided munitions---as well as attrition
of major combat systems, such as combat aircraft, main battle tanks,
high-altitude air-defense weapons, and self-propelled
artillery---[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}, in time, [[wear down Ukraine's
defense if not quickly replaced by friendly states]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Grinding attrition]{.underline}]{.mark} and catastrophic destruction
of industry, agricultural areas, and infrastructure
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[force the Ukrainian government to
accept a diplomatic settlement]{.underline}]{.mark} that will allow
Putin to claim victory. Such a settlement could include Ukrainian
acceptance of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, and
perhaps Kharkiv and Mariupol, as well as a pledge of permanent
neutrality. Putin would also insist on easing of international sanctions
as a precondition for a ceasefire. Despite serious losses and tactical
defeats, it is too early to count Russia out.

[[In this case, Putin is likely to consolidate his
gains]{.underline}]{.mark}, rebuild and improve his forces, stabilize
his internal domestic politics and economy, and attempt to reestablish
working relationships with Europe---above all, with Germany. [[Even
costly success in Ukraine will not]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[satisfy Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}. The invasion of Ukraine should be
seen as another step in an historic process that includes military
aggression in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea, and the Donbas, as well as the
deployment of Russian troops in frozen conflicts in Armenia and Moldova.
[[Further aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} in areas formerly belonging to
the Russian empire---above all, [[the Baltic
States]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[is **highly likely** following a period
of reorganization and recovery]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Avoiding a stalemate or defeat through extreme escalation. [[The second
outcome is a prolonged stalemate or outright
defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this scenario, after staggering losses
and a scorched-earth campaign throughout Ukraine, Russian forces remain
stalled. Ukrainian regular forces have suffered high losses but remain
largely intact with high morale, while territorial defense forces
continue to fight effectively. Ukrainian performance is actually
improving with combat experience, as well as growing confidence and
elan. Western material and financial support remains strong.

Internally, [[domestic unrest in Russia will become a serious threat to
Putin's regime]{.underline}]{.mark}, as crushing economic hardships
mount and Russian losses and lack of military success become more widely
known. [[Russian oligarchs]{.underline}]{.mark} facing financial
ruin---as well as government, intelligence, and military elites who fear
Putin's wrath and state collapse---[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} act to
[[remove Putin from power]{.underline}]{.mark}. Pressure to resolve the
conflict and reassert control may become overwhelming.

### Prolif Turn

The opportunities and challenges of dual-use technologies

[[Dual-use technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, capabilities, concepts,
and products are ubiquitous, as just about any civilian technology can
have a military application. Examples include GPS, vehicle and aircraft
sensors, safety equipment, weapons components, and weapons themselves.

As technology has advanced, the possibility for additional dual-use
capabilities or new applications of existing capabilities has increased,
which [[creates both opportunities and risks. The proliferation
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of dual-use technology depends on the strength
of export control and treaty regimes, which [[requires
**cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark} between allies and adversaries
alike.

Looking ahead, the rapid pace of technological advancement means
organizations such as [[NATO must demonstrate flexibility and agility
in]{.underline}]{.mark} monitoring and [[understanding technological
advancements to determine when or whether innovation can **further**
Alliance aims or contribute to security
**concerns**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how allies can promote peaceful
and responsible uses of emerging technologies.

The Alliance has already demonstrated its commitment to cooperation over
emerging technologies by introducing the Defence Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic (DIANA) and establishing a NATO Innovation Fund
in 2021.

[[By addressing dual-use, emerging technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the Strategic Concept, [[NATO can demonstrate that it
recognizes]{.underline}]{.mark}---and prioritizes---the [[significant
opportunities and challenges posed by these
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Inclusion in the Strategic Concept
will also promote enduring support for ongoing efforts and could spur
new initiatives to consider the implications of emerging and possibly
disruptive technologies in the future security environment. All of
[[these efforts contribute to NATO's role in deterring illegitimate
pursuits of emerging technologies, while ensuring allies remain at the
cutting ed]{.underline}]{.mark}ge of technological capabilities for
their collective defense.

### Climate Turn

#### Aff NATO cooperation is critical to climate mitigation

\"Visualizing the NATO Strategic Concept: Five ways to look at the

[[As NATO reconceptualizes]{.underline}]{.mark} its role [[to focus on
defense and deterrence while also addressing]{.underline}]{.mark}
non-traditional challenges such as [[emerging technologies and climate
change, the Alliance should look for opportunities to
strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark} climate and technology
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** with partners, especially with
its closest partner states and like-minded international organizations.

NATO's network of partners extends to forty states around the world, and
it includes some of the most innovative economies and global leaders in
addressing climate change. According to the United Nations World
Intellectual Property Organization Global Innovation Index, eight of the
top twenty most innovative global economies are NATO partners. And
according to the MIT Green Future Index, which evaluates countries'
ability to transition to a low-carbon future, six of the top twenty
states are also NATO partners.

### Science Turn

#### Aff Science focus amplifies NATO strength

\"Visualizing the NATO Strategic Concept: Five ways to look at the

New Partnership Priorities

[[NATO should identify a set of priorities for cooperation that
leverages **not only** its allies but the strengths of its
**partners**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As evidenced in the data, [[partner
states are international leaders on climate policy, sustainability, and
clean technology]{.underline}]{.mark}. They also manage sophisticated
markets and innovation ecosystems. They invest heavily in research and
development. And they possess world-class human capital. They have as
much to offer the Alliance as NATO can offer them in conversations about
emerging and disruptive technologies, building climate resilience,
science and technology standards, and responding to natural disasters
and crises, among others.

The Madrid Strategic Concept will redefine the Alliance's core tasks.
The focus will be on defense and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic, but
[[cooperative security]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[relations with
partners are still relevant given the myriad non-traditional challenges
posed by climate, technology, and authoritarianism. Cooperative security
is a means of strengthening the Alliance's relationships
with]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[global innovation and climate
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[leveraging their strengths and
experiences to help shape and sustain the rules-based international
order]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Russia Won't Retaliate

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and

[[Prepare for the **most likely** area of escalation: cyberspace. As
events progressively turn against Putin, the prospect of **cyber** war
will loom ever larger]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it represents one of
Russia's most powerful remaining weapons. Few Western nations possess
true offensive cyber capabilities, and [[the United States **alone**
possesses the ability to **deter** major cyberattacks by delivering
effective and large-scale **reprisals**]{.underline}]{.mark}. President
Joe Biden has issued clear warnings to the private sector to harden its
cyber defenses, which remain patchy and incomplete, and put Putin on
notice that cyber assaults on critical infrastructure, the financial
sector, and other key targets will be met with severe retaliation. A
complicating factor is that [[cyber warfare on a strategic scale has
never occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}, and much remains unknown about it.
For example, [[attacks on critical Russian infrastructure, such as power
grids and transportation networks, could unintentionally cause civilian
deaths]{.underline}]{.mark}, while intrusion into military
command-and-control nodes could alarm the commanders of Russia's nuclear
forces. In many respects, the cyber domain remains the realm of the
unknown. Like aerial warfare in the early twentieth century, [[both
sides must grope forward and learn as they go. A strong and clearly
articulated **cyber-deterrence regime**]{.underline}]{.mark}, punctuated
by sharp demonstrations if necessary, [[is the best **defense**
here]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Russia badly weakened by Ukraine war

**ISA**, 6-24-2022, Institute for Strategic Analysis (in Azeri: Strateji

Perceptional Loss Of Global Stature Post-Ukraine Invasion,\" No
Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:7-1-2022)

Summing-up Russia's military losses in its Ukraine Invasion it is
starkly evident that Russian overwhelming conventional military power
has been militarily ineffective, Russian Army's military prowess resting
on massed use of firepower is questionable and so also is questionable
the 'fighting will' of Russian Army.

Economically, [[Russia's economic strength and resilience stands
emasculated by US & Western sanctions applied post-Ukraine
Invasion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russian economy will be more strangled by
Western sanctions if Russian President Putin persists in 'Turning Defeat
into Victory'.

Russia's vast energy resources on whose high global prices Russian
economic stability rested and which provided a \$ 400 billion military
build-up now is threatened by stringent Western economic sanctions.

[[Economic deprivations are likely to fuel domestic political discontent
with serious implications for stability of the Russian
State]{.underline}]{.mark}. Initial indicators are already are emerging
to the fore.

In conclusion, what can be summed up is that Russian President Putin's
'War of Choice' in [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} Invasion has badly
misfired and not only [[endangers]{.underline}]{.mark} President
[[Putin's longevity in power]{.underline}]{.mark} at Russia's helm
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[seriously sets-back Russia by decades
in]{.underline}]{.mark} its quest for [[regaining its global
stature]{.underline}]{.mark} as an alternative centre of power.

### No Middle East War

**No Mid East escalation**

Islamabad : **[There is a need to study the causes of proxy wars, and
what are the potential impacts of such wars on the overall conflict.
These thoughts in a daylong [international seminar on]{.mark} 'Strategic
Dimensions of Peace and [Conflict in]{.mark}]{.underline}** South Asia
and **[[the Middle East]{.mark},' organised by Pak Institute for Peace
Studies (PIPS]{.underline}**), an Islamabad-based think tank,
**[[participated by prominent]{.mark} national and [international
scholars]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Prof]{.underline}**. Shahram **[Akbarzadeh]{.underline}**, Deakin
University, Australia, **[[argued]{.mark} there is significant gap in
the literature on non-state actors]{.underline}**. He called for
empirical research, along with concrete policy suggestions, on the
topic, so as to mitigate the conflicts in the region, in particular
South Asia and Middle East.

Speakers grappled at the notion of non-state actors and proxy wars: PIPS
director Muhammad Amir Rana said **[non-state actors often evoke
memories of violent elements]{.underline}**. This despite that as per
definition, non-state actors include organizations working for human
rights.

Prof. Syed Rifaat Hussain, Department of Government and Public Policy,
NUST, said the term "proxy wars" is a contested notion. There is no
universal agreement on its definition, nor on the set of circumstances
behind such wars. Interestingly, he said, proxy wars are as old as the
phenomena of conventional war itself.

Speakers noted **[[proxy wars are instruments of state
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As to why states go for it, it was argued,
**[it is [because they are]{.mark} often [cheap]{.mark} undertaking to
change the status quo]{.underline}**.

Participants noted over the decades, **[much of the [conflict involves
non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Interstate
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, on the other hand, **[[has
declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent times, he said
**[[tit-for-tat tactics on behalf of such actors have reduced their
appeal.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Dr. Ibrahim **[Fraihat]{.underline}**, Doha Institute of Graduate
Studies, Doha, **[termed proxy war as an arms conflict between two
parties, though one of them is not directly involved]{.underline}**.
This way, **[domestic conflicts are escalated by external power
intervention]{.underline}**. At the same time, proxy war, if unresolved,
can take the shape of conventional war, the most significant example was
of Vietnam War. **[[In contemporary times]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he
lamented, **[[the Middle East has been rendered a stock market of proxy
organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

William Gueriache, Associate Professor American University in the
Emirates Dubai, said on surface, all states support open diplomacy and
multilateralism. Yet the survival of patronage has paved the way for
foreign intervention during conflicts in the whole Middle East.

Dr. Marwan Kablan, Director Policy Analysis at the Arab Center for
Research and Policy Studies Doha, also hinted multiplicity of actors
involved in Syrian conflict, calling it as mother of conflicts in the
region. It was said that wars cannot be ended unless patron states
achieve their interests.

Dr. Shaheen Akhtar, Professor National Defence University Islamabad
focused on the apprehension of Pakistan about India's involvement in
Afghanistan. She said Pakistan's uneasy relationship with Kabul
reinforces a perception of encirclement while growing US-India strategic
cooperation further aggravates these apprehensions.

**[Dr]{.underline}**. Muhammad Riaz **[Shad]{.underline}**, National
University of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad, said **[[fighting
through proxies gives states an opportunity of
deniability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Domestic pushback to plan guts US leadership -- turns case

I want to turn back to the question of how this Ukraine-Russia
interaction plays out in terms of state strategies vis-a-vis economics.
We've seen a lot of economic cooperation, but at the heart of some of
the questions you've been asking is this notion that nation-states are
going to be predisposed to look for national economic security, which
will mean developing a capacity for relative strength---independent
strength---vis a vis global changes. The difficulty is that most states
can't do this, and there's a strong impulse toward economic cooperation
along the technological gradient that will allow states to make up for
their potential deficiencies. We've talked at this conference about
semiconductors and it seems pretty clear that no state, even if it does
make major moves in that direction, is going to be capable of complete
autarky in a whole host of these high-tech areas.

The second piece of this relates to domestic politics in the U.S. [[What
we're seeing in the United States is a growing resistance on the part of
segments of the Republican Party to the development of international
support for Ukraine. We're seeing resistance to U.S.
aid]{.underline}]{.mark} for the military, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
we're seeing [[much broader isolationism that goes back to the MAGA
mentality. This has a ripple effect in terms of how other states will
perceive]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
rely on the United States]{.underline}]{.mark} economically. [[The idea
of the U.S. as a reliable]{.underline}]{.mark} economic and security
[[partner is very much at risk]{.underline}]{.mark}.
