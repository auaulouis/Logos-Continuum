## Advantage 1 - Ethics

### Its Ethical

#### Banning germline genetic editing is naïve and amounts to 'biological nonsense' -- their 'ethical concerns' are unlikely to ever occur and mystify legitimate implementation benefits

**Pinker 15** Pinker, Steven. Steven Pinker is professor of psychology
at Harvard University and the author of 10 books, most recently \"The
Sense of Style: The Thinking Person\'s Guide to Writing in the 21st
Century.\" "Experts Debate: Are We Playing with Fire When We Edit Human
Genes?" STAT, 17 Nov. 2015,

[[Germline editing]{.mark} should be treated like any other medical
procedure, weighing benefits against harms. It [should not be banned out
of a nebulous terror about tampering with a sacrosanct entity called
\"the human germline\" - **a concept which is biological
nonsense**]{.mark}**.** We affect the genetic makeup of our offspring,
and the species, every time we choose one sex partner over another. And
each of us introduces dozens of mutations into our own germlines by
exposing ourselves to everyday radiation and chemical mutagens. [Genetic
editing would be a droplet in the maelstrom of naturally churning
genomes.]{.mark}]{.underline} What are the potential benefits? [[There
are several scenarios in which germline editing could benefit parents
who carry disease genes.]{.mark} It could be used when both parents are
homozygous for the disease, when in vitro fertilization doesn\'t produce
enough viable and unaffected embryos for preimplantation genetic
diagnosis, or if future data shows that babies who undergo the procedure
have compromised longevity or health.]{.underline} [[The principal harm
of germline editing is the risk of producing a sick or deformed
child]{.mark}. Frankly, I suspect that [this risk will always be
unacceptable, so]{.mark} most of [this discussion is
moot]{.mark}.]{.underline} But suppose safety could be ensured. [Should
we fear the prospect of [parents]{.mark} genetically [enhancing their
babies]{.mark}, the outcome the prohibitionists dread? This [is highly
unlikely - a relic of the early 1990s]{.mark}, when people thought there
was \"a gene for\" this or that talent.]{.underline} [[We now know that
heritable]{.mark} psychological [traits]{.mark}, such as intelligence
and personality, [are the product of hundreds or thousands of
genes]{.mark}, each with a tiny effect. And many genes have multiple
effects, some of them harmful, such as an increased risk of neurological
disease or cancer.]{.underline} With each enhancement providing a
trifling benefit and a non-negligible risk, and with the editing process
itself imposing risks, [it\'s unlikely that today\'s morbidly
risk-averse helicopter parents will take a chance at enhancing a
child.]{.underline} They won\'t even feed their babies genetically
modified applesauce! [Add these risks to the expense and tribulation of
IVF]{.underline} compared to good old-fashioned sex, [and one can
conclude that **[widespread genetic enhancement is too unlikely a
possibility to worry about.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Not unethical -- all new technologies have unpredictable effects and we don't ban them. Its key to advancement and innovation.

Douglas, Christopher Gyngell Protein Cell 2015, 6(7):476--479 DOI
10.1007/s13238-015-0184-y

However, some in [[the scientific community]{.underline}]{.mark} are
calling a moratorium on gene editing research. Yet, they [[fail to
give]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[sufficient justification
for]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a ban]{.underline}]{.mark}. In calling
for a moratorium, Lanphier et al. (2015) state: In our view, genome
editing in human embryos using current technologies could have
unpredictable effects on future generations. This makes it dangerous and
ethically unacceptable. Such research could be exploited for
non-therapeutic modifications This reasoning is, however, inconsistent
with widely accepted practices. [[Nearly all new technologies have
unpredictable effects on future generations. Information technologies
like the internet and mobile phones fundamentally change the way people
interact and communicate with each other]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their
effect on future generations is very hard to predict, and though they
could be catastrophic (for example, through cyberterrorism), [[this does
not mean on balance they should be banned. Their expected benefits
outweigh their expected harms]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### No valid legal human rights restriction on germline editing -- ethical because right to health and to benefit from science.

**Boggio and Yotova (2021).** Gene editing of human embryos is not
contrary to human rights law: A reply to Drabiak. Bioethics.
doi:10.1111/bioe.12945 

In a recent article in this journal, Katherine [[Drabiak argues that the
genome editing of human embryos is contrary to fundamental human rights
law]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 "Such practice," Drabiak concludes, "would
violate what we should recognize as a fundamental human right to inherit
a genome without deliberate manipulation." 2 Her argument is presented
in the form of a critique of the analysis and conclusions reached by the
Nuffield Council on Bioethics in its 2018 report Genome editing and
human reproduction: Social and ethical issues3 and of the background
paper, authored by Rumiana Yotova, on The regulation of genome editing
and human reproduction under international law, EU law and comparative
law. 4 Unfortunately[[, Drabiak\'s analysis
mischaracterizes]{.underline}]{.mark} both the Nuffield Council\'s
report and international human rights law that pertains to genome
editing of human embryos. In this reply, we limit our critique to two
main points. First, [[we challenge her methodological
approach]{.underline}]{.mark} used to identify what constitutes
"fundamental human rights law[[." Her approach fails to
include]{.underline}]{.mark} key human rights provisions in the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which
include [[the right to health and the right to benefit from
science]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second, we challenge the substantive
standard invoked by Drabiak (a right to genetic integrity of a future
person) and the implications of the concept of human dignity for
informing how genome editing of human embryos can be regulated. After
further analyzing Drabiak\'s argument and specifying what her argument
does not prove, we conclude by reiterating the position taken by the
Nuffield Council in 2018 and Yotova\'s background paper that:
[[international law does not prohibit genome editing of human embryos
and does not recognize a right to genetic integrity for future
persons]{.underline}]{.mark} let alone inviolability as clearly
evidenced in the text and preparatory works of the 1997 UNESCO
Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights.5

#### Human germline gene editing would actually reduce the risk to a number of unwanted viable embryos.

**Savulescu, et.al. 2015** The moral imperative to continue gene editing

Douglas, Christopher Gyngell Protein Cell 2015, 6(7):476--479 DOI
10.1007/s13238-015-0184-y

[[In fact, gene-editing technologies might ultimately lead to far fewer
embryos being destroyed for reproductive purposes.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Currently, if a carrier of a genetic disease wants to have a child
that will not be affected by their parent's condition, the carrier will
often choose to undergo IVF and PGD in order to select a non-affected
embryo]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This practice often
involves]{.mark}]{.underline} the creation, and [[eventual destruction
of, a considerable number of]{.underline}]{.mark} surplus [[unwanted
viable embryos]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, this practice would be
rendered obsolete by the availability of safe and effective gene-editing
technologies; if such technologies became available, carriers of genetic
diseases would not have to produce large numbers of surplus embryos
which would eventually be destroyed in order to ensure that they could
have a child who was not affected by their parent's genetic disease.

### Its ethical -- A2 Mosaicism & Autonomy

#### New studies prove can do editing without genetic instability

Yelena **Biberman** Dr. Biberman is an associate professor of political
science at Skidmore College, a fellow at West Point's Modern War
Institute, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's

Warfare STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY → FALL **2021**
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-15_Issue-3/Biberman.pdf

[[Gene editing and synthetic biology research are making strides in
overcoming the problem of genetic instability. A study published in 2019
presented a new system, CRISPR-BEST]{.underline}]{.mark}. It created
mutations in actinomycetes (bacteria that produce a wide variety of
industrially and medically relevant compounds) [[without creating
genetic instability and forcing them to rearrange and even delete large
parts of their chromosomes.]{.underline}]{.mark}53 Synthetic biology is
also increasingly embracing genetic instability rather than trying to
suppress or compensate for it. [[With improved understanding, it is
expected to design devices that incorporate genetic instability as a
parameter]{.underline}]{.mark}.54 Such devices would be "a true frontier
in biological engineering."55

#### Genetic engineering necessary to preserve key aspects of our biology and is ethically justifiable

RUSSELL **POWELL** Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts **2015** In
Genes We Trust: Germline Engineering, Eugenics, and the Future of the
Human Genome, USA Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 40 (6):669-695
(2015) <https://philpapers.org/rec/POWIGW>

Whereas [[most of the philosophical literature on the ethics of genetic
engineering, both skeptical and optimistic, has focused on its ability
to enhance human nature and valued biological
capacities]{.underline}]{.mark} (see e.g., Savulescu and Bostrom, 2009),
my contention is that [[genetic intervention will be necessary merely to
preserve them.]{.underline}]{.mark} The dynamic evolutionary environment
may counsel against taking genetic engineering off the table, lest the
technology proves useful in tackling unforeseen challenges that arise in
the future---but this does not imply that we will need to embark on a
genome-wide enterprise of germline modification in order to maintain
valued elements of the biological status quo, or to avoid foreseeable
reductions in human wellbeing. In this section, [[I argue that a
large-scale program of genetic intervention will be necessary to achieve
these goals,]{.underline}]{.mark} regardless of whether the environment
changes in the ways contemplated earlier.8

### Its ethical -- A2 Gene Drive

#### Human germline editing is an ethical imperative to sustain genetic health

RUSSELL **POWELL** Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts **2015** In
Genes We Trust: Germline Engineering, Eugenics, and the Future of the
Human Genome, USA Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 40 (6):669-695
(2015) <https://philpapers.org/rec/POWIGW>

In this article, [[I explore some of the evolutionary and
social]{.underline}]{.mark} risks that attend the other side of the risk
equation: namely, the undesirable [[consequences that are likely to flow
from our failure to intervene in the human
germline]{.underline}]{.mark}. I argue that even if we do not have moral
reasons to genetically "enhance" our children relative to the current
status quo of normality (for arguments that we do, see, e.g., Savulescu,
2001; Bostrom and Ord, 2006; Harris, 2007; Savulescu and Persson, 2008;
Buchanan, 2011; Powell and Buchanan, 2011), [[germline intervention
still emerges as a pro tanto moral imperative so long as we have good
reason to sustain the levels of genetic health that we presently
enjoy]{.underline}]{.mark} for future generations---a goal that should
appeal to bioliberals, biomoderates, and bioconservatives alike. My aim
is to show that [[merely preserving important genetic and phenotypic
aspects of the human species]{.underline}]{.mark}---and perhaps even
human dignity---[[will require that we overcome the remaining technical
obstacles and make germline genetic therapies legal and widely available
to healthcare consumers]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Takes thousands of years to evaluate changes of genetic code -- and can't change human nature.

Vera Lúcia **Raposo 2019** Gene Editing, the Mystic Threat to Human
Dignity Journal of Bioethical Inquiry Pty Ltd. 2019
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-019-09906-4

Based on this understanding, Jurgen Habermas (2006) asserted that when
people change their genetic code they are altering their human nature
and turning themselves into instruments. [[According to Habermas, our
genetic code is the basis of our human nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
if changing it would make us less human. Kass (2002), for instance,
referred to losing one part of being human. This argument can be divided
into two sub-arguments: a) genetic homogeneity can become a threat to
the survival of the human species; and b) an overall ecological balance
should be maintained, which depends on the existence of diverse species.
Notwithstanding these assertions, [[it would take thousands of years and
generations for one change to have repercussions for the genetic makeup
of humanity as a whole]{.underline}]{.mark}. As McConnell (2010, 420)
puts it: [[\[T\]here are more than six billion humans on the planet.
Absent some kind of magic wand, it is initially difficult to see how any
given genetic intervention could change human
nature.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Its ethical -- A2 Human Dignity

#### Its ethical -- germline editing isn't contrary to dignity -- modifying genomes happens in medical treatments and is consistent with international law.

**Boggio and Yotova (2021).** Gene editing of human embryos is not
contrary to human rights law: A reply to Drabiak. Bioethics.
doi:10.1111/bioe.12945 

[[The second rebuttal concerns the argument that clinical interventions
based on gene editing of human embryos are contrary to human
dignity.]{.underline}]{.mark} The argument takes different forms: gene
editing is seen as an alleged violation of human dignity because it (a)
leads to considering some human lives (of those carrying good genes)
better than others (of those carrying bad genes); (b) violates a
purported right to genetic identity; and (c) compromises the human
genome, whose unmodified form is allegedly a requisite of human dignity.
Drabiak embraces the second and third forms of the argument. [[Taken to
an extreme, the idea of this dignity being grounded on genetic identity
or genetic inviolability leads to an indefensible
conclusio]{.underline}]{.mark}n: persons who have undergone cancer or
other serious treatment, which modifies their genome, would have lost,
or have suffered a violation of, their human dignity in the process.
This conclusion is hard to defend on its face. More moderate accounts
are not new to us and have been discussed in Yotova\'s background paper.
After a thorough review of all international and regional instruments
applicable to gene editing that mention human dignity, she concludes
that "there is a trend of acknowledging that while embryos and foetuses
are not generally recognised as holders of human rights, they are
becoming increasingly recognised as having human dignity." 46 The
dignity‐ based argument is complex, and a lengthy analysis of this issue
exceeds the scope of this paper. Here we want to focus on some critical
aspects. First, while embryos may possess human dignity, they are
generally not recognized as rightsholders. As Yotova points out,
"legally speaking ... human rights are protected only after birth, which
puts germline editing outside of their temporal scope of protection." 47
This is the case under international law and also in the majority of
domestic laws. The European Court of Human Rights also acknowledged the
lack of consensus in Europe about the nature and status of the embryo,
rejecting the argument that they are a "person" with "a right to life."
48 Second[[, the ICESCR acknowledges human dignity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Nonetheless, [[it recognizes the right to access treatment to enjoy the
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the right
to access clinical applications as benefits of scientific progress
compatible with human dignity.]{.underline}]{.mark} These two rights are
recognized without reservations. As we have seen, their recognition is
not absolute, leaving it up to State Parties to limit the two rights to
access provided it is done according to the parameters set in Article 4
of the ICESCR. A State Party may consider the interest of embryos to
deserve consideration that trumps the right to access clinical
applications of gene editing of human embryos. However, this is a State
Party\'s prerogative, not a duty under the Covenant. Third, the concept
of human dignity was considered and discussed extensively during the
negotiations of the UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome but never as
an argument against germline interventions. Instead, it was linked to
very different legal principles.

#### Human dignity is not based on a certain genetic code.

Vera Lúcia **Raposo 2019** Gene Editing, the Mystic Threat to Human
Dignity Journal of Bioethical Inquiry Pty Ltd. 2019
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-019-09906-4

[[To conclude that the existence of a non-manipulated genetic code is
linked to human dignity, we would have to assume that human dignity is
based on a certain genetic code,]{.underline}]{.mark} not any human
genetic code but the one every person is born with. [[If that were true,
any change to that code would carry a diminution of dignity. This
conclusion is problematic because our genetic code changes during our
lifetime.]{.underline}]{.mark} For instance, after a baby is born some
fetal cells may be left behind in its mother's body. They can travel to
different organs and be absorbed into the mother's tissues, changing her
genetic composition,3 but no one would say that the mother is less
worthy of dignity. In the case of blood transfusions, depending on the
amount of white blood cells (the only ones that contain nuclear DNA),
some DNA is transferred from the donor to the recipient, even in small
amounts, and it can survive for days in his or her body,4 but this does
not make the recipient less dignified during that transitory period.
[Furthermore, some diseases]{.mark} [[(such as cancer) can lead to
acquired genetic mutations]{.underline}]{.mark}, creating the so-called
genetic mosaics.5 In addition to being sick, do these people become
undignified? The same happens in organ (Olszewski et al. 2005) and bone
narrow donations.6 Both involve adding the donor's DNA to extracts of
tissues from the recipient, but none of these situations diminishes the
recipient's dignity. [[If the above thesis were true and if human
dignity resided in a specific (human) genetic code, these examples would
lead to the conclusion that some people lose their dignity during their
lifetime due to changes]{.mark}]{.underline} (even if reduced and
temporary) in their genomes, which obviously does not make any sense.
Human dignity cannot be reduced to a certain genetic code, nor the human
being reduced to genetic characteristics. This same idea is stated by
article 2 of the UDHG: (a) Everyone has a right to respect for their
dignity and for their rights regardless of their genetic
characteristics. (b) That dignity makes it imperative not to reduce
individuals to their genetic characteristics and to respect their
uniqueness and diversity. If that is the case, there is no way that a
change in the genetic features of a person will undermine his or her
dignity.

**Gene editing is ethical -- does not clash with human dignity**

**Boggio and Yotova (2021).** Gene editing of human embryos is not
contrary to human rights law: A reply to Drabiak. Bioethics.
doi:10.1111/bioe.12945 

Implicit in this interpretation of Article 6 is the fact that [[the
protection of human embryos is not absolute]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
fact, quite to the contrary, the HRC states that providing safe
abortions is a duty of States under certain circumstances. Although
merely hypothetical at this point, [[clinical applications of gene
editing could conceivably remedy non‐viability and alleviate the mental
pain or suffering that comes from knowing that the fetus is or may be
affected by certain genetic conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here we are
not arguing that these interventions will have to be made available to
patients as a matter of duty. More modestly, we argue [[that gene
editing of human embryos does not clash with the right of
life]{.underline}]{.mark} as codified in Article 6 of the ICCPR. In
fact, it may reinforce it.

#### Genetic engineering does not take away humanness 

RUSSELL **POWELL** Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts **2015** In
Genes We Trust: Germline Engineering, Eugenics, and the Future of the
Human Genome, USA Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 40 (6):669-695
(2015) <https://philpapers.org/rec/POWIGW>

I will not take a stand here as to whether our given biological nature
has intrinsic value or, if it does, how weighty that value might be.
Indeed, there are serious problems with drawing any substantive
bioethical conclusions from a conception of human nature (see Buchanan,
2009). Furthermore, authors will disagree over just how much of a
departure from human biological nature is necessary to bring about the
loss of intrinsic value associated with remaining "fundamentally human."
One might contend, for example, that [[much of human biological
nature]{.underline}]{.mark} (as defined earlier) [[can be altered
without altering fundamentally human
characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Attempting to distinguish
putatively fundamental human characteristics from less fundamental ones
raises a spate of philosophical difficulties that I will not address
here. I will simply argue that [[if there is intrinsic value in
retaining human biological nature or central features of "humanness,"
then this gives us further reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}---conservative
reasons---[[to actively promote human germline modification
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, or at the very least to oppose
prohibitions of germline intervention that are insensitive to
risk-benefit analyses and which block the gathering of information
necessary to make proper risk-benefit assessments.

#### Unaltered genetic heritage is not the only way to preserve human dignity

Vera Lúcia **Raposo 2019** Gene Editing, the Mystic Threat to Human
Dignity Journal of Bioethical Inquiry Pty Ltd. 2019
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-019-09906-4

[[The right to an unaltered genetic heritage cannot be taken as an
absolute]{.underline}]{.mark} goal; [[the genetic code isn't something
divine and immutable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even though detrimental
traits are part of human heritage, there is no reason to keep them
unmodified. [[Genetic immutability is not the only guide for genetic
decisions or even the more beneficial to humankind]{.underline}]{.mark}.
If this were so, we would be prevented from defending ourselves against
the caprices of nature and biology based on a supposed duty to respect
nature or BGod-given gifts.\^ [[Surgical interventions, vaccinations, or
even something as simple as taking an aspirin would be
banned.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Its ethical -- A2 Eugenics

#### Human germline editing is not reminiscent of the type of eugenics we should be afraid of -- potential for positivity and not harmful.

Vera Lúcia **Raposo 2019** Gene Editing, the Mystic Threat to Human
Dignity Journal of Bioethical Inquiry Pty Ltd. 2019
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-019-09906-4

[[Human enhancement,]{.underline}]{.mark} including enhancement for
health-related purposes, [[is rejected by many under the accusation that
it led to the Nazi horrors and to other procedures to eliminate the
unfit]{.underline}]{.mark}. What these measures have in common is that
they are all eugenic measures (Paor and Blanck 2016), [[but the mistake
is to consider all eugenics as pernicious]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Nazi
Holocaust and the sterilization of mentally impaired people represented
the negative side of eugenics, characterized by discrimination,
hierarchization of human life, and ultimately the killing of those
perceived as weak in our species (Bachruch 2004; Finkelstein and Stuart
1996). Conversely[[, the kind of human enhancement that we pursue today
by means of gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark} (and artificial
reproductive treatments) [[aims to promote the well-being of the
existing generations]{.underline}]{.mark} (somatic genetic
interventions) [[and of future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}
(germinal genetic interventions). [[The assimilation between these two
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}, so different from each other, [[rest on
a misunderstanding about eugenics as being necessarily
harmful]{.underline}]{.mark} (Caplan et al. 1999). Eugenics has been
vilified because of its abuses during the early 20th century,
particularly Germany's choice to murder people with perceived
disabilities. But the origin of eugenics was simply a desire to increase
the odds that a child would be born healthy. Today we consider such
measures as prenatal care, eating sensibly during pregnancy, avoiding
use of alcohol or other drugs, and choosing your partner carefully to be
the minimum that the pregnant woman should do and that the healthcare
system should offer. Yet these practices are the very basis of eugenics.
(Root 2000, 873). [[It has become common to use eugenics as a kind of
bogeyman and for every intervention with connotations of human
improvement to be at risk of being banned. However, we should not be
afraid of eugenics]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Germline gene editing enhances human dignity and isn't eugenics -- we have the capacity to resolve mass human suffering

Vera Lúcia **Raposo 2019** Gene Editing, the Mystic Threat to Human
Dignity Journal of Bioethical Inquiry Pty Ltd. 2019
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-019-09906-4

In light of this understanding, [[gene editing does not violate human
dignity; on the contrary, it offers the individual more possibilities to
assert his/her status as a human person and, therefore, to assert
his/her dignity]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The claim is unfounded that gene
editing is a form of eugenics]{.underline}]{.mark} and therefore---ipso
facto---repugnant. To be healthy, to live a life with less suffering,
cannot be against human dignity. The accusation of eugenics has become
commonplace---invoking the Nazi holocaust and the fear of gross
violations of human rights. However, [[the fear of past mistakes cannot
block genetic ameliorations that are able to relieve humanity from
diseases that continue to kill so many people]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Critics also invoke the immutability of the genetic code, as a kind of
foundation of human dignity. Nevertheless[[, the preservation of
humankind's genetic pool cannot be more important than the other values
and goals at stake here, such as eradicating the pathological features
of people who are suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the aim is to avoid
human suffering in present and future generations, the hypothetical
right to receive an unmodified genetic code (hypothetical because future
generations do not have any rights) cannot prevail over the right to
health. On the other hand[[, an immutable genome cannot be viewed as a
condition sine qua non for the dignity of the
person]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scientific reports have shown that [[a
person's genetic code changes throughout their existence, even if such
changes are subtle and temporary]{.underline}]{.mark}. Certainly, these
changes do not imply a diminution of an individual's dignity. Another
repeated argument pertains to the destruction of our intrinsic human
nature. However, enhancement (becoming stronger and healthier) is
natural to humanity; it is the defining note of the human species.
Looking back in time, the story of humankind has been one of
enhancement. We are always trying to supplant ourselves (Buchanan 2011).
[[We cannot assume that human nature is something defined and fixed
(Fenton 2006). On the contrary, we cannot avoid changing ourselves for
the simple reason that we are human. Gene editing is just another way of
being human]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### A2 Precautionary principle

#### Precautionary principle is pragmatically insufficient and results in self-interested ignorance and neglect of opportunity costs and [risk probability]{.underline} comparisons 

Sunstein 02 (The Paralyzing Principle BY CASS R. SUNSTEIN University of
Chicago Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence at
the University of Chicago. Cato Institute Winter 2002-2003;
http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2002/12/v25n4-9.pdf)

PRECAUTIONS AND RATIONALITY But if the Precautionary Principle, taken in
a strong form, is unhelpful, how can we account for its extraordinary
influence, and indeed for the widespread belief that it can and should
guide regulatory judgments? Undoubtedly, [self-interested political
actors invoke the principle strategically.]{.underline} For example,
[European farmers invoke the idea of precaution to stifle American
competitors who are far more likely to rely on g]{.underline}enetically
[m]{.underline}odified [c]{.underline}rop[s]{.underline}. But apart from
that point, I suggest that an understanding of human cognition provides
some useful clues: Loss aversion [People dislike losses far more than
they like corresponding gains. The result is that out-of-pocket costs,
or deteriorations from the status quo, seem much worse than opportunity
costs, or benefits lost as a result of continuing the status
quo.]{.underline} In the context of risks, people often tend to focus on
the losses that are associated with some activity or hazard, and to
disregard the gains that might be associated with that activity or
hazard. A closely related point is that [unfamiliar risks produce far
more concern than familiar ones, even if the latter are sta tistically
larger; the Precautionary Principle,]{.underline} in practice, [is much
affected by that fact. The myth of a benevolent nature]{.underline} Loss
aversion is often accompanied by a mistaken belief that nature is
essentially benign, leading [people]{.underline} to [think that safety
and health are generally at risk only or mostly as a result of human
intervention.]{.underline} A belief in the relative safety of nature and
the relative risk of new technologies often informs the Precautionary
Principle. [Because natural processes are often dangerous and human
interventions often promote safet]{.underline}y, **[a commitment to
nature can be life threatening.]{.underline}** The availability
heuristic It is well known that [people focus on some risks simply
because they are cognitive y "available," whereas other risks are
not.]{.underline} When the Precautionary Principle seems to require
stringent controls on one risk, even though other risks are in the
vicinity, the availability heuristic is a common reason. And [when the
availability heuristic is at work, certain hazards will stand out
whether or not they are not statistically large.]{.underline} The
hazards associated with heat waves, for example, receive little public
attention, while the hazards associated with air travel are a
significant source of public concern; one reason is that the latter
hazards come readily to mind. [That is a serious problem because the
less salient risks,]{.underline} including those from heat waves and
poor diet[, can be the serious ones.]{.underline} Probability neglect
[People are]{.underline} sometimes p[rone to neglect the probability
that a bad outcome will occur; they focus instead on the outcome itself.
The Precautionary Principle often embodies a form of **probability
neglect**]{.underline}. At least, [that is the case when people invoke
the principle to favor stringent controls on a low-probability risk and
when the consequence of those very controls is to give rise to new risks
of equal or greater probability.]{.underline} In the context of the
sniper attacks in the Washington, D.C. area in October 2002, people were
far more concerned, and took many more precautions, than the statistical
realities warranted, in part because the high salience of the attacks
led to a form of probability neglect. It is highly likely that some of
those precautions, including those that involved extra driving, actually
increased people's risks. System neglect [The Precautionary Principle
often reflects a general neglect of the systemic effects of
regulation.]{.underline} When a single problem is placed in view, it can
be difficult to see the full consequences of legal interventions.
Sometimes, [the principle has the appearance of being workable only
because a subset of the relevant effects is "on screen" --- and hence
there seems to be no need to take precautions against other possible
adverse effects that do not register.]{.underline} I suggest that the
Precautionary Principle [seems appealing to many people]{.underline} in
large part [for the same reason.]{.underline}

#### Precautionary principle increases risks: diverts attention from more serious threats and ignores risk of inaction

Elizabeth Whelan 5/23/2000 ("Can Too Much Safety Be Hazardous?")
<http://www.acsh.org/healthissues/newsID.589/healthissue_detail.asp>

There are, however, at least two reasons why [the precautionary
principle itself]{.underline}, when applied in its extreme, [is a
hazard, both to our health and our high standard of
living]{.underline}.¶ First, [if we act on all the remote possibilities
in identifying causes of human disease, we will have less time, less
money and fewer general resources left to deal with the real public
health problems which confront us.]{.underline} This does not mean that
before we take prudent action to protect public health we have to dot
every scientific "i" and cross every environmental "t". It does mean
that [we should not let the distraction of purely hypothetical threats
cause us to lose sight of the known or highly probable
ones.]{.underline}¶ Second, [the precautionary principle assumes that no
detriment to health or the environment will result from the proposed new
banning or chemical regulation.]{.underline} For example, what are the
known health risks from the current regulated use of chlorine? None. How
great are the benefits? Enormous. What new health risks wold we
encounter if we were to ban chlorinated compounds because they "might"
be harmful? Plenty.¶ Chlorine, for example, is the essential cornerstone
of modern industrial chemistry. We need chlorine to disinfect our
nation's water supply, make the agricultural pesticides that enable us
to have a food supply rich in cancer-fighting fruits and vegetables, and
to produce lifesaving pharmaceuticals[.¶ When we apply the precautionary
principle and focus on hypothetical risks and ponder what actions we
might take "just in case", **we leave the world of science and enter the
realm of ideology.**]{.underline} We allow ourselves to come under the
spell of those who are motivated , for whatever reason, by a desire to
return to what they perceive as a pre-industrial Garden of Eden.¶ [These
"what if" ideologues need to be reminded that wealth and industrial
progress are associated with better, not worse health. Blanket
applications of the precautionary principle ultimately would mean
rejecting the modern technologies that have given us our enviable state
of good health and longevity, and the freedom to enjoy it.¶]{.underline}
So what is to be done with those instances in which the risks are
hypothetical and the costs of eliminating the technology substantial in
terms of costs and lost human benefits? What should we do when
confronted with the radical version of the precautionary principle? Go
back to what Mom said: "When in doubt, throw it out".¶

This analogy, they argue, relies on misconceived interpretations of
evolutionary theory: we should resist the presumption that intentional
genetic modification is likely to be more dangerous than "unintentional
genetic modification"---that is, the process of mutation, inheritance,
and selection that occurs whether we like it or not. I[t may be that
random genetic changes are more likely to be deleterious than
beneficial, but this is not necessarily true of targeted modifications
designed with some understanding of their likely effects.]{.mark}
Moreover, judgments about risk are not absolute but comparative: whether
a likely consequence is better than or worse than the alternative.
[Precaution as a presumption against action assumes that the
consequences of doing are probably going to be worse than not-doing. In
the case of genome editing for serious disease, it is far from evident
that this is so]{.mark}

#### 2000 years of empirical evidence go our way

Review: Dangerous Times? The International Politics of Great Power
Peace," <http://www.ndu.edu/press/dangerous-times.html#Author>

Forget Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and Machiavelli. Put aside Mackinder, Mahan,
and Spykman. Close the military academies and war colleges. Shut our
overseas bases. Bring our troops home. Make dramatic cuts in the defense
budget. [[The end of]{.mark} major [war]{.mark}, and
perhaps]{.underline} the end of war [itself, [is near, according
to]{.mark}]{.underline} Tulane assistant professor Christopher
[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark} in his recent book, Dangerous Times? The
International Politics of Great Power Peace. Fettweis is not the first
intellectual, nor will he be the last, to proclaim the onset of
perpetual peace. He is squarely in the tradition of Immanuel Kant,
Herbert Spencer, and Norman Angell, to name just three. Indeed, in the
book\'s introduction, [[Fettweis attempts to rehabilitate]{.mark}
Angell\'s]{.underline} reputation for [[prophecy, which suffered
a]{.mark} devastating b[low when the Great War falsified his
claim]{.mark} in The Great Illusion [that]{.mark} economic
[interdependence had rendered]{.mark} great power [war
obsolete]{.mark}]{.underline}. Angell, Fettweis writes, was the first
\"prominent constructivist thinker of the twentieth century,\" and was
not wrong---just ahead of his time (p. 5). [[Fettweis bases his
theory]{.mark} or vision of the obsolescence of major war [on the
supposed linear progress of human nature]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
a major tenet of 20th-century liberalism that is rooted in the
rationalist theories of the Enlightenment. \"History,\" according to
Fettweis, \"seems to be unfolding as a line extending into the
future---a halting, incomplete, inconsistent line perhaps, one with
frequent temporary reversals, but a line nonetheless.\" The world is
growing \"more liberal and more reliant upon reason, logic, and
science\" (p. 217). [[We have heard this]{.mark} all [before]{.mark}.
Human nature can be perfected]{.underline}. Statesmen and leaders will
be guided by reason and science. Such thinking influenced the
visionaries of the French Revolution and produced 25 years of war among
the great powers of Europe. [[Similar ideas
influenced]{.underline}]{.mark} President Woodrow
[[Wilson]{.underline}]{.mark} and his intellectual supporters who
endeavored at Versailles to transform the horrors of World War I into a
peace that would make that conflict \"the war to end all wars.\" [[What
**followed were**]{.underline}]{.mark} disarmament conferences, an
international agreement to outlaw war, the rise of expansionist powers,
appeasement by the democracies, and [[the most destructive war
in]{.mark} human [history]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ideas, which Fettweis
claims will bring about the proliferation of peace, transformed Russia,
Germany, and Japan into expansionist, totalitarian powers. Those same
ideas led to the Gulag, the Holocaust, and the Rape of Nanking. So much
for human progress. [[Fettweis]{.mark} knows]{.underline} all of [this,
but [claims that since the end of the Cold War]{.mark}, the
[leaders]{.mark} and peoples of the major powers]{.underline}, except
the United States, [[have accepted the idea]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[major war is unthinkable]{.underline}. His proof is that there has been
no major war among the great powers for 20 years---a historical period
that coincides with the American \"unipolar\" moment. [[This is very
thin]{.mark} empirical [evidence]{.mark} upon which [to base a
predictive theory]{.mark}]{.underline} of international relations.
Fettweis criticizes the realist and neorealist schools of thought,
claiming that their adherents focus too narrowly on the past behavior of
states in the international system. In his view, realists place too
great an emphasis on power. Ideas and norms instead of power, he claims,
provide structure to the international system. Classical geopolitical
theorists such as Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Nicholas
Spykman, and Colin Gray are dismissed by Fettweis in less than two
pages, despite the fact that their analyses of [[great power
politics]{.mark} and conflict [have long been considered sound]{.mark}
and frequently prescient.]{.underline} Realists and classical
[[geopoliticians have more than **2,000 years of empirical
evidence**]{.mark} to support]{.underline} their theories of [how states
and empires behave]{.underline} and how the international system works.
Ideas are important, but power is the governing force in international
politics, and geography is the most permanent factor in the analysis of
power. Fettweis makes much of the fact that the countries of Western and
Central Europe, which waged war against each other repeatedly for nearly
400 years, are at peace, and claims that there is little likelihood that
they will ever again wage war against each other. [Even if the latter
assertion turns out to be true, that does not mean that the end of major
war is in sight]{.underline}. Throughout history, [some [peoples and
empires that previously waged war]{.mark} for one reason or another
[became pacific without producing]{.mark} worldwide [perpetual
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}: the Mongols, Saracens, Ottomans, Dutch,
Venetians, and the Spanish Empire come immediately to mind. A Europe at
peace does not translate to an Asia, Africa, and Middle East at peace.
In a world in which major wars are obsolete, Fettweis believes the
United States needs to adjust its grand strategy from vigorous
internationalism to strategic restraint. His specific recommendations
include the removal of all U.S. military forces from Europe; an end to
our bilateral security guarantees to Japan and South Korea; an end to
our alliance with Israel; an indifference to the balance of power on the
Eurasian landmass; a law enforcement approach to terrorism; a drastic
cut in military spending; a much smaller Navy; and the abolition of
regional combatant commands.What Fettweis is proposing is effectively an
end to what Walter Russell Mead calls \"the maritime world order\" that
was established by Great Britain and maintained first by the British
Empire and then by the United States. It is a world order that has
defeated repeated challenges by potential hegemonic powers and resulted
in an unprecedented spread of prosperity and freedom. But all of that,
we are assured, is in the past. China poses no threat. The United States
can safely withdraw from Eurasia. The power vacuum will remain unfilled.
[[Fettweis needs a dose of humility]{.underline}]{.mark}. Sir Halford
Mackinder, the greatest of all geopoliticians, was referring to
visionaries and liberal idealists like Fettweis when he cautioned, \"He
would be a sanguine man . . . who would trust the future peace of the
world to a change in the mentality of any nation.\" Most profoundly,
General Douglas MacArthur, who knew a little bit more about war and
international conflict than Fettweis, reminded the cadets at West Point
in 1962 that \"[only the dead have seen the end of war]{.underline}.\"

#### Deterrence doesn't explain peace -- nuclear powers are still engaged in war, non-nuclear powers attacking stronger states

A Nuclear Peace?¶ [For "realist" scholars]{.underline}, the [absence of

the privilege of states having nuclear weapons, while wars are fought by
those who lack them."\[3\]¶ [But [while nuclear arsenals undoubtedly
induced]{.mark}]{.underline} a measure of [[caution]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the behaviour of the superpowers and their allies towards each other,
[[Waltz' assertion is **wrong for two reasons**]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶
First, [[nuclear weapons states are **not embroiled in fewer

and [Russia]{.mark} (]{.underline}USSR)---[[is a nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[state]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ [Second,]{.underline} since the end of
World War II, [[non-nuclear states]{.mark} have [**repeatedly** attacked

**did not deter China** from attacking U.S. forces

#### Nuclear war leads to extinction and even if it doesn't our impact still outweighs 

**Starr 15** (Steven - the director of the University of Missouri's
Clinical Laboratory Science Program, "Nuclear War, Nuclear Winter, and
Human Extinction," *Federation of American Scientists*,
https://fas.org/pir-pubs/nuclear-war-nuclear-winter-and-human-extinction/)

While it is impossible to precisely predict all the human impacts that
would result from a nuclear winter, it is relatively simple to predict
those which would be most profound. That is, **[a [nuclear winter would
cause most humans and]{.mark} large [animals to die from nuclear famine
in a mass extinction event]{.mark}]{.underline}** similar to the one
that wiped out the dinosaurs. [Following the detonation]{.underline} (in
conflict) [of US and/or Russian launch-ready strategic nuclear weapons,
[nuclear firestorms would]{.mark} burn simultaneously over a total land
surface area of many thousands or tens of thousands of square miles.
These mass fires, many of which would rage over large cities and
industrial areas, would [release]{.mark} many [**tens of millions of
tons** of black carbon]{.mark} soot and smoke]{.underline} (up to 180
million tons, according to peer-reviewed studies), [which would rise
rapidly above cloud level and into the stratosphere.]{.underline} \[For
an explanation of the calculation of smoke emissions, see Atmospheric
effects & societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts.\]
The scientists who completed the most recent peer-reviewed studies on
nuclear winter discovered that [the sunlight would heat the smoke,
producing a self-lofting effect that would not only aid the rise of the
smoke into the stratosphere]{.underline} (above cloud level, where it
could not be rained out), [but act to keep the smoke in the stratosphere
for 10 years or more. The longevity of the smoke layer would act to
greatly increase the severity of its effects upon the
biosphere.]{.underline} [Once in the stratosphere, the
smoke]{.underline} (predicted to be produced by a range of strategic
nuclear wars) [would rapidly engulf the Earth and form a dense
stratospheric smoke layer. [The smoke]{.mark} from a war fought with
strategic nuclear weapons [would]{.mark} quickly [prevent up]{.mark} to
[**70% of sunlight**]{.mark} from reaching the surface of the Northern
Hemisphere and 35% of sunlight from reaching the surface of the Southern
Hemisphere. Such an enormous [loss]{.mark} of warming sunlight [would
produce **Ice Age**]{.mark} weather conditions on Earth in a matter of
weeks]{.underline}. For a period of 1-3 years following the war,
temperatures would fall below freezing every day in the central
agricultural zones of North America and Eurasia. \[For an explanation of
nuclear winter, see Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model
and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences.\] Nuclear
winter would cause average global surface temperatures to become colder
than they were at the height of the last Ice Age. [Such extreme cold
would eliminate growing seasons for many years, probably for a decade or
longer]{.underline}. Can you imagine a winter that lasts for ten years?
The results of such a scenario are obvious. [[Temperatures would
be]{.mark} much [**too cold** to grow food, and]{.mark} they would
[remain this way **long enough to cause** ]{.mark}**most [humans]{.mark}
and animals [to starve to death.]{.mark}** Global nuclear famine would
ensue in a setting in which the infrastructure of the combatant nations
has been totally destroyed, resulting in massive amounts of chemical and
radioactive toxins being released into the biosphere.]{.underline} [[We
don't need a sophisticated study to tell us that no food and Ice Age
temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark} for a decade [[would kill most
people]{.underline}]{.mark} and animals [[on the
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}. Would the few remaining survivors be able
to survive in a radioactive, toxic environment?

### A2 Ableism

#### Germline editing itself is not bad\-\--taking social models of disabilities into account solves the harms many fear

Solveig Magnus **Reindal**, 4-1-**2000**, Reindal works at Oslo
University in Norway, \"Disability, gene therapy and eugenics\", Journal
of Medical Ethics, https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89, 6-29-2022, //ms

Introduction In the article, "Is gene therapy a form of eugenics?"
Harris discusses disability and the production of "fine" children and
how this should be achieved. He also criticises people who argue that a
predisposition to being impaired will be used as a basis for
discrimination against disabled people. Harris builds his critique on
what he calls "The moral continuum" and his understanding of disability.
He argues that "[[there is in short **no moral difference** between
attempts to cure dysfunction and attempts to enhance function where the
enhancement protects life or
health]{.underline}]{.mark}".[2](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-2)
He does not distinguish between gene therapy on the germ line and gene
therapy on the somatic line. In his view there is in theory no moral
difference between the two practices. Harris does not agree with
disabled people who argue that gene therapy is a form of eugenics and
that discrimination against them as a group is tantamount to devaluing
them as persons. He argues that to decide not to keep a "disabled
neonate" alive no more constitutes an attack on the disabled than does
curing disability, and that to prefer to remove disability where we can
is not to prefer non-disabled individuals as
persons.[3](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-3) The wrongs that
practising eugenics may involve are, according to Harris: the assumption
that those who are genetically
weak[4](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-4) should be discouraged
from reproducing or are less morally important than other persons, and
that compulsory measures to prevent them reproducing might be
defensible. But this is not what Harris advocates: "[It is not that the
genetically weak should be discouraged from reproducing but that
everyone should be discouraged from reproducing children who will be
significantly harmed by their genetic constitution. Indeed, gene therapy
offers the prospect of enabling the genetically weak to produce and give
birth to the genetically strong]{.underline} . . . . [It
might]{.underline} thus, as we have just noted, [**enable individuals
with genetic defects to be sure of having healthy** rather than harmed
**children** and thus liberate them from the terrible dilemma of whether
or not to risk having children with genetic
defects]{.underline}".[5](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-5)
Consequently, Harris argues that there is nothing morally wrong per se
in practising eugenics,[6](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-6)
but that there is a wrong practice. The wrong practice occurs in the
moment when a majority, a collective, argues that it is defensible to
discourage and/or prevent a minority which is "genetically weak" from
reproducing. Thus, morally right eugenics does not deny the "genetically
weak" reproduction; it only prohibits or prevents the "genetically weak"
from giving birth naturally. Furthermore, [according to Harris, it is
morally wrong to produce children "who will be significantly harmed by
their genetic constitution]{.underline}". In Harris\'s view eugenics is
not wrong and it is a matter of indifference whether we call it eugenics
or not: "call it what you will, eugenics or not, we ought to be in
favour of it".[2](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-2) In the
following I will examine how Harris understands the moral continuum and
disability. The moral continuum In arguing for the moral continuum
Harris uses a hypothetical example of a woman who has five eggs
fertilised in vitro, and who wishes to use some of these embryos to
become pregnant. Normal practice at an IVF clinic would be to insert two
embryos or at most three. Harris asks us to consider the following: "If
preimplantation screening had revealed two of the embryos to possess
disabilities of one sort of another, would it be right to implant the
two embryos with disability rather than the others? Would it be right to
choose the implantation embryos randomly? Could it be defensible for a
doctor to override the wishes of the mother and implant the disabled
embryos rather than the healthy ones - would we applaud her for so
doing? The answer that I expect to all these rhetorical questions will
be obvious. It depends however on accepting that disability is somehow
disabling and therefore
undesirable".[7](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-7) Whether this
is a moral continuum depends, according to Harris, on accepting that
disability is somehow disabling and therefore undesirable. Harris asks
us whether it could be defensible for a doctor to override the wishes of
the mother and implant the disabled embryos rather than the healthy
ones? However, it is not obvious that the mother\'s wish in all
circumstances is what Harris presumes. There could be situations where
the mother wished to implant the impaired embryos, or there could be a
situation where all the embryos showed signs, at preimplantation
screening, of some impairment and the mother still wanted to implant
them. Thus, we need to distinguish, on the one hand, whether a mother\'s
or couple\'s decision is morally justified and, on the other hand,
whether the doctor is justified in overriding it. Let us consider the
following hypothetical examples. Achondroplasia Example A: A couple,
both of whom have the diagnosis achondroplasia, consider having
children. As their house and all other facilities, their car and summer
cabin, are adjusted to their situation they will have to do major
alterations in order to bring up a child of "normal" height. They have
only managed to pay some of the costs of these adjustments and cannot
see how they can afford to make new alterations in a couple of years. In
these circumstances they decide to go to an IVF clinic and ask for a
preimplantation screening for achondroplasia. The result of the
screening is that three of the five embryos have the gene for
achondroplasia. The couple decide they would like to implant the
achondroplasia embryos. Is it defensible for a doctor to override the
wishes of the couple and implant the embryos without achondroplasia
rather than those with achondroplasia? Example B: A couple with
congenital deafness consider having children. For both of them sign
language is their first language, because their parents were also deaf.
As both speak and lip read the hearing language very poorly they will
not be able to communicate with their child through speech. Facilities
in the house are adjusted to their situation and most of their friends
use sign language. Considering these circumstances they opt for the IVF
method of becoming pregnant and as the preimplantation screening shows
two embryos of five with the gene for congenital deafness they choose to
implant these. Again, is it defensible for a doctor to override the
wishes of the couple and implant the three embryos without the gene for
congenital deafness? Underlying presupposition Example C: A couple come
for a second attempt at in vitro fertilisation. They decide that this
will be their final attempt. Last time the woman had a miscarriage. This
time a preimplantation screening shows that all the embryos have some
sign of impairment. However, the couple want to try to implant the
embryos despite supposed impairments and the risk of a miscarriage. Is
it defensible for a doctor to override the wishes of the couple and not
implant any of the embryos because of presumed impairments? If Harris
considers the offspring of the couples with the diagnoses of
achondroplasia and congenital deafness to be examples of "children who
will be significantly harmed by their genetic constitution", I suppose
he would answer that it is morally wrong to implant the embryos with the
impairments under these circumstances and that the parents\' decision is
not morally justifiable. The right thing to do for the doctor in
examples A and B would thus be to override the wishes of the two
couples, if he or she were convinced that it was morally wrong to
produce "children who will be significantly harmed by their genetic
constitution". In Harris\'s terminology the doctor would not be involved
in a wrong eugenic practice because he or she is enabling the
genetically weak to reproduce and give birth to the genetically strong.
However, what about example C, is this couple\'s wish morally
justifiable? I suppose their wish is not justifiable according to Harris
if "disability" is undesirable under all circumstances. Again, we might
presume that the doctor overrides the couple\'s wish with reference to
the embryos assumed impairments. The underlying presupposition for the
doctor\'s decision might have been that even though it is better to
produce "unhealthy" children than to produce no children at all this is
provided that the "unhealthiness" does not make their lives not worth
living. Let us suppose that the doctor views the embryos\'
"unhealthiness" to be of such a kind that their lives would not be worth
living. After the births couples A and B realise that the doctor has
overridden their wishes and decide to sue the doctor on the grounds that
she or he has acted negligently in respect of their wishes. The couple
in example C sue the doctor for negligent action and a loss of a
potential child. The other two couples charge full economic compensation
for the changes that have to be made in order to raise the children, and
try to sue the doctor by bringing "wrongful life" cases. However,
according to Heyd[8](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-8) wrongful
life cases are at most, victimless crimes: "And in that respect, even if
we cannot, for logical reasons, grant legal standing to the child in its
claim for compensation, should not the negligent doctor be held
responsible for the wrong and be liable to (criminal) punishment?
Putting aside the parents\' claim, a wrong was done in the world even if
no individual can be identified as its
victim".[9](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-9) The problem with
these "wrongful life" cases in comparison to other "wrongful life"
cases, for instance where "wrongful life" is claimed because of being
born with achondroplasia, deafness etc, is that one cannot claim that a
wrong was done in the world without acknowledging thereby that
"disability" is undesirable under any circumstances. This will also be
the case with the couple in example C, where the doctor\'s overriding
decision might have prevented a child being born with, for example,
achondroplasia, deafness etc. If the judges follow Harris\'s view that
"disability" is, under any circumstances, undesirable, the couples will
not be given any compensation or approval. However, if the judges hold
that respect for parental autonomy should be given more weight than
preventing the birth of an impaired child, the doctor could be charged
for having violated parental autonomy. Examples A, B and C raise the
question of parental autonomy where impairments are stated. The practice
of genetic engineering (or treatment) challenges parental autonomy on
several levels: first, there is the possibility of resisting genetic
engineering, suggested because of supposed "genetic disorders"; second,
there is the possibility of agreeing to enhance "genetic disorders"
through gene therapy, and third there is the possibility of demanding
genetic engineering according to aesthetic standards, intellectual
abilities and so forth ("utopian eugenics"). All these examples of how
parental autonomy may be exercised raise the issue of normality. While
resisting genetic engineering (or treatment) suggests a widening of
diversities, the exercise of parental autonomy in relation to genetic
engineering of "genetic disorders"and "utopian eugenics" increases
tendencies to adopt narrow notions of normality and can provide
opportunities to stigmatise and exclude people. This is what disabled
people fear will be the result of genetic technology. In Harris\'s
thinking there is a presupposition that "disability" is undesirable
under any circumstances, otherwise there would be no motive to try to
cure or obviate "disability" in health care more
generally.[7](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-7) The crucial
question to be asked then is what is "disability"? What is disability?
Harris argues that we know pretty clearly what we mean by disability.
According to him, a disability is a physical or mental condition we have
a strong preference not to be in ourselves. What is more important, he
argues that it is a condition,which is in some sense a "harmed
condition".[10](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-10) [According
to Harris, [a disability or incapacity is disabling in some sense, and
it is a harm to those who suffer it. The "harmed condition" can be a
result of someone knowingly disabling another individual or leaving the
individual disabled when the disability could be
removed]{.mark}]{.underline}.[11](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-11)
An example of knowingly disabling an individual is provided, according
to Harris, by the case of a pregnant woman who knows that something will
have a bad effect on her fetus, knows she could remove the bad effect by
a simple dietary adjustment, and who fails to make that adjustment.
Harris further defines disability as a disabling condition relative to
active and passive intervention, that is, he defines disability as a
function of people\'s choices caused by an action or refraining from an
action. It is a condition within the individual caused by earlier
choices made by parents or professionals before, during or after
pregnancy. Harris argues that his definition avoids certain obvious
pitfalls: "First it does not define disability in terms of any
conception of normalcy. Secondly it does not depend on post hoc
ratification by the subject of the condition - it is not a prediction
about how the subject of the condition will
feel".[11](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-11) The second
element is especially important for Harris as his definition can thus be
used for the potentially self-conscious: gametes, embryos, fetuses and
neonates and for people who are temporarily unconscious; it is a
definition which does not wait upon subsequent ratification by the
person concerned. However, one pitfall Harris does not avoid is to
regard disability as an individual problem, a condition within the
subject. This understanding of disability is, within contemporary
disability studies, familiar as the medical model, where disability is
seen as a product of biological determinism or personal tragedy. This
individual, or medical, model sees disablement as a medical problem,
which affects only a small proportion of the population. Recent studies
in Britain, however, conclude that four out of every ten adult women and
men have a longstanding illness or disability. Other studies show that
internationally there are around 50 million disabled people in Europe
and approximately 500 million
worldwide.[12](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-12) Disability is
far from merely being a medical problem that can be "cured", on the
contrary it is mainly a cultural and sociopolitical problem. The medical
notion of disability, seeing disability as a cause of a limitation
within the individual, cannot account for the fact that not all people
with losses, diseases, illnesses etc experience disablement. If it were
that impairment, some functional difficulties of any kind, were
tantamount to identifying someone as a disabled person then the medical
notion of disability would have to be utterly comprehensive, exhaustive,
in order to account for an understanding of what disability is. Research
studies A comparison of three research studies carried out in Norway
showed that the number of disabled people decreased when a commonsense
definition of disability was used as a starting point. When the
definition of disability was based on self-report and common sense, the
estimate of disabled people was 15 per cent. However, when
criteria-based definitions were the starting point, 35 and 40-50 per
cent of the population were categorised as
disabled.[13](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-13) These people
were considered disabled because of certain impairments. If the medical
notion of disability is correct, stating disability as a condition
within the subject, which is disabling in some sense, then having
impairments and the experience of disablement, should coalesce. In
Harris\'s definition of disability "how the subject of the condition
will feel" is left out. Harris leaves it out because decisions about
whether individuals will come into existence have to be taken before we
can know how they will feel and therefore we have to decide on some
"objective" basis. However, as shown above the issue of identity is a
challenge to definitions that adhere to a purely medical perspective of
disability. Although Harris regards the cause of disability as relative
to active or passive intervention, his understanding of disability
comprises a causal link between having a certain condition in the
individual and being disabled. Hence, anatomy is seen as destiny. As
already mentioned, disability studies show that there is a distinction
between having an impairment and being disabled. Because of this
distinction, researchers have argued for a division between a certain
condition in the individual and
disablement.[14](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-14) To deny
that there is a necessary causal link between a certain condition in the
individual and disablement does not imply that researchers defending a
social model deny that there are such things as impairments. On the
contrary, impairment simply means that aspects of a person\'s body do
not function or they function with
difficulty.[15](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-15) What they
insist on is that whether an impairment results in disablement is
conditional on other things than merely the impairment itself. They
acknowledge the fact that individuals might regard their impairment as
positive, neutral or negative, and that this might differ according to
time and place. Hence, they favour a social model of disability where
the basis of disability is located in social conditions. Advocates for
the social model maintain that disability is a sociopolitical
construction, a product of organisation and culture rather than a
personal limitation due to a person\'s impairment, where agency and
structure are intricately knit together. Such a view implies that social
barriers, norms and values, rather than impairments, should be analysed
in determining quality of life. Debates in genethics on quality of life
often rest on an individual model of disability, hence low quality of
life is attributed to an impairment of some kind and associated with
"personal tragedy". However, it is not unusual for disabled people to
report that their lives have changed for the better following
disablement.[16](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-16) Of course
the social models do not deny that impairments can affect quality of
life but they deny a priori assumptions, on which, for example, the
practice of fetal screening for abortion and infanticide for babies with
significant impairments, rests. 'Curing disability' and discrimination
[[The main discrimination that results from the creation and
construction of disability is that various institutions refuse to give
up individual models of disability]{.mark}. The very idea of "curing"
disability is the core element in the discrimination of disabled people
because the "curing ideal" resides in conformity and normalcy. The
presupposition of the "curing" ideal makes the removal of disadvantage
contingent upon the removal or "overcoming" of impairment: in other
words, full participation in society is found through cure or
fortitud]{.underline}e.[17](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-17)
To challenge the unacceptable features of the medical model does not
imply that disabled people do not need, or see, at specific points in
their lives, the necessity of medical support. However, what is being
challenged are the social conditions and relations in which such
encounters take place, the enveloping of disabled people\'s identity in
medical terms. It is important that their voices are heard and that they
have much more effective participation in decisions which affect
them.[18](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-18) A consequence of
the medical model, in that it deals only with impairment, is that
resources are directed into impairment-related research and
intervention, whereas scant resources are channelled into social change
for the inclusion of people with impairments.
Cornes[19](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-19) found that in
relation to impairment new technology is widespread, well established
and well funded compared with technology that could lessen disabling
barriers. Another example is research within gene therapy that strives
to "cure disability", while ignoring the social and cultural factors
that make not walking, hearing, seeing etc into a problem. There is
little public questioning of the distribution of the funds between these
two approaches. The main reason this has not been an issue for
discussion is the persistence of an individual model of disability in
the culture and the social structures. [Advocates for the "curing" ideal
will argue that we cannot assume that society is obliged to undertake
changing the world for disabled people so as to render them not disabled
in all cases, rather than eliminating the impairment, especially where
doing that is
cheaper.]{.underline}[20](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-20)
Such a view rests on the assumption that impairments are primarily a
result of genetic predisposition and biological determinism. Thus,
impairments can be avoided and eliminated through abortion,
sterilisation, and infanticide or cured through somatic and germ line
therapy. This view underestimates the prevalence of disablement, which
is increasing, especially in wealthier, developed societies due to a
combination of an aging population and medical interventions which
prolong life. Research in Britain showed that four per cent of those
aged 16-64 suffered from some impairment compared to 28% of the
population over the age of
65.[21](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-21) The insistence on
individual models of disability within social structures means seeing
the "impairment" exclusively as the problem and will render the aging
population ever more disabled as the principle behind service provision
will continue to neglect disabling barriers. Approaches of the
individual model to the study of aging have been criticised for failing
to take account of external and structural factors, which influence
people\'s experience of
aging.[22](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-22) Another aspect
such a view disregards is the creating of impairments through physical
abuse, industrial accidents, unsafe environments, environmental
pollution, stress and exhaustion, war and
violence.[23](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-23) To continue to
persist with individual models of disability, equating the problem of
disability to impairments and individual conditions, is itself a
discrimination against disabled people. Historically, the right to
define has been an instrument of power in relation to minority groups
and in the oppression of, and discrimination against, people.
Conceivably, it is not a coincidence that the majority of non-disabled
people use an individual model of disability, whereas disabled
researchers use a social model of disability. Non-disabled people\'s
insistence on the right to define who is disabled or what disability is,
would in itself constitute discrimination against disabled people if the
understanding that disabled people themselves have of disability is
ignored in, for instance, academic discussions. Let us now return to
Harris\'s position. If it is correct that Harris\'s definition of
disability stems from an individual view of disability, then his
argument for claiming that gene therapy is not a form of eugenics and
discrimination against the disabled as a group, would also rest on this
presupposition. If discussions on gene therapy use individual models of
disability, dominated by biological understandings as a point of
departure, disabled people will experience these discussions as eugenics
in disguise and hence as discrimination against them. This is because
biological determinist understandings were the underlying presupposition
in the eugenic policies that, for example, were at the root of
sterilisation laws introduced in several countries in the
1930s.[24](https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/2/89#ref-24) Accordingly, in
order to have a sincere ethical debate on gene therapy comprehension
demands not just biology and rational reasoning but the methodologies of
the social sciences as well. Hence, the perspectives and empirical
evidence gained from disability studies should eventually be considered
and not ignored in philosophical research into bioethics. Conclusion
[[Individual models of disability and especially the "medical model" are
inadequate as models for explaining the phenomenon of disability. They
adhere to a causal understanding of the interplay between impairment and
disablement. As long as ethical thinking within gene therapy adheres to
a "medical model" of disability, individual differences as impairments
will be regarded as essential attributes which are given moral status.
The medical model of disability leads to value judgments by the
unimpaired in so far as they view an impairment as meaning that a person
has such poor quality of life that that life is judged, by the
unimpaired, to be not worth living. These erroneous **judgments will
only be avoided if social models of disability are taken into account
and the views of individuals with those impairments are sought and
heard**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### No solvency - exposing disability oppression does not lead to change in perception or attitude

**Donoghue 2003** (Christopher, Fordham University, Challenging the
authority of the medical definition of disability: an analysis of the
resistance to the social constructionist paradigm, Disability & Society
18.2)

**[[In an effort to debunk the]{.mark} entrenched authority of the
m[edical model, a social constructionist paradigm has been
adopted]{.mark}]{.underline}** by many disability theorists and
activists. They have suggested that society normally creates a negative
social identity for people with disabilities (Gergen, 1985; Fine & Asch,
1988; Scotch, 1988; Brzuzy, 1997). **[[Through the construction of this
identity, which is typically characterised by deviant or abnormal
behaviour, the non-disabled majority is granted a legitimate means to
exclude and isolate people with disabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As
removed members of society, their contributions are often discredited
and their successes are treated as aberrations. Likewise, the
expectations of people with disabilities are chronically low, and there
is an ever-present suggestion that their lives are not necessarily worth
living. This identity has been argued to derive from the medical model,
which defines a disability as a deficiency that restricts one's ability
to perform normal life activities. By adopting the social
constructionist viewpoint, theorists and activists have contended that
society has created disability by choosing not to remove structural
constraints that would enable more people to participate and gain access
to social resources. **[The social constructionist approach was an
effective ideological rejoinder to the established medical
model]{.underline}**. Yet the question of how to convince the
non-disabled majority that society has disabled certain individuals has
not been adequately resolved. The **[activists]{.underline}** attempted
to adopt the social constructionist theory as a basis for a minority
group model of disability. They would **[use this model to support a
plea for action to people with disabilities as a mechanism to overcome
the oppression being inflicted upon them by the non-disabled
majority]{.underline}**. While it is clear that such a transformation of
the definition of disability among academics and disability activists
has clearly taken hold, **[[the disability movement appears to have
achieved only limited success in changing the views of the non-disabled
majority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By accepting the reward of civil rights
protection without insisting that the medical model be publicly
dismantled, the hopes of the disability activists to change the views of
the broader public may have been sacrificed. The willingness to make
this concession may have stemmed from [**[the belief among social
constructionist theorists that society will change its perception of
disability if it is merely demonstrated that the prior notion has been
made unjustly]{.underline}**.]{.mark} From a structural point of view,
**[it would seem to take much more to convince a dominant group in
society that it needs to redistribute power and access to its treasured
resources.]{.underline}** [**[The more desirable arrangement to the
non-disabled majority is one that maintains the superiority of people
with 'normal' abilities]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[As a result, the
disabled are typically described as dysfunctional and are often
perceived to be incapable of understanding the world in the same way
that 'normal' people do.]{.underline}** Although **[[social
constructionists]{.underline}]{.mark}** argue that such judgements
regarding how people should be able to think or act are subjective
notions that stem from dominant social ideologies, they may be said to
**[[underestimate the extent to which those ideologies are created and
legitimated by the non-disabled majority because they best serve their
interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**The affirmative essentializes the experiences of the disabled and the
non-disabled and their perspectives on germline gene editing**

**Humphrey,** Faculty of Applied Social Sciences, The Open University
UK, **2k** (Jill C., Disability & Society, Vol. IS, No. I, "Researching
Disability Politics, Or, Some Problems with the Social Model in
Practice", Proquest, p. 64-65)

In academic texts, the social model begins with an appreciation of the
individual and collective experiences of disabled people (e.g. Swain a
al, 1993). It goes on to elaborate the nature of a disabling society in
terms of the physical environment, the political economy, the welfare
state and sedimented stereotypes (e.g. Barnes et ah, 1999). Finally, it
endorses [[a critical or emancipatory paradigm]{.underline}]{.mark} of
research (e.g. Barnes & Mercer 1997a). This analysis [[lends itself to a
recognition of the array of diverse]{.underline}
[experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} of disabling barriers; a realistic
appraisal of the need for broader political coalitions to combat
entrenched structural inequalities and cultural oppressions; and an
openness about the potential for non-disabled people to contribute to
critical theory and research[. In activist discourses, [the emphasis is
upon]{.mark} the fact that it is [non-disabled]{.mark} people [who
have]{.mark} engineered the physical environment, [dominated the
political economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, managed welfare services[,
controlled research agendas, [recycled pejorative labels and
images]{.mark}, and translated these into eugenics policies.
[This]{.mark} analysis lends itself to a [dichotomy between non-disabled
and disabled people]{.mark} which [becomes coterminous with the
dichotomy between oppressors and oppressed]{.mark}; and [this tightens
the boundaries around the disabled identity]{.mark}, the disabled
people\'s movement and disability research]{.underline}. [Whilst [this
hermeneutic closure]{.mark} is designed to ward off incursions and,
therefore, oppressions from non-disabled people, it [may]{.mark} also
[have]{.mark} some]{.underline} unfortunate consequences. I would like
to illustrate these consequences by drawing upon a research project
involving the four self-organised groups (SOGs) for women, black people,
disabled members, and lesbian and gay members in UNISON (see Humphrey,
1998, 1999). Material drawn directly from conversations and observations
in the disabled members\' group is supplemented by interview transcripts
with members of the lesbian and gay group, my own personal experiences
of and reflections upon disability and discrimination, and recent
developments in various social movements and critical research texts.
The rest of the article depicts [[three problematic consequences]{.mark}
of the social model in practice]{.underline} and redirects them back to
the social model as critical questions which need to be addressed by its
proponents. [[First]{.mark}, there are questions of [disability
identity]{.mark} where a kind of [\'purism\']{.mark} has been cultivated
from the inside of the disability community.]{.underline} Here, it
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be [[demonstrate]{.underline}]{.mark}d [[that
some people with certain]{.mark} types of [impairments have not been
welcomed]{.mark} i]{.underline}nto the disabled members1 group in
UNISON, which means that the disability community is not yet inclusive,
and that its membership has been skewed in a particular direction[.
[Second]{.mark}, there are questions of disability politics where a kind
of [\'separatism\']{.mark} has been instituted]{.underline}. Whilst the
UNISON constitution allows for separatism to be supplemented by both
coalitions and transformations, these have been slow to materialise in
practice, and the dearth of such checks and balances in the wider
disabled peoples\* movement [[implies]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the
danger of developing]{.underline} [a specific kind of disability
ghetto]{.underline}]{.mark} is more acute. [[Third]{.mark}, there are
questions of disability [research]{.mark} where a kind of
\'provisional-ism]{.underline}1 [[is suspended over the role of
researchers]{.mark}. The most obvious dilemmas arise for [the
non-disabled researcher as would-be ally]{.mark}, but it is becoming
clear that disabled academics [can]{.mark} also [be placed in a
dilemmatic position]{.mark}, and [it is doubtful]{.mark} whether [any
researcher can practise]{.mark} their [craft to]{.mark} their own
standards of [excellence]{.mark} when operating [under]{.mark} the
[provisos placed]{.mark} upon them [by political
campaigners]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Founding action towards people with disabilities upon notions of
difference]{.mark}, placing a primacy on difference particularly in the
context of incorporation, domestication, and acceptance of such
difference, [dooms the struggle for equality to
failure]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[Over recent centuries [all forms of
violent otherness have been incorporated]{.mark}, willingly or under
threat of force, [into a discourse of difference which simultaneously
implies inclusion and exclusion]{.mark}, recognition and
discrimination]{.underline} (Baudrillard, 1993, p. 129[)." [Once the
Native American "savage" became "accepted]{.mark}" under U.S. law [as
"human]{.mark}," or rather a different type of human, it was not long
until [viral hatred forced new boundaries of difference]{.mark} to be
erected]{.underline}, and segregation of such difference to be enacted
in the form of the reservation. [[Where the "savage"]{.mark} or
"monster" [is never]{.mark} understood, or [assimilated]{.mark},
[remaining radically exotic]{.mark} to the oppressive guise of society,
[when "accepted]{.mark}" by society [on the basis of "difference" viral
racism allows only two options]{.mark} for the future: [assimilation or
extermination]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Baudrillard, 1993).
[Similarly, [modern medicine]{.mark} has [facilitated society]{.mark}
with an understanding of disability, [allowing it to accept]{.mark} the
"different" or "disabled" person under law as "human," more specifically
[a "disabled human]{.mark}" in which is different from "normal"
individuals, but none the less similar]{.underline}. "Madness, once its
exclusionary status had been revoked, was caught up in the far subtler
toils of psychology (Baudrillard, 1993, p. 129)." [[As soon as society
began to]{.underline}]{.mark} understand and consequently attempt to
"[[accept]{.underline}]{.mark}" the "monster" other, [[the

"[[monsterness]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
qualities of "[[feebleness]{.underline}]{.mark}," with the social
acceptance of the others difference, the "monster" soon became the
"mongoloid." "[[Difference" annihilated the subaltern]{.mark} subject by
making all that was foreign and radically exotic within easy reach of
societal understanding. [With]{.mark} a [compassion]{.mark} rooted in

#### No solvency - disrupting the inequitable social constructions of people with disabilities is insufficient and leaves the disabled people excluded

**Dewsbury et al 4** Guy, Lancaster Univ, Karen Clarke, Lancaster Univ,
Dave Randalll, Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Mark Rouncefield Lancaster,
Ian Sommerville, Lancaster, The anti-social model of disability,
Disability & Society, 19.2 March

We do not share all **[these concerns]{.underline}** as they **[apply to
the social model of disability]{.underline}**, for we are not menaced by
constructionism, nor do we wish to promote one variety of truth claim
over another. We are concerned specifically with how this helps. The
constructionist focus, we feel, has altered our perspective on expertise
such that **[where we had previously unquestioningly accepted the
professional expertise of medical practitioners, we now equally
unquestioningly accept the expertise of the sociologist who wishes to
undermine it.]{.underline}** **[The social
constructionist]{.underline}**, that is, **[provides professional
explanation by revealing the hidden nature of the social world in and
through a number of typical steps.]{.underline}** These include: 1.
**[Showing that definitions]{.underline}** of a given concept **[are
shifting]{.underline}**, especially historically. Many social
constructionist studies draw attention to the ways in which explanations
that were accepted as matters of fact were embedded in the ideologies or
discourses of the time and can now be clearly seen as absurd or wrong.
2. **[Deriving from this that 'things could be otherwise']{.underline}**
insofar as new and 'constructionist' models can be used contrastively
with models that have preceded them, including models that still have a
currency. 3. **[Arguing that in some way this challenges the 'social
reality']{.underline}** of the concept in question. 4. **[Suggesting
that this challenge to the social reality of any given social fact has
important political consequences]{.underline}** and that the social
constructionist is pivotal in the realization of these consequences. We
think **[there may be problems here]{.underline}**, mainly with steps 3
and 4. As Hacking (1999) has convincingly shown the validity and
importance of challenges to social reality depend very much on what kind
of challenge they are. Equally, we will suggest that **[[the apparent
political importance of the constructionist position is largely
rhetorical]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is not to understate its
importance, for rhetoric is a powerful force, but [**[it does not assist
us with our 'what to do next' problem]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In
explicating the various ways in which disability is a social construct
the Social Model highlights the social features of what, on first
consideration, might appear as a purely physical problem. As Humphrey
argues: '... the social model harbours a number of virtues in redefining
disability in terms of a disabling environment, repositioning disabled
people as citizens with rights, and reconfiguring the responsibilities
for creating, sustaining and overcoming disablism' (Humphrey, 2000, p.
63). Again, there are self-evident, political, advantages in adopting
this position. As Hacking suggests, 'it **[can still be liberating
suddenly to realize that something is constructed and is not part of the
nature of things]{.underline}**, of people, or human society' (Hacking,
1999, p. 35). **[However, the metaphor has grown tired, if not tiresome,
and in the matter of what we call 'practical politics']{.underline}**,
**[that is the quite ordinary business of making-do, managing,
coping]{.underline}** (and obviously everyone 'makes do', not just
disabled people) **[that might inform the design-related questions we
want to ask, it is for the most part empty.]{.underline}** In order to
pursue this theme, **[we need to examine the sense in which the 'social
model' can be seen as 'radical']{.underline}**, **[for as with so many
similar avowals there is less to this than meets the eye]{.underline}**.
**[[Despite the supposedly 'radical' nature and claims of the social
model of disability it clearly engages in the ordinary business of
sociology]{.mark}]{.underline}** and, as Button (1991) suggests, **[[any
radical claims are readily absorbed into everyday sociological
debate]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[That is, radical political commitments
are not radical sociologies]{.underline}**---**[they are,]{.underline}**
from within a sociological perspective**[, unremarkable]{.underline}**.
Radical causes are the very stuff of conventional sociology, conducted
along conventional lines. Even, for example, **[the argument that some
current sociological approaches propagate a 'disablist' view of society
that legitimates the treatment of disabled people, whilst simultaneously
obscuring their real position within society is but a pale imitation of
earlier, similar, Feminist and Marxist arguments. The application of the
idea may be new but the idea itself, and the argument presented, is
not.]{.underline}**

## Advantage 2 -- Economic inequality

#### Germline editing is ethically justifiable -- can solve economic equality concerns with enhanced access.

**2021** GERMLINE EDITING USING CRISPR: WHY A MORATORIUM IS NOT THE
SOLUTION, 55 Fam. L.Q. 69

[[Using CRISPR to repair germline mutations that cause serious
congenital single-gene diseases is ethically
justifiable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such a use poses even fewer ethical
barriers than does IVF generally, which is minimally regulated.
Therefore, the COA erred in forbidding the FDA to even consider
clinical germline editing applications.

For certain applications[[, modifying severe single-gene diseases in
the germline using CRISPR would satisfy the FDA\'s benefit-risk
analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, where both parents will pass
on the Huntington\'s disease mutation to their children, CRISPR may be
the only potential treatment to eliminate the mutation. Evidence also
shows that public opinion strongly supports such use for CRISPR to
address serious medical conditions or diseases. [[While equal access to
the therapy poses an ethical concern, the answer is to enhance access,
rather than to reject treatments that could eliminate serious physical
or mental impairments that would substantially
limit]{.underline}]{.mark} a child\'s major [[life
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, fears of a new eugenics
movement should be allayed if the FDA
authorizes germline editing licenses only for therapies targeting severe
single-gene diseases.

[[The idea is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [commonplace]{.underline} that
income [inequality is]{.underline} inexorably [on the rise]{.underline}.
The US experience in particular has become central to a new grand
narrative prominent in public debate and taken to apply across rich
countries: [[globalisation]{.mark} and technological change have
[polarised society]{.mark} into a small elite]{.underline} with highly
paid, secure jobs on one side, [and]{.underline} on the other side are
[growing numbers]{.underline} of people, including an increasingly
"squeezed" middle class, [in insecure, poorly-paid work]{.underline}.

This growing [[inequality is held responsible for]{.underline}]{.mark} a
wide range of social and political ills. Not least the [erosion
of]{.underline} solidarity, social trust and [faith in democratic
institutions]{.underline}. And, politically, it caused the election of
Donald Trump, the UK's Brexit vote, [and the broad rise of
[populism]{.mark}]{.underline} seen as threatening democracy.

[[This]{.mark} "grand narrative]{.underline}" undoubtedly captures
important aspects of the US experience. But it **[[does not represent
the whole picture]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And as far as other rich
countries are concerned, examining the evidence highlights the diversity
of their experiences over recent decades. As I've found in my research,
[this story is more often than not [a poor fit]{.mark} for various
countries [around the world]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Different experiences

Household surveys show that income [inequality has risen significantly
since the 1980s in about two-thirds of the rich countries of the
OECD]{.underline} -- leaving one-third where it has not. The following
graph shows what has happened to the Gini coefficient, the most
commonly-used indicator of income inequality. [Inequality did not rise
everywhere and, where it did, the scale of that increase varied
widely]{.underline}. Countries such as the UK and Sweden did see
inequality go up as sharply as the US. But for others the increase was
often much more modest and even decreased for some.

Inequality rose decade by decade in the US, but the UK's increase was
mostly concentrated in the Thatcher years of the 1980s, Sweden's in the
1990s, and these contained "episodes", rather than continuous rises, are
also common elsewhere. Tax data show pre-tax income shares at the very
top increasing in many countries, but again this varies widely across
countries.

When it comes to ordinary living standards, middle class income growth
has been even more varied. The next chart shows that middle incomes have
stagnated in purchasing power terms since the early 1980s in Japan and
Italy, as well as the US, and grown only modestly in Germany. But these
are the poorest performers.

The UK, for example, saw substantial income growth around the middle
from the late 1980s up to the mid-2000s, in sharp contrast to its lack
of growth since then. Countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland and Sweden also saw periods of quite strong growth.

Crucially, [across rich countries the **[relations]{.mark}**hip [between
inequality and middle income]{.mark} growth [is **weak** -- throwing
into question]{.mark} the link]{.underline} that gets made [between
[the]{.mark} so-called [squeezed middle and populism]{.mark}. Middle
incomes have]{.underline} generally [lagged behind growth in GDP per
head but again to widely varying extents, and rising **income
[inequality is only one factor]{.mark}**. Knowing what happened to
inequality in a given country would have been of little help in
predicting whether growth in middle incomes was strong or
weak]{.underline}.

Not just the economy

The [extent to which rising inequality]{.underline} and stagnating
living standards over decades [have driven the]{.underline} recent [rise
in populism]{.underline} across the rich countries [is]{.underline} also
**[open to question]{.underline}**. Yes, the white working class
population whose livelihoods have been hurt through decades of
manufacturing decline provided the core constituency supporting Trump
for president. But [[economic dysfunction combines with cultural]{.mark}
and [demographic factors]{.mark} in a way that makes them very hard to
disentangle]{.underline}.

The fact that [[support for populist]{.mark} partie**[s]{.mark}** has
[risen]{.mark} in countries [where inequality has
been]{.mark}]{.underline} fairly [[stable]{.mark} over time (such [as
**Austria** and **France**]{.mark}),]{.underline} [as well as ones where
inequality has risen, [and]{.mark} in countries [where income growth has
been]{.mark} quite [robust (such as **Poland**)]{.mark}]{.underline},
[as well as ones where median incomes have stagnated]{.underline} (such
as Hungary), [illustrates the complexity of the factors at
work]{.underline}.

#### No risk from economic inequality -- effects are exaggerated and its declining.

Phil **Gramm** and John **Early** March 23 **2021** Wall Street Journal,
"Incredible Shrinking Income Inequality,"
<https://www.wsj.com/articles/incredible-shrinking-income-inequality-11616517284>

[[Twice over the past 50 years, the Census Bureau has significantly
changed how it collects and records income
statistics]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 1993 and 2013 the Census Bureau
changed its methods in an effort to collect better information from
high-income households. [[These changes created two major
discontinuities and distorted the time-series so that the change in
measured income inequality in those years was as much as 15 times the
average annual change]{.underline}]{.mark} found for the entire 50-year
period. At the time, the Census Bureau explained in detail what it had
done. It also explained the limitations the changes imposed on the use
of its income-inequality measure to look at changes over extended
periods. In subsequent use of the data by the Census Bureau and others,
however, those warnings have been neglected. The simple solution would
have been to isolate the distortions caused solely by the changes in
data-collection techniques and adjusted the previous years' measures to
reflect the effect of the changes. We made these adjustments and they
are shown in the nearby figure. The blue line is the actual reported
Census Bureau measurement of income inequality. The yellow line
eliminates the effects of the 1993 and 2013 discontinuities caused
solely by changes in measurement technique. The black line shows income
inequality when the value of all transfer payments received is counted
as income, income is reduced by taxes paid, and the two technical
corrections are made. Lo and behold---[[income inequality is lower than
it was 50 years ago]{.underline}]{.mark}. The raging debate over income
inequality in America calls to mind the old Will Rogers adage: "It ain't
what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It is what you do know
that ain't so." [[We are debating the alleged injustice of a supposedly
growing social problem when]{.underline}]{.mark}---for all the reasons
outlined above---[[that problem isn't growing, it's
shrinking.]{.underline}]{.mark} Those who want to transform the greatest
economic system in the history of the world ought to get their facts
straight first.

#### The best empirical evidence disproves the inequality-crisis-cooperation link

Inequality Lead to a Financial Crisis?", National Bureau of Economic

03-xx-2012

The recent [financial [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} in the U.S. [[has
been attributed to]{.mark} a rise in [inequality]{.mark}]{.underline} by
several authors. In his 2010 book, Fault Lines, Raghuram Rajan argued
that rising inequality in the past three decades led to political
pressure for redistribution that eventually came in the form of
subsidized housing finance. Political pressure was exerted so that low
income households who otherwise would not have qualified received
improved access to mortgage finance. The resulting lending boom created
a massive run-up in housing prices which reversed in 2007 and led to the
banking crisis of 2008.¶ Along these lines, Kumhof and Rancière (2011)
study the links between inequality, credit and crises complementing the
Rajan hypothesis with a DSGE model. [[In this model]{.mark}, rising
inequality]{.underline} and stagnant incomes in the lower deciles [lead
[workers]{.mark} to [borrow]{.mark} to maintain]{.underline} their
[consumption growth]{.underline}. As these households become
increasingly indebted, they continue to borrow more to maintain their
consumption. [[This]{.mark} [increases leverage,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} eventually [[a shock]{.underline}]{.mark} to
the economy [[leads to]{.underline}]{.mark} a financial
[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. They posit that their story holds both
for the 1920s stock market boom in the US and the run up to the 2008
crisis. [The focus on income inequality]{.underline} by Kumhof and
Rancière and Rajan **[is a novel approach]{.underline}** [to
understanding]{.underline} macroeconomic outcomes prior to the recent
[financial crisis]{.underline}, and to the Great Depression. [[The theme
**deserves**]{.mark} **further empirical
[scrutiny]{.mark}**]{.underline} from other time periods and countries.¶
[There is reason to wonder about the generality of this new view since
income inequality **rarely plays a significant role**]{.underline} [in
the **large literature** on financial instability and credit
booms]{.underline}. Mendoza and Terrones (2008) study the experience of
a large number of advanced and emerging economies since the 1960s
finding that current account deficits, strong economic growth and fixed
exchange rates accompanied credit booms. Borio and White (2003) have
also elaborated a view of pro-cyclical financial systems. Periods of
expected low and stable inflation, strong economic growth and
liberalized finance can give rise to complacency amongst borrowers,
lenders and regulators. Endogenous market forces that might normally
"rein in" these imbalances seem to be absent. Massive buildups in credit
lead to financial instability in this case. Income inequality plays no
active role in generating the boom-bust outcome in these contributions.
¶ In this paper, [[we present **new empirical evidence** on whether
rising inequality has **any explanatory power**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
accounting [for credit booms and financial crises]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Rather than limiting the focus to inequality as the
Rajan/Kumhof/Rancière (RKR) frameworks do, we control for more
traditional determinants of the credit cycle. Different from these
authors, [we]{.underline} also [bring evidence from **a much larger
sample**]{.underline} [than]{.underline} the [two]{.underline} unique
[periods in US economic history]{.underline} that are the focus of RKR.
Our sample is [[a panel of **14**]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly advanced
[**[countries]{.underline}** [from 1920 to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[20[08]{.mark} [covering **a wide variety** of]{.mark} boom-bust
episodes and financial [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ [[We find **very
little evidence**]{.underline} [linking credit booms and financial
crises to rising inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, **[the two
key determinants]{.underline}** of credit booms [are the upswing of the
business cycle or economic expansion and low interest rates. [This is
**very**]{.mark}]{.underline} much **[[consistent with a broader
literature]{.underline}]{.mark}** on credit cycles. While
[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark} often ticks upwards in the
expansionary phase of the business cycle, this factor **[[does not
appear to be]{.underline}]{.mark}** [a significant determinant of credit
growth]{.underline} once we condition on other macroeconomic aggregates.
Neither is income concentration [[a good predictor
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[financial crises]{.underline}]{.mark} that
often follow above average growth in credit. The anecdotal evidence from
several historical credit booms finds little support for the
inequality/crisis hypothesis.

### Warming defense

#### Extinction from warming requires [12 degrees]{.underline}, [far greater]{.underline} than their internal link, and intervening actors will solve before then 

Sebastian **Farquhar 17** leads the Global Priorities Project (GPP) at
the Centre for Effective Altruism, et al., 2017, "Existential Risk:
Diplomacy and Governance,"
https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf

[The [most likely levels of]{.mark} global [warming are very unlikely to
cause]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 The
[[existential risks]{.mark} of climate change]{.underline} instead
[[stem from tail risk]{.underline}]{.mark} climate change -- [[the low
probability of extreme]{.mark} levels of [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- [and interaction with other sources of risk]{.underline}. It is
impossible to say with confidence at what point global warming would
become severe enough to pose an existential threat. Research has
suggested that [warming of 11-[12°C would render]{.mark} most of [the
planet uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline},16 and would completely
devastate agriculture.17 This would pose an extreme threat to human
civilisation as we know it.18 Warming of around 7°C or more could
potentially produce conflict and instability on such a scale that the
indirect effects could be an existential risk, although it is extremely
uncertain how likely such scenarios are.19 Moreover, [the
[timescales]{.mark} over which such changes might happen could
[mean]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[humanity is able to
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark} enough [[to avoid extinction in even]{.mark}
very [extreme scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}. The probability of these
levels of warming depends on eventual greenhouse gas concentrations.
According to some experts, [unless strong action is taken soon by major
emitters]{.underline}, it is likely that [we will pursue a medium-high
emissions pathway]{.underline}.20 If we do, the chance of extreme
warming is highly uncertain but appears non-negligible. Current
concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher than they have been for
hundreds of thousands of years,21 which means that there are significant
unknown unknowns about how the climate system will respond. Particularly
concerning is the risk of positive feedback loops, such as the release
of vast amounts of methane from melting of the arctic permafrost, which
would cause rapid and disastrous warming.22 The economists Gernot Wagner
and Martin Weitzman have used IPCC figures (which do not include
modelling of feedback loops such as those from melting permafrost) to
estimate that [if we continue to pursue a medium-high emissions
pathway]{.underline}, the [[probability of]{.mark} eventual warming of
[6°C is]{.mark} around [10%]{.mark}]{.underline},23
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[10°C is]{.underline}]{.mark} around
[[3%]{.underline}]{.mark}.24 [[These]{.mark} estimates
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} of course [[highly
uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is likely]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the world will take action]{.mark} against climate change [once it
begins to impose]{.mark} large [costs]{.mark}]{.underline} on human
society, [[long before]{.mark} there is [warming of
10°C]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, there is significant inertia
in the climate system: there is a 25 to 50 year lag between CO2
emissions and eventual warming,25 and it is expected that 40% of the
peak concentration of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere 1,000 years
after the peak is reached.26 Consequently, it is impossible to reduce
temperatures quickly by reducing CO2 emissions. If the world does start
to face costly warming, the international community will therefore face
strong incentives to find other ways to reduce global temperatures.

#### Climate change is inevitable -- even ending emissions won't solve

Zing **Tsjeng, 19**, 2-27-2019, executive editor and the author of the
Forgotten Women book series, \"The Climate Change Paper So Depressing
It\'s Sending People to Therapy\",

\"Deep Adaptation\" is quite unlike any other academic paper. There\'s
the language (\"we are about to play Russian Roulette with the entire
human race with already two bullets loaded\"). There\'s the flashes of
dark humor (\"I was only partly joking earlier when I questioned why I
was even writing this paper\"). But most of all[, there\'s the stark
conclusions that it draws about the future]{.underline}. Chiefly, [that
[it\'s too late to stop climate change from devastating our world---and
that \"climate-induced societal collapse is now inevitable in the near
term]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} How near? About a decade. Professor Jem
Bendell, a sustainability academic at the University of Cumbria, wrote
the paper after taking a sabbatical at the end of 2017 to review and
understand the latest climate science \"properly---not sitting on the
fence anymore,\" as he puts it on the phone to me. What he found
terrified him. \"[The evidence before us suggests that we are set for
disruptive and uncontrollable levels of climate change, bringing
starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and war]{.underline},\" he
writes in the paper. \"Our norms of behavior---that we call our
\'civilization\'---may also degrade.\" \"[[It is time]{.mark},\" he
adds, \"[we consider]{.mark} the implications of [it]{.mark} being [too
late to avert a global environmental catastrophe]{.mark} in the
lifetimes of people alive today]{.underline}.\" Even a schmuck like me
is familiar with some of the evidence Bendell sets out to prove his
point. [You only needed to step outside during the record-breaking
heatwave last year to acknowledge that 17 of the 18 hottest years on the
planet have occurred since 2000. [Scientists]{.mark} already
[believe]{.mark} [we]{.mark} [are]{.mark} soon [on course for an
**ice-free Arctic**]{.mark}, [which will]{.mark} only [accelerate global
warming]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Back in 2017, even Fox News
reported [scientists\' warn]{.mark}ings that [the Earth\'s sixth mass
extinction was underway]{.mark}.]{.underline} Erik Buitenhuis, a senior
researcher at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, tells me
that Bendell\'s conclusions may sound extreme, but he agrees with the
report\'s overall assessment. \"I think societal collapse is indeed
inevitable,\" he says, though adds that \"the process is likely to take
decades to centuries.\" [The important thing, Buitenhuis says, is to
realize that the negative effects of climate change have already been
with us for some time: \"Further gradual deterioration looks much more
likely to me than a disaster within the next ten years that will be big
enough that, after that, everybody will agree the status quo is
doomed.\"]{.underline} \"Jem\'s paper is in the main well-researched and
supported by relatively mainstream climate science,\" says Professor
Rupert Read, chair of the Green House think-tank and a philosophy
academic at the University of East Anglia. \"That\'s why I\'m with him
on the fundamentals. And more and more people are.\" Read\'s key
disagreement with Bendell is his belief that we still have time to
snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, saying, \"[I think it\'s hubris
to think that we know the future.\" But that doesn\'t mean Bendell\'s
premise is wrong: \"The way I see it, [deep adaptation is]{.mark}
insurance **[against the possibility]{.mark}**---or rather, the
probability---[of]{.mark} some kind of [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
says Read. \"\'Deep Adaptation\' is saying, \'What do we need to do if
collapse is something we need to realistically plan for?\'\" [When I
speak to Bendell, he tells me he thinks of \"Deep Adaptation\" as more
of an ethical and philosophical framework, rather than a prophecy about
the future of the planet]{.underline}. \"The longer we refuse to talk
about climate change as already here and screwing with our way of
life---because we don\'t want to think like that because it\'s too
frightening or will somehow demotivate people---the less time we have to
reduce harm,\" he says with deliberation. What does he mean by harm?
\"Starvation is the first one,\" he answers, pointing to lowering
harvests of grain in Europe in 2018 due to drought that saw the EU reap
6 million tons less wheat. \"In the scientific community at the moment,
the appropriate thing is to say that 2018 was an anomaly. However, if
you look at what\'s been happening over the last few years, it isn\'t an
anomaly. There\'s a possibility that 2018 is the new best case
scenario.\" [That means, in Bendell\'s view, that governments need to
start planning emergency responses to climate change, including growing
and stockpiling food.]{.underline} He minces his words even less in his
paper: \"When I say starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and
war, I mean in your own life. With the power down, soon you won\'t have
water coming out of your tap. [You will depend on your neighbors for
food and some warmth. You will become malnourished. You won\'t know
whether to stay or go. You will fear being violently killed before
starving to death.\"]{.underline} Should people start building bunkers
and buying bulletproof vests? \"There\'s no way of getting through this
unless we try together,\" he says. \"We need to help people stay fed and
watered where they live already to reduce disruption and reduce civil
unrest as much as we can.\" Of the Silicon Valley financiers prepping
for the apocalypse in New Zealand, he says: \"Once money doesn\'t matter
anymore and the armed guards are trying to feed their starving children,
what do you think they\'ll do? The billionaires doing that are just
deluded.\" [Bendell wasn\'t always this gloomy about the state of the
world. He once worked for WWF, one of the biggest environmental
charities in the world, and in 2012 founded the Institute for Leadership
and Sustainability (IFLAS) at the University of Cumbria. [The World
Economic Forum]{.mark} named him a Young Global Leader for his work. So
how did he [end up writing]{.mark} a paper that determined [that
civilization]{.mark}---and environmental sustainability as we currently
understand it---[is doomed]{.mark}?]{.underline} \"Since the age of 15,
I\'ve been an environmentalist,\" he tells me. \"I\'ve given my life
professionally and personally. I\'m a workaholic, and it was all about
sustainability.\" Once he sat down with the data, however, he realized
that his field was quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of oncoming
climate catastrophe. \"It would mean not getting super excited about the
expansion of your recycling program in a major multinational,\" he says.
\"It\'s a completely different paradigm of what we should be looking
at.\" What he didn't expect was for the paper to take off online. \"It
was aimed at those people in my professional community and why we\'re in
denial,\" he says. \"When I put it out there, I didn't expect
15-year-olds in schools in Indonesia to be reading it with their
teachers.\" He says that \"Deep Adaptation\" has been downloaded over
110,000 times since it was released by IFLAS as an occasional paper[.
\"Someone in the alternative economics and bitcoin crowd told me, \'Oh,
everyone\'s talking about deep adaptation in London at all the dinner
parties,\'\" he laughs.]{.underline} Researchers from the Institute for
Public Policy Research (IPPR), an established progressive think-tank,
consulted Bendell\'s paper in the process of writing its new report,
\"This is a crisis: Facing up to the age of environmental breakdown.\"
Laurie Laybourn-Langton, its lead author, told me via email: \"I
appreciated the frankness of the report in facing up to issues that so
many in research and policy communities seem unwilling to. We don\'t
subscribe to the view that social collapse is inevitable, however.\" He
explains: [\"This is partly because it\'s so hard to predict the
outcomes of the complex and uncertain process of environmental shocks
interacting with social and economic systems. We simply don\'t know.
That said, they shouldn't be disregarded as a potential outcome, and so
we are calling for greater levels of preparedness to these
shocks.\"]{.underline} Not everyone was so taken with the paper. Bendell
submitted it to a well-respected academic journal for publication, with
little success. Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal
(SAMPJ) told me that the paper was in need of \"major revisions\" before
it would be ready for publication. Bendell ended up publishing it
through IFLAS and his blog. \"The academic process is such that I took
that as an effective rejection,\" he explains, saying that the reviewers
wanted him to fundamentally alter his conclusions. \"I couldn\'t
completely rewrite the paper to say that I don\'t think collapse is
inevitable. It was asking for a different paper.\" Emerald, the
scholarly publisher that owns SAMPJ, says it takes issue with how
Bendell frames its reception of its paper on his blog: \"[the study on
collapse they thought you should not read---yet.\" A spokesperson told
me: \"The decision was arrived at based on the merit of the submitted
article and the double blind peer review process integral to academia
and the advancement of knowledge]{.underline}. SAMPJ, and \[editor Carol
Adams\] are proud members of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)
and adhere to the highest ethical standards in publishing. We see no
evidence that the decision of Major Revision was politically motivated.
\"Emerald requested the author correct their blog post to reflect the
facts. This request was unfortunately ignored. The post continues to
imply the paper was rejected because it was deemed too controversial.
The paper was not rejected, and was given a Major Revision due to the
rigorous standards of the scholarly output of the journal.\" Bendell
says he did reply to Emerald\'s request to amend his blog post---but
only if they would consider telling him the decisions of those who
reviewed his paper. (Under the double blind peer review, reviewers\'
decisions are anonymous.) \"That title can be read in a number of
ways,\" he says. \"It is a paper that the reviewers didn\'t want you to
read. They didn\'t want it published.\" Climate gloom and doom is
nothing new---doomsday preppers have been stockpiling their freeze-dried
food rations for decades now. But Bendell\'s paper appears to have hit a
unique nerve, especially given that the average scientific paper is
estimated to be read by only three or so people. Rupert Read tells me
that he was sent it simultaneously by three other academics when it was
published. But it hasn't trended on Twitter[. It hasn\'t been pushed by
a celebrity. It was briefly mentioned in a Bloomberg Businessweek
article, but that\'s it. \"Deep Adaptation\" is that unique social
phenomenon: an academic paper that has gone viral through word of mouth.
Nathan Savelli, a 31-year-old high school life coach from Hamilton,
Canada, was recommended the paper by a local environmental activist.
Reading it sent him spiraling into depression. \"I guess in some ways it
felt like I was diagnosed with a terminal illness,\" he tells me. \"If
I\'m being honest, it was a mix of heartbreaking sadness and extreme
anger]{.underline}.\" Savelli felt so low that he sought help from a
climate grief support group organized by 350.org, the global grassroots
climate movement. \"I had attended counseling in the past for other
issues, but never a group session, and thought it might be something
helpful for me,\" he tells me. Did it help? \"I\'m not sure I\'d say it
alleviated my grief, but it was definitely comforting to be around
people who understood what I was feeling.\" And therein lies the problem
with \"Deep Adaptation:\" if you accept that the paper is entirely
correct in its prediction of collapse, how do you move on with your
life? How do you even get out of bed in the morning? \"I\'m aware of
what difficult emotions it triggers,\" Bendell acknowledges. \"I do
believe that if you've come across this \[paper\], then absolutely some
grief and despair is very natural. Why isn\'t that OK? We all die in the
end. Life is about impermanence.\" On his blog, he lists several sources
for psychological support, including several groups on Facebook and
LinkedIn that discuss collapse and offer help to those struggling to
come to terms with the conclusions of his paper. But, Bendell adds,
reading the paper has been \"transformative\" for some. \"People find a
new boldness about living life on their own terms---actually connecting
to their heart\'s desire. How do they wish to live, and why don\'t they
live that way now rather than postponing it?\" In one case, it even
helped prompt one high-ranking academic to quit her job and the city.
[In December of 2017, Dr. Alison Green left her post as the pro
vice-chancellor of Arden University. She had read [the **IPCC report
warn**]{.mark}ing [that the world is **nowhere near** averting global
temperature increases]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as the 1,656-page
National Climate Assessment on how climate change is now dramatically
affecting our lives---and then she read Bendell\'s paper.

## Advantage 3 -- Bioterrorism

### 1NC\-\--No CRISPR Bioterror

#### Risk of bioterror from CRISPR is crying wolf -- its too complex and no empirics

These developments prompted policymakers and security analysts to begin
pondering the security implications of CRISPR and evaluate its potential
use for bioweapons developments. [[CRISPR
scientists]{.mark}]{.underline} have themselves [[advanced several
scenarios for bioterrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the use of
gene drives to create more lethal or infectious pathogens. Some
[[scientists have argued that the expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}
required to develop gene drives [[can be acquired relatively
easily]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[an amateur
scientist could set up a lab in his garage]{.underline}]{.mark} and
develop a gene drive undetected. Additional questions that have been
raised include the following: Could CRISPR be used to introduce
antibiotic resistance into a bioweapons agent? Will CRISPR allow the
development of chimeric bioweapons --- weapons that cause the symptoms
of one disease but ravage the body with a different, undetected disease?
Echoing these concerns, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper
included gene editing in his 2016 worldwide threat assessment report to
Congress. Clapper warned, "Given the broad distribution, low cost, and
accelerated pace of development of this dual-use technology, its
deliberate or unintentional misuse might lead to far-reaching economic
and national security implications." In the fall of 2016, the
President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology called for a
new biodefense strategy that would address emerging biotechnology
threats like CRISPR that open up new possibilities for misuse. 22 At the
international level, United Nations entities are also struggling with
how to regulate and anticipate nefarious international developments in
gene-editing technologies. 23 To date, however, [most policy and public
discussions about CRISPR have focused on the technology]{.underline} ---
how it will drive new kinds of security threats --- as if it existed in
a vacuum. [This kind of technological determinism --- the belief that
technology is the primary driver of history and contemporary life ---
has underpinned many popular narratives regarding American technological
innovation since the Industrial Revolution]{.underline}. [[This way of
understanding tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, however,
**[[oversimplifies what it takes, and how long it takes, to develop,
use, and diffuse tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology
**[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** beneficial or **[[nefarious
applications]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Technology never develops and
diffuses in isolation --- it is always shaped by a variety of social
forces --- and understanding the complex interconnecting set of
push-pull factors on technology is important to getting threat
assessments right. [[Since the 1980s]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[there
have a variety of actors "crying wolf]{.underline}]{.mark}**" 4
[[engineering techniques for harm]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Yet we have
little empirical data]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the past 30 years
**[[that show a specific state or terrorist group using any of these new
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological **[[innovations to create
biological weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, [[even those who]{.mark}
are known to [have dabbled in]{.mark} applying [genetic engineering to
produce bioweapons]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., the Soviet Union)
[[encountered a series of tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological,
[[social]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[political, organizational, and economic
hurdles]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that prevented]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[development of viable weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Thus, existing
data suggest a very mixed picture on the ability of individuals, groups,
or countries to use new biotechnologies for harm]{.underline}. What the
existing data do make clear, however, is that it is not just access to,
or emergence of, science and technology that leads to a threat but how a
variety of social, economic, organizational, and political factors shape
the development and use of science and technology. This latter point is
left out of existing dystopian bio-imaginaries, but it is critical to
assess the threat posed by CRISPR or any emerging biotechnology.

### 1NC\-\--Anti-CRISPR tech

#### Anti-CRISPR technology is becoming more prevalent now

[Anti-CRISPR]{.underline} By the time Doudna drafted her proposal to
DARPA, [other scientists already had one big clue for how to stop
CRISPR]{.underline}. In the ancient struggle between bacteria and the
viruses called phage that infect them, [[phage]{.underline}]{.mark} had
[[developed their own antidotes to CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact,
their genomes, it's been found, harbor the ability to produce **[[what
is essentially CRISPR kryptonite]{.underline}]{.mark}**---small proteins
exquisitely tuned by evolution to disable the gene-editing tool.
Scientists call these molecules "[anti-CRISPRs]{.underline}." The first
anti-CRISPRs were discovered in 2013 by a student at the University of
Toronto named Joseph Bondy-Denomy. "It was serendipity. We stumbled onto
the fact that some phages seemed to be resistant to CRISPR. When we put
the phage into a cell, the bacteria couldn't protect itself," says
Bondy-Denomy, now a professor at the University of California, San
Francisco. He quickly zeroed in on one of the virus's 50 or so genes as
the reason. "We thought, wow, [[maybe this is turning off
CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}." [The number of **[labs studying such
defenses is smaller than the number working with
CRISPR]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But anti-CRISPR is becoming a booming
field in its own right. More than 40 anti-CRISPR proteins have already
been found, many by Doudna's lab. Other teams are having early success
locating conventional chemicals that can inhibit CRISPR as well. Today,
Amit Choudhary of Harvard Medical School, in Boston, also with funding
from DARPA, reported he had [[found two drugs that prevent gene-editing
when mixed with human cells]{.underline}]{.mark}. "The hallmark of any
powerful technology is control," says Choudhary. "It's that simple."
Researchers like Bondy-Denomy believe
[[anti-CRISPRs]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[have a role in improving
future gene-editing]{.underline}]{.mark} treatments, by [[giving
researchers more precise control]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, a
team in Germany recently showed if they combined CRISPR and anti-CRISPR,
they could **[[create an editor that will change DNA only in liver
cells]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not neurons or muscle. Another application
being studied is whether anti-CRISPR could create a safeguard against
"gene drives." The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is backing the
development of a CRISPR tool that will spread though wild mosquitoes,
causing their populations to crash, with the idea of preventing malaria.
Others want to develop such gene drives in mice, so they can eradicate
the rodents from islands without using poison. But what if these
experiments go haywire and lead to an extinction? Researchers think they
can create organisms with anti-CRISPR programmed into their genomes so
they're immune. In an initial proof of principle, [scientists in Kansas
last year engineered yeast cells with anti-CRISPR to resist a gene
drive]{.underline}. "[If some North Korean lab comes at you with a gene
drive to wipe out an economically important crop, you could have a
transgenic crop that \[is resistant\]. That is the drawing board
scenario]{.underline}," says Erik Sontheimer of the University of
Massachusetts Medical School.

Listed below are some constraints that show how in the US **[the

as "**[[select agents]{.underline}]{.mark}**",
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** controlled -- perhaps misuse even
[**[prevented]{.underline}** -- **[through]{.underline}** **[technical
and administrative hurdles]{.underline}**]{.mark}:

I. [**[Re-creating]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[n
already existing dangerous [virus]{.mark} for malicious intent is
a]{.underline}** **[complex]{.underline}** scientific
**[endeavor]{.underline}**. (i) **[It [requires
considerable]{.mark}]{.underline}** scientific
**[[knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}** and experience **[[and]{.mark},
more importantly, considerable [financial support]{.mark}. That support
usually comes from government and private agencies]{.underline}** (NIH,
NAF, etc.), organizations **[that carefully screen at multiple levels
all applications for funding of ALL biological research]{.underline}**.
(ii) **[It requires an]{.underline}** **[environment]{.underline}**
**[suitable for experimenting with dangerous infectious
agents]{.underline}** (**[containment]{.underline}**
**[facilities]{.underline}**). **[Any work in containment facilities is
also carefully regulated.]{.underline}**

II\. **[Genetic engineering]{.underline}** to synthesize or modify
organisms **[relies on chemical synthesis of DNA. [Synthesizing DNA
is]{.mark} automated and [carried out with]{.mark} sophisticated,
[expensive instruments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The major
problem]{.underline}** of DNA synthesis, however, **[is that [the
product is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[not error-free.
Any]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[single [mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the sequence of small DNA segments (30--60 nucleotides) or large
segments (\>500 nucleotides) [**[can]{.underline}** **[ruin the

strategies]{.mark} to produce and [deliver error free]{.mark}, synthetic
[DNA]{.mark}, which investigators can order
electronically]{.underline}** from vendors, such as Integrated DNA
Technologies (US), GenScript (US) or GeneArt (Germany). **[This offers
a]{.underline}** superb and **[easy way to]{.underline}**
**[control]{.underline}** experimental **[procedures]{.underline}**
**[carried out in any laboratory]{.underline}**: the
**[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark}** will **[[automatically scan ordered

the order will be]{.underline}** **[stalled]{.underline}** until
sufficient evidence has been provided by the investigator that she/he is
carrying out experiments approved by the authorities. The entire complex
issue of protecting society from the misuse of select agents has been
discussed in two outstanding studies \[11, 12\].

III\. **[Engineering a virus such that it will be]{.underline}**
**[more]{.underline}** **[harmful]{.underline}** (more contagious, more

[viruses]{.mark} have [evolve]{.mark}d [to proliferat]{.mark}ing

[manipulations]{.mark} of a virus often [lead to loss of fitness]{.mark}
that, in turn, is unwanted in the bioterrorist agent.]{.underline}**

### 2NC\-\--No BioWeapons

#### No bio or chemical weapon threat

**Revill 17** -- Dr. James, Research Fellow with the Harvard Sussex
Program at SPRU. "Past as Prologue? The Risk of Adoption of Chemical and
Biological Weapons by Non-State Actors in the EU", Cambridge, pg.
626-642,

The second factor is "the perceived complexity of the innovation in
terms of adoption and use".40 This is important in the innovation
literature, as Rogers remarked, "**[\[t\]he [complexity of]{.mark} an
[innovation]{.mark},]{.underline}** as perceived by members of a social
system, **[[is negatively related to its rate of
adoption]{.underline}]{.mark}**".41 Several **[scholars of terrorist
innovation have also highlighted the issue of
complexity]{.underline}**;42 or, as Cragin et al have stated, "\[h\]ow
simple or complex a technology appears affects perceptions of how risky
it will be to adopt."43

**[In [most]{.mark} cases [terrorist groups]{.mark} appear to have
largely [opted for the simplest pathway]{.mark} towards the achievement
of their goals and]{.underline}** **[the weapons used tend to be
vernacular, functional devices [drawing on local and readily-available
materials, rather than sophisticated]{.mark}, "baroque"
[technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is certainly the case with
IEDs, the history of which is characterised largely by incremental
innovations -- although nevertheless frequently effective ones -- with
many means of delivery recycled from the past.44 Complexity can
therefore be seen as important in the adoption of technology by
terrorists generally, but is perhaps particularly acute in the case of
CBW technology.

Some CBW can be relatively simple: "chlorine-augmented, vehicle-borne
IEDs," as employed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) from 2006 to 2007 are not
sophisticated weapons.45 Attacks on chemical production facilities, an
apparent tactic of Serbian forces in the early to mid-1990s,46 employed
relatively simple technologies -- specifically explosives -- with
toxicity a secondary by-product. Direct contamination of food,47 drink48
or healthcare products49 does not require particularly sophisticated
technology for the purposes of delivery -- although may require some
considerable skill to culture and scale-up a biological agent -- and has
been a common approach in European CBW incidents.50 Similarly, the
contamination of water systems, something familiar to Europe,51 can also
be relatively easily attempted. However, in most cases such methods of
dissemination have generated results that are far short of the "mass
destruction" that CBW are associated with, although this does not mean
such a possibility can be ignored by those working on public health
preparedness.

Although some relatively simple approaches could cause significant harm,
**[[mass casualty attacks]{.mark} still [require considerable
expertise]{.mark}, something [particularly]{.mark} acute [in the context
of bio]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.52 **[The most
effective route to weaponising biology is arguably]{.underline}**
through the process of **[[aerosolising]{.mark} agents]{.underline}**,
something recognised mid-way through the last century as opening up the
theoretical possibility of using biological weapons on a gigantic
scale.53

However, **[realising such theoretical potential [is difficult]{.mark}
and [it took states decades to develop]{.mark} more [predictable
biological weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}**s,54 **[and [even then such
weapons were acutely vulnerable to environmental
factors]{.mark}]{.underline}**.55 **[[For non-state groups such
complexity has proven a significant barrier]{.mark} to CBW
development]{.underline}**. By means of an example, **[one of the
best-resourced biological weapons programs]{.underline}**, that of
**[Aum Shinrikyo, failed variously because the group acquired the wrong
strain, contaminated fermenters and were faced with insurmountable
production and dissemination difficulties]{.underline}**.56 **[There are
of course exceptions, such as the 2001 [anthrax]{.mark} Letter
Attacks]{.underline}** in the US. However, **[if one accepts the
conclusions of the FBI that this sophisticated attack]{.underline}**
with aerosolised anthrax in the US postal system **[was perpetrated by a
US biodefence researcher, Dr]{.underline}** Bruce
**[Ivins,]{.underline}**57 **[it [is an exception that proves the
rule]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[To circumvent]{.underline}** the difficulties with **[aerosolisation,
arguably one could use [human-to-human
transmissible]{.mark}]{.underline}** biological agents as part of a
suicide bioterror operation. There are good reasons for concern over how
crude suicide bioterrorists could employ such a tactic. **[However, the
use of highly contagious agents [is]{.mark} also [poorly
predictable]{.mark} and would have to deal with social factors, such as
the "spatial contact process among individuals"]{.underline}**, which
can spell "out the difference between large-scale epidemics and abortive
ones".58

**[The counter to this argument is the growing access to data and the
changing human geography of the life sciences]{.underline}**. Some 83%
of European households reportedly **[are [online]{.mark}, effectively
allowing access to what is a growing body of available data on CBW,
including so-called bioterrorist "[recipes" and
"blueprints]{.mark}]{.underline}**" that are available in both
mainstream scientific as well as more subversive literatures online. It
is also clear that there is a changing human geography in European life
sciences (for peaceful purposes), with the emergence of 30 DIY-bio
groups located in Europe59 and some 80 European teams in the
international Genetically Engineered Machines (IGEM) competition in
2016.60 **[This is compounded by reports that groups such as Daesh have
deliberately sought to recruit foreign fighters "including some with
degrees in physics, chemistry, and computer science]{.underline}**, who
experts believe have the ability to manufacture lethal weapons from raw
substances".61

Whilst it would be unwise to ignore such developments, **[[there is a
need for caution in looking at the extent to which new
tech]{.mark}nologies [and geographies]{.mark} will [facilitate]{.mark}
the [adoption of chemical and bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** by groups seeking to target European
countries. First, **[[data is not information, and info]{.mark}rmation
[is not knowledge]{.mark}, let alone the tacit knowledge [required for
CBW]{.mark}]{.underline}**.62 In many cases **[a degree of determination
and dedication will be required merely to separate online fantasy from
fact and identify operationally useful information]{.underline}** (of
relevance to the European context) from nonsense (or information
pertinent to contexts other than Europe). Second, with new technologies
there is the potential for such tools to enable some, but certainly not
all, actors, and **[[even then new technologies bring]{.mark} new
[challenges. CRISPR]{.mark}, gene editing technology]{.underline}** is
currently seen as a particular source of promise and peril, **[which
purportedly enables "even largely untrained people to manipulate the
very essence of life]{.underline}**".63 As much may be technically true,
**[yet "untrained people" would nonetheless [require]{.mark} some
[guidance in identifying suitable areas of genetic]{.mark} [structures
to manipulate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[CRISPR [would only
get aspiring weaponeers so far]{.mark}, with the process of culturing,
scaling-up and weaponisation [still requiring considerable attention and
interdisciplinary skills]{.mark}, typically generated through "large
interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, and
technicians]{.underline}**",64 **[in order [to be
effective]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Indeed, **[for all the progress in science and technology, biological
weapons are still not used, in part, because of the complexity of such
weapons]{.underline}**; and the chemical weapons that are used today are
largely the same as the chemical weapons of 100 years ago. As Robinson
noted "It remains the case today that, in the design of CBW,
increasingly severe technological constraint sets in as the
mass-destruction end of the spectrum is approached: **[the greater and
more assured the area-effectiveness sought for the weapon, the greater
the practical difficulties of achieving]{.underline}** it".65

**[Mousepox and [bird flu]{.mark}]{.underline}** (H5N1) experiments
**[[are]{.mark} frequently [cited]{.mark}]{.underline}** to demonstrate
how dangerous new pathogens could be designed. But assessments of this
threat tend to overlook a salient fact: **[In both these
experiments]{.underline}**, **[the [researchers did not actually design
the pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With respect to H5N1, researchers
had indeed been trying to design an air-transmissible virus variant for
some time, without success. The ferret experiment was set up as an
alternative approach, to see whether natural mutations could generate an
air-transmissible variant. **[The [researchers had no influence
on]{.mark} the specific [mutations]{.mark} induced]{.underline}**. In
the mousepox experiment, researchers inserted the gene for interleukin-4
into the mousepox virus to induce infertility in mice and serve as an
infectious contraceptive for pest control. The result---that the altered
virus was lethal to mice---was unanticipated by the researchers. In
other words, it was not planned.

Moreover, some of **[the [key lessons]{.mark} that came out of the

the]{.underline}** **[[trade-offs between improving

Given the broad scope and scale of this growing threat, **[the United
States should take a series of actions to mitigate the
risks]{.underline}**, without unduly stunting the growth of the
biotechnology field. [To date, bioterrorist attacks have been low-risk,
high-impact events]{.underline}. **[While they have been extremely rare,
their frequency will only increase as will their
ramifications]{.underline}**. However, **[overregulating the spread of
biotechnological tools could stunt innovation and the profound potential
of this increasingly important sector]{.underline}**. Furthermore,
[existing methods of preventing bioterrorism may no longer be
effective]{.underline}. [The government could previously monitor the
purchase of expensive and dangerous biotechnology tools and the
laboratories that owned them in large quantities. **This is no longer
possible**]{.underline} to the same degree when such tools are
increasingly cheap, widespread, and usable in a garage. The FBI is
currently attempting to address this risk by building relationships with
the iGEM community and with life scientists so that they can report
suspicious behavior. These [efforts]{.underline} should continue, but
[are wildly insufficient]{.underline}, since some bioterrorists may have
minimal contact with the larger community of biologists and biology
hobbyists. The [release of a bioweapon by a terrorist]{.underline}, if
left unchecked, **[could spread throughout the globe]{.underline}**,
[just as a naturally occurring pandemic would]{.underline}. Thus, one
major step that the United States should take is to establish improved
responses to disease outbreaks, particularly learning from COVID-19.
This should include building a larger stockpile of PPE and establishing
a set of clear step-by-step actions to be taken in the event of an
attack. Building resilience in this fashion will not prevent
bioterrorism, but it will mitigate its effects, and may slightly
disincentivize utilizing bioweapons to cause terror. Beyond this, [the
United States should secure its laboratories and the data
within,]{.underline} as terrorists could leverage that knowledge to
build bioweapons. For example, **[new technology allows pathogens to be
synthesized from the data describing their genetic
sequences]{.underline}**. In a recent controversial study, scientists
published a methodology that would allow horsepox virus, a virus very
similar to one that causes smallpox, to be synthesized. This [research
was conducted with a noble]{.underline} [goal]{.underline}:
[understanding]{.underline} how [the horsepox virus]{.underline} could
be used as a potential treatment for cancer. **[However, it had
significant dual-use implications]{.underline}**. [Research like this
should not be banned outright]{.underline}, but [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates should establish norms to evaluate whether it is
worth the risk before such research is conducted, and then ensure that
it is conducted and the results published in the most secure ways.
Replicability is an important part of science, but the general public
should not be able to replicate the most dangerous experiments. Where
building resilience would reduce the impact of a bioterror incident,
restricting access to dual-use methodologies will reduce the likelihood
of one occurring in the first place. Finally, enforcing domestic
standards is not enough. Pathogens spread across borders, and the
spillover effects of even a targeted bioterrorist attack could kill many
unintended victims. Thus, the United States must work with other
countries to protect against the bioterrorist threat, monitor the
emergence of new viruses and bacteria that could be leveraged for a
bioweapon, limit access to the most dangerous pathogens (and data
associated with those), and build global response networks in the event
of an attack. Importantly, this collaboration should emphasize working
with allies, but should also include adversaries: if China or Russia
remain unregulated, an attack within their borders would still affect
the United States and its allies. **[[Emerging biotechnology will result
in new medicines and medical techniques]{.mark}, a [greater
understanding of how pathogens function and spread]{.mark} (and [thus a
better understanding of how to combat them]{.mark}), [a healthier
populace, innovative new capabilities that could transform daily life,
and greater engagement with the biological
sciences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While ensuring that these benefits are
maintained, the United States and its allies and partners must take
logical steps to protect themselves from the worst-case scenarios. The
risk of bioterrorism is growing, and the United States must be prepared
to face the future.

Lastly, it is important to remember that any global governance structure
that comes from a treaty or declaration is only intended to bind or
influence individual nation-states, assuming that parties to such
treaties would use their own national legal framework to enforce
relevant matters in their jurisdiction. However, [[the relevant matters
that national governments generally tackle are not always easily
enforceable or identifiable in this rapidly changing world of
bio-medical advancements]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [[there is
already a growing movement of DIY-Bio or "bio-hackers," who are buying

#### Ban fails -- never been broad social consensus, and a benchmark for use is totally unrealistic.

Proposal for global moratorium on editing of inherited DNA is met with
criticism
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/13/health/inherited-dna-editing-moratorium-study/index.html

[Sarah Norcross,](https://www.progress.org.uk/sarahnorcross) director of
the Progress Educational Trust, a nonprofit promoting public
understanding of reproductive and genetic science, told the Science
Media Centre that [[a new moratorium \"is neither necessary nor
useful]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" A moratorium would not have deterred
Jiankui, said Norcross, who also had no role in the commentary. She
added that he \"acted secretively and in breach of a clear scientific
consensus that germline genome editing should not be used in the clinic
at this time.\" Even more, she believes that his practices were
\"scientifically and ethically unsound in so many different ways, that
they would have been wrong regardless of whether or not they involved
germline genome editing.\" Her nonprofit, which frequently organizes
public events, has found \"that [[people do not worry specifically about
changing the germline,]{.underline}]{.mark}\" she said. \"[[They are
more concerned with whether or not specific applications of genome
editing are medically warranted]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" O\'Neill was
skeptical for yet another reason: [\"[There has never been a broad
societal consensus about anything in any country, not even the
allocation of human rights, so expecting this as a benchmark for
clinical adoption of germline therapy is
unrealistic.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Easy for CRISPR technology to be used outside of laboratories -- no way a ban can solve.

[[The CRISPR-Cas9 system]{.underline}]{.mark} (hereinafter CRISPR for
short) [[is unique in that, not only is it cheaper]{.underline}]{.mark}
than other genetic engineering technologies, but in comparison, [[is
easier to use and is more precise]{.underline}]{.mark} . According to
the University of California, Berkeley, anyone can make tens of
thousands of precisely guided probes covering an organism's entire
genome for less than \$100 in supplies49 . These developments lend
themselves to widespread accessibility, [[it's use is no longer limited
to a lab]{.underline}]{.mark}, schoolchildren are using it in their
classrooms50 and [[you can even buy a DIY kit online for
\$150]{.underline}]{.mark}. These key features make CRISPR the most
popular system on the market52[[. It has become so popular that it has
been dubbed "the rock star tool of biolog]{.underline}]{.mark}y53 " by
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, even boasting
an annual fan convention called CRISPRcon54. In 2015 CRISPR was named
Science's Breakthrough of the Year55 . Despite its popularity, many
scientists remain wary of ethical dilemmas and practical dangers, even
by Jennifer Doudna, one of its own co-inventors. Doudna described in her
book, A Crack in Creation: The New Power to Control Evolution, that the
early years after publishing her work, she had a reoccurring a nightmare
of Hitler coming up to her with pig-like features wanting to learn about
CRISPR56 . Dawn Sinclair Shapira, filmmaker of "The State of Eugenics,"
says, "in the wrong hands could become a tool of oppression57." There
are two major debates58: (a) germline editing versus somatic editing and
(b) therapy versus enhancement. I will discuss these in turn.

"A case against a moratorium on germline gene editing" G Owen

specializing in applied ethics. He has published a variety of topics in
that area, including research ethics, food ethics, human enhancement,

Accessed 6/29/22 T.T

[[Should researchers put the brakes on genetically engineering
babies?]{.underline}]{.mark} Leading scientists and ethicists
recently [called for a
moratorium](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-00726-5) on clinical
applications of [germline gene
editing](https://theconversation.com/editing-genes-shouldnt-be-too-scary-unless-they-are-the-ones-that-get-passed-to-future-generations-113627):
inheritable alterations to the DNA of embryos to improve kids' health or
other features -- or just "gene editing," for short. This declaration
was prompted in part by the birth last year of the [first gene-edited
babies](https://www.apnews.com/4997bb7aa36c45449b488e19ac83e86d) in
China. The birth was [roundly
condemned](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0) by
experts and [may
result](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2182964/china-confirms-gene-edited-babies-blames-scientist-he-jiankui) in
charges against He Jiankui, the [lead scientist
involved](https://theconversation.com/us/topics/he-jiankui-63070). The
call for a moratorium is grounded in two main concerns. Its supporters
assert, first, that the risks of gene editing are simply too uncertain
and potentially large to proceed. Secondly, the deeply controversial
nature and potential social impact of altering human DNA means
researchers need "[broad societal
consensus](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a)"
before proceeding. The authors suggest a five-year pause to wait for
more scientific progress and public dialogue. At that point, the authors
propose, societies may choose to begin a path forward for gene editing,
if risks are deemed acceptable and the process is fully transparent
[[Already, [over 30
countries](https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7827-12-108) prohibit]{.underline}]{.mark}
this sort of [[gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[either by [law,
regulation or enforceable
guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad6778)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
For this reason, it was quite easy for the director of the U.S. National
Institutes of Health to [endorse the proposed
moratorium](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-supports-international-moratorium-clinical-application-germline-editing) --
the NIH, the [largest public funder of biomedical research in the
world](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/impact-nih-research/our-society),
is already prohibited by law from funding clinical applications of gene
editing. So [[a moratorium is at best redundant in those nations,
perpetuating the status quo]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[**It is also liable
to cause confusion**. If a country]{.underline}]{.mark} or scientific
body [[announces a moratorium as recommended, this could misleadingly
imply that germline editing was previously]{.underline}]{.mark}
permitted and [[unregulated]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[It could also
suggest that some countries' bans will expire in five years, when
currently none has a time-limited prohibition.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Its safe / works

#### Not unsafe -- viable experiments have been done according to safety guideline and it will only get better as it advances.

research on human embryos Julian Savulescu, Jonathan Pugh, Thomas
Douglas, Christopher Gyngell Protein Cell 2015, 6(7):476--479 DOI
10.1007/s13238-015-0184-y

[[The clearest ethical concerns regarding current gene editing
techniques is that they are unsafe]{.underline}]{.mark}. The study by
Huang and co-authors showed that current gene editing techniques can
lead to a large number of off-target mutations. This could cause
significant defects and disabilities in any individuals born as the
result of the research. While some research suggests there are ways to
edit genes that greatly reduce the number of off-target mutations (Iyer
et al., 2015), it would be highly unethical to bring modified human
embryos to term unless we were very confident that the technique could
be used safely. The risk would simply not be justified by any potential
benefits. [[However this doesn't justify a moratorium on gene editing
research]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is already global agreement that no
experiments should be conducted where there is a high risk of harm to
the participant, and a low chance of benefit. [[There is already a
moratorium on unsafe research and we don't need a further moratorium on
unsafe gene editing research]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is possible to do
this research so that the risk is reasonable to any future child
resulting from the future use of such techniques therapeutically. As the
study by Huang and co-authors shows, [[much research on gene editing can
be conducted now that satisfies global safety
guidelines]{.underline}]{.mark}. This research was carried out using
tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes, which have one oocyte nucleus and two sperm
nuclei. Polyspermic zygotes such as these occur naturally in ∼2%--5% of
zygotes during in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinical trials. Crucially,
these zygotes invariably fail to develop normally in vivo (Munné and
Cohen, 1998), so they are not considered to be viable for implantation.
They will never produce a live baby. Since trialling the CRISPR system
in these zygotes had no chance of resulting in a live birth, [[it is
unclear how the study could harm or wrong anyone
directly]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[In fact, this research is important
precisely because it increases our understanding about some of the risks
involved in targeting humans]{.mark}]{.underline} with current gene
editing techniques. One of the stated aims of the research was to
determine the frequency of off-target effects when CRISPR is used in
human embryos. [[This type of research is important for increasing our
understanding of the types of challenges involved in advancing gene
editing techniques to the point where they can be used
therapeutically]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Germline editing in humans work and have been successful -- the tech has diffused around the globe

In 2015, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats) ushered a "huge revolution" in gene editing by "effectively
democratiz\[ing\] the technology so that everyone is using it."33 It is
now allowing researchers to cheaply and quickly change the DNA of almost
any organism, including human.34 The CRISPR technique relies on a class
of enzymes (called "Cas" for "CRISPR-associated," Cas9 in particular)
that uses a guide RNA molecule to pinpoint its target DNA that then
edits the DNA to disrupt genes or to insert desired sequences.
Researchers typically need to order only the RNA fragment, as the other
components can be bought off the shelf. The total cost of gene editing
is as little as \$30, and the technique is even taught in middle-school
science classes.35 [[CRISPR's affordability, availability, and ease of
use increase the prospects of its misuse "not only by a malicious actor
but also through acciden]{.underline}]{.mark}t."[[36 Technologies such
as CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark} are, as the US intelligence community's
2016 worldwide threat assessment put it, "almost always dual-use" and
"[[diffuse rapidly around the globe."]{.underline}]{.mark}37 And
research is gradually overcoming its technical limitations. In 2015, the
first human embryos were genetically engineered using CRISPR.38
Efficiency was low, some cells were altered while others were not within
the same embryo, and "off-target" mutations were observed. However, [[in
just two years]{.underline}]{.mark}, these [[problems were largely
overcome. Scientists repaired a severe disease-causing mutation by
successfully editing genes in human embryos. In the ensuing embryos, all
cells were mutation-free, and there was no evidence of off-target
mutations]{.underline}]{.mark}.39

### Disease turn

Last year, the first attempt to genetically modify human embryos in the
United States was reported and sparked a huge debate (Ma et al., 2017).
[[Although the first human germline modification was only performed two
years ago, the study showed]{.mark} that [rapid advances in technology
has allowed the rate of off-target effects]{.mark} and mosaicism [to be
reduced considerably]{.mark}]{.underline} (Liang et al., 2015).
Recently, [Vertex and CRISPR therapeutics collaborated and developed
CTX001, the first CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy, targeting patients with
β-thalassemia and have begun phase 1/2 clinical trials. [With policies
and technologies regarding genome editing both developing rapidly,
explorations into the possibility of clinical gene editing for hundreds
of hereditary diseases are starting to become achievable.]{.mark} Here,
we address the progress of human embryo editing technologies so far and
its promise and risks in advancing therapy for hereditary
diseases.]{.underline} [Researchers have utilized genome editing
techniques to modify genetic sequences in somatic cells and germline
cells to conduct basic research on gene function or disease
treatment.]{.underline} Genetic modifications to a somatic cell are
generally non-heritable as they do not contribute to gametes. However,
researchers have utilized tetraploid complementation to produce
genetically modified offspring from modified mouse and rat pluripotent
stem cells (Eggan et al., 2002; Li et al., 2017c). On the other hand,
genetic editing to an organism's germ cells is more universally
applicable and will result in the natural inheritance of the modified
genome in its offspring. As current genome editing technology often
introduces off-target effects such as chromosomal translocations or
insertion-deletions (indels) resulting in undesired loss or gain of
functions of genes, which is a safety concern when dealing with the
human germline (Corrigan-Curay et al., 2015), the potential of genome
editing to overcome genetic diseases is therefore held back by the risk
of creating more genetic complications or even irreversibly altering the
human germline through nondescript mutations. [[Genome editing research
is]{.mark} rather [commonplace nowadays]{.mark}, with
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification being at the forefront since
its first adaptation into eukaryotic cells]{.underline} (Abrahimi et
al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016; Cong et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2014; Iyer
et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017b; Mali et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2016;
Noel et al., 2018; Sato et al., 2015; Savic et al., 2018; Schwank et
al., 2013; Shalem et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014; Slaymaker et al.,
2016; Wu et al., 2013). [[The diverse amounts of]{.mark} ex vivo and in
vivo [experiments]{.mark} conducted [have resulted in the genome
editing]{.mark} protocol [to be significantly improved in the last 5
years]{.mark}. Today, nuclease delivery into cells for genome editing
can be either in the form of RNA or protein for enhanced kinetics of
action and nuclease turnover, while also preventing integration of
exogenous DNA into the host genome]{.underline} (Abou-El-Enein et al.,
2017). [Efficient and precise gene correction for mutations takes
advantage of the cell cycle, relying on the homology-directed repair
(HDR) pathway which functions in the late S--G2 phase]{.underline}
(Chapman et al., 2012; Heyer et al., 2010). In the recent year,
[germline editing has become a hot topic in scientific
research.]{.underline} **[[CRISPR]{.mark}/Cas9 microinjections into
mouse zygotes [have been shown to correct disease]{.mark} associated
mutations, producing healthy adult animals]{.underline}** (Wang et al.,
2013; Wu et al., 2013). Likewise, [CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN have both
effectively generated germline mutations in fertilized monkey
embryos]{.underline} (Liu et al., 2014; Niu et al., 2014). [With
numerous successes in both somatic and germline genome editing in animal
models, **[researchers have started to consider the possibility of
translating the protocol to edit the human genome for clinical
purposes]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Cornu et al., 2017). For the first
time, [[US N]{.mark}ational [A]{.mark}cademy of [S]{.mark}ciences [and
N]{.mark}ational [A]{.mark}cademy of [M]{.mark}edicine [relaxed stance
on modification of germline in February 2015]{.mark} followed by the
first reports of gene editing in human embryos.]{.underline}
Tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes which were discarded from clinics were used
by a group in China to attempt CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of
human endogenous β-globin gene (HBB). They found that the efficiency of
single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) mediated HDR was low and
successfully edited embryos exhibited mosaicism i.e., only a portion of
the cells were successfully modified, while the remaining cells remained
as wild type (Liang et al., 2015). In addition, whole-exome sequencing
revealed off-target mutations in these 3PN embryos. Moreover, the
researchers identified that although the endogenous delta-globin gene
(HBD), a HBB homolog, also functions as a template to compete with
ssODNs for HDR repair, majority of the double-stranded breaks (DSBs)
caused by Cas9 were repaired through the unideal error-prone
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway.

#### Germline editing is what is necessary to eliminate genes that causes diseases -- especially those with significant genetic difficulties.

[[Germline editing could eliminate genes that cause
disease]{.underline}]{.mark}, which could positively affect the
treatment of illnesses. [[Somatic gene editing has proven its
potential]{.underline}]{.mark} to be a tool for disease treatment and
prevention: in 2015, gene therapies were already being used to treat eye
disease, and further trials demonstrate that this type of gene editing
may be effective in treating certain blood disorders.39 With regard to
germline editing, screening embryos and using in vitro fertilization is
an existing method of avoiding genetically inherited diseases like
Huntington's. [[However, germline editing could
potentially]{.underline}]{.mark} [[completely eliminate these diseases
and allow couples who would otherwise fear passing these characteristics
to their offspring to parent children genetically related to
them]{.underline}]{.mark}.40

#### Germline genetic editing allows for disease prevention

<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491>

Assisted reproductive techniques are practised with prior consent by
parents. However, widely accepted assisted reproductive techniques such
as IVF involve no intentional genetic intervention. Therefore, under
what conditions does parental consent justify the germline genetic
intervention from the viewpoint of a child\'s welfare? Consider the UK
regulatory framework on mitochondrial transfer ([HFEA,
2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491#bib0160)).
Such intervention is deemed legal provided the germline modification
focuses mtDNA (not nuclear DNA) and intends to prevent the maternal
transmission of 'serious' mitochondrial disease to offspring. This is
employed when a mother carries the risk of transmitting the disease to
the child. Its practice is limited to serious conditions among various
forms of mitochondrial disease. Similarly, disease prevention via
germline genome editing might be accepted in some countries. Notably, in
the International Summit on Human Gene Editing, mitochondrial disease
was addressed as a candidate for germline genome editing ([NASEM,
2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491#bib0170)).
Interestingly, the elimination of pathogenic mtDNA using mito TALEN
(mitochondria-targeted nucleases to selectively reduce mtDNA haplotypes)
requires no oocyte donation, which is indispensable for mitochondrial
donation in the UK ([Reddy et al.,
2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491#bib0100)).
Aside from cases of serious mitochondrial disease, the use of germline
genome editing seems compelling in cases of definite inheritance of a
serious or life-threating autosomal genetic disorder where
preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is inapplicable, such as
autosomal dominant diseases in which one or both parents is homozygous
(e.g. Huntington disease) or autosomal recessive diseases where both
parents are homozygous (e.g. cystic fibrosis) ([Ishii,
2015b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491#bib0055)).
At least four reports have demonstrated that genome editing-mediated
gene correction and the recovery of phenotypes are feasible in mouse and
rat experiments ([Ishii,
2015a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491#bib0050)).
In such rare cases, the benefits of genome editing for a prospective
child is likely to exceed the risks, such as the failure of disease
prevention and off-target mutations ([Ishii,
2015a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491#bib0050),
[Ishii,
2015b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648316305491#bib0055)).
Therefore, parental consent for germline genome editing might be
justifiable.

In an Atlantic Council panel on gene editing in September 2016, Dr.Dr.
Pierre Noel, a professor at the Mayo Clinic and a non-resident fellow at
the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security, agreed the
technique could be a threat. "It's possible that in the future, as the
technology becomes more sophisticated, [[countries may be able to
implement gene-editing tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[to
design]{.underline}]{.mark}...[[super
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}...[with great muscle force and
strength]{.underline}." [The main concern about gene-editing and its
potential danger is the ease of obtaining "CRISPR toolkits for less than
\$50]{.underline}." In May of this year, the web site Futurism
chronicled how organizations organizations routinely distribute the kits
around the world. Addgene, a nonprofit DNA molecule repository in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, has sent "thousands of CRISPR toolkits to
researchers in more than 80 countries," according to Futurism. [One of
those countries is China]{.underline}. [Chinese researchers use Addgene
frequently]{.underline}. They have made over 10,000 requests for CRISPR
plasmids (separated DNA molecules) and hundreds of deposits of plasmids
in the Addgene repository. The organization also has a distributor in
Beijing. [Russian researchers work with Addgene too and the nonprofit

also does not ship to "Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria." While

Chinese military scientists are using the technique to produce proteins
of human blood called albumin in baby pigs. **[Military researchers are
improving CRISPR gene splicing with their own innovative light-induced
editing systems]{.underline}**. Other studies focus on improving cancer
drug resistance. The Chinese military is also investigating removing
Hepatitis-B virus DNA with CRISPR. The main civilian CRISPR laboratories
appear to be affiliated with Chinese Academy of Sciences, particularly
its Institute of Neuroscience at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological
Sciences. These centers alone have dozens of labs with at least 50
scientists who could be working on gene editing at any given time. And
that estimated number is just in neuroscience. That does not count all
the Chinese CRISPR researchers who are toiling in human bioscience or
animal biology. These civilian scientists are speeding through
experiments with monkeys and mice. But **[[more worrisome are]{.mark}
this year's [Chinese CRISPR breakthroughs in human
embryos]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The United States has banned CRISPR
techniques conducted on human embryos. American Biotechnology Firms
Could Be Unwittingly Helping China China has leapt forward in CRISPR
research mostly because of significant government funding. [[Gene
editing has]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[been]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[high priority by the People's
Liberation Army]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Another factor in Chinese
scientific development could be the growth of the American biotech
sector that is dedicated to gene-editing. Some U.S. firms consider China
a huge export market for CRISPR technology. At least four of these U.S.
companies have some connection to China. CRISPR Therapeutics in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, has developed its own proprietary gene-editing
platform. It has raised \$89 million in venture funding. The firm
announced in June that it has received a Chinese patent for its
CRISPR/Cas 9 Genome Editing system. GeneCopoeia, in Rockville, Maryland,
sells numerous CRISPR tools. The firm has a Chinese product distributor
at the Guangzhou Science Park. GenScript in Piscataway, New Jersey, has
an office in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. It recently announced in March
it is working with a genetic science foundation to "engage and expand
the synthetic biology research community in China." GENEWIZ, with its
headquarters in New Jersey, has numerous services in genome editing and
engineering, including the field of synthetic biology. GENEWIZ has
worked with the National Key Laboratory of Biotherapy of Sichuan
University in China to synthesize Zika virus key genes. I am in no way
claiming that these non-profit and for-profit entities are doing
anything improper, unethical, or unlawful. There is a high demand for
CRISPR products and services in China, and these organizations are
simply meeting that demand in a free market system. There have been a
handful of Congressional hearings on CRISPR, but it does not appear any
have focused on export controls for foreign military use. Meanwhile,
**[[China is clearly pursuing dual-use genetic engineering
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
[[plans on becoming the undisputed global leader in gene
editing]{.underline}]{.mark} for its military and civilian medical and
scientific communities. As Burrows has said, the speed of the
technological advances in this field is astonishing, and future growth
will continue to be difficult to track and analyze. The CRISPR tool kits
are cheap and easy to get. Each day more scientists around the world are
obtaining various services and products that help them splice genes. The
[development of Chinese "super soldiers" is probably a long way
off]{.underline}, but these concerns should be taken seriously and
monitored closely. It is plausible that [[the

#### Hegemony is empirically the most stable system and deters all conflict -- decline causes transition wars

[Think of two significant trend lines in the world today. One is the
increasing ambition and activism of the two great **revisionist powers,
Russia and China**. The other is the declining confidence, capacity, and
will of the democratic world, and especially of the United States, to
maintain the dominant position it has held in the international system
since 1945]{.underline}. As those two lines move closer, [[as the
declining]{.mark} will and [capacity of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies to maintain the present world order
meet]{.mark} the increasing desire and capacity of the [revisionist
powers]{.mark} to change it, we will reach the moment at which [the
existing order collapses]{.mark} and the world descends [into]{.mark} a
phase of **[brutal anarchy]{.mark}**, as it has three times in the past
two centuries. The cost of that descent, in lives and treasure, in lost
freedoms and lost hope, will be staggering.]{.underline} Americans tend
to take the fundamental stability of the international order for
granted, even while complaining about the burden the United States
carries in preserving that stability. History shows that [[world orders
do collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, and [when they do [it
is]{.mark} often **[unexpected, rapid, and
violent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The late 18th century was the high point
of the Enlightenment in Europe, before the continent fell suddenly into
the abyss of the Napoleonic Wars. [[In the first decade of the 20th
century]{.mark}, [**the world's smartest minds predicted an end** to
great-power conflict]{.mark} as revolutions in communication and
transportation knit economies and people closer together. [The most
devastating war]{.mark} in history [came four years
later]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The apparent calm of the postwar
1920s became the crisis-ridden 1930s and then another world war. Where
exactly we are in this classic scenario today, how close the trend lines
are to that intersection point is, as always, impossible to know. Are we
three years away from a global crisis, or 15? [That [we are]{.mark}
somewhere [on that path]{.mark}, however, is unmistakable.]{.underline}
And while it is too soon to know what effect Donald Trump's presidency
will have on these trends, early signs suggest that the new
administration is more likely to hasten us toward crisis than slow or
reverse these trends. The further accommodation of Russia can only
embolden Vladimir Putin, and the tough talk with China will likely lead
Beijing to test the new administration's resolve militarily. Whether the
president is ready for such a confrontation is entirely unclear. For the
moment, he seems not to have thought much about the future ramifications
of his rhetoric and his actions. [[China and Russia are **classic
revisionist powers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although both have never
enjoyed greater security from foreign powers than they do today ---
Russia from its traditional enemies to the west, China from its
traditional enemy in the east --- [they are [dissatisfied with
the]{.mark} current [global configuration of power. Both seek to
restore]{.mark} the [hegemonic dominance]{.mark} they once enjoyed in
their respective regions. [For]{.mark} [China, that means **dominance of
East Asia**]{.mark}, with countries like [Japan, South Korea]{.mark},
and the nations of Southeast Asia both acquiescing to Beijing's will and
acting in conformity with China's strategic, economic, and political
preferences.]{.underline} That includes American influence withdrawn to
the eastern Pacific, behind the Hawaiian Islands. [[For Russia, it
means]{.mark} **hegemonic influence in [Central and Eastern
Europe]{.mark}** and Central Asia, which Moscow has traditionally
regarded as either part of its empire or part of its sphere of
influence. Both Beijing and Moscow seek to redress what they regard as
an unfair distribution of power]{.underline}, influence, and honor [in
the U.S.-led postwar global order.]{.underline} As autocracies, [both
feel threatened by the dominant democratic powers in the international
system]{.underline} and by the democracies on their borders. Both regard
the United States as the principal obstacle to their ambitions, and
therefore [b[oth **seek to weaken** the American-led]{.mark}
international security [order]{.mark} that stands in the way of their
achieving what they regard as their rightful destinies.]{.underline} It
was good while it lasted [Until fairly recently, Russia and China have
faced considerable, almost insuperable, obstacles in achieving their
objectives. The chief obstacle has been the power and coherence of the
international order itself and its principal promoter and defender. The
American-led system of political and military alliances, especially in
the two critical regions of Europe and East Asia, has presented China
and Russia with what Dean Acheson once referred to as "situations of
strength" that have required them to pursue their ambitions cautiously
and, since the end of the Cold War, to defer serious efforts to disrupt
the international system. [The system has checked their
ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline} in both positive and negative ways.
[[During]{.mark} the era of [American primacy, China and Russia
have]{.mark} [participated in and]{.mark} for the most part [been
beneficiaries of the open **international economic system** the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [created]{.mark} and helps sustain; [so
long as that system functions, **they have**]{.mark} **had [more to gain
by playing in it ]{.mark}**[than by]{.mark} challenging and [overturning
it.]{.mark}]{.underline} The political and strategic aspects of the
order, however, have worked to their detriment. The growth and vibrancy
of democratic government in the two decades following the collapse of
Soviet communism posed a continual threat to the ability of rulers in
Beijing and Moscow to maintain control, and since the end of the Cold
War they have regarded every advance of democratic institutions ---
especially the geographical advance of liberal democracies close to
their borders --- as an existential threat. That's for good reason:
Autocratic powers since the days of Klemens von Metternich have always
feared the contagion of liberalism. The mere existence of democracies on
their borders, the global free flow of information they cannot control,
the dangerous connection between free market capitalism and political
freedom --- all pose a threat to rulers who depend on keeping restive
forces in their own countries in check. The continual challenge to the
legitimacy of their rule posed by the U.S.-supported democratic order
has therefore naturally made them hostile both to that order and to the
United States. But, until recently[, a preponderance of domestic and
international forces has dissuaded them from confronting the order
directly. Chinese rulers have had to worry about what an unsuccessful
confrontation with the United States might do to their legitimacy at
home]{.underline}. Even [Putin has pushed only against open doors, as in
Syria, where the United States responded passively to his probes. He has
been more cautious when confronted by even marginal U.S. and European
opposition, as in Ukraine. [The greatest check]{.mark} on Chinese and
Russian ambitions [has been]{.mark} the [military and **economic power**
of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies in Europe and Asia.
[China]{.mark}, although increasingly powerful, [has had to contemplate
facing the]{.mark} combined [military and economic strength of]{.mark}
[the world's superpower]{.mark} and some very formidable regional powers
linked by alliance or common strategic interest --- including Japan,
India, and South Korea]{.underline}, as well as smaller but still potent
nations like Vietnam and Australia. [Russia has had to face the United
States and its NATO allies. When united, these U.S.-led alliances
present a daunting challenge to a revisionist power that can call on few
allies of its own for assistance]{.underline}. Even [were the Chinese to
score an early victory in a conflict, such as the military subjection of
Taiwan or a naval battle in the South or East China Sea, [they would
have to contend]{.mark} over time [with the]{.mark} **combined
industrial productive capacities** of some of the world's **[richest and
most technologically advanced nations]{.mark}** and the likely cutoff of
access to foreign markets on which their own economy
depends.]{.underline} A weaker Russia, with its depleted population and
oil- and gas-dependent economy, would face an even greater challenge.
For decades, [[the strong global position enjoyed by the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies has **discouraged any serious
challenge**]{.mark}. So long as the United States was perceived as a
dependable ally, [Chinese and Russian leaders feared that aggressive
moves would backfire]{.mark} and possibly bring their regimes
down.]{.underline} This is what the political scientist William
Wohlforth once described as the inherent stability of the unipolar
order: As [dissatisfied regional powers sought to challenge the status
quo, their alarmed neighbors turned to the distant American superpower
to contain their ambitions. And it worked. The United States stepped up,
and Russia and China largely backed down]{.underline} --- or were
preempted before acting at all. Faced with these obstacles, [the best
option for the two revisionist great powers has always been to hope for
or, if possible, engineer a weakening of the U.S.-supported world order
from within, either by separating the United States from its allies or
by raising doubts about the U.S. commitment]{.underline} and thereby
encouraging would-be allies and partners to forgo the strategic
protection of the liberal world order and seek accommodation with its
challengers. [[The present system has]{.mark} therefore
[depended]{.mark} **not only [on American power]{.mark} but on
[coherence and unity]{.mark}** at the heart of the democratic world.
[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has had to play its part as the
principal guarantor of the order]{.mark}, especially in the military and
strategic realm, but [the order's]{.mark} ideological and **[economic
core]{.mark}** --- the democracies of Europe and East Asia and the
Pacific --- [has]{.mark} also [had to remain]{.mark} relatively
[healthy]{.mark} and confident.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Heg Impact

#### Unipolarity is sustainable and creates a structural disincentive for great power war and escalation -- power vacuums causes cascade prolif and extinction

Hal **Brands 15**. On the faculty at the Sanford School of Public Policy
at Duke University The Elliott School of International Affairs The
Washington Quarterly Summer 2015 38:2 pp. 7--28

The fundamental reason is that [both U.S. [influence and international
stability are]{.mark} **thoroughly [interwoven with a robust U.S.
forward presence]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Regarding influence, [the
protection that Washington has afforded its allies has equally afforded
the United States great sway over those allies' policies]{.underline}.43
[During the Cold War and after]{.underline}, for instance,
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
used the influence provided by its security posture to veto allies'
**pursuit of nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [to obtain more
advantageous **terms in financial and trade agreements**]{.underline},
and even to affect the composition of allied nations' governments.44
More broadly, it has used its alliances as vehicles for shaping
political, security, and economic agendas in key regions and bilateral
relationships, thus giving the United States an outsized voice on a
range of important issues. To be clear, this influence has never been as
pervasive as U.S. officials might like, or as some observers might
imagine. But by any reasonable standard of comparison, it has
nonetheless been remarkable. **[One can tell a similar story about
[the]{.mark} relative [stability of the]{.mark} post-war
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As even some leading offshore balancers
have acknowledged[, the [lack of]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark} in regions
like Europe in recent decades **[is not something that]{.mark} has
[occurred naturally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark} has [occurred
**because the "American pacifier" has suppressed**]{.mark} **precisely
the [dynamics that previously fostered geopolitical
turmoil]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That pacifier has **limited arms races
and security competitions by providing the protection that allows other
countries to under-build their militaries**. It has soothed historical
rivalries by affording a climate of security in which powerful countries
like Germany and Japan could be revived economically and **reintegrated
into** thriving and fairly cooperative **regional orders**.]{.underline}
[It has [induced caution in]{.mark} the behavior of **[allies and
adversaries]{.mark} alike**, **[deterring aggression and
dissuading]{.mark} other [destabilizing behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
As John Mearsheimer has noted, the United States "effectively acts as a
night watchman," lending order to an otherwise disorderly and anarchical
environment.45 [What would happen [if Washington backed away]{.mark}
from this role]{.underline}? The most logical answer is that **[both
U.S. influence and [global stability would
suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [With respect to influence,]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[would]{.underline} effectively [be **surrendering the most powerful
bargaining chip** it has traditionally wielded in dealing with friends
and allies,]{.underline} [and jeopardizing the position of leadership it
has used to shape bilateral and regional **agendas for
decades**]{.underline}. **[The consequences would seem no less damaging
where stability is concerned]{.underline}**. As offshore balancers have
argued, it may be that U.S. retrenchment would force local powers to
spend more on defense, while perhaps assuaging certain points of
friction with countries that feel threatened or encircled by U.S.
presence. But it equally stands to reason that [removing the American
pacifier would **liberate the more destabilizing influences that U.S.
policy had previously stifled**]{.underline}. [Long-dormant **[security
competitions]{.mark} might [reawaken as countries armed
themselves]{.mark}** more vigorously]{.underline}; **[historical
[antagonisms]{.mark}]{.underline}** [between old rivals might
**[reemerge]{.mark} in the absence of a robust U.S. presence** and the
reassurance it provides]{.underline}. Moreover, [countries that seek to
revise existing regional orders in their favor]{.underline}---think
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
or **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Asia---might indeed [[applaud
U.S. retrenchment]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [they might just as
plausibly feel empowered to more assertively press their
interests]{.underline}. If the United States has been a kind of
Leviathan in key regions, Mearsheimer acknowledges, then "**[take away
that Leviathan and there is likely to be big trouble]{.underline}**."46
Scanning the global horizon today, **[one can easily see where such
trouble might arise]{.underline}**. [In Europe,]{.underline} [a
revisionist Russia is already destabilizing its neighbors and contesting
the post-Cold War settlement in the region.]{.underline} [In the Gulf
and broader Middle East, the threat of Iranian ascendancy has stoked
region-wide tensions manifesting in **proxy wars** and hints of an
**incipient arms race**, even as that region also contends with a severe
threat to its stability in the form of the Islamic State. In East Asia,
**a rising China is challenging the regional status quo** in numerous
ways, sounding alarms among its neighbors---many of whom also have
historical grievances against each other.]{.underline} In these
circumstances, [**[removing the]{.mark} American [pacifier would]{.mark}
likely yield not low-cost stability, but [increase]{.mark}**d
**[conflict]{.mark} and upheaval.** That conflict and
upheaval]{.underline}, in turn, **[would be quite damaging to U.S.
interests]{.underline}** even if it did not result in the nightmare
scenario of a hostile power dominating a key region. **[It is hard to
imagine]{.underline}**, for instance, **[that increased instability and
acrimony would produce the robust multilateral cooperation necessary to
deal with transnational threats from pandemics to piracy]{.underline}**.
**[More problematic still might be the economic
consequences.]{.underline}** As scholars like Michael Mandelbaum have
argued, [the enormous progress toward global prosperity and integration
that has occurred since World War II]{.underline} (and now the Cold War)
[has come in the climate of relative stability and security provided
largely by the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.47 [One
simply cannot confidently predict that this **progress would endure amid
[escalating geopolitical competition]{.mark} in regions of enormous
importance to the world economy.**]{.underline} Perhaps [the greatest
risk that a strategy of offshore balancing would run]{.underline}, of
course, **[is that a key region might not be able to maintain its own
balance following U.S. retrenchment]{.underline}**. That prospect might
have seemed far-fetched in the early post-Cold War era, and it remains
unlikely in the immediate future. But [**in East Asia particularly,**
the rise and growing assertiveness of China has highlighted the medium-
to long-term danger that a hostile power could in fact **gain regional
primacy**]{.underline}. [If China's economy continues to grow
rapidly]{.underline}, and if Beijing continues to increase military
spending by 10 percent or more each year, [then its neighbors will
ultimately face grave challenges in containing Chinese power **even if
they join forces in that endeavor**]{.underline}. This possibility,
ironically, is one to which leading advocates of retrenchment have been
attuned. "The United States will have to play a key role in countering
China," Mearshimer writes, "because its Asian neighbors are not strong
enough to do it by themselves."48 If this is true, however, then
**[offshore balancing becomes a dangerous and potentially self-defeating
strategy]{.underline}**. As mentioned above, [it [could lead]{.mark}
countries like [Japan and]{.mark} South [Korea to **seek nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [stoking arms races and
elevating regional tensions]{.underline}. Alternatively, and perhaps
more worryingly, [it might encourage the scenario that offshore
balancers seek to avoid, by easing China's **ascent to regional
hegemony.**]{.underline} As Robert Gilpin has written,
"[[Retrenchment]{.mark} by its very nature is **an indication of
relative weakness** and **declining power**, and thus retrenchment [can
have a **deteriorating effect on relations** ]{.mark}**with allies and
rivals**]{.underline}."[49 In East Asia today, U.S. allies rely on U.S.
reassurance to navigate increasingly fraught relationships with a more
assertive China precisely **because they understand that they will have
great trouble balancing Beijing on their own**]{.underline}. A
significant U.S. retrenchment might therefore tempt these countries to
acquiesce to, or bandwagon with, a rising China if they felt that
prospects for successful resistance were diminishing as the United
States retreated.50 In the same vein, retrenchment would compromise
alliance relationships, basing agreements, and other assets that might
help Washington check Chinese power in the first place---and that would
allow the United States to surge additional forces into theater in a
crisis. In sum, if one expects that Asian countries will be unable to
counter China themselves, then reducing U.S. influence and leverage in
the region is a curious policy. Offshore balancing might promise to
preserve a stable and advantageous environment while reducing U.S.
burdens. But upon closer analysis, the probable outcomes of the strategy
seem more perilous and destabilizing than its proponents acknowledge.

An **[[emerging genetic warfare arms race]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The potential advantages and drawbacks of germ line genome editing to
future military capability and operations has not yet been rigorously
explored. Nevertheless, [[genome editing opens the door
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the deliberate conception and [[selective
modification]{.underline}]{.mark} of cohorts of individuals [[for the
express purpose of building superior military
capability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Certain countries prohibit such an
enterprise from being undertaken. However, as seen [in the case of He in
Shenzhen]{.underline}, [this activity can be undertaken through to
completion in jurisdictions with intact regulatory
frameworks]{.underline} (2). He's work has signalled **[a successful
"proof of concept" to industry, military organisations and government
agencies]{.underline}**, and has **[opened a vista of Genetic Warfare to
allies and enemies alike]{.underline}**. [Irrespective of the social and
moral fallout of this momentous announcement]{.underline}, **[[this
technique is now a potential pathway to achieving]{.mark}]{.underline}**
future **[[military or strategic aims]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} could **[[result in irrevocable change to
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Historically, similar situations -- the
Battleship arms race in Europe in the late 1800s and the missile gap
between US and USSR during the cold war - have [resulted in great power
arms races, destabilised the balance of power, and led to conflict and
suffering]{.underline} (13-16). [One example of the willingness to
exploit available biotechnology for gain is the illicit use of
erythropoietin and other stimulating agents]{.underline} (to induce
biological changes in the human body) and other performance-enhancing
drugs to enhance performance in competitive sport, which appears to
occur in all countries despite being banned (17). The governance
requirement around this has necessitated a World Anti-doping Authority,
with very little effect on the competitive race to enhance performance
(18). It seems likely that **[[once the gates are open to create
enhanced human beings, a race will begin]{.underline}]{.mark}**, either
covertly or overtly. The He experiment also raises questions about
whether the engineered babies or other similarly designed babies will
then be tested for their resistance to the disease they were designed to
overcome, and the ethics of using human infants for such
experimentation. [If an arms race occurs, in the drive for rapid
progress, this is very likely to be a consequence]{.underline}. The
concept of genetic modification for population goals is not new. More
broadly, it has featured regularly in narratives and philosophical
discourse on the future of humanity -- adapt and evolve to survive --
and recent discourse about risks of and accelerating evolution towards
homo superior (19). However, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[temptation to
use]{.underline}]{.mark} He's [[now proven techniques to
achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} homo [[superior
immediately]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[in the context of great power
rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark}** and realpolitik, [**[may be too
great]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} now [is likely
unavoidable]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Historical parallels abound -- most
concerningly that started by the development of the atomic
bomb]{.underline}** and demonstrated by the Trinity test series, and
subsequent arms races and real or perceived capability gaps marking the
cold war (20). Is He's work the Trinity Test of genetic warfare, and
**[will an arms race evolve to address perceptions of a genetic warfare
capability gap]{.underline}**? [[Genetic engineering offers numerous
potential military capability advantages]{.underline}]{.mark} but its
use would require significant distortions to the historical and ethical
norms of the raising, [training and sustainment of armed
forces]{.underline} (21, 22), and [[provide a new source of combatants
to armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} with parallels to the use of paid
mercenaries by great powers in recent centuries (23). [Germ
line]{.underline} [modification for military purposes would necessitate
the selective raising of genetically modified cohorts of
individuals]{.underline} destined to fill the ranks of future armed
forces from birth -- the creation of a genetically modified military
caste within the unmodified mass of humanity. This has been attempted
earlier through selective breeding programs, such as the Lebensborn
program of the Nazi SS (24-26) that attempted to increase the numbers of
Aryan offspring. Prior to He's work the possibility of this transpiring
was theoretical -- considered to be at least a number of major advances
distant, undesirable as more acceptable genetic therapeutic options were
available, and ethically proscribed. It is instructive, **[now that the
pathway to germ line modification has been opened]{.underline}**, to
[**explore what military capabilities could be achieved through this
methodology. Targets for germ line modification for friendly forces**
Germ line]{.underline} modification for military purposes would likely
be turned towards addressing factors that would [offer advantages in
conflict where human personnel currently introduce
limitations]{.underline}. Alteration or augmentation of the
pseudocholinesterase gene (27), which is [important for
protection]{.underline} [against exposure to organophosphate compounds
such as nerve agents]{.underline}, could be **[germ line modified to
augment expression or improve performance]{.underline}**, thus rendering
individuals highly resistant or invulnerable to intoxication. Similar
modifications could be made to the target proteins of various plant and
bacterial toxins (e.g. ricin, abrin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B,
botulinum neurotoxin), or [manipulation of the vulnerabilities or
protective capacities of the resilience and adaptability of individuals
in dimensions bypassing historical evolutionary pressures]{.underline}
(28). [Strength, resilience to environmental stressors such as acute
radiation exposure, reduced need for nutrition, and physical stamina
could be optimised]{.underline}. For example, **[germ line modification
could be used to selectively introduce high performance
haemoglobin]{.underline}** or upstream modulators of haematological
system parameters. [Introduced]{.underline} prior to conception from
sequences taken [from superior examples of human resilience and
strength]{.underline}, such changes would then become part of the
individuals' genome indistinguishable to the discarded wild-type
sequences (29). [Cognition, attention, tolerance to pain, creativity and
potentially more desirable personality traits are all possible future
targets for engineering]{.underline} (30, 31). Finally, the creation of
human-other hybrids or introduction of non-natural sequences for
technological purposes (e.g. integrated Mind-Machine interface) are
potential future avenues for capability exploitation (32, 33).
**[Targets for germ line modification against enemy
forces]{.underline}** The potential for this technology to [also be used
for harm against enemies]{.underline} must not be neglected. It is
possible through this technology to [insert "sleeper]{.underline}"
[mechanisms within the genome of a target population]{.underline},
activated through exposure to otherwise innocuous events and causing
deleterious effects. This might include subtle modifications of
populations for resilience to environmental stressors, decreased
resistance to infection or disturbances to immunity, and cognitive or
behavioural effects. Equally, this could include development of novel
characteristics in organisms or humans, or exploitation of
characteristics of both materiel and unmodified personnel, to achieve
military aims (34). [In the strategic domain, ecological weaknesses
could be introduced to a population - caused by gradual reductions in
genetic diversity or introduction of lower performance genes, into a
population leading to changed ability to adapt to environmental change,
stress, changed fertility and survival - risks already identified in
human and non-human modification alike]{.underline} (35). The primary
concern is the almost limitless ability of actors to interfere with
others using methods and techniques difficult to identify, prove or
counter. [Given that human ambition]{.underline}, greed [and
competition]{.underline} remains strongly conserved in the population,
[it would appear inevitable that most]{.underline} of the [negative
scenarios possible with genomic editing]{.underline} are likely, or
**[have already, begun to play out]{.underline}**.
[Implications]{.underline} The recent calls for a moratorium (35, 36)
highlight the significant concern in the scientific, security and wider
community that germ line editing has stimulated. However, we are already
in the post-editing era where [not only are the practical techniques for
achieving germ line modification now clear, but new research horizons
will open]{.underline}. In all domains of society -- commercial,
military, social -- this technology opens up areas of individual and
population competitions and tensions that have been recognised as at
best destabilising, and at worst likely to result in mass suffering and
destruction that is unpredictable. Furthermore, CRISPR Cas9 technology
still has problems, with unintended DNA changes that can lead to
unexpected consequences including cancer and other diseases (36). [In
the military domain]{.underline}, the [[logic of strategic balance of
power dictates]{.underline}]{.mark} likely **[[emergence of genetic
warfare arms race]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[with some form of
involvement of all major powers]{.underline}]{.mark} (37). **[[This
situation further complicates]{.underline}]{.mark}** an **[[already
sensitive global balance of power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[introducing
uncertainties]{.underline}]{.mark} into strategic calculus with possible
severe negative implications. He Jiankui's work could be seen as the
"Trinity Test" of an era of Genetic Warfare, and not only of germ line
modification. However, **[the implications of this may be more profound,
far reaching, and impactful than the recent nuclear escalations for
humanity]{.underline}**.

[[No country is pushing human germline gene editing research harder than
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is fitting that the country that first
broke the glass door on gene editing in human embryos would be leading
the way for the controversial field. [[Human germline editing research
has been able to thrive in China in part because of how ethical research
laws are]{.underline}]{.mark} (or better yet) [[not
enforced]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, in 2015, when China reported
the first case of human germline editing, its Guidelines on Human
Assisted Reproductive Technologies stated that "using human egg plasma
and nuclear transfer technology for the purpose of reproduction, and
manipulation of the genes in human gametes, zygotes or embryos for the
purposes of reproduction are prohibited." 99 However, the 2015 study was
likely able to proceed because such administrative research guidelines
are considered "soft law" and not thoroughly enforced.100 [[Today, any
Chinese university or hospital can freely conduct clinical trials for
gene editing technology with approval from their own ethics commissions
and do not require approval by China's federal
government]{.underline}]{.mark}.101 Interestingly, it also seems that
China is equally willing to support gene editing research for fixing
disorders as opposed to human augmentation. For example, while one
Chinese study gene edited embryos to correct the mutation for
β-thalassemia,102 another Chinese study enhanced an embryo to give it
genetic resistance against HIV.103 [[With other countries following
China's lead, one wonders whether it is inevitable that the United
States will eventually join the fray]{.underline}]{.mark}.

WASHINGTON --- A rogue Chinese scientist stunned the world last year
when he announced the birth of genetically modified twin girls,
prompting widespread outcry from the broader scientific community and
calls for a "global moratorium" on editing human embryos that result in
births. Yet months later, **[[Democrats]{.mark} on Capitol Hill
surprised many science policy experts when they [attempted to roll back
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** related, **[[4-year-]{.underline}]{.mark}**old
**[[ban on altering the DNA of embryos]{.mark} intended for
pregnancies.]{.underline}** To many health policy experts here, and
research advocates across the country, the timing --- just months after
the biggest genome editing scandal in world history --- was
inexplicable. Several Republicans criticized the proposal by playing up
concerns of "maverick bioengineers" operating with little oversight and
without ethical norms. And while some scientists supported the effort,
others expressed open confusion, in particular at the breadth of the
change Democrats sought. Within weeks of proposing to eliminate their
plan, Democrats largely backed off. But **[[their sudden effort to
reverse what seemed to some like a basic ethical
protection]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[serves as a case study in
how]{.underline}]{.mark}** Washington regulates science --- and **[[the
immense influence lawmakers, regardless of their scientific expertise,
often wield over federal research.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "In terms of
'Why now,' it does seem odd given there is so much international
conversation in the scientific community about how to limit germline
editing," said Remy Brim, a scientist and former Democratic Capitol Hill
aide who works at the D.C. lobbying firm BGR. The United States has
banned germline editing with the aim of starting a pregnancy since 2015,
the result of bipartisan opposition to the practice and preemptive
scientific concern about the implications of the gene-editing technology
CRISPR. Republicans in particular have supported the ban due to
conscience concerns similar to those surrounding the use of fetal tissue
in research and using federal funds for abortion --- some argue that
germline genome editing requires the creation of human embryos that will
eventually be discarded. **[[When Democrats took control of the
House]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of Representatives in last year's
midterm elections[, they saw an opening to repeal a measure that many
felt was overly restrictive.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As the House
Appropriations Committee considered the spending package that funds the
Food and Drug Administration, lawmakers excluded the brief provision
that has banned the consideration of certain genome-editing trials --- a
change that would have essentially lifted the ban, if the law had
passed. **[[Republicans quickly criticized the
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, calling it hasty and ill-advised --- even
specifically citing China's "CRISPR babies" scandal, in which He Jiankui
drew worldwide criticism for using the technique to alter the genes of
twin girls.

**[[A House committee]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Tuesday
**[[restored]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
**[[pending]{.underline}]{.mark}** legislation a **[[ban on altering the
genomes of human embryos]{.underline}]{.mark}** intended for
pregnancies, despite calls from some scientists to lift the ban and
allow the Food and Drug Administration to review applications for new
technologies. Lifting the prohibition could have opened the door to
clinical trials of babies being made with genetic material from three
people or with genomes that had been changed in ways that would be
passed on to future generations. The ban has been attached to bills that
fund the Food and Drug Administration in the form of an amendment, or
rider, since December 2015. But last month, a subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee dropped the ban from the legislation. At a
hearing Tuesday, supporters of the ban framed it as a necessary barrier
to prevent experiments like the one announced last year in which a
Chinese scientist created the world's first gene-edited babies with the
technology CRISPR. The work drew worldwide condemnation for skirting
ethical and regulatory guidelines and for using scientific tools that
were not yet ready to be used in people. "The ethics hadn't caught up
with the science, and... the science has not caught up with the
science," said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), who introduced the rider
in 2015 and again at Tuesday's hearing. He said that for now,
genetically editing embryos had "too many unknowns, too many unintended
consequences." The rider blocks the Food and Drug Administration from
considering clinical trial applications "in which a human embryo is
intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic
modification." Scientists and ethicists who advocated for dropping it
argued that doing so would simply allow the FDA to review research
requests, as it does any other innovative therapy. Some **[[Democratic
lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** who had **[[appeared supportive of
dropping the ban]{.underline}]{.mark}** earlier ---
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** who had **[[criticized the inclusion of
the ban in 2015 without debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- said **[[they
felt it was time for Congress to debate the
underlying]{.underline}]{.mark}** ethical and **[[scientific
issues.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But they said that should be done
separately from the appropriations process. **[[The chairwoman of the
committee,]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Democrat Nita
Lowey]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of New York]{.underline}**, **[[said she
"reluctantly supported" returning the ban]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the
bill. **[[She acknowledged]{.mark}]{.underline}** that editing embryonic
DNA had some **[[potential risks, but added that it could cure and
prevent genetic disease]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "We have a moral
obligation to allow advances in science so that fewer parents have to
watch a child die," she said. Some scientists had called on Congress to
modify the legislation to allow so-called three-parent embryos but
maintain the ban on the direct editing of embryonic DNA. The
three-parent technology, more precisely called mitochondrial replacement
therapy, or MRT, has the potential to prevent severe diseases that
result from abnormal mitochondria, energy-producing cellular structures.
It involves transferring the nucleus of an unfertilized egg with
defective mitochondria into one with healthy mitochondria and then
fertilizing it via IVF. Because mitochondria have a small bit of their
own DNA, the resulting embryo has genes from three people. The
technology is being studied in some countries, including Britain, as a
way to halt the inheritance of genetic diseases that stem from the DNA
in the mitochondria. Rep. Sanford Bishop Jr. (D-Ga.), who chaired the
subcommittee that approved the bill without the ban last month, said he
wanted Congress to discuss allowing MRT, "but today is not that time,
and this appropriations committee markup is not that place." He
supported adding the ban back to the bill. **[[The committee approved
the amendment to reinsert the ban]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a voice
vote, but **[[one Democrat]{.underline}]{.mark}** who **[[voted against
it]{.underline}]{.mark}** was Rep. **[[Debbie

risk of]{.underline}]{.mark}** certain
**[[cancers]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[(she was diagnosed with breast
cancer in 2007) and said her children would have to get tested to see if
they carried the mutation. "If we ever have an opportunity when they
have children or when they decide to have a family, to have research
advanced to a point where you could have their genetic material, when
combined with their partner, altered so that that mutation could be cut
off in our family tree and that risk of death and massive health care
implications could be eliminated, that's incredibly important," she
said.]{.underline}**

#### Restrictions on germline genetic editing would crush business confidence -- venture capitalist are hugely invested.

[[Increasing venture-capital investment]{.underline}]{.mark} in
gene-editing technology [[is fueling a rush]{.underline}]{.mark} to
secure intellectual property in a sector that promises to spur advances
across several areas of biotechnology.Technology known as Crispr enables
researchers to make precise changes, or edits, to the genetic code,
which could lead to therapies for genetic diseases, cancer and other
conditions. Because of its broad commercial potential, the gene-editing
technology has been surrounded by intellectual-property disputes for
several years.In one such dispute, U.S. patent authorities ruled that
the Broad Institute, a partnership including the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Harvard University, was first to invent a method of
editing plant and animal cells using the enzyme Cas9, a type of
molecular scissors that can cut DNA.The dispute pitted Broad against the
University of California, Berkeley, the University of Vienna and
Emmanuelle Charpentier, who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
with Berkeley professor Jennifer Doudna for their Crispr-Cas9
research.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office decision affects companies
that use Cas9, favoring those with ties to the Broad, including Editas
Medicine Inc., and going against drugmakers such as Intellia
Therapeutics Inc. that have licenses from the University of California
and its partners.Intellia last week said it had filed patent
applications for its own Crispr-Cas9 innovations and that it doesn\'t
expect the ruling to affect its ability to develop future Crispr-based
medicines.Several Crispr-based startups raising venture capital recently
are using enzymes other than Cas9 to enable new applications for gene
editing, avoid existing patents, and generate new intellectual property.
Last week\'s ruling will spur even more Crispr innovation, said
Katherine Ann Rubino, chair of the life-sciences practice group for law
firm Caldwell Intellectual Property Law.Globally, venture capitalists
invested \$1.08 billion in 31 Crispr startup financings last year,
compared with \$172.9 million in 18 such deals in 2020, according to
market tracker PitchBook Data Inc. Part of the appeal is the efficiency,
specificity and simplicity of Crispr gene editing, said Ursheet Parikh,
a partner with venture firm Mayfield.

**[[gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark}** (like the other innovations) has
been in the works for a while, the last seven years have seen major
developments in our ability to specifically edit DNA in living cells. It
is not without controversy. Recent claims that human embryos in China
had been genetically edited and had resulted in twin babies prompted
widespread condemnation from scientists, as well as discussions about
safety and ethics and calls for effective regulation. But as a
[[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, the ability to alter a gene in a
living cell [[**offers** many]{.underline}]{.mark} potential
[**[benefits]{.mark}**, including treating]{.underline} inherited
[diseases, understanding what specific genes do]{.underline}, generating
more resilient crops and even detecting species in the environment.
\"The field is amazing,\" says Jane Farrar, a professor of genetics at
Trinity College Dublin. \"I have had some very late nights updating my
lecture slides for undergraduates, because so much in gene technology is
happening so quickly.\" Gene editing -- which directly changes the
"letters" of the genome -- is becoming more of a feature of gene
therapy, notes Farrar, but it is the new kid on the block. "The ability
to edit specific genes in living cells is relatively new," she says.
"That means many forms of gene therapy that have by now reached the
clinic or are under late-stage development don't use these new
gene-editing techniques. They deliver the gene into the cell, rather
than correcting or editing the DNA," she notes. Farrar was one of the
pioneers of gene therapy research in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s,
when the patient-led charity Fighting Blindness supported work to find
the genetic changes linked to inherited forms of vision loss. "The eye
is really an ideal place for gene therapy," she explains. "It is
accessible, it can tolerate the viruses used to deliver genes and you
have a natural control -- if you put the gene therapy in one eye you can
compare it to the other over time." Rare eye disease Farrar, Prof Pete
Humphries and colleagues identified gene changes involved in a rare eye
disease called retinitis pigmentosa, and developed a system to
\"rescue\" the gene function by suppressing the mutant gene and
delivering a new gene into the cell. The technology was acquired by
Spark Therapeutics in 2016. In 2017, the FDA in the USA approved a
different Spark therapy, Luxturna, which replaces the function of gene
changes associated with progressive sight loss. It was the first gene
therapy of its kind to be approved in the US. ["In general, [there's a
**huge amount of commercial interest** in new gene
therapies]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Farrar. "[Plenty more are in the
works]{.underline}, not just for inherited eye diseases but also [for
rare diseases that affect how cells break down cellular components to
recycle them, conditions that damage the mitochondria]{.underline}
\[which act as "batteries" in cells\] and spinal and central nervous
system disorders, [among others]{.underline}." She believes that [[gene
editing will become]{.mark} more [common in gene therapy
approaches]{.mark} in the coming years,]{.underline} particularly as we
work out how to do it safely and effectively. "With gene editing, there
is the potential risk of 'off-targets', where editing a target gene
could bring about unintentional changes in the genome or cell function,
so some researchers are looking for 'safe harbours' in DNA," she
explains. "These are stretches of DNA where in principle you could add
different genes targeting different disorders, while avoiding negative
off-target effects." The availability of gene editing in recent years
also means that scientists can now use it as a research tool to target
specific stretches of DNA relatively easily, according to Prof Breandan
Kennedy, a senior lecturer at University College Dublin. Probably the
best known gene-editing technology is CRISPR-Cas9, which was made
commercially available in 2012. A little like having a sat-nav and a
scissors, CRISPR-Cas systems allows you target a specific sequence of
DNA "letters" in a living cell, then cut the sequence at that point.
'Very powerful' "By doing this, we can inactivate a specific gene, and
this gives us a lot of information about what that gene normally does,"
says Kennedy, whose work at UCD school of biomolecular and biomedical
science uses gene editing technology on microscopic worms, zebrafish and
human cells in the lab. "By inactivating specific genes, which we can do
much more quickly and easily now with CRISPR-Cas systems, our group has
been able to identify genes that are important for vision, for eye
development and for blood vessels in the eye to grow and work properly.
We are also using the approach to validate in the lab whether particular
DNA change in patients are involved in inherited eye disease. Ten years
ago if you said such a technology would be widespread, people would have
laughed, but now labs around the world can do this. It's very powerful."
Plant science, too, is reaping the rewards of being able to target
specific stretches of DNA in living cells. \"What is possible now is
what was impossible five years ago,\" says Dr Ewen Mullins, head of the
crop science department at Teagasc, Oak Park. "The holy grail for plant
breeding is to be able to control the activity of a single gene, or
several linked genes, and now gene editing allows us to do that," he
says. "And crucially, we are not necessarily adding a gene in from
another species. With CRISPR-Cas systems, we can edit the genes already
in the plant." This could help to make crop plants more resilient in the
face of droughts, fluctuating temperatures and agents of disease, notes
Mullins: "These are becoming issues for farmers in Ireland and other
parts of the world now, and in the face of climate change we need to
reduce those susceptibilities where we can into the future." Identifying
species Gene-editing technology can even help us to identify what
species are living in a particular environment, as Dr Anne
Parle-McDermott from Dublin City University is finding out. \"We are
looking at the different species of salmon that live in rivers and
aquaculture, but we are doing that by analysing the DNA they shed, also
known as environmental or e-DNA,\" she explains. \"We can take a sample
of water, then we add CRISPR to find unique stretches of DNA that tell
us about the species it came from. The associated Cas protein then cuts
a reporter DNA and we can detect that cutting activity, so we know that
stretch of DNA is present in the sample. It gives us a whole new way of
knowing what DNA is present in the environment.\" Dr Ciaran Seoighe,
deputy director general at Science Foundation Ireland, is impressed that
gene technology won the reader vote for the innovation of the decade.
\"CRISPR-Cas9 is a case of a discovery turned into an innovation,\" he
says. \"Decades ago, researchers were discovering that bacteria had this
system of being able to find and cut DNA in viruses and so stop them
attacking, and the innovation was to take that and use it to
specifically edit genes ourselves. It was a case of finding something
interesting and then doing something different with it. Now it provides
a tool for researchers to work on more personalised approaches to
medicine.\" Farrar is also impressed by the winning vote. "I think the
readers are very insightful," she says. "[[Gene tech]{.mark}nology [has
matured in the last decade]{.mark}, and [thanks to]{.mark} gene-editing
[tech]{.mark}nology [we can]{.mark} also now [get far more understanding
about disease. This is really a story of fundamental biology enabling a
new tech]{.mark}nology. [Without that]{.mark} curiosity, [we **might not
have**]{.mark}]{.underline} these exciting
**[[innovations]{.underline}]{.mark}** now."

Given the broad scope and scale of this growing threat, **[the United
States should take a series of actions to mitigate the
risks]{.underline}**, without unduly stunting the growth of the
biotechnology field. [To date, bioterrorist attacks have been low-risk,
high-impact events]{.underline}. **[While they have been extremely rare,
their frequency will only increase as will their
ramifications]{.underline}**. However, **[[overregulating the spread of
biotechnological tools could stunt innovation and the profound potential
of this increasingly important]{.mark} sector]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, [existing methods of preventing bioterrorism may no longer
be effective]{.underline}. [The government could previously monitor the
purchase of expensive and dangerous biotechnology tools and the
laboratories that owned them in large quantities. **This is no longer
possible**]{.underline} to the same degree when such tools are
increasingly cheap, widespread, and usable in a garage. The FBI is
currently attempting to address this risk by building relationships with
the iGEM community and with life scientists so that they can report
suspicious behavior. These [efforts]{.underline} should continue, but
[are wildly insufficient]{.underline}, since some bioterrorists may have
minimal contact with the larger community of biologists and biology
hobbyists. The [release of a bioweapon by a terrorist]{.underline}, if
left unchecked, **[could spread throughout the globe]{.underline}**,
[just as a naturally occurring pandemic would]{.underline}. Thus, one
major step that the United States should take is to establish improved
responses to disease outbreaks, particularly learning from COVID-19.
This should include building a larger stockpile of PPE and establishing
a set of clear step-by-step actions to be taken in the event of an
attack. Building resilience in this fashion will not prevent
bioterrorism, but it will mitigate its effects, and may slightly
disincentivize utilizing bioweapons to cause terror. Beyond this, [the
United States should secure its laboratories and the data
within,]{.underline} as terrorists could leverage that knowledge to
build bioweapons. For example, **[new technology allows pathogens to be
synthesized from the data describing their genetic
sequences]{.underline}**. In a recent controversial study, scientists
published a methodology that would allow horsepox virus, a virus very
similar to one that causes smallpox, to be synthesized. This [research
was conducted with a noble]{.underline} [goal]{.underline}:
[understanding]{.underline} how [the horsepox virus]{.underline} could
be used as a potential treatment for cancer. **[However, it had
significant dual-use implications]{.underline}**. [[Research like this
should not be banned outright]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates should establish norms to
evaluate whether it is worth the risk before such research is conducted,
and then ensure that it is conducted and the results published in the
most secure ways. Replicability is an important part of science, but the
general public should not be able to replicate the most dangerous
experiments. Where building resilience would reduce the impact of a
bioterror incident, restricting access to dual-use methodologies will
reduce the likelihood of one occurring in the first place. Finally,
enforcing domestic standards is not enough. Pathogens spread across
borders, and the spillover effects of even a targeted bioterrorist
attack could kill many unintended victims. Thus, the United States must
work with other countries to protect against the bioterrorist threat,
monitor the emergence of new viruses and bacteria that could be
leveraged for a bioweapon, limit access to the most dangerous pathogens
(and data associated with those), and build global response networks in
the event of an attack. Importantly, this collaboration should emphasize
working with allies, but should also include adversaries: if China or
Russia remain unregulated, an attack within their borders would still
affect the United States and its allies. **[[Emerging biotechnology will
result in new medicines and medical techniques]{.mark}, a greater
understanding of how pathogens function and spread (and thus a better
understanding of how to combat them), [a healthier populace, innovative
new capabilities that could transform daily life, and greater engagement
with the biological sciences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While ensuring that
these benefits are maintained, the United States and its allies and
partners must take logical steps to protect themselves from the
worst-case scenarios. The risk of bioterrorism is growing, and the
United States must be prepared to face the future.

### CP -- Regulations

#### Regulations and norms are the best option -- bans won't solve and are a dangerous illusion of control.

König, H. The illusion of control in germline-engineering policy. *Nat
Biotechnol* **35, **502--506 (2017). <https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3884>

The arrival and rapid adoption of the clustered, regularly interspaced,
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)--CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)
system1 has sparked ethical and societal controversy around genome
editing of the human germline. Here, I point out [the fallacy that such
technologies and their applications can be globally prohibited]{.mark}
on the basis of universal ethics and bans---[the so-called \'illusion of
control\']{.mark}. A look at previous technological developments
suggests instead that [differentiated]{.mark} and multi-faceted
[approaches that take into account the]{.mark} broadest range of
[possible ethical and social issues would be]{.mark} preferable for the
oversight of CRISPR--Cas9 germline engineering. Such an approach would
not only be [more effective]{.mark} [but also ensure that society has
the greatest]{.mark} chance of capitalizing on potential [opportunities
of the technology]{.mark}. To date, the CRISPR--Cas9 technique has been
used to edit the genomes of (non-viable) one-celled human embryos2,3.
The first of these genome-editing studies published in the spring of
2015 prompted debate from within the field and by national academies
about not only safety issues (such as off-target effects) but also
ethical-moral questions. As a result, calls and statements have been
released urging researchers to cease performing CRISPR--Cas9 experiments
on human germ cells in a clinical context until safety issues have been
resolved and the ethical and social implications of directed germline
modifications broadly discussed among diverse societal groups and the
public4,5,6. In February 2017 a report by the US National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that clinical trials might
be permitted and outlined criteria for a strict regulatory framework.
These include the restriction to preventing a serious disease, credible
pre-clinical and/or clinical data on risks and potential health
benefits, or long-term, multigenerational follow-up (that still respects
personal autonomy)7. Furthermore, several groups have suggested the need
to develop norms and harmonize regulations \*\*internationally or
globally5,6. Among the numerous ethical and social challenges of genome
editing and its potential applications, [a key]{.mark} unresolved [issue
relates to the notion that certain technologies]{.mark} or applications
[can be prohibited globally]{.mark}. The notion of banning technologies
or applications worldwide has come to the fore as calls have grown for
regulating germline editing in humans. [The]{.mark} central
[assumption]{.mark} underlying this notion [is that technologies can be
prohibited---continuously or until they are \'safe
enough\'---and]{.mark}, moreover, [that this can be done
globally]{.mark}. Considering reproductive technology as a whole,
history provides several examples of procedures that prompted
controversy due to ethical (including safety) or moral concerns once
they became technically feasible. These include the use of
assisted-reproduction techniques (ARTs), such as in vitro fertilization
(IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis (PGD). As time has passed, these technologies have
become more and more widely adopted and accepted across the globe.
Today, they have come into use, even in countries where they were
initially prohibited for considerable time periods (e.g., Costa Rica,
which only \*\*\*effectively lifted its ban on IVF in 2016; and Germany,
which only granted conditional permission for PGD in 2011). In 2015, the
United Kingdom approved therapeutic approaches that involve three-parent
mitochondrial genome replacement (MGR) in egg cells or one-cell embryos,
which thus entail inheritable changes to the human germline.
Furthermore, in the Ukraine, MGR has been applied to treat infertility,
with a first baby girl reported to have been born early this year8.
Similarly, US fertility researchers recently announced that they had
conducted MGR in Mexico to prevent mitochondrial disease in a boy born
last April9. An expert panel recently convened by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) concluded that clinical investigations of MGR are
ethically permissible, though only under strict conditions, for example,
if restricted solely to male embryos, which cannot pass on mitochondrial
DNA to later generations10. Yet, by the time this article went to press,
MGR therapy was still effectively banned in the United States owing to
an FDA decision in 2001 (http://bit.ly/2q2898X) because of concerns over
safety issues such as negative effects from mitochondrial heteroplasmy
and mitochondrial--nuclear mismatches. The decision was made in response
to ART applied in several fertility clinics that involved the transfer
of egg cytoplasm (including mitochondria)11. The decision indicates that
the use in therapy of human cells "involving the transfer of genetic
material by means other than the union of gamete nuclei" requires
application to the FDA for permission. Even the idea that technologies
can be banned or prohibited until they are proven by research to be
\'safe enough\'---at least in the context of reproduction and/or
therapies---appears to be disputable. What safe enough means may in
practice be as much a question of perception involving different values
and interests (and weighing perceived benefits against perceived risks)
as it is one of available \'strictly scientific\' evidence or numbers
(should they be available at all before first clinical applications). An
example may be the decisions for the first ART via ICSI by four couples
after 3--13 years of unsuccessful trials with traditional ART methods,
even though only data from rabbits were available12. An ambiguous state
of [global union Imposing legal regulations]{.mark} that might prohibit
the use of ART technology [globally]{.mark} also [appears
non-feasible]{.mark}, at least when ethical or moral arguments stand in
the way of new medical opportunities. [Even with respect to human
somatic cell]{.mark} nuclear [transfer]{.mark}---and despite a seemingly
broad international scientific consensus against reproductive cloning
due to its low efficiency and the unacceptable potential health issues
associated with cloned offspring---[no binding global convention has
been agreed upon]{.mark}. What\'s more, [the resulting non-binding
United Nations]{.mark} (UN; New York) "[Declaration on Human Cloning"
remains ambiguous]{.mark} by calling to "prohibit all forms of human
cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the
protection of human life"13. The ambiguity in the UN declaration arises
from its failure to define or interpret the forms of cloning that are
incompatible with human dignity or what human life and human dignity
should mean. The reason [this ambiguity exists]{.mark} was [because UN
negotiations had to address the issue that dignity and life have
different meanings in different cultures and religions]{.mark}
globally14. In line with this, [regulations vary in different]{.mark}
countries or [regions]{.mark} of the world, ranging from prohibition of
all forms of cloning, to selectively permitting therapeutic cloning, to
no official regulations at all (Table 1). Furthermore, the Council of
Europe\'s (Strasbourg, France) legally binding "Convention on Human
Rights and Biomedicine," which prohibits in its protocol on cloning the
creation of "a human being genetically identical to another human being,
whether living or dead," has not been signed or ratified by various
member states, although it explicitly leaves the interpretation of
"human being" to national policies to allow therapeutic cloning where it
is accepted15. That (reproductive) cloning appears not to have been
performed anywhere so far, including in countries where there is no
legal ban, may encourage supporters of such international declarations
or conventions. However, it can hardly provide evidence that they were
instrumental in---or even contributed to---this outcome, especially
given the huge technical hurdles that reproductive cloning faces16.
Illusion of (universal) control [The idea that biological technologies,
like CRISPR]{.mark}--Cas9, [or their applications can be (continuously)
prohibited]{.mark}, and that this can be done [globally]{.mark} thus
[appears]{.mark} [to be]{.mark} reminiscent of [the \'illusion of
control]{.mark}\' [in psychology---a phenomenon in which people\'s
beliefs in the control are greater than can be actually
justified]{.underline}. For instance, people act as if they have control
in situations that are actually determined by chance17. Similarly, when
people envision that they will obtain a certain result that they then
achieve, they frequently overestimate their influence in bringing about
the result18. It is very unlikely that a global ban across jurisdictions
is feasible. Indeed, [current regulations related to germline]{.mark}
interventions [vary considerably]{.mark} across the globe19,20. They
encompass bans---based on law or less-enforceable governmental or
research council guidelines---that prohibit both research and clinical
or reproductive applications; or that prohibit clinical or reproductive
application only; or that remain sufficiently unclear to raise doubts as
to whether they cover human germline gene modification at all (Table 1).
In the United States, no federal law describes an outright ban on human
germline interventions and work on human embryos, and in some states
researchers could do research on embryos with private funding (as was
the case with MGR experiments in Oregon in 2012; ref. 21). Yet, there
are regulatory means in place that in fact prevent human germline
modifications in publicly funded research and in clinical settings.
Thus, the US National Institutes of Health does not fund "any use of
gene-editing technologies in human embryos" and its Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee (RAC) will not entertain or review proposals for
human germline alterations22. Furthermore, the FDA has regulatory
authority over cell and gene therapy applying to any (not only publicly
funded) research and clinical trials in the United States, and the
agency has never approved a proposal to modify the germline. In
addition, a renewable provision (that has been extended twice into 2017)
of the US Congress\'s Fiscal Year 2016 omnibus spending bill prevents
the FDA from using the budget to evaluate or permit trials with human
embryos "intentionally created or modified to include a heritable
genetic modification"23 (see also ref. 24). The bill may thus also
affect the FDA\'s capability to review MGR therapy approaches (see
above). When it comes to developing regulations on whether or under
which conditions germline modifications should be permitted, entrenched
moral stances and views on ethics will always be confronted by, and
weighed against, the hopes and needs of affected people and their
families and caregivers. These may include a desire for people to have
their \'own\' (genetically related) children not suffering the same
disease (e.g., deafness or cystic fibrosis) as both parents do, or new
fertility treatments that may be (felt to be) needed due to economic or
cultural factors. Naturally, the result of the confrontation between
societal ethics and individual hopes---be it a strict ban on all forms
of human germline interventions or more differentiated
regulations---will strongly depend on the prevalent ethical and moral
stances of the societies in which those individuals are found. And these
societal ethical or moral stances will differ across the globe. As in
the case of cloning, moral stances with respect to the compatibility
with human dignity may also be a key issue with respect to germline
modification. The UN Declaration on Human Cloning includes statements on
human genetic engineering. But as for its language about reproductive
cloning, it remains vague and ambiguous with respect to genetic
modification and human dignity, calling for the adoption of "measures
necessary to prohibit the application of genetic engineering techniques
that may be contrary to human dignity"13. Notions of global bans, and
maybe even of globally harmonized regulations, on germline
interventions---at least of ones that would not be too vague or
ambiguous---may thus in fact include features related to the
\'illusion-of-control\'. Alternatives to illusions Features like
exaggerated belief in control or in the causal role of one\'s own
intentions, or unrealistic optimism are elements of normal human
thought. They can promote motivation, persistence or the ability to care
for others25. However, when it comes to the development or choice of
policies, it may be worth considering that these phenomena could also
have a downside: they may entail less \'realistic\' and thus
less-efficient policies. Thus, [policies]{.mark} may be followed
[that]{.mark} strive to universally, and maybe continuously,
[ban]{.mark} or prohibit technologies or their
application---irrespective of their purpose---on a national level or
even globally. But on the basis of the evidence, [there is]{.mark} in
fact little or [no empirical support that such strategies work]{.mark}.
In addition, they may obscure and distract from alternative policy
approaches, focusing on processes that we could better or more
realistically control. Such processes could be case-by-case evaluations,
dealing with specific applications in which we use knowledge and the
technologies in question, such as CRISPR--Cas9 genome editing.
[Developing and delineating tests and standards]{.mark} (including
clinical ones) [for techniques or]{.mark} therapeutic [tools used in the
specific context of these applications may be important]{.mark} elements
of such evaluations. Furthermore, [focusing on concrete applications and
conditions should facilitate interpretations and definitions]{.mark}
(including legal ones) [related to applications and ethical
boundaries]{.mark}20. In contrast to global regulations or bans based on
efforts to \'globalize\' ethics that universally disapprove germline
applications of genome editing, alternative[, more realistic policies
would support more case-oriented approaches]{.mark}. Such policies may
in fact benefit from experiences coming from diverse governance schemes
or authorities. These may involve state, regional and national
regulations, multiple monitoring bodies (both public and private), but
also formal and informal bilateral or multilateral interactions and the
engagement of stakeholders on various levels. Stakeholders should
include not only researchers and ethicists, but also companies and
investors, non-governmental organizations, groups of concerned citizens
or families who would be involved in deciding, for instance, on
(experimental) approaches. The difficulty of deciding who should be
included in such consultations should not be underestimated. For
example, it may be important to engage in the policy development
processes of not only do-it-yourself biology and biohacker communities
as well as biohacker spaces, but also funding sources, such as
crowd-funding platforms or investor-supported \'hackubators\', even
though human germline applications of CRISPR--Cas may not (yet) appear
as a goal for these groups26. Involving them and their efforts on codes
of ethics may be beneficial, not least of all because any bans or
guidelines on institutional research or research funding may hardly
provide guidance and oversight on such non-institutional activities27.
These more [\'polycentric\']{.mark} [patterns of approaches and
stakeholders may]{.mark} [promote]{.mark} key elements linked to
polycentric governance in other contexts, like [diverse]{.mark}
experimental [efforts]{.mark}, [enhanced collaboration]{.mark} or
[mutual monitoring]{.mark} and trust28. These elements could be
important to [facilitate bilateral and multilateral exchange]{.mark}
between nations, [and gain scientific data and knowledge]{.mark} on
safety issues by carefully crafted and monitored laboratory and clinical
experimental approaches. But they may also prove beneficial to the
development of democratically meaningful deliberation processes. These
would need to go beyond the type of expert-dominated summits or one-time
public consultations with largely expert-driven agendas (that resulted
from calls, including for global action, and statements by various
groups4,5,6 so far). Furthermore, these processes would need to
contribute to understanding risks by continuously revisiting earlier
choices and questions, and thus improve policies over time---based on
experiences (about hardly predictable interactions between society and
technology) from different conditions and involving a wide variety of
perspectives29. Such deliberation processes may reduce the danger of
missing potentially important ethical, social or political implications,
and further strengthen mutual trust. [\'Illusion-of-control\'-like
notions of universal ethics and bans on germline applications may thus
favor one-dimensional thinking and illusionary policies, harboring the
danger of leaving aside potentially more realistic and efficient policy
alternatives.]{.underline} [The latter type of \'polycentric\' approach
should be better capable of exploring the opportunities of
genome-editing techniques, foster collaboration between countries and
enhance the chances to grasp the broad range of possible ethical and
social issues that would have to be taken into account by efficient and
trust-building policies.]{.underline} They may also require governments,
non-profits, investors and corporate managers to invest more effort to
understand and experiment with conditions that both foster and ethically
guide innovation. Ensuring that these differentiated and polycentric
policymaking strategies take into account the realities of \'manyness\'
(i.e., societal differences in values and interests across the globe)
would mean tailoring regulations around specific conditions rather than
rejecting applications of technologies as a whole. Such an approach to
regulations would not only allow space for experimental efforts that
generate important scientific data (e.g., on safety issues), but also
reduce incentives for researchers to move to countries with more lax
standards or less stringent oversight. At the same time as they allow
research to progress, they would also allow meaningful democratic
deliberation processes on futures with genome-editing applications that
people may, or may not, want.
