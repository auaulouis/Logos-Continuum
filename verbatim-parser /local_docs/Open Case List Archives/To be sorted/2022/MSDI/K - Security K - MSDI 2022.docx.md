#### The affirmative prioritizes cooperation with NATO, an institution formed as a military alliance and that functions as the West's defender of a hegemonic international legal order. Threats are the glue that bind alliances together. The narrative of the 1AC sustains and perpetuates securitization.

[[In recent years, there has been renewed interest
among]{.underline}]{.mark} International Relations [[(IR) scholars in
the ability of the Western security community to protect itself from a
variety of threats and challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}s. In this context,
longstanding debates concerning [[the role played
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the organization that is widely regarded as the
institutional expression of that
community---[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}---have recently taken on new
dimensions. Scholars and policymakers often disagree in their
interpretations of the relative strength of NATO, but [[many agree that
the alliance needs to play a central role in protecting the West from a
mix of conventional and non-conventional dangers]{.underline}]{.mark},
ranging from an increasingly assertive Russia to transnational
terrorism. One of the key assumptions underpinning many analyses is that
[[NATO constitutes the institutional expression of a pre-existing
Western security community united around liberal-democratic norms and
values]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, a close reading of the alliance's
history shows that, far from simply representing a pre-given community,
[[NATO has always been involved in constructing "the
West."]{.underline}]{.mark} At the heart of that process of social
construction lie practices of collective (re)imagining of the Western
world in specific ways, as well as the representation---and management
of---internal tensions as feuds within a community united by shared
liberal values. Today, the task of managing internal differences has
been rendered particularly difficult by the rise of radical conservative
political forces in several allied states. This has translated into a
clash between liberal and illiberal interpretations of the Western
security community, which has the potential to seriously complicate
inter-allied relations in the foreseeable future. As this paper shows,
contrary to conventional wisdom, middle powers have always played
important roles in the constitution of the Western security community.
More recently, they have also played significant roles in contesting
liberal interpretations of the security community, and articulating an
alternative, radical conservative vision of the West. Recent
developments in allied countries such as Turkey and Poland are a potent
reminder that not all middle powers are alike; on the contrary, based on
their socially constructed, historically specific definitions of
identity, they can perform a diversity of international roles---in
support of, or, conversely, as obstacles to liberal internationalism.
The narrative of Western unity and the politics of collective forgetting
during the Cold War [[One of the most influential narratives of
international security put forward]{.underline}]{.mark} by liberal IR
scholars and practitioners [[centres on the Euro-Atlantic security
community]{.underline}]{.mark}, consisting of a group of countries
[[united around a set of key liberal norms and institutions that
generate "dependable expectations" of peaceful resolution of conflicts
that might arise among them]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 From that
perspective, [[NATO is an institution]{.mark}]{.underline} that was
[[created in the context of the Cold War to protect the pre-existing
security community from the threats posed by the West's dangerous
other]{.underline}]{.mark}: the communist bloc. Yet, as a series of
constructivist scholars have persuasively argued, there is nothing
natural about the Western security community.2 In Emanuel Adler's words,
"[[security communities are socially constructed and rest on shared
practical knowledge of the peaceful resolution of
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}."3 Furthermore, [[the absence of violence
should not lead us to conclude that the construction of security
communities in general and the Western community in particular were
power-free processes]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the contrary, as Adler and
Barnett explain, central to the establishment of a security community is
the dialectic between power---primarily symbolic power---and knowledge.4
Thus, in the physically non-violent context of security communities,
[[power is primarily "the authority to determine the shared meanings
that embody the identities, interests and practices of states, as well
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the conditions that confer, [[defer or deny
access to goods and benefits."]{.underline}]{.mark}5 Applying this logic
to the specific case of NATO, we can see the alliance not as the
institutional expression of a pre-given community, but, rather, as [[an
organization that has been deeply involved in power-filled practices of
construction and reproduction of that community]{.underline}]{.mark}.6
Historical evidence indicates that the founders of NATO---policymaking
elites from the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, France, and
the Benelux states---did not take the Western security community for
granted. Instead, they engaged in a systematic set of practices aimed at
constructing a sense of community around a shared set of
liberal-democratic norms in the Euro-Atlantic area, and placed the newly
created North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the heart of those
practices. In the intergovernmental debates leading up to the
establishment of NATO, the threat of military confrontation with the
Soviet Union was regarded as less worrisome than the danger of communist
subversion within the weakened societies of Western European states.7 In
that context, as Louis St. Laurent---then Canadian Secretary of State
for External Affairs---argued, the best way to prevent a third world war
was by confronting "the forces of communist expansion with an
overwhelming preponderance of moral, economic and military force on the
side of freedom."8 At the level of top Western political elites, the
fear of communism inspired a collective (re)definition of political
identity in the Euro-Atlantic area. The "spectre of Communism" provided
the defining other against which decision-makers on both sides of the
Atlantic were able to subordinate their differences to a collective
definition of a Western community. That community was seen as based on
the common heritage of political and cultural ideas of member states;
its defining mark was [[the set of shared values]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of individual liberal freedoms, the rule of law, and
democracy.]{.underline}]{.mark}9 This view is clearly reflected in the
preamble to the Washington Treaty (NATO's foundational treaty), which
stipulates that the alliance is based on principles of democracy,
individual liberty, and law.

#### And, security is a psychological construct\-\--the aff's scenarios for conflict are products of paranoia that project our violent impulses onto the other

[**The** **threat of nuclear annihilation**]{.underline} has [stimulated
us to]{.underline} try to [**understand what it is about (hu)mankind
that has led to** such **self-destroying behavior**. Central to
this]{.underline} inquiry [is an exploration of the adversarial
relationships between ethnic or national groups. It is out of such
enmities that war, including nuclear war]{.underline} should it occur,
[has always arisen]{.underline}. [Enmity]{.underline} between groups of
people [stems from the interaction of psychological]{.underline},
economic, and cultural [elements. These include fear and
hostility]{.underline} (which are often closely related), [competition
over perceived scarce resources,\[3\] the need for individuals to
identify with a large group]{.underline} or cause,\[4\] [a tendency to
disclaim]{.underline} and assign [elsewhere responsibility for unwelcome
impulses]{.underline} and intentions, [and a peculiar susceptibility to
emotional manipulation]{.underline} by leaders who play upon our more
savage inclinations in the name of national security or the national
interest. [A full understanding of the \"enemy system\"\[3\] requires
insights from]{.underline} many specialities, including
[psychology]{.underline}, anthropology, history, political science, and
the humanities. In their statement on violence\[5\] twenty [social and
behavioral scientists]{.underline}, who met in Seville, Spain, to
examine the roots of war, [declared that [there was **no scientific
basis for**]{.mark} **[regarding (hu)man(s) as]{.mark}** an **innately
[aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline} animal, [inevitably committed to
war]{.underline}. The Seville statement implies that **[[we have real
choices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It also points to a hopeful paradox of
the nuclear age: [threat of nuclear war may have provoked our capacity
for fear-driven polarization but at the same time it has inspired
unprecedented efforts towards cooperation and settlement of differences
without violence.]{.underline} The Real and the Created Enemy [Attempts
to **explore the psychological roots of enmity** are frequently met with
responses on the following lines: \"**I can accept psychological
explanations of things, but [my enemy is real]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The Russians]{.underline} \[or Germans, Arabs, Israelis, Americans\]
[are armed, threaten us, and intend us harm]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[there are real differences between us and our national interests, such
as competition over oil, land, or other scarce resources, and genuine
conflicts of values]{.underline} [between our]{.underline} two
[nations]{.underline}. [It is essential that we be strong and maintain a
balance or superiority of **military and political power**, lest the
other side take advantage of our weakness\". This]{.underline} argument
[[does not address]{.mark} the distinction between the]{.underline}
enemy [threat and **one\'s own contribution to that
threat**]{.underline}-**[by distortions of perception]{.underline}**,
provocative words, and actions. In short, [the enemy is real, but **we
have not learned to understand [how we]{.mark} have [created that
enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [or how the threatening image we
hold of the enemy relates to its actual intentions. \"[We never see our
enemy]{.mark}\'s motives]{.underline} and we never labor to assess his
will, [[with]{.mark} **anything approaching
[objectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}\".\[6\] Individuals may have little
to do with the choice of national enemies. Most Americans, for example,
know only what has been reported in the mass media about the Soviet
Union. [We are largely unaware of the forces that operate within our
institutions, affecting the thinking of our leaders and ourselves, and
which determine how the Soviet Union will be represented to
us]{.underline}. Ill-will and a desire for revenge are transmitted from
one generation to another, and **[[we are not taught to think]{.mark}
critically [about how]{.mark} our assigned [enemies are selected]{.mark}
for us.]{.underline}** In the relations between potential adversarial
nations there will have been, inevitably, real grievances that are
grounds for enmity. But the attitude of one people towards another is
usually determined by leaders who manipulate the minds of citizens for
domestic political reasons which are generally unknown to the public. As
Israeli sociologist Alouph Haveran has said, [in times of conflict
between nations **[historical accuracy is the first
victim]{.mark}**.\[8\]]{.underline} The Image of the Enemy and How We
Sustain It Vietnam veteran William Broyles wrote: \"**[War begins in the
mind, with the idea of the enemy]{.underline}**.\"\[9\] But [to sustain
that idea]{.underline} in war and peacetime [a nation\'s leaders must
maintain public support for the massive expenditures that are required.
Studies of enmity have revealed susceptibilities]{.underline}, though
not necessarily recognized as such by the governing elites that provide
raw material [upon which the leaders may draw to sustain the image of an
enemy.\[7,]{.underline}10\] [Freud\[11\] in his examination of mass
psychology identified the proclivity of individuals to **surrender
personal responsibility to the leaders of large groups**]{.underline}.
This surrender takes place in both totalitarian and democratic
societies, and without coercion. Leaders can therefore designate outside
enemies and take actions against them with little opposition. Much
further research is needed to understand the [[psychological]{.mark}
[mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[impel individuals to]{.mark}
kill or [allow killing]{.mark}]{.underline}** in their name, often [with
little questioning of the **morality or consequences** of such
actions]{.underline}. Philosopher and psychologist Sam Keen asks why it
is that in virtually every war \"The enemy is seen as less than human?
He\'s faceless. He\'s an animal\".\" Keen tries to answer his question:
\"[The image of the enemy]{.underline} is not only the soldier\'s most
powerful weapon; it [is society\'s most powerful weapon. **It enables
people en masse to participate in acts of violence**]{.underline} they
would never consider doing as individuals\".\[12\] National leaders
become skilled in presenting the adversary in dehumanized images. The
mass media, taking their cues from the leadership, contribute powerfully
to the process.

While [[recommendations to **shift our frame**]{.mark} **of
orientation** away from conventional **state-centrism** [toward]{.mark}
a **[\'human security\' approach]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[are
valid, this [cannot be achieved without confronting]{.mark} the
**[deeper theoretical assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[underlying **conventional approaches to \'non-traditional\'
security issues**]{.underline}.106 [By occluding the **structural
origin**]{.underline} [and **systemic dynamic**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} global **[ecological, energy and economic
crises]{.underline}**, [orthodox approaches are **incapable of
transforming them**]{.underline}. Coupled with their excessive
state-centrism, this means [they operate largely at the level of
**\'surface\' impacts** of global crises]{.underline} in terms of how
they will affect quite traditional security issues relative to
sustaining state integrity, [such as]{.underline} international
**[terrorism, violent conflict and population movements]{.underline}**.
[Global crises end up fuelling the **projection of risk onto social
networks**,]{.underline} **[groups and countries]{.underline}** that
cross the geopolitical fault-lines of these \'surface\' impacts -
**[which happen to intersect largely with Muslim
communities]{.underline}**. [Hence, regions particularly vulnerable
to]{.underline} **[climate change]{.underline}** impacts, containing
large repositories of hydrocarbon **[energy resources]{.underline}**, or
subject to demographic transformations in the context of rising
population pressures, [have become the **focus of**]{.underline}
**[state security]{.underline}** planning in the context of
counter-terrorism operations abroad. [The intensifying problematisation
and **externalisation of Muslim-**majority regions and populations by
**Western security agencies - as a [discourse]{.mark}** - [is]{.mark}
therefore not only interwoven with growing state perceptions of global
crisis acceleration, but [driven]{.mark} ultimately [by]{.mark} an
[**epistemological failure** to **interrogate** ]{.mark}**the [systemic
causes]{.mark} of this acceleration** in collective state
policies]{.underline} (which themselves occur in the context of
particular social, political and economic structures). This expansion of
militarisation is thus coeval with the subliminal normative presumption
that the social relations of the perpetrators, in this case Western
states, must be protected and perpetuated at any cost - precisely
because the efficacy of the prevailing geopolitical and economic order
is ideologically beyond question[.]{.underline} As much as [this
analysis]{.underline} highlights a direct link between global systemic
crises, social polarisation and state militarisation, it
[**fundamentally undermines the idea** of]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
symbiotic **[link between natural resources and conflict]{.underline}**
per se. **[Neither \'resource shortages\' nor \'resource
abundance\']{.underline}** (in ecological, energy, food and monetary
terms) [**necessitate conflict** by themselves]{.underline}. [There are
two key operative factors that determine whether either condition could
lead to conflict]{.underline}. The first is the extent to which either
condition can generate socio-political crises that challenge or
undermine the prevailing order. The second is the way in which
stakeholder actors choose to actually respond to the latter crises. [To
understand these factors accurately requires close attention to the
political, economic and ideological **strictures of resource
exploitation, consumption and distribution**]{.underline} between
different social groups and classes. [**Overlooking the systematic
causes** of social crisis leads to a heightened tendency to
**problematise its symptoms**,]{.underline} in the forms of challenges
from particular social groups. [This can lead to **externalisation of
those groups**, **and** the **legitimisation of violence towards them**.
Ultimately, this systems approach to global crises strongly suggests
that conventional **[policy \'reform\' is woefully inadequate]{.mark}**.
Global warming and energy depletion are manifestations of a civilisation
which is in overshoot]{.underline}. The current scale and organisation
of human activities is breaching the limits of the wider environmental
and natural resource systems in which industrial civilisation is
embedded. This breach is now increasingly visible in the form of two
interlinked crises in global food production and the global financial
system. In short, industrial civilisation in its current form is
unsustainable. [This calls for a process of wholesale civilisational
transition to adapt to the inevitable arrival of the post-carbon era
through social, political and economic transformation. Yet
[conventional]{.mark} theoretical and [policy approaches fail to]{.mark}
(1) fully engage with the gravity of research in the natural sciences
and (2) **[translate]{.mark} the social science [implications]{.mark}**
of this research [in terms of]{.mark} the embeddedness of human social
systems in natural [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, **[[lacking
capacity for epistemological self-reflection]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
inhibiting the transformative responses urgently required,
**[[they]{.mark} reify and [normalise mass violence]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} diverse [\'Others\']{.mark}]{.underline}**, newly
**[[constructed as]{.mark} traditional security
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** enormously [amplified by global crises -
[a process that guarantees]{.mark} the intensification and globalisation
of insecurity on the road to **[ecological, energy and economic
catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Such an
outcome]{.underline}]{.mark}[, of course, [is **not
inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [extensive [new]{.mark}
transdisciplinary [research]{.mark} in IR]{.underline} and the wider
social sciences - drawing on and integrating human and critical security
studies, political ecology, historical sociology and historical
materialism, while engaging directly with developments in the natural
sciences - [[is]{.mark} urgently [required to develop]{.mark} coherent
conceptual [frameworks which could **inform more sober**]{.mark}**,
[effective]{.mark}, and joined-up [policy-making]{.mark} on these

### Link\-\--NATO

#### Cooperation with NATO perpetuates the logic of securitization -- it's the most successful military alliance in history -- founded on the desire to construct and eliminate an enemy and preserve the values of western rule of law and democracy.

[[Throughout history military alliances have formed to balance either
countervailing power or the perceived threat
thereof]{.underline}]{.mark}. They have collapsed when the need for a
balance disappeared as a result of either power crumbling or threat
perceptions changing. [[While the origins of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) can be found in its members' perceived need to
balance rising Soviet power in the aftermath of World War
II,]{.underline}]{.mark} the collapse of Soviet imperial rule in the
late 1980s did not lead to NATO's demise. For that reason, [[NATO is
often referred to as the most successful military alliance in
history.]{.underline}]{.mark} Not only did it prove to be the key
instrument in defending its members against Soviet attack or subversion
and in helping to speed Soviet disintegration, the Atlantic Alliance
survived and, at times, thrived in the decade since the disappearance of
the Soviet threat robbed NATO of its main raison d\'être. If success is
measured by longevity, then NATO has rightly earned its historic
designation. [[What accounts for NATO's persistence? Three
factors]{.underline}]{.mark} can be cited[[. First, in the immediate
aftermath of Soviet imperial rule, few were ready to throw the Alliance
overboard.]{.underline}]{.mark} As former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher remarked at the time, "You don't cancel your home
insurance policy just because there have been fewer burglaries on your
street in the last 12 months!"1 [[The need to hedge against an uncertain
future was reflected]{.underline}]{.mark} in the new Alliance strategic
concept, adopted in November 1991 by NATO Heads of State and Government
just days before the Soviet collapse. This concept pointedly noted that
[[the need to "preserve the strategic balance in Europe" would remain
one of NATO's four fundamental security tasks.2 Second, the Alliance has
always meant more than providing a countervailing balance to Soviet
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. To a considerable extent, [[NATO evolved
into a community of like-minded states, united not just by their
opposition to Soviet communism but also by their
determination]{.underline}]{.mark} (as the preamble to the North
Atlantic Treaty of 1949 stated) "[[to safeguard the freedom, common
heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of
democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of
law]{.underline}]{.mark}."3 Over time, NATO grew from being an alliance
principally dedicated to protecting its members against military threat
or attack into the principal NATO in the 21st century - 7 - Final --
March 19, 2001 institutional expression of the transatlantic community
of states and the western values that both defined and united them.
Together, the NATO allies formed a viable, yet pluralistic security
community, one where (with the possible exception of Greece and Turkey)
the thought of settling any dispute among its members by the threat or
use of force has been ruled out a priori. 4 That community remains as
vibrant today as it did at the height of the cold war. Third, when the
military organization was established in the early 1950s to give full
expression to the collective defense commitment of the Washington
Treaty, the basis was laid for a large bureaucracy, staffed by many
thousands of people dedicated to the organization and its mission. While
old soldiers may fade away, large organizations rarely do. After
initially resisting the need to change, the NATO bureaucracy responded,
like all such bureaucracies, by seeking to adapt its mission and
structure in a manner relevant to its new environment. [[On the military
side, internal adaptation has taken the form of a streamlined and more
flexible command structure capable of deploying military forces rapidly
and over greater distances than was the case during the cold war.
Politically, the Alliance has sought new missions to retain its
relevance -- from peacekeeping to countering the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction (WMD).]{.underline}]{.mark} In the process,
NATO has not only survived but been transformed into a politico-military
entity that differs in many significant ways from the organization that
stood ready to meet a Warsaw Pact tank assault across the Fulda Gap.

#### Cooperation with NATO symbolizes a commitment to a common western identity grounded in the logic of threat construction and securitization

One could imagine that the saying 'There is life in an old dog yet' fits
quite well for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Many
serious challenges threatened its cohesion, such as the Suez crisis in
1956, the disputes over the so-called double-track decision in 1979, and
the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1993. While the history of the
alliance has often been told as a history of crises (e.g. Stanley
Hoffman, 1981), neither internal disputes over the war in Iraq nor the
disappearance of a 'communist threat' have led to a break-up of NATO.
[[The transatlantic alliance lives on. It has even expanded in size and
tasks]{.underline}]{.mark} after the end of the Cold War. Recent
tensions between 'the West' and Russia over Crimea and Ukraine make
clear that the Atlantic alliance is anything but dead. As Stephen Walt
put it: 'NATO owes Putin a big thank-you' (Walt, 2014). In International
Relations (IR), debates on the Atlantic alliance have witnessed ups and
downs as well. While realist, liberal, and institutionalist scholars
strove to explain the existence and persistence of NATO by referring
either to an alliance against threat (Walt, 1990, 1997), an alliance of
democracies (Risse-Kappen, 1995, Risse, 1996), or a security manager
(Wallander, 2000), other approaches have advocated a more critical and
reflective understanding of the discourses and practices which
constitute(d) the alliance in the first place (Klein, 1990; Bially
Mattern, 2005; Behnke, 2013; Hellmann, 2006; Jackson 2003; Neumann and
Williams, 2000; Pouliot, 2010; Adler, 2008). [[NATO's lasting ability to
overcome internal and external challenges to its
cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}, I will argue, directs our attention
exactly to the discursive practices which enabled a continuous
re-constitution of a Western security community. By re-constitution I
refer to the Janus-faced process of activating and transforming
foundational narratives which justify the existence and continuity of
NATO. This process commonly includes constructions of threats and a
sense of a shared identity which are both ingrained in symbolic orders
and mobilized by articulations of a common security strategy. Of further
interest, therefore, is how [[the allies]{.underline}]{.mark} answered
the question why NATO should exist, how they invented and [[used a
common notion of identity, interests, and threats in order to justify a
deep and lasting pattern of military cooperation between North America
and (Western]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[European
states.]{.underline}]{.mark} Such a critical constructivist approach
directs our attention to the political dynamics whereby a Western
security community is invented in the first place instead of already
presuming it as taken for granted (cf. Tilly, 1998; Bartelson, 2009;
Herborth, 2009). It emphasizes that [[the practical usage of meaning
imbues an act of political power with quite tremendous institutional
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. Invented as a geopolitical community
of solidarity in the early 1950s with a clear distinction of friends and
enemies, [[NATO symbolized more than a classical military
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Compared to the 'pledge' of collective
defense in [[Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark} of the North Atlantic
Treaty, [[Article 4]{.underline}]{.mark} emphasized that the allies
'will consult together whenever . . . the territorial integrity,
political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened'.
[[Exactly this invocation of a political community made NATO's evolution
possible and enabled a smooth reorientation towards out-of-area missions
and Eastern enlargement in the 1990s]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### NATO was literally founded as a military alliance on principles of deterrence, prioritizing security and maximizing Western domination

Introduction Born in critical times, developed over decades, and having
weathered divisive conflicts, both NATO and the EU will soon enter a
period of political uncertainty in terms of their cooperation. This
article provides insight into the longevity and feasibility of
cooperation initiatives by the EU and NATO by surveying both the
bureaucratic and the strategic challenges faced. The inception of the
European Union (EU) during the post Second World War era is perhaps the
true starting point for analysing how transatlantic security cooperation
adapted a self-sustaining and mutually reconcilable rationale. Winston
Churchill's
[call](http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html) for
supranational European solidarity --- a call for a "United States of
Europe" --- in his 1946 Zurich speech was not only necessitated by
strategic US forebodings during the prelude to the Cold War, but also by
a maturing understanding of the requirements of international security
on both sides of the Atlantic. With this call for unity in mind,
European Coal and Steel Community was conceived to foster economic
interdependence among its members. From there on it surpasses its
original purpose in becoming a safeguard of common European values. The
American counterpart, [[NATO, was formed on the foundational principle
of collective defence and deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and emerged
as a military alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} with abundant economic and
political interests. Historically, [[NATO has prioritised the military
and security]{.mark}]{.underline} while the EU aimed for economic and
developmental progress. However, similar to the EU, [[NATO is an
organization with an ever increasing dedication to a common set of
values, through which is seeks to ensure stabilization and
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although [[NATO operates
on]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[militaristic grounds]{.underline}]{.mark}
than the EU, the alliance has overhauled its solely military focus to
envision a wider appreciation of values, including [transparency and
accountability](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_111582.htm)
as well as [women, science and environment for peace and
security](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_91091.htm). NATO and
EU's positions -what they want- and interests -why they want- have not
always overlapped. For instance, [[NATO actions had been in parallel to
maintaining American unipolarity in the global
order]{.underline}]{.mark} contrasted with EU prioritizing the
multiscale cooperation with its neighbors and other world powers,
including China, Russia and India. Exemplified by disapproving European
position of American invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, NATO's
non-regional interventions is
[advised](https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Report_8-What_do_Europeans_want_from_NATO_0.pdf)
to be exceptions rather than a rule by EU Institute for Security
Studies.

#### NATO is an integrated military structure highly trained and schooled in both overt and subtle security planning.

[[The integrated command structure]{.underline}]{.mark} as a general
asset [[is crucial to understanding why NATO-and
not]{.underline}]{.mark} [[other institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, such
as the UN or the Western European Union (WEU)-can act for post-Cold War
military missions in Europe. \"NATO has the military structure: look at
Kosovo. The UN failed in Bosnia: it can do certain kinds of peacekeeping
operations and humanitarian missions very well. But military missions
require command and control, so this means NATO. [[Military command is
crucial to what NATO does well]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"77 [[NATO has the
headquarters with planning, logis- tics, and intelligence staffs,
including military personnel who have all planned, trained, exercised,
and schooled together for years and developed a deep
trust.]{.underline}]{.mark}78 \"If, for example, NATO were just the
Article 5 commitment without any of its assets, it would be the WEU.
What made NATO possible in the 1990s was what was devel- oped in the
Cold War to deal with the Soviet threat and the alliance\'s internal
tasks. One official said that the OSCE was considered as a vehicle for
dealing with Yugosla- via, but officials recognized what it could and
could not do. The OSCE is best at establishing norms and standards for
political and human rights. \"We do not need NATO for every security
issue, but we did need it to be able to react to the ones that were on
the agenda in the 1990s.\"80 Why were NATO\'s military command structure
and political decision-making pro- cedures general, rather than
specific, assets? Because, observed a senior defense official, \"through
its political consultation, integrated military command, and organi-
zations for implementation, NATO is able to do the three things that
have to be done for any policy: mobilize, organize, and implement.\"\'81
Although developed during the Cold War, these capacities translate into
post-Cold War missions and are crucial for multilateral security
missions. While those who value efficiency bemoan NATO\'s slowness, the
official noted, NATO \"is not for maximum efficiency, but for acting
together.\"82 Another official, when asked why NATO has been able to
adapt, an- swered that it is because all political-military missions
require planning, and \"during the Cold War, that is what NATO did.\"83
And another official answered that it is NATO that has the tools for
action, listing the integrated military command, logistics,
command-control-communication, and the structures for coming to a
coherent and cohesive consensus, whereas the UN and the OSCE do not.84
The political issues of non-Article 5 missions make the process more
difficult, he observed, but the plan- ning mechanism is basically the
same: procedures for generating forces and readi- ness are on the books,
the militaries understand them, and governments are accus- tomed to and
ready for them. However, just as clearly as Bosnia demonstrated that
NATO\'s political consulta- tion and integrated command structures were
general assets that made it adaptable to the new security environment of
risks and non-Article 5 conditions, it also demon-strated that NATO
lacked important specific military assets for dealing with out-of- area
non-Article 5 contingencies. [[The alliance\'s potential new military
missions re- quire smaller, lighter, and mobile forces with expertise
and training in peacekeeping, humanitarian relief, and peace
enforcement, in stark contrast to the Cold War
mission]{.underline}]{.mark} of positional defense. This process of
creating post-Cold War specific military assets began both among members
and in conjunction with Partnership for Peace.

#### NATO exists to solidify and react to perceived threats of danger to Western security.

GIORGIO **CAFIERO** April 23, **2022** The Russian Threat Gives NATO New
Purpose
https://politicstoday.org/the-russian-threat-gives-nato-new-purpose/

It was not long ago when NATO's divisions were running deep. Until
recently, many in the West were questioning the security alliance's
purpose. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald Trump said that if
Baltic states weren't "paying their bills" the U.S. shouldn't
necessarily protect them from Russia notwithstanding treaty obligations.
In 2019, French President Emanuele Macron asserted that NATO was
"becoming brain-dead". The following year, tensions between Greece and
Turkey led some experts to conclude that NATO was "paralyzed". At that
time, 70 percent of Turkey's population saw the U.S., NATO's dominant
military force, as a threat to their country. Many voices in the West
accused Germany of being a "shaky alliance partner" and "NATO's biggest
freeloader." But [[Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} on
24 February [[was a geopolitical tsunami that fundamentally changed the
strategic stakes for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} members. Amid drastic
changes in Europe's security architecture[[, the Western alliance has
regained a sense of purpose.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Today NATO is more
unified and cohesive than it ever has been]{.underline}]{.mark} since
the Soviet Union's implosion in 1991. "[[Threat is the glue that binds
together a security alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}," explained John
Feffer, the director of Foreign Policy In Focus, in an interview with
Politics Today. "[[When the threat increases--and there is a consensus
on the nature of the threat--the alliance necessarily becomes more
cohesive.]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's invasion of Ukraine has served
to smooth over a number of disagreements within the alliance." The
Ankara-based Foreign Policy Institute's Dr Tarik Oguzlu
[wrote](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/analysis/analysis-natos-impasse-in-the-ukraine-russia-war/2563261)
that "as we witness NATO's European members awaking from their
geopolitical hibernation, NATO is almost returning to its founding
mission." The war in Ukraine quickly led to a "revolution in German
military affairs" with Berlin now committed to a hike in defense
spending. The Germans put Nord Stream 2 pipeline on hold. Berlin is also
arming the Ukrainian resistance with lethal weapons despite previously
opposing NATO's militarization of Ukraine. For decades, a handful of
Western countries accused Italy of being too Russia-friendly. But for
the past two months, Italy has taken a strong stance against Vladimir
Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Now closely aligned with the Transatlantic
alliance against Moscow, Rome has supported sanctioning Russia. As
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi put it, Italy responded to the
President of Ukraine's appeal for weapons because "it's not possible to
respond only with encouragement" when a democratic country comes under
attack. Talk in western capitals about kicking Turkey out of NATO has
basically come to a sudden end. There has been somewhat of a rebound in
Ankara-Washington relations as Turkey arms Kiev with Baykar TB2 drones.
Based on shared concerns about Moscow's conduct in Ukraine, Greece and
Turkey have found common cause since 24 February. NATO's Baltic members
have long been far more alarmist about the Russian threat than those in
Western Europe. But such [[East-West divisions within NATO are going
away. "Western politicians are now saying to us, you were
right,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Arvydas Anušauskas, Lithuania's Minister of
National Defence, [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thVCPFcHpNs) Al
Jazeera. Since 24 February, [[NATO members "have rallied together and
acted quickly with new defence and deterrence measures such as
activating the NATO defence plans, activating elements of the NATO
Response Force, and approving the deployment of four new multinational
battlegroups in Eastern Europe,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Mihai Chihaia, a
policy analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre, told
Politics Today. [["Reinforcing the Eastern flank has been a top priority
and the Allies have shown a very high degree of
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, [[the strong commitment to
Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark} (mutual defense) [[has been constantly
reiterated." NATO is]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[becoming more
unified because of a growing common threat
perception]{.mark}]{.underline} of Russia. The security alliance might
be on the verge of expanding its membership. Sweden and Finland appear
close to abandoning their decades-old foreign policy tradition of
neutrality and entering NATO. Finland doing so would add [810

#### NATO is premised on western imperialism and means all their authors assume a cold war mindset that causes perpetual war

[Discussions of]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\'s
[([NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}[)]{.underline} role [after the end of the
cold war predominantly focus on its adaptation to the new
[security]{.mark} environment, the redefinition of its mission and the
transformation of its military and political structures]{.underline}
(Gordon, 1997; Kay, 1998; Yost, 1998). While this kind of literature is
valuable in its own right, [[its underlying assumption]{.mark} about the
adaptive logic of NATO\'s post-cold war policies tends to underrate the
ability of the Alliance to actively shape the security environment
through its [discursive construction of security political
\'realities\']{.mark} and the re-presentation of its institutional
identity]{.underline}. At the same time, this literature arguably
underestimates the task confronting NATO. The collapse of the cold war
order does not only pose a problem to NATO in terms of adapting to a new
reality, the features of which are are supposedly as clearly discernable
as the ones of the cold war itself. [Rather, its demise challenges NATO
(and other international actors and institutions) to articulate new and
stable \'structures of meaning\' which can render \"the unfamilar in the
terms of the familiar\"]{.underline} (Campbell, 1992:4) and [which make
it possible to re-assume political and military-strategic
agency.]{.underline} The purpose of this essay is to [analyze the way in
which NATO is responding to these challenges]{.underline}. [More
specifically]{.underline}, it [addresses the problem of the Alliance\'s
[\'Western\' identity]{.mark} and the strategies of inclusion and
exclusion through which this identity is [re-defined]{.mark} and
re-asserted after the disappearence of the constitutive Other of the
cold war, that is, [the Communist \'East\']{.mark}. At the same time,
the essay deals with NATO\'s search for new adversaries and
threats.]{.underline} These two issues, while often treated separately
in the literature, are in fact closely related. As Owen Harries
(1993:42) pointed out some years ago, [[The political \'West\' is not a
natural construct]{.mark} but a highly artificial one. It took the
presence of [a life-threatening,]{.mark} overtly hostile \'East\' to
bring it into existence and to maintain its unity. It is extremely
doubtful whether it can now survive the disappearance of that
[enemy.]{.mark} We need not take Harries\' skepticism at face value in
order to appreciate the problematization of what the West actually is.
Suffice it to state that matters of identity are intrinsically related
to the problem of difference and adversity. The articulation of a
Western identity, Harries\' argument suggests, was made possible, and
depended upon the presence of a hostile \'East\'.]{.underline} As
Bradley Klein (1994:120-21) has argued, [this presence has allowed NATO
to prevail and survive the many crises and internal conflicts amongst
its member-states.]{.underline} Already in the 1960s, Henry Kissinger
analyzed the effects of détente on alliance cohesion in terms that
anticipate to some extent the troubles NATO would face some 30 years
later after the demise of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. As the détente
develops, the need to transform the Alliance from its present defensive
concept into a political arrangement defining itself by some positive
goals will grow ever more urgent. [Defense against a military threat
will soon lose its force as a political bond. Negotiations with the East
will prove corrosive unless they go hand in hand with the creation of
common political purposes and the institutions to embody
them]{.underline} (Kissinger, 1965:10). In other words, in [the absence
of a \'life-threatening\' adversary, the West runs the danger of
[disintegrating and dissolving.]{.mark} That [NATO]{.mark} was able to
avoid this fate]{.underline} for forty years supports Klein\'s
(1994:121) contention that the alliance strength rested on its ability
to wed itself \"to the defense of a distinctly modern[, Western,
Atlantocentric cultural project\" which made it possible to deflect and
externalize its internal contradictions and conflicts. If we acknowledge
this internal relationship between (stable) identity and (hostile)
difference, we can appreciate the paradox that the end of the cold war
presented a much more serious threat to NATO than the East-West
confrontation ever did. For the end of the cold war also means that the
unraveling of [Cold War representations]{.mark} has raised for the first
time the fundamental issue of Western identity. It is no longer clear
who is to be legitimately incorporated within the space of modern
[Western culture]{.mark}.]{.underline} \... Simply put the world under
[[NATO\'s guidance]{.mark} is no longer subject to containment. It\'s
boundaries have now been eroded\...]{.underline} (Klein, 1994:133).
Consequently, the West faces the problem of \'self-determination\', of
defining its identity and its borders against the rest of the world.
Self-determination is usually assumed to contribute to peace in the
international system. Thus, the United Nations (UN) Charter states in
Article 1, paragraph 2 as one of its purposes, To develop friendly
relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal
rights and self-determination of peoples.

### Link\-\--BioD

#### Depictions of a pristine biodiversity ignoring the un-ending violence caused by the west -- their attempts to maintain Bio -- D are not for protection but further surveillance and exploitation

Timothy W. **Luke**, Professor of Political Science at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University, **1997**, Ecocritique, p.
65-69

Until the early 1970s, TNC adhered to many essentially romantic
as­sumptions about Nature in its various operations. Nature existed as a
real presence in places left undisturbed by human beings.27 At such
sites, therefore, all plants and animals embodied Nature's substance,
and as such they were all worthy of protection. Therefore, acquiring any
and all land that was not now being touched by some human settlement's
eco­nomic and social activity constituted a meaningful act of Nature
conser­vation. The battle lines were drawn across territories understood
as land under active current social utilization (or artificial zones
without a large Nature presence) and land no longer or not yet put to
such use (or natu­ral zones without a large social presence), making it,
therefore, worthy as a site of Nature conservancy. At some point in the
1960s and 1970s, these discursive frames be­came obsolete, even though
many people today inside and outside of the environmental movement do
not recognize their obsolescence. Bill McKibben and Carolyn Merchant, to
a very real extent, are right.28 [Nature has ended. [Nature is
dead]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps it was the conquest of
extraterrestrial spaces in the moon landings of 1969---70, whose
tele­visual and photographic images of the Earth sublated conceptual
an­tinomies like Nature/Society, out-there/in-here,
wilderness/settlement, and environment/economy in pictures of one
undifferentiated little blue planet floating in space. Perhaps it was
the penetration of trans­national capitalism even into Moscow and Beijing
during Nixon's detente, whose acceptance of Pepsi, Kentucky Fried
Chicken, or Pan Am passengers underscored how commercial commodities now
could go anywhere anytime anyone wished them to do so. Perhaps it was
the collective shudder of the 1971---73 oil shocks from OPEC, whose
antics illustrated how tightly coupled all human societies were to
petrochemical energy supplies mostly pumped up from under a hand­ful of
Mideastern deserts. [The brittleness in the traditional categories,
[pitting "Nature" against "Society]{.mark}," finally
snapped]{.underline}. There really were no lands without any traces of
some large social presence. Hundreds of individual plants and animals
were not merely being disturbed by humanity; they were being eradi­cated
as species in wholesale extinctions. Scientific observations of air
quality, water quality, atmospheric integrity, bone composition, or milk
production were indicating that human beings have profoundly dis­turbed
what had been regarded as unalterable sovereign Nature with in­dustrial
pollution, greenhouse gases, chemical contamination, and radio­active
wastes. Hence, to pretend to be conserving "the untouched and
undisturbed expanses of Nature" in simple actions of land ownership made
very little sense[. [Nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it had been
conceptualized by the Ecologist's Union in 1945 for The Nature
Conservancy to preserve after 1951, [had been [disappearing]{.mark}
right from under everyone's noses]{.underline} as global modernization
accelerated at even greater rates from 1945 to 1973. [Once-undisturbed
lands could no longer be regarded as the container of Na­ture as such,
[they had to be continuously reassessed to determine their ecological
values,]{.mark} creating the space of surveillance]{.underline}, as
chapters 4 and 5 argue, [known as "the environment.]{.underline}"29 From
1951 to 1973, TNC did have a decidedly scientific air about its
operations, even though with its haphazard policies of property
acquisi­tion the organization still worked as a land collection program
to pre­serve scenic beauty, rare plants, and wild animals on whatever
land it would get whenever it could get it. Low-key and
nonconfrontarional, The Nature Conservancy's style of environmental
protection had been fairly cozy with big business from the beginning.
Under the leadership of Pat Noonan from 1973 to 1980, however, this
almost accidental prece­dent was turned into an article of faith. During
the intensive environ­mental conflicts of the early 1970s, as Noonan
notes, "corporations and environmentalists were butting heads, but we
knew the free-enterprise system was a fantastic motivator. So the
Conservancy decided to reach out to corporate America. No other
environmental group was doing it." This operational strategy was
augmented with a new mission state­ment from Bob Jenkins, The Nature
Conservancy's in-house biologist. Dissatisfied with [the
Conservancy]{.underline}'s acceptance of land with dubious ecological
worth, although it often appeared to be undisturbed as natu­ral scenery,
Jenkins [saw [biodiversity rather than natural appearance]{.mark} as
that quality which TNC should be preserving]{.underline}.31 Instead of
protecting any and all land that it acquired, [Jenkins's strategy
stressed preserving only those lands populated by rare or endangered
flora and fauna in [unique ecosystems. Scientific surveillance was
combined with high-test property management]{.mark}]{.underline} to give
TNC a much clearer purpose. Noonan's acceptance of corporate free
enterprise and Jenkins's [agen­das for surveying, inventorying, and
guarding biotic diversity recentered The Nature Conservancy's ideologies
and institutions]{.underline} on the strategies they continue to follow
today. Grove concludes: The Nature Conservancy would henceforth seek out
and attempt to save species and biotic communities that stood in danger
of disappearing under human pressures. It would buy land when necessary,
but to cut down on management and overhead costs, property was often
turned over whenever possible to responsible federal and state agen­cies
for protection. Further, TNC would decentralize, establishing state
field offices that could keep closer watch on the land. Coinciding with
its new focus, the national staff grew out of its basement quarters in
Washington and moved just across the Potomac River into a high rise
office building in Rosslyn, Virginia. Emerging as well in the months and
years that followed were the practical arguments for maintaining biotic
diversity. . . . Although morals and aesthetics still apply, the
emphasis turned to "save this plant because we may need it someday"
instead of "save this plant because we have no right to kill it." Over
the past two decades, TNC has grown by leaps and bounds by sticking to
the operating objectives in this "preserving biodiversity" mis­sion
statement. [Because Nature has ended, material signs of its now-dead
substance need to be conserved as pristine preserved parts]{.underline},
like pressed leaves in a book, dried animal pelts in a drawer, or a
loved one's mortal remains in a tomb. [Nature is dead, but long shall
[Nature live in the environmental­ized forms of rare species, exotic
biodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline}, land preserves, [[and threat­ened
ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}. As powerful anthropogenic actions have
recontoured the earth to suit the basic material needs of corporate
modes of produc­tion, these artificial contours now define new ecologies
for all life forms caught within their "economy" and "environment." [The
"economy" be­comes a world political economy's interior spaces defined by
techno­science processes devoted to production and consumption, while
"the environment]{.underline}," in this sense, [becomes a planetary
[political economy's ex­terior spaces oriented to resource
creation]{.mark}]{.underline}, scenery provision, [and waste
reception]{.underline}. The [pickets and suits deployed by]{.underline}
other more vocal [ecological groups]{.underline} perpetuate a faulty
one-dimensional consciousness, "believing that environmental protection
and economic growth are somehow mu­tually exclusive."33 These antiquated
perceptions [cling to the illusion that Nature is alive, and somehow
avoiding its subjection to capital in the commodity form by remaining
wilderness]{.underline}. Recognizing the true to­tality of [transnational
capital's power]{.underline}, which [easily commodifies wilder­ness in
many environmental products]{.underline}, the goal of "The Nature
Conser­vancy is to change this unfortunate perception," because, as
anyone at­tentive to capital's dynamics can attest, "our economy and
environment are not antagonists, they depend on each other. \...
protecting our natu­ral resources generates economic benefits."34 Natural
resources exist, but Nature does not. Economic survival is imperative,
but the commodity logics driving it need to be grounded in sound
ecological common sense lest the limitless dynamism of com­modification
be permitted to submit everything to exchange logics im­mediately. Time
is now what is both scarce and centrally important in the highly
compressed time-space continua of contemporary commod­ity chains. It is
no longer a question of jobs versus the environment, be­cause fewer jobs
will not resurrect Nature. Nature is dead, and the envi­ronment
generating global production assumes that jobs are necessary to define
it as the space of natural resources. Doing jobs irrationally and too
rapidly, however, is what destroys these environments, making jobs done
rationally and at an apt pace ecologically acceptable. Consequently, the
agendas of environmental protection must center on the "question of the
short-term vs. the long-term," and this is "what the Conservancy is all
about."35

### Link\-\--Bioterror

#### Bioterror discourse is imagined, and leads to war 

**Kittelsen, 9** -- Researcher for the Security programme @ the
International Peace Research Institute in Oslo (Sonja, "Conceptualizing
Biorisk: Dread Risk and the Threat of Bioterrorism in Europe," Security
Dialogue vol. 40, no. 1, February)

The dread [that the prospect of [bioterrorism]{.mark} elicits thus not
only [compounds]{.mark} the distinction between actual and [imagined
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but also challenges the
conventional spatio-temporal relationship between ['threat' and
'[security']{.mark}, in that it [reinforces a]{.mark} sense of
[imminence and pervasiveness]{.mark} of possible
[attack.]{.mark}]{.underline} Its imperceptible nature means that
[insecurity can exist independent of an actual attack occurring, [the
mere threat of infection]{.mark} and contagion carrying the capacity to
[evoke a heightened sense of fear]{.mark} [long before]{.mark} and well
after [an attack]{.mark} has been identified as ever having taken place.
In the absence of fact about a threat that [deliberately evades
detection]{.mark}, the demand on governments to act proactively has
become all the more salient, and providing for security has taken a
precautionary turn. Strategies aimed at mitigating the threat of
bioterrorism have thus involved attempts at delineating security through
[spatio-temporal techniques]{.mark} that involve intervening in the
present in order to avoid the potential for serious and [irreversible
damage in the future]{.mark}. They constitute an attempt at
rearticulating the boundary between 'secure' and 'insecure' space
through the active act of anticipation. Inherent in such an anticipatory
logic, however, is an in-built vulnerability, in that this logic is
necessarily informed by the subjective insecurities that the threat of
bioterrorism elicits. [It simultaneously functions within and
constitutes a product of the dread that the threat of
bioterrorism]{.mark} evokes, and accordingly does not so much serve to
reduce the threat of bioterrorism as it serves to mitigate the effects
of what is considered an inevitable occurrence. It there- by runs the
risk of [perpetuating insecurity]{.mark} to the extent that it
facilitates threat through its enactment. Engaging with the threat of
bioterrorism, then, neces- sarily requires recognizing how the same
logic that informs the dread that bioterrorism elicits also serves to
inform the security practices pursued to confront it. Just as [the
molecular body is no longer conceptualized as a unified whole]{.mark},
so too is Europe less a self-contained entity than a site of circulation
and exchange. Mitigating the threat of bioåterrorism, then, necessitates
explor- ing the ways in which security practices and perceptions of
threat interact with each other and with the more tangible aspects of
the threat of bioterror- ism to make Europe not only vulnerable to
biological insecurity, but also [a producer and perpetuator of
it]{.mark}. This article argues that it is by conceptualizing
bioterrorism through the notion of '[dread risk']{.mark} that this
[self-perpetuation of vulnerability and threat can be exposed]{.mark}
and the necessary inroads provided by which to engage more critically
with the threat of bioterrorism, its produc- tion and perpetuation, as
well as with the constitution of 'security' itself.]{.underline}

Commentator Joshua Ramo had famously lumped various threads of narrative
under the rubric of [["Beijing Consensus"]{.mark}. Subsequently, that
[narrative took on new dimensions]{.mark}, both in China and abroad,
[countervailing]{.mark}]{.underline} along the way the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank as the organs behind globalising
Anglo--American [[neo-liberal discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}
("Washington Consensus").12 Then, [[why has Beijing's narrative
attracted so much attention if the Chinese experience is in reality so
hard to define? It can be attributed]{.mark} mainly [to]{.mark} an
emergent [insecurity among policymakers]{.mark} and the intelligentsia
in Western Europe and North America [about the validity of their
own]{.mark} social and political [values, and the salubrity of their own
societies]{.mark}. Evidence to that effect [can be found]{.mark} not
merely [in]{.mark} Brook's litanies about the [loss of American
dynamism]{.mark} and the bumbling of the Barack Obama
administration.]{.underline} More importantly, a growing body of
academic literature has accumulated over the last few years to
underscore how grossly unequally distributed income has become in the
West. Many economists, not just on the far left, now indict the Ronald
Reagan-- Margaret Thatcher project of neo-liberalism for reversing the
great post-war baby boomers' march towards equal opportunity.
[Inequality seers like Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, Thomas Picketty or
Luigi Zingales may not necessarily agree about the health of the Chinese
economy per se, but they certainly share a platform when it comes to
inveighing against the godfathers of financial
deregulation]{.underline}, which they see as the underlying cause of
America's post-2008 recession.13 To be sure, there has always been
critical interest among American academe in the failings of the
"system", and in democratic "optimisation" of economic outcomes.
Buchanan and Tullock's pioneering 1962 work on public choice is a case
in point. They sought a free-market-friendly mathematical formula that
would curb the ability of vested-interest groups to bypass the will of
the silent majority through, for example, "pork-barrelling" swing voters
or "lobbying" career politicians. However, in the 1960s, even studies
such as Buchanan and Tullock's were informed by the "genius" of
America's founding fathers and its 1787 Constitution,14 whereas many
commentators of different partisan persuasions today view the
Constitution itself, if not the Union's whole political architecture, as
anachronistic and unfit for the purpose in that they paralyse
decisionmaking in Washington.15 [In search of new answers, [the
insecurity premise]{.mark}, as discussed earlier, [has
resurrected]{.mark} interest in the once-marginalised, ["heterodox"
economic theories]{.mark}, ranging from Mancur Olson, Hyman Minsky, Wolf
Ladejinsky, Karl Polanyi to John K. Galbraith. All heterodox thinkers
shared, in their time, deep-seated suspicion of the ability of free
markets or representative democracy for that matter, to pre-empt the
harbingers of resource misallocation. In other words, they rejected in
one way or another neoclassical economic theory.]{.underline} As has
been argued elsewhere, this disillusionment with neoclassical diktat has
also led to renewed interest in the lessons that economic history,
economic sociology and new institutional economics might offer, thus
revitalising these three disciplines.16 Recent historically informed
work by economists is now almost de rigueur and has gone well beyond the
left-leaning circles. Taking issue with the root causes of the 2008
global financial crisis, such work---ranging from Reinhart and Rogoff's
rightleaning This Time is Different to Acemoglu and Robinson's more
centrist Why Nations Fail---harks back to several centuries earlier in
its temporal scope. At the same time, older work by contrarian economic
historians and economists that has been somewhat neglected in the 1980s,
when neo-liberalism was fast advancing, found new readers among
conventionally trained economists---from Paul Bairoch, Chalmers Johnston
to Alice Amsden. Also, authors outside academe like Joe Studwell draw on
that onceneglected work and converge on the view that the East Asian
experience belies neoliberalism and exposes the small-government biases
thereof.17 Freshly published, Studwell's path-breaking and
quantitatively-compelling research in economic history is further
validating his insights. Allen and Lind have both respectively shown,
for example, that unfree-market, big-government designs had not only
typified the East Asian path to industrialisation. In fact, such grand
design could also be attributed to America's rise in the early 19th
century. [Baldly put, Allen, Lind and others argue that [wealthier
countries start preaching to poorer countries about the need for free
trade]{.mark} (read: reduce tariffs designed to protect nascent
industries) [and the need to reduce government size]{.mark} (read: allow
foreigners to buy out vital sectors of the national economy) [only after
they themselves had completed industrialisation on the back of very
protectionist measures]{.mark}.]{.underline}18 [For these reasons, the
human rights discourse in the modern developed world is critiqued by
scholars like Noam Chomsky, Daniel A. Bell and Martin Jacques as a
values-laden, ahistorical sugarcoating of what is, in essence, crude
economic interests of/in advanced capitalist countries. Much like "free
markets" in neoclassical parlance, human rights are conceived of as
bringing about immediate betterment of the human condition irrespective
of time and place, whereas in the Chinese narrative "individual" rights
and "markets" are both viewed as contingent on "collective will" and on
evolutionary social reform]{.underline}. Yet, as Stiglitz alluded to,
the wealthier "collectivist" China becomes, the harder it is to shrug
off its affinity with the "individualistic" United States. [While, on
the right, some [Western critics still cling to democracy-vs.-tyranny
binary]{.mark}, and on the left, some critics starkly posit the American
neo-imperialism vs. China's "peaceful rise" thesis, both contending
powers are in fact experiencing flagrantly unequal wealth
distribution---they are both big polluters, big military spenders,
capital-punishment enthusiasts; and they also incarcerate big segments
of their population.]{.underline}19 Perhaps more importantly, not only
are their logics of socio-economic regulation increasingly more similar
to each other, they are now more economically interdependent than at any
other point in history.20 Much of the self-doubt in America as well as
the newfound interest in institutional economics, have, after all, to do
with the fact that the "one man, one vote" system proved incapable of
stalling the reversal of the post-war social contract in the West, which
had in turn stamped out the spread of communism. Ironically, as Picketty
poignantly shows, once the spectre of communism had diminished,
inequality exploded.21 Recent works are very important in this context
because they show---based on independently gathered polling data---that
the absence of "one man, one vote" in China is not yet costing the CPC
much popular support. Peerenboom, in particular, does much to dispel the
fairly common Western notion that the peoples of the developing world
would prefer a greater degree of democracy and social equality to
raising of living standards in absolute terms.22 The argument, to be
sure, might hold well beyond China. [It specifically brings to mind
Latin America: while that part of the world democratised relatively
recently, in some cases following decades of oppressive dictatorship,
most Latin Americans still seem to prize economic performance over
universal suffrage. Moreover, a few democratically elected Latin
American governments have arguably taken social inequality well beyond
the norm under their dictatorial predecessors.]{.underline}23 US-based
academics like Pei Minxin and Huang Yasheng often invoke India by way of
an inspiration for the developing world that is alternative to the
"China Model"; one that is more democratic and therefore one that would
prove more economically compelling in the long run.24 After all, India
is the biggest and one of the longestrunning democracies in Asia.
[However, as Drèze and Sen's work indicates, the fact that the Gini
coefficient for supposedly-communist China may now be higher than that
of India conceals the tough everyday realities that the overwhelmingly
rural populations of either country face.]{.underline} For Drèze and
Sen, perhaps more instructive is the fact that Chinese economic reforms
of the last three decades did not whittle away at arable land
distribution. In India, by way of contrast, arable land distribution
remains badly skewed despite Nehru's socialist legacy.25 What this
points to, then, is [[the need for any transfers of concrete policies
and regulatory ideologies]{.underline}]{.mark}---in particular that of
the supposedly superior neoliberal reason---[[to be contextually and
historically grounded]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[WHAT'S THE COST OF IMAGINING AN ENEMY?]{.mark}]{.underline} In Charles
Frazier's award-winning novel Cold Mountain, the male protagonist Inman,
a badly wounded soldier running away from the bloody battlefield during
the American Civil War, meets a blind street vendor. Similar to his own
wounds, someone must have been responsible for his blindness, Inman
wonders. To Inman's surprise, however, the street vendor says he was
actually born that way. Looking at his terrible wounds at the hands of
known enemies, Inman somehow starts to pity that blind man. '[For how
did you find someone to hate for a thing that just was? What would be
the cost of not having an enemy? [Who could you strike for retribution
other than yourself?]{.mark}']{.underline}3 A self-fulfilling prophecy
85 As he quickly flips through these questions in his mind, suddenly
Inman begins feeling lucky---at least he knows his enemy. To that blind
man, knowing no enemy denies him that precious sense of certainty or a
clear target for revenge. [With his known enemy, the lucky Inman is in
good company. In many ways, [the military-industrial complex
finds]{.mark} itself in a similar situation, but [its lucky star is the
perceived]{.mark} certain [threat of China. Without]{.mark} knowing this
[threat]{.mark}, the high-level military [spending would be difficult to
justify]{.mark}, and [without]{.mark} that military [spending,
the]{.mark} political [economy of fear could not function]{.mark}
properly, nor could military Keynesianism continue to
flourish.]{.underline} This is why Richard N. Haass, President of the
Council on Foreign Relations and former Director of Policy Planning in
the US State Department, observes that having survived decades of the
Soviet challenge, [containment might not be able to survive its own
success.]{.underline} 4 While the lack of an enemy---real or
imagined---appears costly indeed for the discursive identity and
institutional 'survival' of the militaryindustrial complex, [I contend
that having an enemy, even an imagined one, is by no means cost-free. In
fact, [in the case of China,]{.mark} it could be very costly in that
[the construction]{.mark} and treatment of China [as a threat could
result in China becoming one in reality]{.mark}. In other words, the
cost lies in the fact that the 'China threat' paradigm could become
self-fulfilling in practice. To the military-industrial complex, the
absence of a threat/enemy constitutes an ultimate threat.]{.underline} A
self-fulfilling prophecy, according to American sociologist Robert
Merton, means that 'a false definition of the situation which makes the
originally false conception come true'.5 What is 'false' in hindsight or
in the eyes of a bystander is frequently defined as real by the actor in
question; and 'if men define situations as real, they are real in their
consequences'. 6 [[In international relations, fear]{.mark}, often based
on 'false' images, [can have]{.mark} precisely [such self-fulfilling
consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thucydides, the author of a realist
'great text' History of the Peloponnesian War, noted a self-fulfilling
prophecy of fear in interstate politics. In his account for the war's
outbreak, Thucydides suggested that 'What made war inevitable was the
growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta'.7
More than two millennia later, another realist scholar-practitioner,
George Kennan ascribed the origin of the Cold War to the paranoid
ideology of the Soviet Union.8 [If so, the fear manifested in the 'China
threat' paradigm could also become confirmed in reality. Two
interrelated processes are at play here. First, the 'China threat'
paradigm, taken as objective truth, would imply the need for containing
China in practice. Second, such practice, given the logic of mutual
responsiveness, is more likely than not to be mirrored back by China in
either symmetric or asymmetric ways. As the latter's hardline mimicry
apparently 'confirms' the initial fear of the China threat, what we are
witnessing is a classic case of self-fulfilling prophecy.]{.underline}

#### The fear of China comes from a neocolonial desire -- such rhetoric is made to produce an economy of fear causing ontological death

[[The twin paradigms of China threat and China opportunity are animated
by Western]{.mark}/American [neocolonial desire]{.mark}. [Their
constructions of self and Other]{.mark} are not merely discursive in
nature, but [have]{.mark} political and strategic [consequences]{.mark}.
Rather than divorced from power, they are always in the service of power
and at the same time (re)produced by it through the political economies
of fear and fantasy]{.underline}. How knowledge, desire, and power
interact in the cases of these China paradigms will be the focus of
Chapters 4-7. Thus far, scholarly analysis of Western representations of
China has tended to treat those representations merely as knowledge,
which is then empirically evaluated against so-called 'objective facts'
in China. Depending on whether they are thought to match Chinese reality
or not, they are labelled either 'truth', 'misrepresentations', or
something in between. But this empirically-grounded approach misses a
crucial point. That is, it leaves intact and unquestioned the complicity
of China knowledge in power relations. What is needed, therefore, is a
critical examination of the power/knowledge nexus in the two modes of
China representation. How the 'China threat' paradigm relates to the
political economy of fear and informs political practice is the focus of
this and the following chapter. And Chapters 6 and 7 will deal with the
'China opportunity' paradigm. [To better understand the dynamics of
power/knowledge/[desire in the 'China threat' paradigm]{.mark}, we need
to recognise this paradigm for what I think it [is]{.mark}, namely, a
particular form of desire---[fear]{.mark}---disguised as certain
knowledge]{.underline}. Fear, it may be argued, is primarily a
biological instinct inherent in probably all animals that are both
capable of fear and have experienced such an emotion. And yet, [in the
human context at least, fear is as much a sociocultural phenomenon as it
is a natural, biological reflex. This is because [most forms of
fear]{.mark} in modern society are not experienced directly through
actual physical encounters, but rather [are created]{.mark}, mediated,
maintained and reinforced through often-institutionalised knowledge
resources such as images, symbols, metaphors and, above all,
discourses]{.underline}. Sometimes referred to as 'prevailing danger
codes', those knowledge resources serve as 'an extremely dense layer of
mediation between what one might be advised to fear... and what one's
moment-to-moment experience appears to be'.3 In a study of the politics
of fear in the media, David Altheide argues that fear 'did not just
happen or emerge' from uncertainty, the lack of community or a sense of
lack of control over our lives; rather, it is largely produced and
reproduced through 'the entertainment formats of mass media and popular
culture'. Only through coming to grips with this culturally-mediated
dimension of fear, can we better understand why one's sense of fear is
often not directly or proportionally linked to the object of that fear.
4 In fact, quite often the opposite is true. [For instance, Altheide
points to the paradox that '[there is]{.mark} widespread public
[perception \[in the West]{.mark}\] that risk and danger are everywhere,
[that we are not safe]{.mark}, and that the future is bleak', [even
though]{.mark} most in [Western societies 'are]{.mark} safer, healthier,
living longer, and [more secure in their environments]{.mark} than
virtually any population in history'.5 How is such a strange 'surplus'
of fear produced and consumed in an otherwise reasonably safe and
wealthy society?]{.underline} Michael Shapiro suggests that the
increased level of popular representation in the political process has
not been matched by a similar increase in people's ability to represent
safety and danger as they find them in their daily lives. [6 Rather,
just as more and more supermarket products nowadays are no longer made
locally, so too the 'commodity' of [fear is increasingly
outsourced]{.mark} from elsewhere, manufactured and packaged as
knowledge by all sorts of security, intelligence, health and environment
experts]{.underline}. And just as consumers part company with their
money in exchange for whatever fantasies are evoked by commercial
advertisements, [[consumers of fear surrender their power]{.mark} to
scaremongering experts and political leaders, in exchange for the
promised certainty and security]{.underline}. In return, through their
knowledge of danger and threat, those experts and politicians gain
trust, power, and the ability to influence others to behave in ways that
meet their expectations. In this way, whatever form of knowledge that
can effectively tap into fear and constantly reproduce it is, without
doubt, ideally placed to serve power and enforce discipline. Little
wonder that the discursive production of fear and threat has been a
fixture in modern-day politics. In Australia, no recent federal
elections were complete without some forms of politics of fear at play
in the political campaigns, be it about 'boat people', terrorism,
workers' rights or even interest rates. Of course, fear is not always an
undesirable element in politics and social life. Moïse argues that 'an
element of fear is an indispensable protection against the danger of
overconfidence. Fear is a force for survival in a naturally dangerous
world'.7 [[The 'China threat']{.mark} paradigm should be understood in
this broad context. This paradigm [does not reflect a
pre-existing]{.mark} sense of [fear]{.mark} about a menace 'out there',
[but rather]{.mark} is a discursive site where such fear [is]{.mark}
first [constructed]{.mark} and where a particular form of political
economy of fear emerges.]{.underline} With a specific focus on the US,
this chapter will examine how the China threat knowledge, which gives
the popular fear of China an aura of objective credibility, serves the
political and economic interests of the power elite, and is at the same
time shaped by those interests. However, when fear is systematically
deployed in politics, it is worth asking whose interests this fear
politics intends to serve and how such fear is produced and for what
purposes. THE CHINA THREAT AND AMERICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY OF FEAR [The
political economy of fear has been a much-cherished ingredient in
statecraft for millennia. '[Let them hate as long as they fear']{.mark},
the Roman emperor Caligula once proclaimed]{.underline}. '\[I\]t is far
better to be feared than loved if you cannot be both', admonished
Machiavelli in The Prince. [8 Thus, Robert Higgs argues that fear is a
foundation of every government's power: 'Without popular fear, no
government could endure for more than twenty-four hours']{.underline}.9
While the state has traditionally relied on such visible instruments of
fear as the army, the police, the legal system, and the prison to
maintain discipline in a society, [it has also resorted to a less
visible instrument: the discursive production of fear. [One]{.mark}
particularly [fertile ground for]{.mark} such [fear]{.mark}related
knowledge [production has been]{.mark} the realm of [international
relations]{.mark}, where the objects of fear appear
plentiful.]{.underline} The French political philosopher Jean Bodin
observed that 'the best way of preserving a state, and guaranteeing it
against sedition, rebellion, and civil war is... to find an enemy
against whom they can make common cause'.10 [Similarly, Adam Smith
examined in The Wealth of Nations how a government could use the
nation's anxiety for security to induce its citizens to agree to a new
tax which otherwise they would probably resent]{.underline}.11 [[It is
in this context that the fear of the China threat has been a recurring
feature in American politics]{.mark} in general and during the
presidential and congressional midterm elections in
particular.]{.underline} During the 2010 midterm elections, for
instance, New York Times reported that in a space of just one week, at
least 29 candidates from both sides of politics unveiled advertisements
accusing their opponents of being soft on China, with the undertone that
China had been the chief villain for current American economic woes.
[Such is the political economic use of fear especially when it is
disguised as scientific knowledge.]{.underline}

#### Prior commitment to Chinese threat perception makes their impacts inevitable --commitments to war collapse chances at peace 

Chengxin **Pan**, Department of Political Science and International

Discourses Of 'China' In International Relations: A Study in Western
Theory as (IR) Practice, p. 141-142

These are some of the questions in the minds of Western/American
strategic analysts, who are wondering how to maintain U.S. preponderance
in a world of anarchy and uncertainty. The conservative realist Samuel
Huntington asks: "If being an American means being committed to the
principles of liberty, democracy, individualism, and private property,
and if there is no evil empire out there threatening those principles,
what indeed does it mean to be an American, and what becomes of American
national interests?" [Obsessed with this [self-imagery]{.mark}, many
[scholars and policy planners]{.mark} have been keen to reinvoke the
timeless, structural certainty of geopolitical rivalry, and to embrace
the '[back to the future' scenario,]{.mark} maintaining that despite the
dawn of the post-Cold War period little has changed---the world remains
a dangerous, volatile place. With such searching eyes for an enemy, it
would be surprising if China failed to come into view. Indeed,
[China]{.mark} makes a perfect candidate, in that "China [remains the
major source of uncertainty]{.mark} in the Asia-Pacific]{.underline}."
That is, not only do the implications of its economic transformation and
military ambition remain unclear, but the resilience of the Communist
government even after its roundly condemned Tiananmen suppression seems
also to fly in the face of the 'End of History' triumphalism.
Consequently, (and before September 11), the only major certainty coming
out of the post-Cold War era seems to be an unpredictable and dangerous
China. From the beginning[, [this 'China threat]{.mark},' I suggest, [is
not a result of its actual challenge to the]{.mark} West or the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates per se, [but]{.mark} primarily [a
discursive dimension of the neorealist construction]{.mark} of the
[America]{.mark}n self in terms of global supremacy]{.underline} and
indispensable leadership. As Huntington makes it clear, "Chinese
hegemony will reduce American and Western influence \[in Asia\] and
compel the United States to accept what it has historically attempted to
prevent: domination of a key region of the world by another power." In
the absence of such self-fashioning, most of China's neighbours, which
might arguably be more vulnerable to a China threat if there is one,
have traditionally adopted a much less alarmist view on the 'Middle
Kingdom.' Thus, [China's real challenge for America]{.underline}, as Yu
Bin notes, "[is perhaps more psychological and conceptual---that is, how
to deal with a major power whose rise is not necessarily guided by
Washington,]{.underline} unlike the post-World War II rise of Japan and
Germany." Also, it can be argued that [[the existence of an
'enemy]{.mark}' is indispensable to the continued imagination of the
'indispensable nation.]{.underline}' In Charles Frazier's novel Cold
Mountain, Inman, a soldier returning home from battle during the
American Civil War, pondered the question: "What is the cost of not
having an enemy?" Such a cost, then, seems very high indeed, for at
stake here is what is seen as the 'fundamental' modern Western/American
self-identity as a (global) rational being and indispensable leader.
Heroic leadership would not be so needed if there was little left to
fight for. Clearly mindful of this, Georgi Arbatov, Director of Moscow's
Institute for the Study of the USA and Canada, told a U.S. audience the
year before the collapse of the Berlin Wall: "We are going to do
something terrible to you---we are going to deprive you of an enemy."
While he correctly noted that for the U.S. to live without an
identity-defining enemy is terrible indeed, Arbatov was only half right,
for the 'enemy' itself often has no control over its status as an enemy.
Rather, as noted before, [it [is primarily a ready-made discursive
category]{.mark} built into the American self-imagination. With this
discursive category as the analytical framework for understanding other
actors on the world stage, Western and particularly American scholars
did not simply 'discover' [a China threat]{.mark} out there; it [was
cognitively constructed beforehand.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The affirmatives democratic rhetoric gives the false illusion of peace - it causes mobilization against anything as long as it is labeled totalitarian

One of the ways [this fear was put to work and the [citizenry
'aroused']{.mark} was [through the elision of the differences between
war and peace]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The movers and shakers in
the US state claimed that, [in theory at least, [democracies generally
separate peace from war as distinct periods]{.mark} and processes, and
that this distinction tends [to be obliterated]{.mark} but
'totalitarian' regimes]{.underline}. And yet they also claimed that
since [we lived in an age of 'permanent antagonism and
conflict']{.underline} (with 'no lasting abatement of the crisis'), as
the NSC-68 put it-'the smaller [the gap between peacetime and wartime
purposes, the greater \[is\] the likely-hood that a successful military
effort will be politically successful as well']{.underline}. NSC-20/1
noted that '[[a democracy cannot effect, as the totalitarian
state]{.mark} sometimes does, a complete identification of its peacetime
and war time objectives', but nonetheless suggested that the US needed
to 'reduce as far as possible the gap between them']{.underline}.
Indeed, one Policy Planning Staff Memo of May 1948 suggested that
[liberal [democracies had been 'handicapped']{.mark} by 'attachment to
the concept of a basic difference between peace and war' and claimed
that what was needed was the idea of '[political warfare']{.mark} as
'the logical application Clausewitz in time of peace']{.underline}.
NSC-20/1 thus cited Clausewitz's claim that '[war is a continuation of
policy, intermingled with other means']{.underline}. The intent was
clar: 'the basic objective outlines...is one which would be valid for
peace as well as fro war'. Or as NSC-68 put it: [the objectives of a
society are equally valid and necessary for peace as well as for war',
and they are so because [the challenge of security]{.mark} is one
'whicch encompasses [noth peace and war']{.mark}. Hence it is 'essential
that this government formulate general objectives which are capable of
sustained pursuit both in times of peace and in the event of war'. In
other words, since the enemy is as much within as without, and since the
objectives, fears, and insecurities running through [the body politic
are present in times of both peace and war, the distinction between the
two is,]{.mark} in essence [obliterated.]{.mark} War and politics become
a unity, and ['political warfare' is set in place mobilizing]{.mark}
'all the means at a nation's command'. I]{.underline}n this sense, [the
national security state sought to legitimize the exercise of war powers
during periods of peace by transforming the concept of 'peace' as
applied to liberal democracy. 'Such as peace as the United States is
experiencing is not a peace; it is in fact a war'. This transformation
was effected through the notion of security, especially in its
ideological circuit with emergency]{.underline}. Herein lies a further
reason to explain the emergence of 'national security' rather than
'national defense' beyond that discussed at the beginning of Chapter 3.
As Eyal Weizman has noted, [the logic of 'defence' deals with war and
seeks to constitute with borders and barriers a clear distinction
between 'inside' and 'outside', between the territory within the state
and that which is exterior to it. T[he logic of 'security',]{.mark} on
the other hand , [presupposes that the danger is already inside]{.mark},
presented by a population in which the subverive elements exist...If
defence engages directly with the concept of war, security engages with
the temporarily ill-defined and spatially amorphous 'conflict' not only
between societies, but within them as well. E]{.underline}liding the
distinction between military practice and the everyday political
administration of [civil society thereby helps in 'securing' a general
willingness among the citizenry to submit to wartime disciline and
emergency powers on a permanent basis.]{.underline}

#### The fundamental assumptions of liberalism ignore other more vital causes of war---the properties that make a democratic nation peaceful aren't democratic

Liberal IR Theory" Alternatives v. 27

This sort of argument strips bare the assumption behind much liberal IR
theory, that liberalism, and in particular the creation of civil
society, is held to be the key to domestic and international peace.
[[The \"liberal\" states]{.mark} that surround and protect their own
civil societies are thus taken to be \"[morally complete\" and
nonviolent because they embody the normative superiority of
liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. (51) In theorizing the development of a
zone of interstate peace, therefore[, liberal IR theorists assume that
liberal states are not the source of war; [they may engage in war, but
only because illiberal or uncivilized states pose a
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. More importantly, however,
[the]{.underline} second [consequence is that liberal IR theorists seem
insensible to the domestic, [\"civil\" roots of violence, its control
and intensification, alongside liberal norms and within liberal and
representative institutions]{.mark}, nurtured and sustained in the
crucible of civil society, and [driven by a process of
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nowhere is this more obvious than in
the work of Kant, on whom many contemporary liberal democratic-peace
theorists unwisely rely. (52) When they do so, [the claim to the
normative superiority of liberal-democratic norms collapses since it
soon becomes clear that]{.underline} Kant\'s arguments [for a \"pacific
federation\" of states were based in part on military competition, and
his principles of representation turn out to be anything but
democratic.]{.underline} (53) If, as Cederman suggests, \"it is our
duty\" to take Kant\'s \"ethical reasoning\" seriously, then we may
find, contrary to Cederman\'s expectations, that Kant was neither a
democrat nor a liberal, and certainly not a theorist of
\"interdemocratic peace.\" (54)

### Link\-\--Disease

#### The discourse of disease relies on biopolitical securitization of the military industrial complex -- that causes perpetual war

[Western societies entered the 20 century in an era of infectious
disease]{.underline}. In the United States, for example, tuberculosis
was the number one killer while small pox, diphtheria, tetanus and other
infectious diseases were prevalent. [Curative medicine, allied to [other
biopolitica]{.mark}l 'social' security strategies, transformed the
morbidity [of western populations]{.mark}, however, by virtually
[eliminating]{.mark} such [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Consequently, an entirely different demographic of morbidity has
emerged. [This new landscape is characterised by chronic rather than
infectious diseases. Chronic diseases are in turn [distinguished by a
variety of significantly different features from those which
characterised infectious disease]{.mark}.]{.underline} These features
include the following. 1. First, susceptibility to chronic illness is a
universal among western populations. 2. Second, chronic illnesses are
characterised by early onset. 3. Third, chronic illnesses are
progressive. 4. Fourth, such illnesses become clinical explicit only at
certain symptom thresholds; angina or heart attack signalling the
presence, for example, of heart disease that has been developing for
many years. 5. Fifth, chronic illnesses are multifactorial. 6. Sixth,
differences between individuals are manifested by the rate at which such
diseases progress rather than the bald presence or absence of the
disease. 7. Seventh, the onset and rate of progress of chronic illness
is a direct function of exposure to risk factors. [These in turn are
very much a function of how lives are lived; 'life styles'. Whereas
infectious disease invited drug cures, chronic illnesses invite
pre-emption and prevention together with medical campaigns aimed at
changing life-styles, backed by widespread [use of surveillance]{.mark}
(or 'screening' in medical terms) and the statistical documentation of
the incidence of disease distribution spatially as well as temporally.
All these developments have in turn begun to be combined with the
pervasive regulation and management of risk]{.underline}, and the
astonishingly greater resolution given to the analytic of risk which
resonates throughout all aspects of western society. [Closely allied
with the concern for risk factors arising from life-styles, is an
intense individualisation and personalisation of medicine as
well.]{.underline} [Whereas Foucault spoke of the ways in which liberal
biopolitical governmentality encouraged the development of the
entrepreneurial self,]{.underline} 53 the compression of morbidity
witnesses the emergence of a self entrepreneurially responsibilised to
secure its own health care[. Such developments similarly also reflect
the intense preoccupation in [military corporate and homeland
security]{.mark} domains with the same kinds of preoccupations and
analytical devices allying screening and surveillance with
distribution-patterning and risk analysis across mass populations
locally as well as globally. The [biopoliticisation of security
discourse]{.mark} in these more traditional areas of security analysis
also reflects amassive shift to pre-emptive and preventative
strategies]{.underline}. While we do not have the space to trace the
connections, the correlation is no mere accident. Granted that both
military and corporate strategies are driven by their own local and

3\. [The Ethical Dangers of Biopolitics]{.underline} [Many of those
advocating [the securitization of AIDS]{.mark} hope that their actions
will bring about a plethora of important, long-term normative
benefits]{.underline}. These advantages include (i) mobilising more
political support and economic resources for addressing the AIDS
pandemic at global and local levels, (ii) breaking the silence and
stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in many African, Asian and Latin American
countries, (iii) politicising the central role of the security sector as
a vector of the virus, and (iv) helping to override the legal
constraints bearing on the production of affordable life-saving AIDS
medicines -- especially those imposed by the international regime
protecting intellectual property rights (TRIPS), the provisions of which
do not apply to cases of national security crises.55 [These goals do
seem worth striving for, but they must also be reassessed in light of
the biopolitical dimension to the securitization of AIDS identified
above]{.underline}. Foucault, after all, had been able to detect at
least two [[serious ethical dangers]{.mark} historically accompanying
the deployment of biopolitical strategies]{.underline}, and both of
these concerns can, to some extent, be shown to apply to the current
securitization of HIV/AIDS as well. 3.1[. [Biological
Racism]{.mark}]{.underline} One such danger is that [historically
biopolitical strategies have given rise to new instances [of mass
dea]{.mark}th heralded on the basis of biological criteria]{.underline}.
With hindsight it seems profoundly ironic that the European era of
biopower -- advanced in the name of 'life' -- coexisted with political
strategies demanding the deaths of millions. [Foucault later came to
understand this bizarre confluence on the basis of a new racism -- a
racism of biology rather than of culture]{.underline}.56 'Racism', he
contended from a biopolitical perspective, 'is primarily a way of
introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power's
control: [the break between what must live and what must die.'57 [The
Nazi movement]{.mark} demonstrated this darker side of
biopolitics]{.underline} in a particularly stark manner when it carved
up the European continent using the dubious criterion of 'blood' for
deciding which populations could be usefully 'Germanized' and thus
spared, and which ones could not.58 This biological racism was also
projected internally to the Jewish population of the German *Reich*;
Jews were no longer prosecuted solely because of their Judaism, but
because of their 'Jewishness', which prompted Hannah Arendt to point out
in her memorable phrase that whereas in the past 'Jews had been able to
escape from Judaism into conversion; from Jewishness there was no
escape.'59 [A biopolitical society, in short, may still make decisions
about whose life is worth preserving and whose life will be allowed to
perish, and the function of racism in a biopolitical age is to make this
very distinction]{.underline}. Indeed, biological racism may even prove
to be more pernicious than the traditional cultural racism precisely in
that there is no escape from one's biological makeup. [In either case,
such biological racism can explain the historical irony that it was 'as
managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race]{.underline}, that
so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men
to be killed'.60 This darker side of the twentieth century [European
biopolitics, moreover, must give pause for thought regarding ongoing
attempts to the frame the AIDS pandemic as an international security
issue]{.underline}. Is there any evidence of racism operating in the
international debate on HIV/AIDS? [There is certainly evidence that the
older, cultural racism is present in this debate]{.underline},
especially regarding the question of which peoples are allowed to live
and which ones are left to die. Given the existence of life-prolonging
medicines, the pandemic could be significantly curtailed with sufficient
international political will and resources. Yet Africans' claims to
these medicines are not being satisfied; the survival of these
populations is being given much less priority internationally than say

the less than 3,000 U.S. citizens who died on September 11, 2001,
prompting the head of UNAIDS, Peter Piot, to remind his listeners that
'if this would have happened in the Balkans, or in Eastern Europe, or in
Mexico, with white people, the reaction would have been different.'61 It
is indeed hard to imagine that this pandemic would have been allowed to
rage out of control on any continent other than Africa. Of course, this
kind of racism is different from the racism deployed by Germany's
National- socialists in that people are not being killed either
deliberately or on biologically- defined grounds, but its effects are
much the same; [HIV-positive populations are]{.underline} being allowed
to die in vast numbers despite the availability of life-prolonging
medicines, thus highlighting an implicit racism between different
populations at the global level. Yet, and somewhat paradoxically, it is
also precisely this kind of cultural racism that the ongoing
securitization of AIDS is attempting to resist; the securitization of
AIDS is being driven by the desire to make more resources available
internationally for addressing the pandemic, and thus it does not seem
ethically culpable with regard to furthering this kind of cultural
racism. Indeed, the hope of combating such cultural racism forms a
considerable part of its rhetorical force. There is, however, also
evidence of a second and more subtle form of *biological* racism
operating in the international AIDS debate. This racism is not so much
concerned with the traditional war *between* races, as with more modern
attempts to guard the biological [health and fitness of the whole
population or race vis- à-vis specific 'diseased' or 'degenerate'
threats. Nazi eugenics, it is worth recalling, began in precisely such a
vein -- by first attempting to eradicate diseased people for the benefit
of the health of the German population as a whole]{.underline}. Foucault
thus noted how *biopolitical* (as opposed to cultural) racism appeals to
the principle 'that the death of others makes one biologically stronger
insofar as one is a member of a race or a population.'62 This biological
racism serving the population as a whole also occasionally surfaces in
the debate on HIV/AIDS. In 1999, for example, one former UN Population
Fund (UNFPA) official reportedly joked that AIDS would be one way of
controlling population growth in Africa. Increased mortality, the
official jibed, was one of three ways of controlling population growth,
implying that this would be beneficial for those surviving the
pandemic.63 Nor is this an isolated incident. The initial reaction of
one official at the National Intelligence Council in the mid 1990s,
responding to the early demand for a project on the security
implications of AIDS, was reportedly: 'Oh, it will be good, because
Africa is overpopulated anyway.'64 Some have even committed such
thoughts to paper. In a report by the World Bank from 1992 one can read
that '\[i\]f the only effect of the AIDS epidemic were to reduce the
population growth rate, it would increase the growth rate of per capita
income in any plausible economic model'.65 [Underlying such thinking is
not [a cultural racism]{.mark}, but a more subtle biological racism that
pits the population or 'race' as a whole against HIV-positive
persons]{.underline} by implying, however erroneously, that the former
would be better off without the latter. Again, however, [the
securitization of AIDS is, at least on the surface of it, trying to
combat this form of racism by calling for a more global and
comprehensive response to the AIDS pandemic, and consequently does not
appear ethically culpable with regard to furthering this kind of racism
either. Where then, one might ask, is the evidence of [the
securitization of AIDS, as a biopolitical gesture,]{.mark} giving rise
to new forms of racism in the way Foucault had warned? The extent to
which novel forms of racism may emerge in the securitization of AIDS
depends very much on exactly how HIV/AIDS is securitized.]{.underline}
The tactical dilemma faced by all advocates and adherents of the
securitization of AIDS is whether [this securitization is to be achieved
primarily on the basis of a national security or a human security
framework. On the one hand, advocates of the securitization of AIDS
clearly want this securitization to be successful in order for the
normative benefits they envision to accrue as quickly as possible. This
means casting HIV/AIDS as a security threat within the framework of
national and international security, i.e. in terms that will appear most
plausible and persuasive to the Security Council and the traditional
security sector. This, in turn, would entail highlighting the effects of
HIV/AIDS on the armed forces, on peacekeepers, and on state
capacity]{.underline}. A human security framework, by contrast, is less
likely to persuade the Security Council and the more traditionally
oriented security sector to take the issue seriously at the highest
levels, and is hence unlikely to achieve the same degree of political
impact[. So the tactical advantages of drawing on national and
international security frameworks initially appear very compelling. Yet
if the securitization of AIDS is to proceed solely or even primarily on
the basis of national and international security, then it also
inadvertently risks simply substituting the cultural racism it eagerly
seeks to combat with a new strategic form of racism. Put differently,
securitizing the illness in this manner could encourage an international
response whereby medicines are provided not democratically and
comprehensively to all who need them, but only to those populations who
play a crucial role in maintaining national and international security,
i.e. the armed forces and state elites. Securitizing AIDS with reference
to national and international security may thus come to benefit those
elites in question, but not the wider population. There is consequently
a danger of the securitization of AIDS introducing a subtle put
potentially disastrous new [criterion for deciding who is allowed to
live and who will be left to die]{.mark}; a criterion [that assesses
human beings not in terms of any intrinsic value, but on the basis of
their strategic value.]{.mark} In this way the securitization of AIDS
risks substituting a cultural racism with a new strategic racism that,
from a biopolitical perspective, is still a racism because it would
provide the crucial biopolitical function of deciding who must live and
who must die. What is more, framing HIV/AIDS as a threat to national and
international security also risks further fuelling the aforementioned
biological racism that advocates of the securitization of AIDS are
trying to combat. It does so by inadvertently construing persons living
with HIV/AIDS as security threats.]{.underline} A characteristic
headline from the British *Daily Telegraph* reads '*African AIDS: Deadly
Threat to Britain'.*66 Nor is this an isolated incident; [[the portrayal
of AIDS as being a disease that comes from foreigners]{.mark}, from
outsiders, and [especially from 'black' Africans]{.mark}, is a perennial
feature of the discourse on AIDS ever since the illness was first
discovered. Calls for quarantining people with HIV/AIDS not because of
their skin colour but because of their biological characteristics,
subjecting them to various forms of violence, attempting to bar such
persons from serving in state institutions, and the refusal to issue
visas to foreigners living with HIV, are only a few of the examples in
which persons living with HIV/AIDS have been ostracized and even
persecuted by some states for their illness]{.underline}. Nor are these
examples confined to the dustbin of history. As recently as February
2003 the British government considered implementing compulsory HIV
screening for prospective immigrants amid alleged worries that
HIV-positive foreigners are traveling to the United Kingdom to seek
treatment.[67 [Within the armed forces around the
world,]{.underline}]{.mark} [moreover, there has already been growing
pressure to exclude soldiers living with HIV because the illness is
being perceived as a security threat. As with Arendt's aforementioned
observations about 'Jewishness', there seems to be no escape from one's
HIV-status. Although the securitization of AIDS tries to remedy the
cultural racism evident in the unequal global access to medicines, if it
is conducted primarily on the grounds of national and international
security it risks -- contrary to its own intensions -- furthering both a
strategic racism that will save elites but not ordinary people, and a
biological racism that fuels exclusionary practices regarding persons
living with HIV. It is only by first acknowledging [the biopolitical
nature of the securitization]{.mark} of AIDS, that these novel ethical
dangers can be identified.]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Economy

#### Economic collapse scenarios further societal militarization by connecting it to national security -- that turns the case and perpetuates the international capitalist order

Mark **Neocleous,** Professor of Critique of Political Economy at Brunel
University (UK), 200**8** ("Critique of Security." Pg. 101-102. )

In other words, [the new international order moved very quickly to
reassert [the connection between economic and national security]{.mark}:
the commitment to the former simultaneously a commitment to the latter,
and vice versa. As [the doctrine of national security was being born,
the major player on the international stage would aim to use perhaps its
most important power of all -- its economic strength]{.mark} -- in order
to re-order the world. And this re-ordering was conducted through [the
idea of 'economic security]{.mark}'. Despite the fact that 'economic
security' would never be formally defined beyond 'economic order' or
[economic well-being']{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the significant conceptual
consistency between economic security and liberal order-building also
had a strategic ideological role]{.underline}]{.mark}[. By playing on
[notions of 'economic well-being', economic security seemed to emphasize
economic and thus 'human' needs over military ones.]{.mark} The
reshaping of global capital, international order and the exercise of
state power could thus look decidedly liberal and 'humanitarian'.
This]{.underline} appearance [helped co-opt the]{.underline} liberal
[Left into the process and]{.underline}, of course, [[played on
individual desire for personal security]{.mark} by using notions such
as]{.underline} 'personal freedom' and ['social equality']{.underline}.
Marx and Engels once highlighted the historical role of the bourgeoisie
in shaping the world according to its own interests. "The need of a
constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over
the whole surface of the glove. It must nestle everywhere, settle
everywhere, establish connections everywhere... [It compels all nations,
on pain of extinction]{.underline}, to adopt the bourgeois mode of
production; it compels them... to become bourgeois in themselves. In one
word, it creates a world after its own image." In the second half of the
twentieth century this ability to 'batter down all Chinese walls' would
still rest heavily on the logic of capital, but would also come about it
part under the guise of security. [The whole world became a garden to be
cultivated -- to be recast according to the logic of
security]{.underline}. In the space of fifteen years [[the concept
'economic security']{.mark} had moved]{.underline} from connoting
insurance policies for working people [to the desire to shape the world
in a capitalist fashion]{.underline} -- and back again. In fact[, it has
constantly shifted]{.underline} between these registers ever since,
[being used for the constant reshaping of world order and resulting in a
comprehensive level of intervention and policing all over the globe.
[Global order has come to be fabricated]{.mark} and administered
according to a security doctrine underpinned by the logic of
capital-accumulation and a bourgeois conception of order.]{.underline}
[By incorporating within it a particular vision of economic order, the
concept of national security implies the interrelatedness of so many
different social, economic, political and military factors that more or
less any development anywhere can be said to impact on liberal order in
general and America's core interests in particular]{.underline}. [Not
only could]{.underline} bourgeois [Europe be recast around]{.underline}
the regime of [capital, but so]{.underline} too [could [the whole
international order as capital not only nestled, settled and established
connections, but also 'secured' everywhere.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Food security pays lip service to the hungry while serving as a justification for the violent expansion of global governance

Bristol in 2009, MSc dissertation prize joint winner 2009, "Speaking
Food: A Discourse Analytic Study of Food Security" 2009, pdf available
online, p. 10-14 MT)

Since the 1970s, [the concept of '[food security']{.mark} has been the
**primary lens** through which the ongoing prevalence and **inherent
complexity** of]{.underline} global [hunger has been
viewed]{.underline}. The adoption of the term at [the
FAO]{.underline}-sanctioned World Food Conference in 1974 has led to a
burgeoning literature on the subject, most of which [takes 'food
security' as an unproblematic starting point from which to address the
persistence of so-called 'food insecurity]{.underline}' (see Gilmore &
Huddleston, 1983; Maxwell, 1990; 1991; Devereux & Maxwell, 2001). A
common activity pursued by academics specialising in food security is to
debate the appropriate definition of the term; a study undertaken by the
Institute of Development Studies cites over 200 competing definitions
(Smith et al., 1992). [This]{.underline} pervasive predilection for
empirical clarity [[is symptomatic of]{.mark} traditional [positivist
epistemologies]{.mark}]{.underline} and constrains a more far-sighted
understanding of the power functions of 'food security' itself, a
conceptual construct now accorded considerable institutional depth.2
Bradley Klein contends that [to understand the political force of
organizing principles like food security, [**a shift of analytical focus
is required**: 'Instead of presuming their existence]{.mark} and
meaning, [we ought to historicize]{.mark} and relativize [them]{.mark}
as sets of practices with distinct genealogical
trajectories]{.underline}' (1994: 10). [The forthcoming analysis traces
the emergence and evolution of food security discourse in official
publications and interrogates the intertextual relations which pertain
between these publications and other key sites of discursive change
and/or continuity]{.underline}. Absent from much (if not all) of the
academic literature on food security is any reflection on the
governmental content of the concept of 'security' itself. [The notion of
food security is received and regurgitated in numerous studies which
seek to establish a better, more comprehensive food security
paradigm]{.underline}. Simon Maxwell has produced more work of this type
than anyone else in the field and his studies are commonly referenced as
foundational to food security studies (Shaw, 2005; see Maxwell, 1990;
1991; 1992; 1996; Devereux & Maxwell, 2001). Maxwell has traced the
evolution in thinking on food security since the 1970s and distinguishes
three paradigm shifts in its meaning: from the global/national to the
household/individual, from a food first perspective to a livelihood
perspective and from objective indicators to subjective perception
(Maxell, 1996; Devereux & Maxwell, 2001). There is something of value in
the kind of analysis Maxwell employs and these three paradigm shifts
provide a partial framework with which to compare the results of my own
analysis of food security discourse. I suggest, however, that the
conclusions Maxwell arrives at are severely restricted by his
unwillingness to reflect on food security as a governmental mechanism of
global liberal governance. As a 'development expert' he employs an
epistemology infused with concepts borrowed from the modern development
discourse; as such, his conclusions reflect a concern with the
micro-politics of food security and a failure to reflect on [the
macro-politics of 'food security' as a specific rationality of
government]{.underline}. In his article 'Food Security: A Post-Modern
Perspective' (1996) Maxwell provides a meta-narrative which explains the
discursive shifts he distinguishes. He argues that the emerging emphasis
on 'flexibility, diversity and the perceptions of the people concerned'
(1996: 160) in food security discourse is consistent with currents of
thought in other spheres which he vaguely labels 'post-modern'. In line
with 'one of the most popular words in the lexicon of post-modernism',
Maxwell claims to have 'deconstructed' the term 'food security'; in so
doing, 'a new construction has been proposed, a distinctively
post-modern view of food security' (1996: 161-162). This, according to
Maxwell, should help to sharpen programmatic policy and bring theory and
knowledge closer to what he calls 'real food insecurity' (1996: 156). My
own research in the forthcoming analysis contains within it an explicit
critique of Maxwell's thesis, based on three main observations. First,
Maxwell's '[reconstruction' of [food security]{.mark} and
re-articulation of its normative criteria [reproduce]{.mark} precisely
[the kind of]{.mark} technical, [managerial]{.mark} set of [solutions
which characterise the positivistic need for]{.mark}]{.underline}
definitional [[certainty]{.underline}]{.mark} that he initially seeks to
avoid. Maxwell himself acknowledges 'the risk of falling into the trap
of the meta-narrative' and that 'the ice is admittedly very thin' (1996:
162-163), but finally prefers to ignore these misgivings when faced with
the frightening (and more accurately 'post-modern') alternative. Second,
I suggest that the third shift which Maxwell distinguishes, from
objective indicators to subjective perceptions, is a fabrication which
stems more from his own normative beliefs than evidence from official
literature. To support this part of his argument Maxwell quotes earlier
publications of his own work in which his definition incorporates the
'subjective dimension' of food security (cf. Maxwell, 1988). As my own
analysis reveals, [[while lip-service is occasionally paid to]{.mark}
the lives and faces of [hungry people, food security analysis is
constituted by]{.mark} increasingly extensive, technological and
professedly '[objective' methods of]{.mark} identifying and [stratifying
the ']{.mark}food [insecure]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}. This
comprises another distinctly positivistic endeavour. Finally, Maxwell's
emphasis on 'shifts' in thinking suggests the replacement of old with
new -- the global/national concern with food supply and production, for
example, is replaced by a new and more enlightened concern for the
household/individual level of food demand and entitlements. Discursive
change, however, defies such linear boundary drawing; the trace of the
old is always already present in the form of the new. I suggest that
Maxwell's 'shifts' should rather be conceived as 'additions'; the
implication for [[food security]{.underline}]{.mark} is an increasingly
complex agenda, increasingly amorphous definitions and the establishment
of new divisions of labour between 'experts' in diverse fields. This
[[results in]{.mark} a **[technocratic discourse]{.mark}** which
'presents policy as if it were directly dictated by matters of
fact]{.underline} (thematic patterns) [and deflects consideration of
values choices]{.underline} and the social, moral [and political
responsibility for such choices]{.underline}' (Lemke, 1995: 58, emphasis
in original). The dynamics of technocratic discourse are examined
further in the forthcoming analysis. These observations inform the
explicit critique of contemporary understandings of food security which
runs conterminously with the findings of my analysis. [[I]{.mark} adopt
a broad perspective from which to [interrogate]{.mark} [**food
security** as **a discursive technology of global liberal
governance**]{.mark}. Food security is not conceived as an isolated
paradigm, but as a component of overlapping discourses of human security
and sustainable development which emerged concurrently in the
1970s]{.underline}. The securitisation process can be regarded in some
cases as an extreme form of politicisation, while in others it can lead
to a depoliticisation of the issue at hand and a replacement of the
political with technological or scientific remedies. I show how [**[the
militaristic component of]{.mark} traditional [security discourse
is]{.mark} [reproduced in]{.mark} the wider agenda of [food security,
through the notions of risk]{.mark}, threat and** permanent
**[emergency]{.mark}** that constitute its governmental
rationale]{.underline}.

"Today we take it for granted that war happens in smaller, poorer and
more backward countries," Steven [Pinker]{.underline} writes in his new
book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: the Decline of Violence in
History and Its Causes. The celebrated Harvard professor of psychology
[is discussing what he calls "the Long Peace"]{.underline}: the period
since the end of the second world war [in which]{.underline} "the great
powers, and [developed states in general, have stopped waging war on one
another]{.underline}." As a result of "this blessed state of affairs,"
he notes, "[two entire categories of war---the imperial war to acquire
colonies, and the colonial war to keep them---no longer
exist]{.underline}." [Now and then there have been minor
conflicts]{.underline}. "To be sure, \[the super-powers\] occasionally
fought each other's smaller allies and stoked proxy wars among their
client states." [But these episodes do not diminish Pinker's enthusiasm
about the Long Peace. Chronic warfare is only to be expected in backward
parts of the world.]{.underline} "Tribal, civil, private, slave-raiding,
imperial, and colonial wars have inflamed the territories of the
developing world for millennia." [In more civilised zones, war has all
but disappeared.]{.underline} There is nothing inevitable in the
process; major wars could break out again, even among the great powers.
But the change in human affairs that has occurred is fundamental. "An
underlying shift that supports predictions about the future," the Long
Peace points to a world in which violence is in steady decline.

[A sceptical reader might wonder whether the outbreak of peace in
developed countries and endemic conflict in less fortunate lands might
not be somehow connected.]{.underline} [Was the immense violence that
ravaged southeast Asia after 1945 a result of immemorial backwardness in
the region? Or was a subtle and refined civilisation wrecked by world
war and the aftermath of decades of neo-colonial
conflict]{.underline}---as Norman Lewis intimated would happen in his
prophetic account of his travels in the region, A Dragon Apparent
(1951)? [It is true that [the second world war was followed by]{.mark}
over 40 years of [peace in North America and Europe]{.mark}---even if
for the eastern half of the continent it was a peace that rested on
Soviet conquest. [But there was no peace between]{.mark} the [powers
that]{.mark} had [emerged as rivals]{.mark} from the global
conflict]{.underline}.

[In much the same way that rich societies exported their pollution to
developing countries, the [societies of the]{.mark} highly-[developed
world **exported their conflicts**. They were **at war**]{.mark} **with
one another [the entire time]{.mark}**]{.underline}---not only in
Indo-China but [in other parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and
Latin America.]{.underline} [[The Korean war, the Chinese invasion of
Tibet, British counter-insurgency]{.mark} warfare [in]{.mark} Malaya and
[Kenya, the]{.mark} abortive [Franco-British invasion of Suez, the
Angolan civil war]{.mark}, decades of [civil war in the Congo and
Guatemala, the Six Day War, the Soviet invasion of
Hungary]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1956 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of
[[Czechoslovakia]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1968, [the Iran-Iraq war and
[the Soviet-Afghan war---these are]{.mark} only [some of the armed
conflicts]{.mark} through which the [great powers pursued]{.mark} their
rivalries [while avoiding direct war]{.mark}]{.underline} with each
other. [When the end of the Cold War removed the Soviet Union from the
scene, [war]{.mark} did not end.]{.underline} [It [continued in the
first Gulf war, the Balkan wars, Chechnya, the Iraq war and]{.mark} in
Afghanistan and Kashmir, among [other conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Taken together [[these conflicts add up to a formidable sum of
violence]{.mark}. For Pinker they are minor, peripheral and hardly worth
mentioning. The real story]{.underline}, for him, [is the outbreak of
peace in advanced societies, a shift that augurs an unprecedented
transformation in human affairs]{.underline}.

[[The history of US foreign policy is]{.mark} a **[violent and
bloody]{.mark}** one]{.underline}, although this is not necessarily the
dominant perception of most Americans. [[From]{.mark} the]{.underline}
frontier [wars of [subjugation against Native Peoples to colonial
wars]{.mark} against Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, the [Cold War
interventions]{.mark} in Korea, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam,
Nicaragua, Grenada, Lebanon, Panama, Libya and elsewhere, the post-Cold
War interventions in Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Kosovo,
[and]{.mark} the post-9/11 [interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq,
Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya]{.mark} today]{.underline}, [[the US
has an **unrivaled record of war**]{.mark} and foreign military
intervention.]{.underline} There are in fact, few periods in its history
when the US has not been engaged in war or military attacks on other
countries. In addition, [[the US is the world's largest]{.mark}
manufacturer and [exporter of military weapons]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and has a military budget several times greater than all its nearest
rivals combined. It is in fact, the **most warring nation in modern
history**. It is in this historical context that we have to]{.underline}
try and [understand its current military involvement in]{.underline}
Iraq, Afghanistan, [Pakistan, Yemen, the Horn of Africa and
Libya]{.underline}.

Although [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes
[[argued]{.underline}]{.mark} by apologists [[that these]{.mark}
military [actions are]{.mark}]{.underline} always defensive in nature
rather than proactive and expansionist, and are [[the result]{.mark} [of
real]{.mark}]{.underline} and serious [[threats]{.mark} to US security
or the wider international system]{.underline}, the virtually
impregnable security position of the US, notwithstanding the 9/11
attacks a decade ago, makes [this argument unconvincing. [The reality is
that the size of the US]{.mark} landmass [and population, the]{.mark}
vast [oceans to its]{.mark} eastern and western [borders and]{.mark} the
[friendly countries to its north and south, and the extent of
its]{.mark} economic and military [power, means that there are no
serious obstacles to]{.mark} the adoption of an [isolationist foreign
policy or]{.mark} even the adoption of [a pacifist role]{.mark} in
international affairs]{.underline}. In other words, **[[there is nothing
inevitable]{.mark} or predetermined]{.underline}** [[about]{.mark} its
long record of [war]{.mark}]{.underline} and intervention. [Explaining
the historical record of]{.underline} US foreign [intervention requires
a careful evaluation of both its strategic interests and its ideological
system, as it is the]{.underline} almost [unique combination of these
factors and the way in which they underpin and interact with each other
which helps to explain why the US continues to be the most violent state
in the international system today.]{.underline}

Strategically, the US is today the world's dominant power. [In order to
maintain this [hegemonic position]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
international system, [which is the primary]{.underline} and preeminent
[goal of all US foreign policy]{.underline} (or at least, no major
foreign policy initiative can seriously contradict this first principle
goal), [[necessitates]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of key measures,
such as: [maintaining [military advantage]{.mark} over rivals,
[which]{.mark} in turn **[requires a permanent]{.mark} internal
[military-industrial complex]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [a system
of]{.underline} allies and a military [presence in bases]{.underline}
stretched around the globe, especially in strategic regions like the
Middle East and the Horn of Africa; [influence over]{.underline} or
control of [strategic resources such as oil; domination or at least
influence over the global economic and trading system; significant
influence in international institutions; and preventing the rise of
serious challengers to its overall hegemony.]{.underline}

At the same time, the US has evolved since the founding of the republic
[a core set of [ideological beliefs]{.mark}]{.underline} which are now
deeply embedded culturally and accepted by both the political elite and
the wider society. Some of these beliefs [[are]{.mark} necessitated by,
and [functional to]{.mark}, the [military power]{.mark} of the US:
maintaining a costly and permanent military-industrial
complex]{.underline} capable of staying ahead of its rivals, for
example, [requires a supporting set of cultural values which valorize
military prowess]{.underline}, patriotism and sacrifice in war. [These
[values are]{.mark} now part of the military-industrial-media complex in
which]{.underline} video [games]{.underline} and movies, among others,
[serve as]{.underline} recruitment tools for the military, [**[narrative
frames for interpreting foreign threats]{.mark}** and as propaganda for
generating support for foreign military intervention.]{.underline}
Importantly, [[this]{.mark} [military]{.mark}-industrial-[media complex
has come to generate its own]{.mark} material and [political
interests]{.mark}, in part [because it **requires**]{.mark} **actual
[wars to]{.mark} reproduce and [sustain itself]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Other important ideological values include the strongly-held belief that
the US has been called by history (or God) to protect the so-called free
world from major threats. Thus, it is believed that the US was first
called to defeat the threat posed by the Axis powers, then the communist
threat, and today, the global threat of terrorism. [[This ideological
belief]{.mark} rests on the notion [that]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} is
uniquely placed -- by virtue of its military and economic
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}, and its moral values -- [to [ensure]{.mark}
the [safety]{.mark} of the civilized world]{.underline}; it is the
'exceptional nation' which must lead the world. Related to this, the US
has come to believe that its core values of liberty and democracy are
actually universal values which is it bound to protect at home and
spread abroad. As with its military values, these ideological beliefs
are ubiquitous in popular and political culture.

[It is the combination of the US's strategic interests and its
ideological dispositions]{.underline} in the past two hundred years or
more [which **[explains the frequency]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
geographical distribution **[[of]{.mark} its [military
interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In some cases, interventions have
been launched primarily to protect perceived strategic interests, such
as the case of the first Gulf War in which Iraq took control of Kuwait
oil reserves and appeared to seriously threaten Saudi oil reserves. In
other cases, the US's strategic interests coincided with strong
ideological imperatives, such as the Libyan intervention today where the
presence of significant oil reserves and the desire to create a pro-US
regime in a strategic region has combined with the US ideological value
of spreading democracy and overthrowing a long-term dictator and US
opponent. The key point however, is that ideological values such as
democracy promotion only rarely generate sufficient will by themselves
for military intervention, although Somalia and Kosovo may be considered
exceptions (although there were strategic interests involved in both
cases). In many other cases, such as Rwanda in the 1990s and Syria
today, such ideological imperatives are insufficient on their own to
generate US-led military intervention. At the same time, no wars can be
justified or defended to the American public, except by claiming that
they fit US ideological values; US politicians cannot admit that they
are ever at war solely to secure strategic advantage.

Of course, [during]{.underline} some periods such as the cold war and to
a lesser degree [[the]{.mark} war on terror, [US]{.mark} strategic
interests simply overrode ideological commitments to]{.underline} [human
rights or democracy promotion, as it [supported]{.mark} a series of
[brutal dictatorships in places like Latin America, Asia and
Africa]{.mark}. I]{.underline}n some cases, [[the US]{.mark} even
[approved of **mass murder**]{.mark}, such as the Indonesian
government's suppression of Communists in 1965 [which killed 500,000
people]{.mark}, its support for the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia,
[and]{.mark} its [support for Latin American death squad]{.mark}
activitie[s]{.mark} in places like Chile and El Salvador]{.underline}.
In other special cases, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, US strategic
interests override ideological commitment entirely and little real
effort is made to promote values-based policies.

The war on terror, particularly the Iraq and Afghanistan interventions,
demonstrates the interplay of these two factors, with both strategic
interests -- dealing with the threat of terrorism, the securing of
Iraq's oil and Afghanistan's potential role as an access-point to
Central Asian oil reserves, fashioning pro-US regimes, and the
construction of military bases in strategic regions to put pressure on
countries like Iran -- and ideological imperatives -- bringing liberty
and democracy to countries wracked by human rights abuses -- driving the
interventions. Paradoxically, of course, the war on terror, like many
previous US interventions, has resulted in massive human rights abuses
around the world and the denial of liberty to millions, with torture,
rendition, and the denial of civil rights commonplace, among others. At
the same time, it has also endangered US strategic interests: the attack
on Iraq strengthened and emboldened Iran, destabilized Pakistan, and
greatly damaged the reputation and standing of the US in the Middle East
and large parts of the Muslim world.

In the end, [the culturally and politically embedded ideology of the US
-- its [militarized patriotism]{.mark} -- [blinds]{.mark} its leaders
and [public to the]{.mark}]{.underline} interests and [[consequences
of]{.mark} its [military interventions, and **sustains the likelihood of
future interventions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Few Americans accept that
its country's **[wars have killed, injured and displaced literally
millions of people]{.mark}** in the last few decades, most often
[for]{.mark} little or **[no positive result in]{.mark} either
[strategic]{.mark} or ideological [terms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- that
in fact the **[real-world consequences]{.mark}** of its interventions
[are]{.mark} virtually [always the **denial of its own stated
values**]{.mark}]{.underline} of liberty and democracy. Fewer still
question why the US is willing to sacrifice thousands or even millions
of lives to secure its strategic interests, or why the US population is
so perennially vulnerable to [ideological appeals by
leaders]{.underline} which [mask the deeper strategic reasons for
violent intervention.]{.underline} [While it is unlikely
that]{.underline} its strategic interests will change any time soon or
that [the military-industrial complex can be significantly reduced in
size, there is always the hope that]{.underline} new leaders might arise
and [peace movements might emerge which are able to
challenge,]{.underline} and perhaps even change, [the]{.underline}
militarized patriotism and deeply-embedded [culture of violence which
makes the US the most violent state in the world.]{.underline}

#### The discourse of legitimacy masks the violence of hegemony\-\--the affirmative's commitment to US leadership recreates gendered national identity that codes the US as a the masculine shepherd of the global-liberal architecture\-\--turns the case

Both during his campaign, and in his presidential inauguration speech,
Barack [[Obama promised]{.mark} a [\"**new beginning\" in**
]{.mark}**American [foreign]{.mark} and national security**]{.underline}
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark} (especially [in relation to the Middle
East]{.underline}) [[that would]{.underline}]{.mark} both [keep us
safe]{.underline} from enemies **[and \"[restore our moral
standing]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** (Obama, Acceptance). In particular,
[this new beginning promised [to distance]{.mark} U.S. foreign [policy
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the grim (and largely illegal) features of the
[[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark} administration[[\'s \"war on terror\" such
as the **executive** sanctioning]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[torture]{.underline}]{.mark} of prisoners, the maintenance of a gulag
of foreign [detention centres where prisoners could be treated [outside
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [guidelines of U.S.]{.underline} and
international [[law]{.underline},]{.mark} and illegal secret initiatives
such as the program to assassinate Al-Qaeda operatives directed by Vice
President Cheney (Mazzetti and Shane). In his first day in the White
House, on January 22, 2009, Obama issued three executive orders that
followed through on this promise.\[2\] In addition to these early
executive orders, in the days and months following his election Obama
showed great rhetorical sensitivity to the wide-spread negative
perception in the Middle East of U.S. imperial behavior and designs, its
uncritical support of Israel, and its disregard for civilian casualties
and for the civil rights of prisoners. In an effort to reverse the tide
of anti-American feeling, Obama\'s first post-inaugural interview was
given to Hisham Melhem of Al Arabiya TV news (Interview). This was
followed in April and May by major addresses in Ankara and Cairo whose
primary intended audience was Middle Eastern and, more broadly, Islamic.
Both of these speeches articulate a new rhetoric of hope for U.S.-Middle
Eastern relations. In the speech to the Turkish parliament, for example,
Obama declares:¶ I \[\...\] want to be clear that America\'s
relationship with the Muslim community, the Muslim world, cannot, and
will not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism. We seek broader
engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect. We will listen
carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek common
ground. We will be respectful, even when we do not agree \[\...\].
(para. 38)¶ Hope for a new era of U.S Middle East relations is here
embodied by an attitude of respect, by a willingness to negotiate
differences and find areas of mutual interest, and by an explicit
criticism of the unilateral and monologic focus of the Bush
administration on the \'war on terror\'.¶ This apparent change in
direction in national security and foreign policy seems to be
characterized by an alternate version of presidential masculinity and by
an alternate telling of the myth of American exceptionalism. Many have
commented on the muscular character of George W. Bush\'s rhetoric of war
and national security. Indeed, his policies in what he called the \'war
on terror\' depended almost exclusively on what Joseph Nye famously
called \"hard power\", and were justified rhetorically by a
conspicuously militarist and masculinist narrative about America\'s role
in world history and politics.\[3\] In contrast to the \"\[\...\] stern
projection of a tough national persona\" (Ivie and Giner 288) in Bush\'s
rhetoric and policies, [[Obama]{.mark} seems to articulate a gentler,
more reasoned approach to national security]{.underline} and terrorism
[that]{.underline} includes the use of \'hard\' military power but also
[[depends]{.mark} importantly [on \'soft\' power in]{.mark} the form of
[diplomacy, international cooperation]{.mark}, and an emphasis on human
rights]{.underline}, economic stability and political freedom. Ivie and
Giner argue that [the success of [Obama\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}
rhetorical [[appeal to \'soft\' power]{.underline}]{.mark} during the
2008 presidential campaign [was due to his ability to]{.underline}
**[harness and [resignify the deeply-resonant myth of American
exceptionalism for a more democratic]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
community-minded **[[projection of America\'s
role]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in world affairs]{.underline}**. In
Obama\'s version of national security, they write:¶ A less tragic sense
of order mandated a reduced sense of guilt and thereby decreased the
need for redemption via the cult of killing. This expression of national
mission in more democratic and practical terms indicated, at least
\"logologically,\" the possibility of aligning public culture with a
more global and constructive perspective on matters of national
security. It revealed the possibility of a founding myth reformed to
relax the lethal grip of the Evil One on the conscience of a nation that
might do more good in the world if it were burdened less by tragic
guilt.\[4\] (296)¶ This conclusion requires a retrospective reassessment
in the light of Obama\'s decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan.
[How do we reconcile Obama\'s seemingly dramatic shift from
progressive]{.underline} presidential candidate [who]{.underline} was
proud to have [opposed]{.underline} the war in [Iraq]{.underline} from
the beginning, and who abolished the use of torture and illegal
detention in his first day in office, [to the president who]{.underline}
in December 2009 [made the decision to]{.underline} pursue and
significantly [escalate]{.underline} military [violence in
Afghanistan?]{.underline} How do we reconcile Obama\'s seemingly
contradictory use of both the soft rhetoric of hope and diplomacy and
the hard rhetoric of fear and military violence in his national security
statements and speeches?¶ In the analysis that follows I argue that
[**[while Obama]{.underline}** **[at times articulates a
softer]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[version of [foreign
policy]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[and seems to perform a softer, more
inclusive presidential masculinity in the area of global
politics]{.underline}** and terrorism, **[[this does not fundamentally
signify a]{.mark} [different orientation to national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}** as some have argued. **[I emphasize how
[Obama\'s rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}** and policies **[[fall within
the]{.mark} standard rhetorical [oscillations that constitute the myth
of]{.mark} American [exceptionalism and presidential
masculinity]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} that those oscillations
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** principally and most significantly
**[oriented by the more [militarist]{.mark} and]{.underline}**
conventionally **[masculinist versions of the myth]{.underline}**.¶
Presidential Masculinity in the Democratic Nomination Speech¶ Obama\'s
speech at the Democratic National Convention in August 2008 marks the
formal shift of his campaign focus from Democratic Party voters towards
a national audience, and from his rivalry with Hillary Clinton to a
campaign against John McCain. In terms of Obama\'s national security
rhetoric, this is a fascinating moment because, in this new broader
context, he makes an attitudinal shift to a more militarized and
masculinized mode of speech. In fact, Obama\'s performance of soft
masculinity on issues of national security during the primary campaign
was an opportune product of the moment that did not reflect the
principal orientation of his thinking.\[5\] This is quite clear in the
nomination speech as he shifts his campaign towards a more conservative
national audience, and directs his attention from a female rival to a
male rival with military credentials.¶ Obama\'s first sentence about
foreign policy in the nomination speech concerns his own stature and
ability to lead American troops into battle, and to battle John McCain
for the position of commander in chief. \"If John McCain wants to have a
debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next
commander-in-chief, that\'s a debate I\'m ready to have.\" (para. 79)
What is most interesting about this lead-in to the topic of national
security, terrorism, and foreign policy is that its main rhetorical
function is to emphasize Obama\'s masculine capability. It does this by
declaring his presidential mettle, but also through the performance of
an \'I dare you\' challenge to his political adversary. It seems to say,
\'if you want to fight, then let\'s fight. Bring it on!\'¶ Why does
Obama begin this section of the speech with a flexing of muscle? In
part, it has to do with the histrionics of presidential campaigns, and
in this particular campaign with the anticipated challenge to Obama\'s
military masculinity from John McCain, a candidate with a powerful story
of military bravery and heroism to his credit. At the same time, the
foregrounding of presidential masculinity in terms of the resolve and
capacity to lead the armed forces into battle is nothing unusual. The
most significant human protagonist in the narrative of American
exceptionalism is almost always the figure of [the
president]{.underline}. This is especially true in times of danger,
crisis or war. He is the commander in chief of the armed forces. To him
goes the job of protecting the national family from outside threats and
danger. To do this effectively, he [must be brave, decisive and
rational.]{.underline} He cannot afford to be feminized by being overly
emotional or sympathetic to others; [he cannot]{.underline} succumb to
doubts, or [become scared to act]{.underline} (Cohn, Cuordileone,
Hopper, Lakoff, Sylvester, Tickner, Young). It is to this mythos that
Obama\'s beginning performance of masculinity in the speech belongs. In
the new context of a national audience, it stands out as a deeply-felt
and vigorously articulated orientation towards national security.¶ After
this initial show of male plumage, Obama continues the foreign policy
section of the nomination speech by contrasting his youthful masculinity
to McCain\'s elderly, bumbling masculinity.¶ For \-- for while \-- while
Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I
stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from
the real threats that we face. When John McCain said we could just
muddle through in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more
troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked
us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his
lieutenants if we have them in our sights. (para. 80-81)¶ While McCain
turns his sights away from the target, Obama stands up. While McCain
muddles, Obama works to finish the fight and \"take out\" bin Laden if
he\'s \"in our sights.\" In the subtly crafted metaphor of aiming a gun
at an enemy that organizes the passage, McCain appears as a distracted
old soldier who aims at the wrong target and is generally confused. In
contrast, vigorous and youthful, Obama stands up purposely, aims at the
target, and fires. These metaphors all work to highlight the differences
between McCain and Obama in terms of their embodiment of a properly
militarized masculinity: which candidate can stand up, correctly
identify the enemy, and fire the necessary shots to kill him.¶ Obama
criticizes McCain for standing alone in \"stubborn refusal\" to
recognize the realities of the conflict (that it is with al Qaeda in
Pakistan and Afghanistan, not in Iraq), and therefore for lacking
judgment. This lack of judgment is also narrated in terms of a contrast
between a youthful and an aging masculinity: \"[We need a president who
can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of
the past.\"]{.underline} (para. 84) Obama declares. The contrast between
a man who grasps at the past and one who \"faces\" the future is coded
with messages about age and masculinity: youthful, confident stepping
forward into the future versus old, unsteady back-stepping towards the
past. At stake in this contrast is which strategy will \"defeat\" the
enemy. \"You don\'t defeat \-- you don\'t defeat a terrorist network
that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq\", (para. 85) Obama
argues. These are enemies who must be killed in order to protect the
nation. [To do this requires a commander-in-chief with masculine resolve
and courage who can lead us into battle]{.underline}. This is not work
for touchy-feely idealists who want to understand, communicate, and
negotiate. And Republicans, Obama points out proudly, are not the only
ones with the proper testicular size to lead the army into battle: \"We
are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don\'t tell
me that Democrats won\'t defend this country. Don\'t tell me that
Democrats won\'t keep us safe.\" (para. 87) As in his opening statement,
part of the effectiveness of these lines is their performance of a kind
of \"I\'m up to the challenge masculinity\" that talks tough, is
aggressive with challengers (\"don\'t tell me\"), and does not back
down. The rhetoric of American exceptionalism and presidential
masculinity foregrounded here in the nomination clearly constitutes the
dominant note of continuity in Obama\'s national security thinking. This
is most evident in his two speeches from December 2009 in which he
justifies his decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan as the
following discussion will show.¶ Reasons for War: the December 1, 2009
Speech at West Point¶ Obama\'s December 2009 speech at West Point argues
for the strategic necessity and ethical correctness of increased war
effort in Afghanistan on the basis of history. The history begins with
the 19 Al Qaeda operatives who committed the terrorist atrocities on
9/11 and moves quickly to focus on the Taliban who provided them with a
secure base from which to operate. After 9/11, as Obama tells the story,
we made great military inroads against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but
then mistakenly turned our attention to Iraq. This provided an opening
for the Taliban, and for Al Qaeda, who are now coming back into
Afghanistan from Pakistan. The Afghan government cannot fight them off
and therefore, he says, summing it all up: \"In short, the status quo is
not sustainable\" (para. 12). How does a rudimentary history like this
serve as an explanation or justification for war? What is the mediating
logic?¶ The over-simplification of contemporary U.S and Afghan history
entailed in this schematic narrative is head-spinning.\[6\] But, even
putting that aside, if one accepts the history at face value, it is
still the case that our commitment to war is left unexplained and
unjustified by the narrative. The history begins with 19 terrorists, and
ends with the large-scale military action on the part of the United
States. Should it not take a lot more than saying, \'well, the Taliban
are gaining momentum and, remember, they are best friends with Al
Qaeda\' to justify the deployment of 100,000 U.S. troops, predator
drones strikes all over northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan, full
involvement of the CIA, major flows of capital and materiel, and huge
contracts with private military contractors like XE Services (aka
Blackwater)? Obama\'s historical narrative simply does not add up to a
political argument for this kind of war, and for this kind of outlay of
capital.¶ [As a justification for war, it seems, rather, to be
structured like a myth]{.underline} in the sense that Roland Barthes
gave the word. [[Myth]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Barthes, is
paradoxically effective because, formally, it [[works like an alibi.
**It is an explanation based on an absence of evidence**]{.mark} **and
meaning [rather]{.mark} [than its presence]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In an
alibi (the accused was absent not present at the scene) the meaning and
the evidence are always elsewhere (121-127). [Obama\'s narrative amounts
to a **mythological explanation for war**]{.underline} in the sense that
its significance lies not in the history itself but in the formal
seriousness of a president telling a story to justify war. That is, its
significance lies in the rhetorical gesture that serves to remind the
audience of the president\'s authority as commander in chief and of his
role to defend the nation from harm. By telling this story the president
in effect quotes an array of motives, intentions, plot sequences and
characters that are formally full even if their content in this instance
is misleading or empty. To paraphrase Hayden White, in this case the
content is the form. Here, the details of the story of the Taliban and
Al Qaeda in Afghanistan are significant to the extent that they play a
role in a larger narrative already familiar to the American audience:
the Unites States stands for peace and prosperity, freedom and democracy
but sometimes it is attacked by evil enemies whose irrational desire is
to destroy all that is good. In that circumstance, the president must
protect the national family through the use of military violence. War is
the best and, in fact, the only way to make ourselves secure.¶ Following
this schematic historical narrative with which he begins the West Point
speech, Obama reassures the audience that his final decision to escalate
the war was taken only after a serious and difficult deliberative
process. This process, he says, \"has allowed me to ask the hard
questions, and to explore all the different options, along with my
national security team, our military and civilian leadership in
Afghanistan, and our key partners. And given the stakes involved, I owed
the American people \-- and our troops \-- no less.\" (para. 13) [The
image of the president very seriously asking questions, exploring
options, and consulting experts is one intended to produce a sense of
citizen confidence both in the decision and in the decider]{.underline}
(as George W. Bush famously called himself) again without revealing any
of the details or particulars that constitute the decision. The
rhetorical appeal here is essentially charismatic and depends on thick
cultural associations with the president as benevolent paternal
authority, and as rational but determined protector of the nation. The
tone of the passage is that of a father reassuring his family that the
big decision he has made today was made with great care, and with their
communal welfare in mind.¶ Obama\'s [[stress on his]{.mark} careful
[deliberation process but not on the **content of the
deliberation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is reminiscent
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Iris Marion Young\'s emphasis on [[the \"logic
of masculinist protection]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [in national security
thinking]{.underline}. [This is a logic that connects the protective
role of the father in the patriarchal family with the role of commander
in chief.]{.underline} In both cases, she argues that [one of the prices
exacted by benevolent masculinist protection is that [the
protected]{.mark} woman/[feminized citizen must concede
\"]{.mark}critical [distance from decision-making]{.mark}
autonomy]{.underline}.\" (120). In other words, if the fatherly
president\'s allegiance to citizens and soldiers is expressed in the
mindfulness with which he makes communal decisions of this magnitude,
then it is equally true that our allegiance to the father-president is
expressed in our acceptance of his authority and judgment to do what is
best for us in these circumstances. The allegiance to the father quickly
becomes the measure of our patriotism. As a rhetorical strategy, then,
Obama\'s description of the seriousness of his decision-making process
serves to legitimate his decision to escalate war through an appeal to
an image of protective presidential masculinity. This appeal
interpellates the audience in the role of a complicit, feminized
citizenry that needs such fatherly protection.\[7\]¶ After the scant
historical review, and a summary of where we are and why we are obliged
to go to war, Obama devotes a good portion of the West Point speech to
making a series of sequential points, statements of fact, and reasoned
arguments. For example, he gives three specific goals for the Afghan
intervention, and outlines how those goals will be achieved and how it
will all be paid for. He also identifies three possible objections to
the escalation and gives reasoned arguments for why these criticisms are
incorrect. In sum, he says \"As President, I refuse to set goals that go
beyond our responsibility, our means, or our interests.\" (para. 37).As
feminist International Relations scholars have argued, [to [talk about
war in rationalist terms]{.mark} as Obama does here [tends to **divert
attention from the cruelties**]{.mark} **of war**, [and to
imagine]{.mark} the truth of [war \"**abstracted** from
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}\"

(Ruddick 132). It becomes difficult, in this context, to focus on, or
give weight to, the terrible details of war, and in particular to the
death and destruction that modern wars exact mostly from civilians not
soldiers.\[8\] As a rhetorical performance, the description of war in
terms of rational sequences and formulas also tends to give authority to
the rhetorician himself by distancing him from feminized forms of
emotionality or care work (Cohn).¶ Obama ends his speech with the
conclusion that presidential war speeches commonly have: an eloquent and
solemn call to unity and patriotism. \"Now, let me be clear: None of
this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will not be
finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan.
It will be an enduring test of our free society, and our leadership in
the world.\" (para. 41) The logic of a bond between our free society and
our leadership in the world is presupposed rather than described or
explained. Like all heroes, the hero of the exceptionalist narrative
faces a test. In this instance, he is us, and our essential quality of
being a free society is linked to our dominance in the world.¶ Since the
days of Franklin Roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our
grandparents and great-grandparents, our country has borne a special
burden in global affairs. We have spilled American blood in many
countries on multiple continents.We have spent our revenue to help
others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies.We have
joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions \-- from
the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank \-- that provide for the
common security and prosperity of human beings.¶ We have not always been
thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. But more
than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten
global security for over six decades \-- a time that, for all its
problems, has seen walls come down, and markets open, and billions
lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress and advancing
frontiers of human liberty.¶ For unlike the great powers of old, we have
not sought world domination.Our union was founded in resistance to
oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations.We will not claim
another nation\'s resources or target other peoples because their faith
or ethnicity is different from ours.What we have fought for \-- what we
continue to fight for \-- is a better future for our children and
grandchildren. And we believe that their lives will be better if other
peoples\' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access
opportunity (para. 47-49).¶ [[Unlike other world powers, we are
**benevolent**]{.mark},]{.underline} [seeking only that which will make
the world a better place]{.underline}. We are, that is to say, a world
power but not a world empire. [Our history shows]{.underline} this: our
military violence and [our leadership have underwritten global security
for over sixty years.]{.underline} [Strangely, though, our fatherly
sacrifice to protect the world from harm is sometimes misunderstood, and
\"we have not always been thanked for our efforts.\" Who are the
unthankful]{.underline} and what is their story? [In the]{.underline}
standard-issue [exceptionalist narrative, they are the enemies of
freedom, the sowers of chaos,]{.underline} and the ideologically
possessed. Obama certainly believes this. At the same time, the
statement that \"we have not always been thanked for our efforts\" also
expresses a deep anxiety about the details and the stories that are
erased by the great father\'s version of history.¶ Making War, Talking
Peace: The Nobel Peace Prize Speech¶ The Nobel Prize acceptance speech,
given just nine days after Obama\'s announcement of the escalation of
the war in Afghanistan, provides a fascinating expansion of the plot of
\"American as good vs. foreign as evil\" that informs the narrative
justification for war in the West Point speech. In this speech, Obama
contextualizes both American exceptionalism in general, and his specific
decision to expand the war in Afghanistan, in a sweeping historical
narrative of global progress. \"At the dawn of history,\" Obama
declares, \"war was routinely pursued between tribes and peoples quite
simply as a way of \'seeking power and settling disputes.\" (para. 6)
Later, as \"man\" progressed, legal and diplomatic efforts were made in
an attempt to regulate war and the way it was pursued. Obama invokes
just war theory citing it as one of the principle ways in which humans
have tried to regulate and civilize war. [In Obama\'s narrative, [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is located
at the upper end of]{.mark}]{.underline} this [[historical progression
because it]{.mark} is th[e]{.mark} U]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates [that has [provided]{.mark} the
[leadership to produce **the global \"architecture**]{.mark}**\" of
peace**]{.underline} in the form of the United Nations, support for
human rights, nuclear arms reductions, and so on. Elaborating on the
schematic history of the United States that appeared in the West Point
speech, Obama says¶ The United States of America has helped underwrite
global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens
and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and
women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to
Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans.We
have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will.We have
done so out of enlightened self-interest \-- because we seek a better
future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their
lives will be better if others\' children and grandchildren can live in
freedom and prosperity (para. 18).¶ J. Ann Tickner argues that
[[the]{.mark} idea of [enlightened self interest corresponds to a
masculinist model of i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [in which
states are]{.mark} systematic and [instrumental]{.mark} they are
competitive \"[**profit** **maximizers that pursue power**]{.mark} **and
autonomy** [in an anarchic world]{.mark} system]{.underline}.\"(52) In
this context, if [international [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}
exists, it [[is explained not in terms of community]{.mark} [or]{.mark}
an [interdependent]{.mark} notion of [security]{.mark}]{.underline} and
welfare, [[but]{.mark} rather in terms of **[rational choice]{.mark}**
and enlightened self-interest]{.underline}. Here, in Obama\'s version,
we shoulder the burden of world peace and prosperity both heroically
(with American blood and military power) but also as rational actors.
[[We act]{.mark} not [as]{.mark} an imperial power, but as [a benign
power]{.mark}]{.underline} exercising rational choices in a dangerous
world in order to protect our interests. By virtue of the incantatory
power of the exceptionalist narrative, our interests are identical with
democratic values and the cause of economic justice.¶ The awkward
context of the Nobel Prize speech both clarifies and complicates
Obama\'s justification of war. While acknowledging the \"moral force\"
of the theory of non-violence, he also argues that \"[evil does exist in
the world\" and that a realist assessment of the world \"as it is\"
sometimes requires violence.]{.underline} This part of the speech is
quite subtle, [shuttling back and forth between the recognition that war
is terrible and the insistence that it is sometimes necessary. [The
notion that war is]{.mark} sometimes just and sometimes [necessary
for]{.mark} building [peace is]{.mark} modified throughout [with an
appeal to]{.mark} \"responsibility\" and to [the **rational, measured
use of military violence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obama argues that \"all
responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear
mandate can play to keep the peace.\" (para. 26) The rationalist tone of
responsibility and militaries with clear mandates is matched by Obama\'s
framing of the philosophical question of war and peace as a matter of
human imperfection. The ideals of peace are beautiful, but in the world
as it is human beings are not perfect. They sometimes act unaccountably
and irresponsibly. And sometimes they must be stopped from perpetrating
evil.¶ At the end of the speech, Obama signals what for him is the chief
human imperfection that is at the root of so much of the world\'s
violence. He says,¶ As the world grows smaller, you might think it would
be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are; to
understand that we\'re all basically seeking the same things; that we
all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of
happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families. ¶ And yet
somehow, given the dizzying pace of globalization, the cultural leveling
of modernity, it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss
of what they cherish in their particular identities \-- their race,
their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion. In some places,
this fear has led to conflict.At times, it even feels like we\'re moving
backwards.We see it in the Middle East, as the conflict between Arabs
and Jews seems to harden.We see it in nations that are torn asunder by
tribal lines.¶ And most dangerously, we see it in the way that religion
is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted
and defiled the great religion of Islam, and who attacked my country
from Afghanistan.T hese extremists are not the first to kill in the name
of God; the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded. But they
remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war (para. 47-49).¶ In the
context of globalization, what jams the machine is fear of loss of
identity. This fear also gets in the way of our universal human
aspirations for peace and prosperity. The most notable example of this
kind of fear is, of course, the terrorism practiced by al Qaeda. This is
a fear underwritten by megalomania: the idea that violence is mandated
by God. What is striking about this passage is that it plots opposition
to globalization as fear of change, almost as a kind of primitive or
childish clinging to identity in a world whose universal characteristics
are evident. But can this be the whole story? Can one explain the
conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, as Obama appears to do
here, as irrational fear of loss of identity? Is opposition to
capitalist globalization American-style, and under the paternal arm of
American power, always and everywhere a form of childishness or partial
vision?¶ In his concluding comments, Obama quotes Martin Luther King\'s
1964 Nobel Prize acceptance speech in which he talks about the moral
necessity of striving for what ought to be rather than accepting things
as they are. This is an eloquent but highly impertinent frame for the
speech. In his Nobel address, King soundly rejects those versions of
history organized around notions of necessary violence. Accepting the
prize on behalf of the entire civil rights movement, King says:¶ After
contemplation, I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of
that movement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer
to the crucial political and moral question of our time - the need for
man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence
and oppression. Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts.
Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have
demonstrated that nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful
moral force which makes for social transformation. Sooner or later all
the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in
peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative
psalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all
human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and
retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love (para. 4).¶ King
clearly rejects the idea that civilization sometimes requires violence,
or that violence can sometimes be just or moral. Love, in King\'s terms,
is antithetical to the discourse of innocence, guilt, power and violence
that constitutes the narrative of American exceptionalism. Instead,
King\'s ethic of love is consonant with Judith Butler\'s critique of
violence:¶ The violent response is the one that does not ask, and does
not seek to know. It wants to shore up what it knows, to expunge what
threatens it with not-knowing, what forces it to reconsider the
presuppositions of its world, their contingency, their malleability.
[[The nonviolent response lives with its **unknowingness about the
Other**]{.mark} in the face of the Other, since sustaining the bond that
the question opens is finally more valuable than knowing in advance what
holds us in common, as if we already have all the resources we need to
know what defines the human, what its future life might be]{.underline}
(35).¶ **[This is precisely [what is wrong with]{.mark} the narrative of
[American]{.mark} [exceptionalism]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[and
with]{.underline}** Obama\'s **[obligation to it.]{.underline}** **[[A
story whose plot is organized]{.mark} entirely [around the]{.mark}
character of its [hero]{.mark} does not seek to know.]{.underline}**
**[It [is narcissistic. It shores up what it knows in fear of the
Other,]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark} in this gesture
[reconfirms that its view of the world is the
truth]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Obama seems **oblivious to the
contradictions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in his assertion of American
power [as he struggles]{.mark} here [to articulate]{.mark} the oxymoron
of **[peace through war]{.mark}**. In the end, what \"makes sense\" in
his justification for war is the cultural and political sense that
adheres to the image of embodied presidential masculinity, and to his
military leadership performed in patriotic service to America\'s heroic
global mission.]{.underline}¶ Conclusion¶ Obama\'s national security
policies and rhetoric are, to be fair, significantly different in many
ways than Bush\'s. Nonetheless, he steeps his rhetoric of hope for a new
foreign policy in the old, familiar language of American exceptionalism.
This illustrates how [[the **political logic**]{.underline} [of a
militarized and masculinized]{.underline}]{.mark} nation,
[[presidency]{.underline}]{.mark} and citizenry [[has proved to be
**more enduring**]{.mark}**, significant [and powerful]{.mark}**
[than]{.mark} the [strategy differences]{.mark} that have divided
Democrats and Republicans]{.underline} over the last 60 years. It is
important also because [[the cultural logic of]{.mark} American
[exceptionalism]{.mark} guaranteed by military power **[makes]{.mark} so
[many questions difficult]{.mark}** to ask [because the
questions]{.mark} themselves [seem]{.mark} absurd, effeminately nave, or
simply [out of rhetorical limits]{.mark}. These are unasked questions
such as what violence was required to achieve our affluence and power?
How can that violence be justified? **[Are there models for world
peace]{.mark}, prosperity and freedom [other than]{.mark} America\'s
[dominance]{.mark} and \"leadership?\"**]{.underline} [Does military
power and violence produce security?]{.underline} [What constitutes
security?]{.underline} Is invulnerability a legitimate security goal? Is
the authority of Commander-in-chief one that automatically adheres to
the presidency at all times, or should the executive be more limited in
its power as originally envisioned in the Constitution? Is citizenship
best characterized in terms of a militarized and masculinized
patriotism? Can terrorism be fought with large-scale military tactics?¶
Of course, [it is impossible to know all the ins and outs of how
Obama]{.underline} and his advisors [reached the decision to escalate
the war in Afghanistan]{.underline}. For those who voted for Obama over
Clinton during the Democratic primary campaign because of his
clear-spoken commitment to a different kind of foreign policy, the
decision is disappointing to say the least. **[In the final analysis,
when the decision was made, and its justification needed to be
formulated into public rhetoric, what is clear is that the Obama
administration felt at home in and oriented by - the old language of
American exceptionalism]{.underline}**. Familiar orientations, as Sara
Ahmed argues, are an \"effect of inhabitance.\" That is, their sense,
their familiarity and their surety are products of their alignment with
an already aligned world (7). My argument here is that the sense Obama
makes of war is indebted to and made possible by - the familiarity and
common-sense orientation of American exceptionalism. [If the [militarism
and masculinism]{.mark} of his national security logic seem sensible or
reassuring, it is because they [are]{.mark} **oriented in [deeply
familiar]{.mark} ways**. The rhetoric of war and national
[security]{.mark} also [works]{.mark}, of course, **[to recreate
the]{.mark} familiar [orientation from which it
emerges.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As Susan Jeffords argues, in the
post-Vietnam context, heroic narratives about the war had the decisive
(but indirectly manifested) effect of \"remasculinizing American
culture.\" This is why the work of disorientation that is proposed by
feminist International Relations scholars and activists with its
specific focus on the hidden injuries of gender in the familiar
discourses of war and security is so important. It is also why it is so
difficult.¶ I have argued that [Obama\'s war logic is oriented by, and
serves to reorient us towards, a **[national mythology grounded in
narratives of glorified violence]{.mark}** and masculinity.]{.underline}
The difficulty of challenging and disorienting that prevailing narrative
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} eloquently described by Jorge Luis Borges in
his story \"The South.\" The story serves as an apt allegory of the
mythology of American exceptionalism with its multiple commitments to
masculinity and violence, and for the ways [this mythology]{.underline}
works to [make military violence]{.underline} the [seemingly
inevitable]{.underline} and sensible locus where the national story is
both resolved and reinvigorated. The main character in \"The South\" is
named Juan Dahlmann. Dahlmann feels \"deeply Argentine\" despite the
fact that his paternal grandfather was a northern European immigrant.
Dahlmann\'s patriotic sense of identity involves, among other things,
having purchased a little ranch in the south that had once been in his
mother\'s family. Dahlmann lives in Buenos Aires, and for him the south
has tremendous symbolic resonance as that place that retains the
masculinist features of national mythology: the pampa, the gaucho, the
singing bard, the tavern, the duel. Dahlmann dreams about the ranch and
its old house, and takes comfort in imagining it waiting for him on the
pampa, even though he never really gets a chance to actually go there.
One day, Dahlmann is struck gravely ill with a terrible infection and is
hospitalized with high fever. As is typical of so many of Borges\'
stories, it is impossible to tell if the subsequent narrated events are
products of his hallucinatory state or are really happening to him. In
any event, after some days of medical intervention, he is released and
boards a train towards the south to convalesce at his ranch. He arrives,
enters a tavern where he eats barbeque and drinks wine, and then is
taunted by some young men who have been drinking too much. Although the
bar owner tells him to pay them no mind, Dahlmann confronts them as any
traditional male character in a gaucho story would be required to do. In
seeming recognition of his decisive entrance into one of the enduring
storylines of nationalist mythology (the knife fight between men at a
watering hole on the pampa), the ancient gaucho in the corner of the bar
who until now has remained motionless as if frozen in time, becomes
\"ecstatic\" and throws him a dagger. The rest is preordained: Dahlmann
will walk out of the tavern with a knife in his hand, he will fight
bravely, and then die with the stranger\'s blade in his gut. It is, the
narrator says, \"as if the South had decided that Dahlmann should agree
to the duel.\" (203) When he picks up the dagger, he feels two things:
first, \"that this almost instinctive act committed him to fighting\"
and, second, \"that, in his clumsy hand, the weapon would not serve to
defend him, but rather to justify their killing of him\" (Borges, 203
translations mine).¶ For me, \"The South\" is a story about the
masculinist mythology of national identity and violence. Intricate and
contradictory is it dream or reality? the myth exercises its force both
from within on Dahlmann\'s imagination and from without on his body.
[The logic of a militarized and masculinized rhetoric of national
security, in concert with the economic logic of our military budget and
the imperial logic of our global ambition, serves as our \"south\"
**[leading us on]{.mark}**]{.underline}ward [**[towards the use of
large-scale military violence]{.mark} as if in a dream from which we
cannot wake**.]{.underline} We cannot hear the warnings of the barkeep
who tries to tell us that we do not have to kill or be killed in this
instance. Like Dahlmann, our politicians even the less bellicose among
them when faced with security threats simply cannot imagine any
alternative to masculinist bravado and the duel to the death.¶ \"The
South\", then, is a cautionary tale. As long as presidents and
politicians dare not challenge the role of the military budget as the
primary organizing principle of our economy, and [as long as the
militarized and masculinized ideology of American exceptionalism remains
the almost unitary language with which we speak of national security and
foreign policy, there should be no surprise when ostensible
doves]{.underline} from the Democratic Party such as Barack Obama
[pursue large-scale military campaigns]{.underline} in places like
Afghanistan, [and seem to do so as readily as their reputedly hawkish
counterparts in the Republican Party.]{.underline} **[[Alternate
strategies to]{.mark} large-scale military [violence require new
story-lines of national identity]{.mark}]{.underline}** and national
security. **[We need to give ourselves a choice]{.underline}** [about
whether taking up the knife is what the situation calls for**. [We need
to ask questions about how we got into such a situation in the first
place.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[We need to create alternatives
to]{.mark} the logic that defines [security]{.mark} as killing or being
killed]{.underline}. Clearly, **[[rhetoric plays a significant role in
preparing these choices]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But, as Obama\'s
performance indicates, [[it is unlikely that our]{.underline}]{.mark}
presidents and our [[politicians will do the]{.mark} rhetorical [work
necessary to disorient the]{.mark} prevailing [exceptionalist
narrative]{.mark} and reorient the debate towards]{.underline} the ethos
of [human security**. [It falls to]{.mark} us - citizens, activists and
[intellectuals - to turn our]{.mark} political [rhetoric away from
antagonisms that require violence towards the democratic task of
contending with opponents]{.mark} with whom we share**]{.underline}
**[the world]{.underline}**.

By now it is fair to say that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has come to be **dominated by two grand and
dangerous hallucinations: the promise of benign US globalization and the

[has [committed]{.mark}]{.underline} itself [after 9/11---[two
countries]{.mark} [invaded, **thousands of innocent people**]{.mark}
**imprisoned, [killed, and tortured]{.mark}**[---unless we grasp a
**defining feature of our moment**, that is, **a** ]{.mark}**deep and
disturbing [doubleness with respect to power]{.mark}**. [Taking
shape]{.mark}, as it now does, [around **fantasies of global
omnipotence**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Operation Infinite Justice, the War
to End All Evil) [[coinciding with **nightmares of impending attack,
the**]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[has entered the domain of
paranoia]{.mark}: dream world and catastrophe.]{.underline}** For [it is
[only in paranoia]{.mark} that [one finds
simultaneously]{.mark}]{.underline} and in such condensed form both
**[[deliriums of absolute power and forebodings of perpetual
threat.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[Hence the]{.mark} spectral and
nightmarish quality of]{.underline} the "war on terror," [a]{.underline}
**[[limitless war against a limitless threat]{.mark}, a war vaunted by
the US administration to encompass all of space and persisting without
end.]{.underline}** But the war on terror is not a real war, for
"terror" is not an identifiable enemy nor a strategic, real-world
target. [The war on terror is]{.underline} what William Gibson calls
elsewhere ["**a consensual hallucination,"**]{.underline} 4 and [[the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} government [[can]{.mark} fling its military
might against ghostly apparitions and [hallucinate]{.mark} a
[victory]{.mark} over all evil **[only at the cost of]{.mark}
catastrophic self-delusion and the [infliction of great
calamities]{.mark} elsewhere.**]{.underline}

I have come to feel that [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} urgently [[need to
make visible]{.underline} **[(the better politically to

**[concealed]{.mark} circuits of [imperial
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that now animate the war on terror. [[We
need]{.underline}]{.mark}, as urgently, [[to illuminate the
**continuities that connect those circuits**]{.mark} of imperial
violence abroad with the vast, internal shadowlands of prisons and
supermaxes---]{.underline}the modern "slave-ships on the middle passage

[Can we, the uneasy heirs of empire, now speak only of national
things?]{.underline} If a long-established but primarily covert US
imperialism has, since 9/11, manifested itself more aggressively as an
overt empire, [[does]{.mark} the terrain and object of [**intellectual**
**inquiry**, as well as]{.mark} the claims of **[political
responsibility,]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[not also extend]{.mark} beyond

[how can we theorize]{.underline} the phantasmagoric, [imperial violence
that has come so dreadfully to constitute our kinship with the

extraordinary the ordinary bodies of ordinary people,]{.underline} [an
imperial violence which in collusion with a complicit corporate media

shadow and fleshly bodies into specters?**]{.underline} For
**[[imperialism is not something that happens
elsewhere]{.mark},]{.underline}** an **[offshore]{.underline}** fact to
be deplored but as easily ignored. [Rather, the force of [empire comes
to reconfigure,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[from
within]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [the nature and violence of the
nation-state itself[,]{.mark} giving rise to perplexing questions: Who
under an empire are "we," the people?]{.underline} And [who are the
ghosted, ordinary people beyond the nation-state who, in turn,
constitute "us"?]{.underline}

[We now inhabit **a crisis of violence and the visible**]{.underline}.
**[How do we insist on seeing the violence that the imperial state
attempts to render invisible,]{.underline}** while also seeing the
ordinary people afflicted by that violence? For [to allow the spectral,
disfigured people]{.underline} (especially those under torture) [obliged
to inhabit the **haunted no-places and penumbra** of empire to be made
visible as ordinary people is to **forfeit the**]{.underline} long-held
**[US claim of moral and cultural exceptionalism, the traditional
self-identity of the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[**as the uniquely superior, universal standard-bearer of moral
authority, a tenacious, national mythology of originary innocence now in
tatters.**]{.underline} The deeper question, however, is not only how to
see but also how to theorize and oppose the violence without becoming
beguiled by the seductions of spectacle alone. 6

Perhaps in the labyrinths of torture **[[we must]{.mark} also find a way
to speak with ghosts, for specters [disturb the authority of vision
and]{.mark} the hauntings of popular memory [disrupt the]{.mark} great
[forgettings of]{.mark} official [history.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Paranoia

Even the paranoid have enemies.

---Donald Rumsfeld

Why paranoia? [[Can we]{.underline}]{.mark} fully [[understand]{.mark}
the **[proliferating]{.mark} circuits of [imperial
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the very eclipsing of which gives to
our moment its uncanny, phantasmagoric cast---[[without]{.mark}
[understanding the **pervasive presence of the paranoia** that
has]{.mark} come, quite [**violently**,]{.mark} to [manifest itself
across the]{.mark} **political and [cultural spectrum]{.mark}** as a
defining feature of our time?]{.underline} By paranoia, I mean not
simply Hofstadter's famous identification of the US state's tendency
toward conspiracy theories. 7 Rather, [I conceive of paranoia as an
inherent contradiction]{.underline} with respect to power: a
double-sided phantasm [that oscillates precariously between deliriums of
grandeur and nightmares of perpetual threat, [a]{.mark} deep and
[dangerous doubleness]{.mark} with respect to power that [is held in
unstable tension,]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[but [which, if]{.mark}
suddenly [destabilized]{.mark} (]{.underline}as after 9/11), [[can
produce **pyrotechnic** ]{.mark}**displays of
[violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The pertinence of understanding
paranoia, I argue, lies in its peculiarly intimate and peculiarly
dangerous relation to violence. 8

Let me be clear: I do not see paranoia as a primary, structural cause of
US imperialism nor as its structuring identity. Nor do I see the US war
on terror as animated by some collective, psychic agency, submerged
mind, or Hegelian "cunning of reason," nor by what Susan Faludi calls a
national "terror dream." 9 Nor am I interested in evoking paranoia as a
kind of psychological diagnosis of the imperial nation-state. Nations do
not have "psyches" or an "unconscious"; only people do. Rather, a social
entity such as an organization, state, or empire can be spoken of as
"paranoid" if the dominant powers governing that entity cohere as a
collective community around contradictory cultural narratives,
self-mythologies, practices, and identities that oscillate between
delusions of inherent superiority and omnipotence, and phantasms of
threat and engulfment. The term paranoia is analytically useful here,
then, not as a description of a collective national psyche, nor as a
description of a universal pathology, but rather as an analytically
strategic concept, a way of seeing and being attentive to contradictions
within power, a way of making visible (the better politically to oppose)
the contradictory flashpoints of violence that the state tries to
conceal.

Paranoia is in this sense what I call a hinge phenomenon, articulated
between the ordinary person and society, between psychodynamics and
socio-political history. Paranoia is in that sense dialectical rather
than binary, for its violence erupts from the force of its multiple,
cascading contradictions: the intimate memories of wounds, defeats, and
humiliations condensing with cultural fantasies of aggrandizement and
revenge, in such a way as to be productive at times of unspeakable
violence. For how else can we understand such debauches of cruelty?

A critical question still remains: does not something terrible have to
happen to ordinary people (military police, soldiers, interrogators) to
instill in them, as ordinary people, in the most intimate, fleshly ways,
a paranoid cast that enables them to act compliantly with, and in
obedience to, the paranoid visions of a paranoid state? Perhaps [[we
need to take a]{.mark} long, hard [look]{.mark} [at]{.mark}
the]{.underline} simultaneously humiliating and aggrandizing [rituals of
militarized institutions, whereby individuals are first broken down,
then reintegrated]{.underline} [(incorporated) into the larger corps as
a unified, obedient fighting body**, [the methods by which
schools]{.mark}**,]{.underline} the military, training camps--- **[[not
to mention]{.mark} the [paranoid image-worlds]{.mark} of the corporate
media---[instill paranoia in]{.mark} [ordinary people and]{.mark}
fatally [conjure up collective but unstable fantasies of
omnipotence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 10 In what follows, I want to trace
the flashpoints of imperial paranoia into the labyrinths of torture in
order to illuminate three crises that animate our moment: the crisis of
violence and the visible, the crisis of imperial legitimacy, and what I
call "the enemy deficit." I explore these flashpoints of imperial
paranoia as they emerge in the torture at Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib. I
argue that Guantánamo is the territorializing of paranoia and that
torture itself is paranoia incarnate, in order to make visible, in
keeping with Hazel Carby's brilliant work, those contradictory sites
where imperial racism, sexuality, and gender catastrophically collide.

The Enemy Deficit: Making the "Barbarians" Visible Because night is here
but the barbarians have not come. Some people arrived from the
frontiers, And they said that there are no longer any barbarians. And
now what shall become of us without any barbarians? Those people were a
kind of solution.

---C. P. Cavafy, "Waiting for the Barbarians"

The barbarians have declared war.

---President George W. Bush

C. P. Cavafy wrote "Waiting for the Barbarians" in 1927, but the poem
haunts the aftermath of 9/11 with the force of an uncanny and prescient
déjà vu. To what dilemma are the "barbarians" a kind of solution?
[[Every]{.mark} modern [empire faces a]{.mark}n abiding **[crisis of
legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in that it flings its power over
territories and peoples who have not consented to that
power.]{.underline} Cavafy's insight is that [[**an imperial state
claims legitimacy** **only by evoking the threat of** ]{.mark}**the
[barbarians]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[It is only the threat of the
barbarians that constitutes the silhouette of the empire's borders in
the first place.]{.underline}** On the other hand, [the
[hallucination]{.mark} of the barbarians [disturb]{.mark}s the empire
with **[perpetual nightmares of impending attack.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
**[[The enemy is]{.mark} the abject of empire:]{.underline}** [**[the
rejected from which we cannot part]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And
**[[without]{.mark} the [barbarians the legitimacy of empire
vanishes]{.mark} like a disappearing phantom.]{.underline}** **[Those
people were a kind of solution.]{.underline}**

[[With the collapse of the]{.mark} Soviet [Union]{.mark}]{.underline} in
December 1991, the grand antagonism of the United States and the USSR
evaporated like a quickly fading nightmare. [The cold war rhetoric of
totalitarianism]{.underline}, Finlandization, [present
danger]{.underline}, fifth columnist, [and infiltration
vanished.]{.underline} **[[Where were the enemies]{.mark} now [to
justify the]{.mark} continuing escalation of [the military
colossus]{.mark}?]{.underline}** "And now **[what shall become of us
without any barbarians?"]{.underline}** By rights, [**[the thawing of
the cold war should have prompted a]{.mark}n immediate [downsizing of
the military]{.mark}**; any plausible external threat had simply ceased
to exist.]{.underline} [Prior to 9/11]{.underline}, General Peter
[Schoomaker, head of the US Army, bemoaned the enemy
deficit]{.underline}: "It's no use having an army that did nothing but
train," he said. "There's got to be a certain appetite for what the hell
we exist for." Dick [Cheney]{.underline} likewise [complained: "**The
threats have become so remote. So remote that they are difficult to
ascertain**."]{.underline} Colin [Powell agreed]{.underline}: "Though we
can still plausibly identify specific threats---North Korea, Iran, Iraq,
something like that---[the real threat is the unknown, the
uncertain."]{.underline} Before becoming president, George W.
[Bush]{.underline} likewise [fretted over the post--cold war dearth of a
visible enemy: "We do not know who the enemy is, but we know they are
out there]{.underline}." It is now well established that the invasion of
Iraq had been a long-standing goal of the US administration, but there
was no clear rationale with which to sell such an invasion. In 1997 a
group of neocons at the Project for the New American Century produced a
remarkable report in which they stated that to make such an invasion
palatable would require "a catastrophic and catalyzing event---like a
new Pearl Harbor." 12

[The [9/11]{.mark} attacks [came as a]{.mark} dazzling
[solution]{.mark}, both [to the enemy deficit]{.mark} and the problem of
legitimacy]{.underline}, [offering the Bush administration what they
would claim as a **political casus belli and the military unimaginable
license to expand its reach**]{.underline}. General Peter Schoomaker
would publicly admit that the attacks were an immense boon: "There is a
huge silver lining in this cloud. . . . War is a tremendous focus. . . .
Now we have this focusing opportunity, and we have the fact that
(terrorists) have actually attacked our homeland, which gives it some
oomph." In his book Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke recalls thinking
during the attack, "Now we can perhaps attack Osama Bin Laden." After
the invasion of Afghanistan, Secretary of State Colin Powell noted,
"America will have a continuing interest and presence in Central Asia of
a kind we could not have dreamed of before." Charles
[Krauthammer]{.underline}, for one, [called for a declaration of total
war. "We no longer have to search for a name for the post-Cold War era,"
he]{.underline} [declared. "It will henceforth be known as the age of
terrorism."]{.underline} 13

### Link\-\--Human Rights

#### The international human rights regime bolsters the violence of liberalism by demarcating half the world as inhuman 

William **Rasch**, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at
Indiana University, Spring **2003**, Cultural Critique, Vol. 54, p.
141-144

For Schmitt, to assume that one can derive morally correct political
institutions from abstract, universal norms is to put the cart before
the horse. [[The]{.mark} truly [important question remains:]{.mark} [who
decides]{.mark}?]{.underline}
[15](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT15)
What political power representing [[which political order defines terms
like human rights]{.mark} and public reason]{.underline}, defines, in
fact, [[what it means to be]{.mark} properly
[human]{.mark}?]{.underline} What political power distinguishes between
the decent and the indecent, between those who police the world and
those who are outlawed from it? Indeed, what political power decides
what is and what is not political? Habermas\'s contention that normative
legality neutralizes the moral and the political and that therefore
Schmitt \"suppresses\" the \"decisive point,\" namely, \"the legal
preconditions of an impartial judicial authority and a neutral system of
criminal punishment\" (1998, 200), is enough to make even an incurable
skeptic a bit nostalgic for the old Frankfurt School distinction between
affirmative and critical theory. One could observe, for instance, that
[[the \"universality\" of human rights has a very particular
base]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Habermas says: Asiatic societies cannot
participate in capitalistic modernization without taking advantage of
the achievements of an individualistic legal order. One cannot desire
the one and reject the other. From the perspective of Asian countries,
the question is not whether human rights, as part of an individualistic
legal order, are compatible with the transmission of one\'s own culture.
Rather, the question is whether the traditional forms of political and
societal integration can be reasserted against---or must instead be
adapted to---the hard-to-resist imperatives of an economic modernization
that has won approval on the whole. (2001, 124) Thus, despite his
emphasis on procedure and the universality of his so-called discourse
principle, the choice that confronts Asiatic societies or any other
people is a choice between cultural identity and economic survival,
between, in other words, cultural and physical extermination. As Schmitt
said, the old Christian and civilizing distinction between believers and
nonbelievers (Gläubigern and Nicht-Gläubigern) has become the modern,
economic distinction between \"creditors and debtors\" (Gläubigern and
Schuldnern). But while affirmative theorists like Habermas and Rawls are
busy constructing the ideological scaffolding that supports the
structure of the status quo, what role is there for the \"critical\"
theorist to play? Despite the sanguine hopes of Hardt and Negri (2000)
that \"Empire\" will all but spontaneously combust as a result of the
irrepressible ur-desire of the multitude, can we seriously place our
faith in some utopian grand alternative anymore, or in some
revolutionary or therapeutic result based on the truth of critique that
would allow us all, in the end, to sing in the sunshine and laugh
everyday? Do, in fact, such utopian fantasies not lead to the moralizing
hubris of a Rawls or a Habermas?
[16](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT16)
In short, it is one thing to recognize the concealed, particular
interests that govern the discourse and politics of human rights and
quite another to think seriously about how things could be different, to
imagine an international system that respected both the equality and the
difference of states and/or peoples. Is it possible---and this is
Todorov\'s question---to value Vitoria\'s principle of the \"free
circulation of men, ideas, and goods\" and still also \"cherish another
principle, that of self-determination and noninterference\" (Todorov
1984, 177)? The entire \"Vitorian\" tradition, from Scott to Habermas
and Rawls, thinks not. Habermas, for instance, emphatically endorses the
fact that \"the erosion of the principle of nonintervention in recent
decades has been due primarily to the politics of human rights\" (1998,
147), a \"normative\" achievement that is not so incidentally correlated
with a positive, economic fact: \"In view of the subversive forces and
imperatives of the world market and of the increasing density of
worldwide networks of communication and commerce, the external
sovereignty of states, however it may be grounded, is by now in any case
an anachronism\" (150). And opposition to this development is not merely
anachronistic; it is illegitimate, not to be tolerated. So, for those
who sincerely believe in American institutional, cultural, and moral
superiority, the times could not be rosier. After all, [[when push comes
to shove, \"we\" decide---not only about which societies are
decent]{.mark} and which ones are not[, but also about which acts of
violence are \"terrorist\" and which compose the \"gentle compulsion\"
of a \"just war]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" What, however, are those
\"barbarians\" who disagree with the new world order supposed to do?
With Agamben, they could wait for a \"completely new politics\" to come,
but the contours of such a politics are unknown and will remain unknown
until the time of its arrival. And that time, much like the second
coming of Christ, seems infinitely deferrable. While they wait for the
Benjaminian \"divine violence\" to sweep away the residual effects of
the demonic rule of law (Benjamin 1996, 248-52), the barbarians might be
tempted to entertain Schmitt\'s rather forlorn fantasy of an egalitarian
balance of power. Yet if the old, inner-European balance of power rested
on an asymmetrical exclusion of the non-European world, it must be
asked: [[what new exclusion will be necessary for a new balance, and is
that new exclusion tolerable]{.mark}?]{.underline} At the moment, there
is no answer to this question, only a precondition to an answer. If one
wishes to entertain Todorov\'s challenge of thinking both equality and
difference, universal commerce of people and ideas as well as
self-determination and nonintervention, then [[the concept of humanity
must once again become the invisible and unsurpassable horizon of
discourse]{.mark}, not its positive pole. The word \"human,\" to evoke
one final distinction, must once again become descriptive of a \"fact\"
and not a \"value.\" Otherwise, whatever else it may be, [the search for
\"human\" rights will always also be the negative image of the
relentless search for the \"inhuman\"
other]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Link\-\--Rule of Law

#### The plan identifies the non-Western world as a space devoid of the rule of law\-\--that sets the stage for aggressive intervention and colonial plunder, which locks in neoliberal structural violence

"GLOBAL LAW & PLUNDER: THE DARK SIDE OF THE RULE OF LAW," online:
<http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=bocconi_legal_papers>

Within this framework, [[Western law has]{.underline}]{.mark} constantly
[[enjoyed]{.mark} a]{.underline} [dominant position]{.underline} during
the past centuries and today, [thus [being in the position
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[shape]{.mark} and bend the evolution of [other
legal systems]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}. During the colonial era,
continental-European powers have systematically exported their own legal
systems to the colonized lands. During the past decades and today, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[have
been]{.underline}]{.mark} [dominating the international arena as the
most powerful economic power]{.underline}, **[[exporting their]{.mark}
own [legal system to the 'periphery']{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
both [by itself and through a set of international
institutions]{.underline}, [**[behaving as a
neo-colonialist]{.underline}** [within]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**ideology known as [neoliberalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Western countries]{.underline} [identify themselves
as]{.underline}]{.mark} [law-abiding and [civilized no matter what
their]{.mark} actual [history reveals]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Such identification is acquired by]{.mark} false
knowledge]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[[false comparison with
other]{.mark} people[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} those
[[who]{.mark} were]{.underline} **[said to '[lack' the rule of
law]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [such as]{.underline} [China, Japan, India,
and the]{.underline} **[Islamic world]{.underline}** more generally. In
a similar fashion today, [according to some leading
economists,]{.underline} **[Third World developing countries 'lack' the
minimal institutional systems]{.underline}** [necessary for the
unfolding of a market economy]{.underline}.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} **[theory of 'lack']{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} [**[rhetoric of the rule of law]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[have]{.underline} **[[justified aggressive
interventions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from Western countries into
non-Western ones.]{.underline} The policy of [[corporatization]{.mark}
and open markets,]{.underline} supported today globally by the so-called
Washington consensus3, [[was used]{.mark} by Western bankers and the
business community [in Latin America]{.mark} as the main vehicle [to
'open]{.mark} the veins' of [the continent]{.mark}]{.underline}---to
borrow Eduardo Galeano's metaphor4---with no solution of continuity
between colonial and post-colonial times. [[Similar policy was used
in]{.underline} **[Africa]{.underline}**]{.mark} to facilitate the
forced transfer of slaves to America, and today [[to facilitate
the]{.underline} [extraction of agricultural
products]{.underline}]{.mark}[, oil, minerals, ideas and cultural
artefacts]{.underline} in the same countries. The policy of opening
markets for free trade, used today in Afghanistan and Iraq, was used in
China during the nineteenth century Opium War, in which free trade was
interpreted as an obligation to buy drugs from British dealers. The
policy of forcing local industries to compete on open markets was used
by the British empire in Bengal, as it is today by the WTO in Asia,
Africa, and Latin America.

[**[Foreign-imposed privatization laws]{.underline}** [that
facilitate]{.underline}]{.mark} [unconscionable
[bargains]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[at the expense of the
people]{.underline}** [have been]{.underline} **[vehicles of plunder,
not]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[of [legality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
all these settings [the]{.underline} **[[tragic human
suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}** [produced by such plunder
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[simply ignored]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In
this context [[law played a major role in legalizing such
practices]{.mark} of powerful actors against the
powerless.]{.underline}5 [Yet]{.underline}, **[this use of power is
scarcely explored in the study of Western law]{.underline}**.

[[The]{.underline} **[exportation of Western]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[legal [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [from the West to
the 'rest' [has]{.mark}]{.underline} [systematically [been justified
through the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ideological use]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [extremely [politically strong
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[technically weak]{.underline}** [concept of
'rule of law']{.underline}]{.mark}. The notion of 'rule of law' is an
extremely ambiguous one. Notwithstanding, within any public discussion
[its positive connotations have always been taken for
granted.]{.underline} **[[The dominant image]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
the rule of law [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[false]{.underline}**]{.mark} both [[historically]{.mark} and in the
present]{.underline}, [[because it does not]{.mark} fully [acknowledge
its dark side]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The]{.underline} **[false
representation]{.underline}** [starts from the idea that good
law]{.underline} (**[which others 'lack']{.underline}**) [is
autonomous]{.underline}]{.mark}[, separate from society and its
institutions, technical,]{.underline} non-political, [[non-distributive
and reactive]{.mark} rather than proactive]{.underline}: more
succinctly, **[a technological framework for an 'efficient'
market.]{.underline}**

[The rule of law has]{.underline} a bright and **[a dark
side,]{.underline}** [with the latter progressively]{.underline}
**[conquering new ground]{.underline}** whenever the former is not
empowered by a political soul. In the absence of such political life,
**[the rule of law becomes a cold technology]{.underline}**. Moreover,
[when large corporate actors dominate states]{.underline} (affected by a
declining regulatory role), [law becomes a product of the economy, and
economy governs the law rather than being governed by it]{.underline}.

Ten years [[after]{.mark} the end of the [Cold War]{.mark}, mutual hopes
that a [comprehensive partnership]{.mark} would replace
containment]{.underline} as the major organizing theme [[in
U.S.-Russian]{.mark} relations [have not been
realized]{.mark}]{.underline}. The record of the 1990s has left both
Russia and the United States unsatisfied. [[Russia looks
back]{.underline}]{.mark} at the decade [[with bitterness]{.mark} and a
feeling of being marginalized and slighted by the world's sole remaining
superpower]{.underline}. It is also disappointed by its experience with
Western-style reforms and mistrustful of American intentions. The United
States is equally disappointed with Russia's lack of focus, inability to
engage effectively abroad, and failure to implement major reforms at
home. A comprehensive partnership is out of the question. Renewed
competition or active containment are also not credible as organizing
principles. Russia's economic, military and political/ideological
weakness makes it an unlikely target of either U.S. competition or
containment. Not only is Russia no longer a superpower, but its status
as a regional power is in doubt. Current thinking about Russia is
divided among four basic approaches: Forget Russia, Enfant Terrible
Russia, Evil Russia, and Russia First. The Forget Russia view holds that
Russia is too weak, too corrupt, and too chaotic to matter. After 10
years of trying to help Russia, the United States should focus its
resources and attention on more deserving and important world issues.
The Enfant Terrible view holds that, although Russia has been an
irresponsible and irritating partner, it is too weak to hurt the United
States and therefore need not be feared in earnest. President Vladimir
Putin's visits to Cuba and North Korea, courtship of Slobodan Milosevic,
and welcoming of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to Moscow are of
little strategic consequence and thus not worth our attention. This view
presupposes the existence of an important U.S.-Russian bilateral agenda
and the need to protect it from childish and irresponsible Russian
grandstanding. [[The Evil Russia view]{.mark} holds [that
Russia]{.mark}n courtship of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea is a
deliberate effort to [undermine U.S. influence]{.mark} in the world and
recreate the Soviet empire]{.underline}. Analysts [embracing this view
[take less notice of]{.mark} Russia's [diminished capabilities]{.mark}
than of ambitious rhetoric by Russian politicians]{.underline}. Given
Russia's evil purposes, [the United States is already on a collision
course with it and might as well do everything it can to box Russia
in.]{.underline} The Russia First view holds that Russia still is the
most important issue on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. It accepts the
premise that the two sides have shared interests and that Russia, once
reborn as a stable, prosperous democracy, can be a U.S. partner and
ally. Therefore, the United States should actively assist Russia in its
transformation and engage it in a broad and intense relationship with
renewed vigor and creativity. There are shortcomings in all of these
approaches. Notwithstanding its precipitous decline, to Forget Russia is
clearly not an option: the country's geographic expanse, nuclear
arsenal, and proliferation potential simply make it impossible for U.S.
policymakers to ignore. The Enfant Terrible view fails to take Russia
seriously and ignores the very real problems that exist between the two
countries. **[[The Evil Russia view risks inflating the threat and
making]{.mark} the myth of evil Russia [a self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Russia First view is [[not grounded
in reality]{.underline}]{.mark}. After a decade of failure, it should be
clear that [neither the specter of Russia's past nor the promise of its
future warrants a position near the top of the U.S. foreign policy
agenda]{.underline}. The Need for Normalcy Russia's external weakness
and internal problems have left the United States without an effective
interlocutor, either as partner or competitor. Thus, the United States
should deal with Russia on a case-by-case basis to advance our
interests, in much the same way we deal with most other countries. This
path will sometimes lead toward partnership with Russia and at other
times toward competition. It may even result in a situation where Russia
and the United States find themselves as partners and competitors
simultaneously in different parts of the world or on different issues.
Given its size, history, strategic nuclear capabilities, and future
potential, one is tempted to overstate the importance of relations with
Russia and put them at the top of the U.S. national security agenda.
Except for geography and nuclear weapons, however, there is little at
this stage to justify making relations with Russia a top priority.
Undoubtedly, Russia can inflict unacceptable damage on the United
States. [But [fear of Russia]{.mark}n nuclear weapons should not be the
driving element of the relationship. The hostility and ideological
differences that [divide]{.mark}d the super[powers]{.mark} during the
Cold War are gone. The [prospect of Russia consolidating]{.mark} and
rebuilding itself under a militant authoritarian, nationalist regime [is
remote]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Therefore, [fears of]{.mark} a deliberate
surprise [attack]{.mark} on the United States [are
unjustified]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite a number of bilateral
undertakings outside the Cold War-style security agenda, ranging from
regional diplomacy in the Balkans to investment, U.S. engagement with
Russia, with the notable exception of the Cooperative Threat Reduction
(CTR) Initiative, is limited. American investment in Russia is a
fraction of what it is in Europe or China, trade rarely exceeds a few
billion dollars a year, and political and cultural relations are limited
at best. In other words, beyond traditional Cold War issues, the United
States has an extremely narrow relationship with Russia, let alone
enough of a stake in it to merit a special place on the U.S. foreign
policy agenda. Nonetheless, while Russia is not a major player in Europe
or Northeast Asia, its proximity to Europe, Japan, and China make it a
focus of U.S. policy.

#### Cold War perceptions of Russian decision making perpetuates conflict -- casual relations spur escalation

Cold War' or twenty years' crisis? Russia and international politics"

Cold war redux? Nearly two decades since [the Cold War was transcended
by the Soviet Union's refusal to play the game any more,44 why has [the
rhetoric of the Cold Wa]{.mark}r resur- faced? Nuclear sabres are once
again being rattled, and the lines of [a new global struggle for
geopolitical advantage]{.mark} are beginning to emerge. This, however,
would be a very peculiar new Cold War, since [no fundamental interests
divide the two former superpower]{.mark}s]{.underline} (one has been
reduced to great power status, while the other has become a hyperpower).
[[There are no fundamental ideological contradictions]{.mark}, [direct
conflicts over resources or major differences over the substantive
issues]{.mark} that face the international community. Indeed, in some
ways [Russia]{.mark} could have [become the]{.mark} natural [ally of
America]{.mark} and the EU on a range of questions]{.underline}. So why
have the differences become so sharp, and why has the whole architecture
of post-commu- nist security arrangements been brought into question? In
a rather schematic manner below I will suggest that t[here have been
four major failures in adjusting policy to the new circumstances:
political, strategic, intellectual and cultural. The key question is:
How can we find our bearings in what we had assumed would be the
post-Cold War era, to ensure that it is indeed the end of this
particular global confrontation? [The political failure]{.mark} There
has been a profound asymmetry [in the transcendence]{.mark} of the [Cold
War]{.mark}. While the structures that fought the Cold War (including
the ideological ones) were dismantled on the one side, they were
retained on the other.]{.underline} The functions of bodies such as NATO
have not been replaced by a common collective security regime, but
instead have been strengthened and enlarged. Russia's early enthu- siasm
for the OSCE reflected the aspiration to create a genuine common
security regime, but failed to take into account the asymmetrical end to
the Cold War. The same applies to the 'softer' Cold War structures,
including the whole ideological- security apparatus. These are active in
[Washington and London, but in a different way no less alive in Moscow,
and have been the easiest structures to revive in a renewed period of
confrontation. The asymmetrical transcendence of the Cold War is
accompanied by an internal asymmetry at the heart of Russian politics[.
Russia renounced its claims to the ideological leadership]{.mark} of an
alternative system to the world capitalist order and the geopolitical
leadership of an alternative military and political bloc, but it did not
renounce [its civilizational identity or its aspirations to participate
in global leadership.]{.mark}]{.underline} The external asymmetry
allowed one side of the old Cold War conflict to claim the right to
oversee the transformation of the other; and while this was at first
welcomed in Russia, it increasingly came to be resented and exacerbated
the tensions within the internal asymmetry. [While [the
neo-conservative]{.mark}s in Washington [stressed the imperial and
global role t]{.mark}hat the promotion of democratic values should play,
[Moscow began to reassert an aggressive autonomy]{.mark} in interna-
tional affairs, insisting on the sovereign right of each
country]{.underline}, if not to claim a Sonderweg, then at least to
choose its own path and to define democracy as it saw fit: the new
ideology of 'sovereign democracy' that came to the fore after Ukraine's
'Orange' revolution in late 2004.45 The fundamental failure in the
post-Cold War era has been to find ways to compensate for the twofold
asymmetry. Even the recognition of the problem---that Russia could not
easily be categorized as just another 'post-communist' country--- was a
long time coming. The general difficulty of adjusting the international
system to the end of the bloc politics and hegemonic aspirations that
were characteristic of the Cold War has still not been resolved. The key
challenge after the dissolution of communist power in 1989--91, the
winding-up of the Warsaw Pact in 1990 and the disintegration of the
Soviet Union in 1991, was how to insert Russia into the new global
order. This would have been relatively easy if Russia had been a
defeated power (like Germany and Japan after 1945), but proved much
harder to do on its own terms, as an endlessly proclaimed 'great power'.
As early as the December 1992 meeting of what was still the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Kozyrev warned of the onset
[[of a 'new Cold War', and]{.mark} such warnings have sounded regularly
since then. The legitimacy of Russia's ambition to be a great power,
even a 'normal' one, has been questioned, even more than Britain's and
France's aspirations in this respect. The major difference, of course,
is that Russia's readjusted role has been accompanied by a profound
change in its internal political order, a process that is far from over.
Grave issues of international politics have become interwoven into a
constant regime [of inspection over how Russia is doing
internally]{.mark}.46 This asymmetry has been effectively exploited by
the opposition in Russia. Domestic political actors soon learnt that
easy political capital could be made by working the international
circuit, condemning the latest alleged malfeasance by Russia's rulers.47
Some of Russia's neighbours learned the rules of this game
only]{.underline} too well, and fed a constant stream of anti-Russian
material to receptive ears on Capitol Hill and elsewhere.48 This then
fed back into profoundly misinformed statements about developments in
Russia and its policies, which in turn provoked Russian reactions that
only deepened distrust and exacerbated suspicions about policy
motivations.49 Thus all sides entered into a deeply negative spiral of
mutual suspicion that gradually hardened into abuse which in turn gave
way to threats and counterthreats. Russian domestic struggles were
projected onto interstate rivalries. Indeed, the scholar Dmitry Furman
argued that 'There is only one opposition to Putin at present---other
countries.'50 At the same time, America's ideological wars for and
against various abstractions---against terror and authoritarian
capitalism, and for 'global freedom' and the like---affect specific
countries, not least Russia.51 The net result is that the security of
Europe and the world today is facing the gravest threat to peace since
the end of the bloc politics of the Cold War. In some ways the threat is
even greater, since the earlier confrontation had devised rules and
stable expectations about how the conflict would be managed. Cold War
conflict management procedures have been dismantled, while elements of
the conflict have re-emerged in a far more anarchic context. Indeed, the
political failure in the early 1990s, and once again in the early 2000s,
to build on the evident desire of Russia to move beyond the Cold War,
[and to create new organizations that could provide common institutional
mechanisms to solidify what was by any reckoning an epochal shift in
global politics, allowed old institutions and ways of thinking to
reassert themselves.]{.underline} Integration within the framework of
the EU was not accompanied by an inclusive pan-European unifi- cation
process. In [Moscow the representatives of the old bloc mentality are
now certainly in evidence once again, and their views are encouraged by
their counter- parts in the West]{.underline}. Sergei Karaganov,
director of the Council for Foreign and Defence Policy (CFDP), argues
that this is evidence that a 'new epoch of confron- tation (NEC)' is
beginning. Even in the 1990s '[any attempt by Russia to stop the
panicked retreat produced by the disintegration of the USSR was declared
to be "[neo-imperialis]{.mark}m"', to the point that today '[the
oversimplification of criticism on some parameters is even worse than in
the Cold War]{.mark} ... Any critic or opponent of the Russian president
and the Kremlin automatically becomes a democrat and friend of the
West.' Europe's failure to act as an autonomous power and the inten-
sified rivalry between 'the traditional West and the energy-producing
countries for control of energy resources' mean that Russia 'has been
forced by history into the centre of a new competitive struggle between
the liberal-democratic and authoritarian models of capitalism'.52 A
report issued to mark the 15th anniversary of the CFDP on 16 March 2007
talked about [a global 'crisis of manageability', in]{.mark} which no
single power centre on its own could manage the crisis engendered by the
growing number of failed and failing states.53]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Terror

#### Framing of terrorism is based on irrational thoughts that create endless war and state control

James **Der Derian**, leading IR theorist, respected professor,
Political Science Professor, University of Massachusetts,
12/19/**2008,** Critical Practices in International Theory, pg. 70-72

For some, this kind of [intellectual activity]{.underline} [might be
considered subversive]{.underline}. Indeed, former Secretary of State
George Shultz in a major policy address on terrorism stated that the
[[US cannot effectively respond to terrorism unless Americans are of 
one mind on the subject:]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[Our nation cannot
summon the will to act without firm public understanding and
support]{.underline}.\" Without such a consensus we risk becoming, in
Shultz\'s words, \"the Hamlet of nations, worrying endlessly over
whether and how to respond.\" I believe, however, that [[it is time to
take up a position of detachment towards terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}
that Hedley Bull approvingly referred to as \"political nihilism\".
After all, \"when times are out of joint,\" as they were for Hamlet and
as they to be for the USA as the 1980s took a radical turn, we might
find in Hamlet-who through his passionate yet [intellectual
introspection discovered just how rotten the declining state could be-a
better guide]{.underline} than, say, Henry V-who \"because he did not
know how to govern his own kingdom, determined to make war upon his
neighbors.\" [[We might also discover that there are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the official terrorist
discourse]{.mark}, perhaps even uncomfortable truth that there is some
of the terrorist in us, and some of us in the terrorist]{.underline}. My
response, then, to Shultz is more diplomatic than politic:the new
antidiplomatic estrangement of [international relations [requires that
we endlessly mediate the terrorist act]{.mark} and the response [to it
with a deeper and broader knowledge of all practices of global political
violenc]{.mark}e.]{.underline} [Otherwise, the will to act becomes
inseparable from the will to know, and [terrorism becomes
indistinguishable from counter-terrorism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover[, [an alternative approach is needed because the problem of
terrorism is implicated by a profound predicament]{.mark} that now
confronts advanced societies]{.underline}. Call it late
[capitalism]{.underline}, post-modernism, post-warring, or as I prefer,
neo-medievalism, it is a disturbing anxiety-inducing condition in which
[traditional modes of knowledge and formations of identity no longer
seem up to the task of representing, let alone managing international
relations. Nation-states never enjoyed a true monopoly on the use of
force, but now more than in any other post-Westphalian time- and
certainly at the accelerated pace-the legitimacy of that monopoly has
come under serious challenges from social, economic, technical, and
military changes. Interdependent economies, global ecological concerns
penetration by surveillance and media technologies, the three
dimensionality and nuclearization- they have all been recognized as
growing antidiplomatic forces undermining the sovereign [privileges and
obligations of the territorial state. Less noticed and understood is the
emergence of a terrorist discourse]{.mark},]{.underline} by which I
refer to [a global semiotic activity where violent powers and insurgent 
meanings clash. WIth a nuclear statement curtailing superpower and a
global information economy boosting sign-power, it is increasingly in
[the discursive realm of terrorism that the \"crises\" of political
legitimacy, national identity, and practical knowledge are being played
out. Simultaneously brutalizing, repugnant, and fascinating, the
terrorist repertoire-kidnapping, hijackings, and assassination- cannot
alone account for its rise to the singular status of international
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [In terrorist
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} a less visible battle is being
fought-most desperately between the vanguards of aspiring powers and the
rearguards of great powers-to reinscribe the boundaries of legitimacy in
international relations. In short, four important yet neglected
theoretical points are being made here. [[In the study of terrorism,
method matters: but very little critical consciousness of just how much
it matters has been demonstrated in the field]{.mark}. Second, [method
is matter given the symbolic practices of terrorism,]{.mark} limitations
of physical anti-terrorism, and [the simulacral projection of
terrorism]{.mark} by the media, the representations of terrorism have
taken o n a powerful materiality. Third, because of changing
configurations of power that rival traditional claims of international
legitimacy, new critical methods are called for. Fourth, method alone
cannot substitute for an ontological step that anyone seriously [seeking
truths about terrorism must take: questioning how our own identity is
implicated and constituted by the terrorist discourse must precede any
study of terrorism.]{.mark} These critical considerations inform the
analysis of modern forms of terrorism that follows. Taking]{.underline}
into account the sheer volume of terrorist archive, I can make no claims
for comprehensiveness. My strategy is [[deconstructive and
reconstructive:]{.mark} to provide a method which might displace,
[critique, and historicize received accounts of terrorism]{.mark} and,
simultaneously, to present an alternative primer [for reading terrorism
in its multiple, de-terroitoralized]{.mark} forms]{.underline}. What I
wish to avoid is the [subtextual ploy found in much of the terrorism
literature where the theoretical organization of an inchoate body of
thought pretends to reconcile the differences and contradictions of the
terrorism, thus \"taming\" rather than interpreting a heavily conflicted
field. At best, I hope to leave the reader with a critical method and
the minimal amount of historical knowledge necessary [to distinguish the
politically dispossessed from the violently possessed, and to
imagine]{.mark} possible forms of coexistence with the former, while
galivanting collective action against the latter.  ]{.underline}

#### The case is a lie -- terrorism truths are produced by fearmongering and faulty knowledge of the Other

**Spencer, 8** -- Lecturer in International Relations @
Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich (Alexander, and Rainer Hülsse,
Assistant Professor of International Relations @
Ludwig-Maximilians-University, "The Metaphor of Terror: Terrorism
Studies and the Constructivist Turn," Security Dialogue vol. 39, no. 6,
December)

In any case, most of what has been written on Al-Qaeda is based neither
on interviews nor on field research conducted inside the organization.
Rather, it builds on less-direct information -- it is 'veranda terrorism
research'. Among the sources used are already existing studies of
Al-Qaeda, media information and intelligence reports. [Obviously, [this
leads to a rather incestuous field of knowledge]{.mark}, where [one
scholar reproduces]{.mark}]{.underline} the unverified views of another
and thus contributes to the circulation of the ever-same 'facts' (Reid,
1993). This is hardly a new insight about terrorism research, however.
Back in 1988, one review found that 'there are probably few areas in the
social science literature in which so much is written on the basis of so
little research' (Schmid & Jongman, 1988: 177). [Another remarked that
'with a few clusters of exception there is, in fact, a disturbing [lack
of good empirically-grounded research on terrorism']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Gurr, 1988: 2). These findings have been subsequently confirmed -- and
deplored -- on numerous occasions (e.g. Merari, 1991; Silke, 2001, 2004;
Horgan, 2004; Schulze, 2004; Ranstorp, 2007). Obviously, this lack of
primary research further aggravates the problem identified above, as it
adds another layer of interpretation. Studies of this kind which
predominantly use secondary information are interpretations of how
others (e.g. intelligence staff or field-researching terrorism scholars)
[have [interpreted Al- Qaeda]{.mark} members'
[self-interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline}. And yet, despite these
various filters, information in such studies is presented as though it
provided objective accounts of the reality about Al-Qaeda. This is
particularly true for work that draws on intelligence reports and treats
them as though they were primary sources (e.g. Burke, 2003; Gunaratna,
2002; Jacquard, 2001; Koch, 2005; Reeve, 1999). [Yet, even if an
intelligence report is based on successful infiltration, [it provides
not a description]{.mark} but an interpretation [of
Al-Qaeda.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Warming

#### Warming rhetoric gets co-opted by the military furthering militarism - that turns the case 

**Marntinot, 07** \[Steve -- Instructor at the Center for
Interdisciplinary Programs at San Francisco State University,
"Militarism and Global Warming"\]
<http://www.greens.org/s-r/42/42-06.html>

In other words, [[war is the factor that renders the military a
self-generating cyclic producer of global warming]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Wars add untold and inestimable damage to the ecology on all levels,
while fulfilling their major function of producing mass murder.]{.mark}
War is the essential logic of [a military machine, and of an ethic and a
politics of militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Its fundamental
purpose is to guarantee access to resources]{.underline}, and in
particular petroleum, for its constituency. Its constituency is the US
economy, and US industry. As the largest single consumer of petroleum in
the world, its role is to guarantee the continued consumption of
petroleum by the US economy, the largest national consumer of petroleum
in the world. In addition, t[he military has become a major industrial
factor in the US itself, as part of a greater economic
cycle.]{.underline} This is a result of an ancillary economic process,
the movement of runaway shops and of whole industries relocating to
lower wage areas. Some industries moved south, others to Latin America,
others to Asia or wherever on the globe they could be more exploitative.
The US government, from the Reagan administration on, has provided
subsidies to major industries to move to low-wage areas, and produced
agreements in many countries for establishing export production zones
--- that is, zones in which production is only for export; they add
little to the local host economies, and create international assembly
lines whose only coherence is the multinational corporate structure that
controls it. The effect of this process has been to gut the industrial
base of the US [economy. The subsidiary internal effect was that
[t]{.mark}he military, the one industry that could not run away because
it was strategic, gained economic hegemony by default. The US economy
fell into the hands of the military-industrial complex. This brings us
to [the third dimension of militarist self-generation as a global
warming factor]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the face of runaway industries,
the US economy has become dominated by military production. The military
is now connected and conjoined to roughly 50% of all economic activity
in the US. This doesn't mean that 50% of all production is military
production; it means that 50% of all economic activity is associated
with the military, either in the production of military hardware, the
running of bases, or in ancillary industries whose major customer is the
military, and who thus owe their existence and functions to that major
customer. [Military appropriations by Congress]{.underline} may be 25%
of the budget, but there are ripple and multiplier effects that expand
the economic involvement of the military to far beyond that 25%. [ ...
the citizens of that structure[, the corporations themselves, have no
ethical concerns toward the planet nor toward life.]{.mark} Here is how
corporate control of the economy, a history of militarism, and corporate
globalization all come together. [The US military is what facilitated
the acquisition of exploitation righ]{.mark}ts in other countries by US
corporations, leaving the US economy essentially a military-oriented
economy. That is, militarism has engendered a military economy. Second,
it fosters a situation in which a transnational corporate structure
becomes the predominant political force in the world; and the citizens
of that structure, the corporations themselves, have no ethical concerns
toward the planet nor toward life. Its ethics are governed by the
maintenance of its stock value on the stock markets of the world. Thus,
resource exploitation is its food, and resource consumption is its
metabolism. [Militarism is the way corporations maintain their access to
their food supply --- the planet.]{.mark} Because the military economy
is by nature a monopoly, owing to government control, security
clearances, national security considerations, etc., all military
industries fall into a culture of corruption that is far beyond that of
ordinary industries]{.underline}. [This corruption is a cultural
phenomenon that makes health and longevity an ancillary
concern.]{.underline} In the interests of that corruption, beyond profit
or stock price levels[[, the military drives the political processes and
thinking of this society to ideologically ignore or deny the problem of
global warming]{.mark}.]{.underline} The profit picture is important, of
course, and it leads the oil and coal interests to buy prostituted
scientists to help them promulgate that denial. [But [the real
opposition to recognition of global warming is more immediately the
corruption that exudes from the military and its militarism. In order to
seriously address the problem, the movements]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}(ecology, environmentalist, anti-consumption, alternative
energy) [[will have to be anti-militarist]{.underline}. [The military is
key]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the cycle of [self-generation of global
warming]{.mark} at the human (initiatory) end of the spectrum of
factors[. The military may not be the worst offender in producing
greenhouse gases in the pragmatic sense, but it is the worst offender as
an entity and an ideology in the world.]{.mark} It has to be seen as
lying at the heart of the offense itself]{.underline}.  [[The military
may not be the worst offender in producing greenhouse gases in the
pragmatic sense, but it is the worst offender as an entity and an
ideology]{.underline}]{.mark} ...[[It is not possible for the
environmental movement to take a step toward preserving the environment
unless two things are brought to an end --- the existence of the US
military machine and the existence of the corporate
structure.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### That destroys movements which are key to solving warming in the real world 

**Brinsmead, 98** \[Robert D. -- Hall of Fame Winner of the Tweed
Business Excellence Award, "APOCALYPTIC AND CLIMATE CHANGE"\]

APOCALYPTIC AND CLIMATE CHANGE: [Apocalyptic has [a 100% failure
rate]{.mark}. Yet the question is raised whether [climate change
apocalyptic]{.mark} might be the one awful instance when apocalyptic
proves to be right]{.underline} - like the boy who repeatedly cried
"Wolf!" [Apocalyptic]{.underline} takes its name from an aberrant form
of Judaism that developed around 200 B.C. It prevailed until the bar
Cochba revolt in 135 C.E. That was when it [finally managed to [destroy
itself]{.mark} in an ill-conceived "end-time"]{.underline} conflict with
the Romans. After this, Rabbinic Judaism pronounced a curse on any Jew
who persisted with apocalyptic[. [Scholars of apocalyptic literature and
apocalyptic movements recognize that this development]{.underline}
]{.mark}within Judaism was the classical form of apocalyptic, providing
a kind of paradigm for other apocalyptic movements right down to our
day, including especially America's religious Right, Marxism and
[Environmentalism]{.underline}. Apocalyptic has been called "[a
theology]{.underline} \[or a world view\] of despair," meaning that it
is an outlook that has lost faith in the historical process. After
Judaism had been ruled by one great power after another (Babylon,
Persia, Greece and Syria), it lost faith that its aspirations for
independent statehood under its own Davidic king would take place within
the ordinary historical process. It therefore focused on a very bloody
"end-time" solution that would terminate the ordinary historical
process. The hallmark of apocalyptic is to see the world getting worse
and worse -- whether that is the ruling powers getting worse and worse
(Jewish apocalyptic), humanity getting worse and worse (Christian
apocalyptic), capitalist society getting worse and worse (Marxist
apocalyptic), or the environment getting worse and worse
(Greenpeace-style apocalyptic). In the case of the apocalyptic Zealots
within Judaism, (if I may borrow some striking imagery from Albert
Schweitzer) they threw themselves on the wheel of history in a last
desperate effort to make it turn. The wheel turned, but it crushed them
rather than ending Greco-Roman civilization and the historical process.
[[With its 100% failure rate, apocalyptic movements illustrate one thing
that apocalyptic environmentalism is yet to learn: it is people who are
fragile, not the world with its historical process]{.mark}. Its climate
change alarmism is just another form of Salvationism - in this case the
salvation of a supposedly fragile earth that is about to be destroyed by
human activity]{.underline}. When even school children are being
conscripted to play a role in "saving the planet" by doing good little
deeds like cutting back on water and energy consumption, planting trees
and riding bikes instead of using cars, we may see how far this
[apocalyptic salvationism has penetrated the popular
culture.]{.underline} Suppose we ask a good geologist such as Professor
Ian Plimer to tell us, especially in the context of the current global
warming panic, whether the earth is so fragile that it calls for human
efforts to save it. Plimer has already given his published answer, and
it is almost like a snort of derision. In *The Past is the Key to the
Present*, Plimer says: "For at least the last 2500 Ma, the continents
have been pulled apart and stitched back together. Every time the
continents are pulled apart, huge quantities of volcanic H2O, CO2 and
CH4 are released into the atmosphere and greenhouse conditions prevail.
When continents stitch together, mountain ranges form. Mountains are
stripped of soils, new soils form and remove CO2 from the atmosphere,
these soils are stripped from the land and the CO2 becomes locked in
sediments on the ocean floor. When atmospheric CO2 is low, glaciation
occurs. Large climate cycles can be related to plate tectonics." (The
full paper may be viewed at
www.climatechangeissues.com/files/science/Plimer.doc ) Plimer goes on
like this for page after page, portraying planet earth being pelted and
pummeled with asteroids, intense global volcanism, mass extinctions,
great ice ages, inter-glacial periods much warmer than our present "five
minutes" of global warming, enormous sea-level changes, variations in
atmospheric carbon dioxide from 6% to our present 0.037% and lower. In
short, [[a planet]{.mark} [that has survived what planet earth has
survived for 4.5 billion years is anything but
fragile]{.mark}]{.underline}. Plimer has also said that he wrote *A
Short History of Planet Earth* because he "was inspired by a Greenpeace
banner which read 'Stop Climate Change.' To stop climate change, one
must stop supernova eruptions, solar flaring, sunspots, orbital wobbles,
meteorites, comets, life, mountain building, erosion, weathering,
sedimentation, continental drift, volcanoes, ocean currents, tides and
ice armadas -- no mean feat, even for Greenpeace!"
www.smedg.org.au/plimer0701.html Whether the earth, including its
climate system, is fragile or resilient goes to the heart of the climate
change debate. [The kind of world view that we bring to the debate
determines how the facts about C02 and the climate are
interpreted.]{.underline} For instance, if in discussion with a climate
alarmist you point out that CO2 represents only 3.6% of all greenhouse
gases, and that humans produce only about 3% of all CO2 emissions, you
may then make the point that the human contribution is only 0. l8% - not
much more than 1 part in a 1000 of all greenhouse gases. If anyone
quibbles on the exact percentages here, you can double the human
contribution and it is still comes out a very tiny number in the whole
greenhouse equation. [When the warming alarmists are confronted with
these facts, they must resort to the argument that the climate is so
finely tuned and earth's systems are so fragile that this small human
contribution -- a human burp in a thunderstorm when compared with the
vast natural greenhouse emitters - [will cause a catastrophic tipping
point in the earth's fragile climate system.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[There is no danger]{.mark} that this]{.underline} super-tough,
resilient old [planet will not be able to take]{.underline} a bit of
[extra CO2]{.underline} in its stride as it has repeatedly done in its
past history anyway. So much for the myth of the fragile earth! [[It
is]{.mark} also [a dangerous myth]{.mark} because]{.underline} like all
apocalyptic myths [it has]{.underline} the capacity to [hurt people.
[The policies]{.mark} being [advocated]{.mark} by the climate change
alarmists call for drastic economic and [social changes, and they won't
be satisfied until they have destroyed civilization]{.mark} as we know
it. [If climate apocalyptic goes the way of all apocalyptic in being
impatient and intolerant, no changes are going to be rapid enough or
severe enough to inaugurate its post-industrial age]{.mark}. It will
therefore throw itself on the wheel of history to force it to turn. We
should already know the outcome.]{.underline}

#### Discourse analysis is a prior question -- if we win a link argument that proves the aff is based on a production of knowledge which favors certain understandings of reality while marginalizing others - their global environment scenario ensures extinction and a diversion from real science

Discourses of Environmental Governance [[Discourse analysis]{.mark} has
gained ground and proliferated in the analysis [of global

[and policy
studies]{.mark}]{.underline}.[2](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/global_environmental_politics/v006/6.1backstrand.html#FOOT2)
[A central insight]{.underline} of this disparate work [[is to identify
power relationships associated with dominant narratives surrounding
\"environment\" and \"sustainable development]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"
Four dimensions of discourse analysis that are prominent in the
literature and relevant for our study are highlighted. First, discourses
are conceived of as a shared meaning of phenomena[. [Global
environmental change]{.underline} ]{.mark}[in general and the role of
terrestrial carbon sinks in particular [are permeated by a struggle over
meaning and symbolic representation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In
line with Hajer [we understand [discourses]{.mark} as \"specific
ensembles of ideas, concepts and categorization that [are produced,
reproduced and transformed in ]{.mark}]{.underline}a
[[particular]{.underline}]{.mark} set of
[[practices]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"[3](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/global_environmental_politics/v006/6.1backstrand.html#FOOT3)
Secondly, [[the exercise of power is closely tied to the production of
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}, \[End Page 51\] [which in turn can
sustain a discourse]{.underline}. Hence, [[discourses are embedded in
power relations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [\"as historically variable [ways

[[Discourses as \"knowledge regimes\" bring us squarely to the role of
science. In expert-driven global environmental change research]{.mark}
especially]{.underline}, modern [[scientific knowledge]{.mark},
techniques, practices [and institutions enable the production and
maintenance of discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly, in line with
argumentative discourse analysis, we subscribe to a conception of
[[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[bridges the gap between the
linguistic]{.mark} aspects and [institutional dimensions of
policy-making]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this vein discourse analysis can
be brought to the forefront of the analysis of power and policy.
[[Policies are not neutral]{.mark} tools [but]{.mark} rather [a product
of discursive struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accordingly, [[policy
discourses favor certain descriptions of reality, empower certain actors
while marginalizing others]{.mark}. The concept of discourse
institutionalization is useful as it refers to the transformation of
discourse into institutional
phenomena]{.underline}.[5](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/global_environmental_politics/v006/6.1backstrand.html#FOOT5)
Fourthly, we align ourselves with a [discourse analysis]{.underline}
that [includes a notion of agency]{.underline}. [Recent studies have
advanced concepts such as \"discourse coalition\" and \"knowledge
broker\" to highlight how agents are embedded in
discourses]{.underline}.[6](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/global_environmental_politics/v006/6.1backstrand.html#FOOT6)
In this perspective, [[discourses are inconceivable without discoursing
subjects]{.mark} or agents [that interpret, articulate and reproduce
storylines congruent with certain discourses]{.mark}.]{.underline} We
use the concept of discursive agent and argue that [[political power
stems from the ability to articulate and set the term for the
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}.To conclude, we employ [a
discourse-analytic framework]{.underline} that [sheds light on how
discourses are deeply embedded in scientific practices and techniques,
institutionalized in global policy arenas and articulated by agents
spanning the public-private and local-global divide.]{.underline} In the
sections below we present each of the three discourses that arguably
underpin policy practice and academic debates of environmental
governance. They provide rough maps for understanding the discursive
framing of contemporary global environmental politics. However, as will
be demonstrated, each discourse is heterogeneous and thus in a constant
change and redefinition. Consequently, there are overlaps and conflicts
between the discourses when making sense of environmental governance.

Security, not liberty: the 'permanent emergency' of the security society

The US military's evident disdain for international law, indifference to
the pain of 'Others' and endless justifying of its actions via the
language of 'emergency' have prompted various authors to reflect on
Giorgio Agamben's work, in particular, on bare life and the state of
exception in accounting for the functioning of US sovereign power in the
contemporary world.111 Claudio [Minca]{.underline}, for example, has
used Agamben to attempt to [lay bare US military power in the spaces of
exception of the global war on terror;]{.underline} for Minca, "[it is
precisely the **absence of a theory of space** able]{.underline} [to
inscribe the **spatialisation of exception** that allows, today, such an
enormous, **unthinkable range of action** to sovereign
decision]{.underline}".112 [This]{.underline} critique
[speaks]{.underline} especially [to the **excessive sovereign
violence**]{.underline} [of our times]{.underline}, all [perpetrated in
the name of a]{.underline} global [war on terror]{.underline}.113
Minca's argument is that [geography]{.underline} as a discipline [has
failed to geo-graph and theorise the spatialization of the 'pure'
sovereign violence of **legitimated geopolitical action
overseas**]{.underline}. He uses the notion of the camp to outline the
spatial manifestation and endgame of a new global biopolitical 'nomos'
that has unprecedented power to except bare life.114

In the 'biopolitical nomos' of camps and prisons in the Middle East and
elsewhere, managing detainees is an important element of the US military
project. As CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid made clear to the
Senate Armed Services Committee in 2006, "an essential part of our
combat operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan entails the need to
detain enemy combatants and terrorists".115 [However, [it is a mistake
to characterize as 'exceptional' the]{.mark} US military's broader
biopolitical [project]{.mark} in the war on terror.]{.underline} Both
Minca's and Agamben's emphasis on the [notion of 'exception'
is]{.underline} most [convincing when elucidating how the US military
has dealt with the 'threat' of enemy combatants, rather than how it has
**planned for, legally securitized and enacted, its 'own' aggression
against them**]{.underline}. [[It does not account for]{.mark} the
**[proactive juridical warfare]{.mark}** of the US military in its
forward deployment [**throughout the globe**, which]{.mark} rigorously
[secures]{.mark} classified [SOFAs with]{.mark} host [nations and
protects]{.mark} its armed [personnel]{.mark} [from transfer to the
I]{.mark}nternational [C]{.mark}riminal [C]{.mark}ourt]{.underline}.
[[Far from]{.mark} designating a 'space of [exception', the US]{.mark}
does this to **[establish]{.mark} normative [parameters in its exercise
of legally sanctioned]{.mark} military [violence]{.mark} and [to
maximize]{.mark} its 'operational capacities of
[securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark}.

[A bigger question]{.underline}, of course, [is what the US military
practices of lawfare and juridical securitization say about our
contemporary moment]{.underline}. [Are they]{.underline} essentially
'[exceptional']{.underline} in character, prompted by the so-called
exceptional character of global terrorism today? Are they therefore
enacted in 'spaces of exceptions' or are they, in fact, simply
contemporary examples of Foucault's 'spaces of security' that are
neither exceptional nor indeed a departure from, or perversion of,
liberal democracy? As Mark Neocleous so aptly puts it, [has the "liberal
project of 'liberty'" not **always been**]{.underline}, in fact, [**a
"project of security**"]{.underline}?116 [This 'project of
[security']{.mark} has [long invoked]{.mark} a powerful political
dispositif of '**[executive powers']{.mark}**, typically registered [as
'**emergency** powers', but]{.mark},]{.underline} as [Neocleous makes
clear, **[of the permanent kind]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}117 For
Neocleous, the pursuit of '[[security']{.underline}]{.mark} -- and more
specifically 'capitalist security' -- [marked the]{.underline} very
[emergence of liberal democracies, and [continues to **frame**
our]{.mark} contemporary [world.]{.mark}]{.underline} In [the
West]{.underline} at least, that world may be [endlessly registered as a
liberal democracy defined by the **'rule of law'**]{.underline},
[but]{.underline}, as Neocleous reminds us, [[the assumption
that]{.mark} the [law, **decoupled from politics**, acts as the]{.mark}
ultimate [safeguard of democracy is]{.mark} **simply
[false]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- [a]{.underline} ]{.mark}[key [point
affirmed by]{.mark} considering the US military's extensive waging of
**[liberal lawfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As David Kennedy observes,
[[the military lawyer who "carries]{.mark} the briefcase of
[rules]{.mark}]{.underline} and restrictions" [[has]{.mark} long [been
replaced by the lawyer who "**participate\[s\] in**
]{.mark}**discussions of strategy and
[tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline}".118

The US military's [liberal lawfare reveals how **[the]{.mark} rule of
[law is]{.mark} simply [a]{.mark}nother securitization [tactic in
liberalism's 'pursuit of security']{.mark}**]{.underline}; [a pursuit
that paradoxically eliminates fundamental rights and freedoms in the
'name of security'.]{.underline}119 [This is a 'liberalism' [defined
by]{.mark}]{.underline} what Michael Dillon and Julian Reid see as [a
commitment to waging 'biopolitical war' for the securitization of life
-- '**[killing to make live']{.mark}**]{.underline}.120 And for Mark
Neocleous, [(neo)liberalism's [fetishization of 'security' -- **as both
a discourse and a technique of government**]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- has
[resulted in]{.mark} a world defined by **[anti-democratic
technologies]{.mark} of power**]{.underline}.121 [In the case of the US
military's forward deployment]{.underline} on the frontiers of the war
on terror [-- and its **juridical tactics to secure biopolitical power
thereat** -- this has been **made possible by constant reference to** a
neoliberal 'project of **security'** registered in a language of
'endless emergency' to 'secure' t]{.underline}he geopolitical and
geoeconomic goals of US [foreign policy]{.underline}.122 [[The]{.mark}
US [military's]{.mark}]{.underline} continuous and indeed
[[growing]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[footprint]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the Middle East and elsewhere [[can be read as a '**permanent
emergency'**]{.underline},]{.mark}123 the new 'normal' [[in
which]{.mark} geopolitical military **[interventionism]{.mark}** and its
concomitant biopolitical technologies of power [are necessitated by the
**perennial**]{.mark}]{.underline} political economic ['**[need' to
securitize volatility]{.mark} and threat**.]{.underline}

Conclusion: enabling biopolitical power in the age of securitization

"Law and force flow into one another. We make war in the shadow of law,
and law in the shadow of force" -- David Kennedy, Of War and Law 124

[Can a focus on lawfare and biopolitics help us to **critique our
contemporary moment's proliferation of practices of
securitization**]{.underline} -- practices that appear to be primarily
concerned with coding, quantifying, governing and anticipating life
itself? **[In the context of US military's war on terror]{.underline}**,
I have argued above that **[it can]{.underline}**. If, as David Kennedy
points out, the "emergence of a global economic and commercial order has
amplified the role of background legal regulations as the strategic
terrain for transnational activities of all sorts", this also includes,
of course, 'warfare'; and for some time, [the US military has recognized
the "opportunities for creative strategy" made possible by **proactively
waging lawfare beyond the battlefield**]{.underline}.125 As Walter
Benjamin observed nearly a century ago, **[[at the very heart of
military violence is a "lawmaking character".]{.underline}]{.mark}**126
And [it is this '[lawmaking]{.mark} character' that [is **integral**
to]{.mark} the biopolitical technologies of power that [secure US
geopolitics]{.mark} in our contemporary moment]{.underline}. [US
[lawfare **focuses**]{.mark} **"the [attention]{.mark} of the world [on
this or that excess]{.mark}**[" whilst]{.mark} simultaneously **[arming
"the most heinous human suffering in legal privilege", redefining
horrific violence]{.mark}** as "collateral damage, **self-defense,
proportionality, or necessity**"]{.underline}.127 [It involves [a
**mobilization of the** law]{.mark} that is precisely [channelled
towards "**evasion**]{.mark}]{.underline}", securing 23 classified
Status of Forces Agreements [and "offering]{.underline} at once [the
experience of **safe ethical distance** and careful pragmatic
assessment]{.underline}, [[while **parcelling out
responsibility**]{.mark}**, attributing it, denying it -- [even
sometimes embracing it -- as a tactic of]{.mark} statecraft and
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}".128

Since the inception of the war on terror, [the US military has waged
incessant lawfare to **legally securitize, regulate and empower its
'operational capacities'**]{.underline} in its multiples 'spaces of
security' [across the globe]{.underline} -- whether that be at a US base
in the Kyrgyz Republic or in combat in Iraq. I have sought to highlight
here these tactics by demonstrating how the execution of [US geopolitics
relies upon a proactive legal-biopolitical securitization of US troops
at the frontiers of the American 'leasehold empire'.]{.underline} For
the US military, [[legal]{.mark}-biopolitical [apparatuses of
security]{.mark} enable its geopolitical]{.underline} and geoeconomic
[projects of security on the ground; **they plan for and [legally
condition]{.mark} the 'milieux' of military commanders**]{.underline};
[[and]{.mark} in so doing they **[render operational]{.mark}
the**]{.underline} pivotal **[spaces of [overseas intervention]{.mark}
of contemporary US national security]{.underline}** conceived [in terms
of '**global governmentality'**]{.underline}.129 [In the]{.underline} US
global [war on terror, it is lawfare that facilitates]{.underline} what
Foucault calls the "[biopolitics of security]{.underline}" -- when life
itself becomes the "object of security".130 [For the US military, this
involves the **eliminating of threats to 'life',** the creating of
operational capabilities to 'make live' and the anticipating and
**management of life's uncertain 'future'**.]{.underline}

Some of the most key contributions across the social sciences and
humanities in recent years have divulged how [[discourses of
'security',]{.mark} 'precarity' and 'risk']{.underline} [**[function
centrally in]{.mark} the [governing dispositifs]{.mark}** of our
contemporary world]{.underline}.131 [In a society of (in)security, such
**[discourses have]{.mark} a [profound power]{.mark}** [to invoke danger
as "requiring **extraordinary action**".]{.mark}]{.underline}132 In the
ongoing war on terror, registers of emergency play pivotal roles in the
justification of military securitization strategies, where '[risk', it
seems, has become permanently binded to 'securitization']{.underline}.
As Claudia Aradau and Rens Van Munster point out, **[the "perspective of
[risk management" seductively effects]{.mark} practices of [military
securitization to be seen as necessary]{.mark}, legitimate and indeed
therapeutic]{.underline}**.133 [US tactics of liberal lawfare in the
long war -- the conditioning of the battlefield, the
sanctioning]{.underline} of the privilege [of violence, the regulating
of the conduct of troops, the **interpreting, negating and
utilizing**]{.underline} 24 of **[international law]{.underline}**, and
the securing of SOFAs -- [are vital security dispositifs of a broader
'risk- securitization' strategy involving the deployment of liberal
technologies of biopower to "manage dangerous irruptions in the
future]{.underline}".134 [It may well be fought beyond the battlefield
in "a war of the pentagon rather than a war of the
spear",]{.underline}135 **[but it is [lawfare]{.mark} that [ultimately
enables the 'toxic combination' of US geopolitics and biopolitics
defining]{.mark} the current age of
[securitization.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### The impact is massive structural violence as a majority of the globe is reduced to bare life\-\--the war on terror represents an extension of necropolitical impulse of colonialism\-\--investigating the historical constitution of war via asymmetrical power relations is necessary to solve endless violence

¶ The Necropolitics of Global Civil War¶ As with other civil wars,
global civil war affects society as a whole. It \"tends,\" as Hardt and
Negri argue, \"towards the absolute\" (2004, 18) in that it polices
civil society through elaborate security and surveillance systems,
negates the rule of law, militarizes quotidian space, diminishes civil
rights to the degree in which it increases torture, illegal
incarceration, disappearances, and emergency regulations, and fosters a
culture of fear, intolerance, and violent discrimination. Hardt and
Negri, therefore, rightly argue that [[war]{.underline}]{.mark} itself
[[has become \"a permanent]{.mark} social
[relation]{.mark}]{.underline}\" and thereby the \"primary organizing
principle of society, and politics merely one of its means or guises\"
(ibid., 12). What Hardt and Negri suggest is new about today\'s global
civil war is its biopolitical agenda. \"War,\" they write, \"has become
a regime of biopower, that is, a form of rule aimed not only at
controlling the population but producing and reproducing all aspects of
social life\" (ibid., 13). For example, the biopolitics of war entails
the production of particular economic and cultural subjectivities,
\"creating new hearts and minds through the construction of new circuits
of communication, new forms of social collaboration, and new modes of
interaction\" (ibid., 81). The ambiguity of Hardt and Negri\'s notion of
biopower subtly resides in their adaptation of the language of social
and political revolution, for it seems to be the regime of biopower,
rather than the multitude, that absorbs and transvalues the
revolutionary, that is, anti-colonial, spirit inscribed in the rhetoric
of \"new hearts and minds.\" At the same time, they argue, that a
biopolitical definition of war \"changes war\'s entire legal framework\"
(ibid., 21-22), for \"whereas war previously was regulated through legal
structures, war has become regulating by constructing and imposing its
own legal framework\" (ibid. 22). If none of this, at least in my mind,
is marked by a particular originality of thought, then this may have to
do with Hardt and Negri\'s reluctance to address the historical
continuities between earlier wars of decolonization and contemporary
global wars, the legacies of imperialism, and the imperative of race in
orchestrating imperial, neo-colonial, and today\'s global civil wars. ¶
In fact, while biopolitical global warfare might be a new phenomenon on
the sovereign territory of the United States of America, specifically
after 11 September 2001, it is hardly news to \"[people in the former
colonies]{.underline}, who,\" as Crystal Bartolovich points out, \"[have
long lived]{.underline} ???[at the]{.underline} [\'crossroads\'
of]{.underline} global forces\" (2000, 136), violence, and
[wars]{.underline}. For example, in Sri Lanka global civil war has been
a permanent, everyday reality since the country\'s Sinhala Only Movement
in 1956, and become manifest in the normalization of racialized violence
as a means of politics since President Jayawardene\'s election campaign
for a referendum in 1982, which led to the state-endorsed anti-Tamil
pogrom in 1983. Similarly, according to Achille Mbembe, biopolitical
warfare was intrinsic to the European imperial project in \"Africa,\"
where \"war machines emerged\" as early as \"the last quarter of the
twentieth century\" (2003, 33). In other words, although Hardt and Negri
argue convincingly that it is the ubiquity of global war that
restructures social relationships on the global and local level, their
concept tends to dehistoricize different genealogies and effects of
global civil war. Indeed, not only do Hardt and Negri refrain from
reading wars of decolonization as central to the construction of what
David Harvey sees as the uneven \"spatial exchange relations\" (2003,
31) necessary for the expansion of capital accumulation and of which
global war is an intrinsic feature, but they also dissociate global
civil wars from the nation-state\'s still thriving ability to implement
and exercise rigorous regimes of violence and surveillance. As for the
term\'s epistemological formation, global civil war has been sanitized
and no longer evokes the conventional association of civil war with
\"insurrection and resistance\" (Agamben 2005, 2). Instead, it has
become the effect of a diffuse new sovereignty (i.e., Hardt and Negri\'s
Empire), a sovereignty that no longer decides over but has itself become
a disembodied, that is, denationalized and normalized, state of
exception. Yet, to talk about the disembodiment of global war not only
reinforces media-supported ideologies of high-tech precision wars
without casualties, but it also represses narratives about the ways in
which the modi operandi of global war come to be embodied differently in
different sites of war.¶ In her short story \"Man Without a Mask\"
(1995), the Sri Lankan writer Jean Arasanayagam describes the global
dimensions of a war that is usually considered an ethnic civil war
restricted to internally competing claims to territorial, cultural, and
national sovereignty between the country\'s Sinhalese and Tamil
population. Told by an elite mercenary who clandestinely works for the
ruling members of the government and leads a group of highly trained
assassins, the story follows the thoughts of its narrator and
contemplates the politicization of violence and death. As a mercenary
and possibly an ex-SAS (British Special Air Service) veteran the Sri
Lankan Government hired after the failure of the Indo-Lankan Accord, the
narrator signifies the \"privatization of \[Sri Lanka\'s\] war\"
(Tambiah 1996, 6) and, thus, the reign of a global free market economy
through which the state hands over its institutions and services to
private corporations, including its army, and profits from the
unrestricted global and illegal trade in war technologies. Like a
craftsman, the mercenary finds satisfaction in the precision and
methodical cleanliness of his work, in being, as he says, \"a hunter.
Not a predator\" in his ability to leave \"morality\" out of \"this
business\" (Arasanayagam 1995, 98). He is an extreme and perverted
version of what Martin Shaw describes as the \"
\'soldier-scholar,\'???the archetype of the new \[global\] officer\"
(1999, 60). As a self-proclaimed \"scholar or scribe\" (ibid., 100), the
mercenary plots maps of death. Shortly before he reaches his victim, a
politician who underestimated the political ambition of his enemy, he
comments that bullet holes in a human body comprise a new kind of
language: \"The machine gun splutters. The body is pitted, pricked out
with an indecipherable message. They are the braille marks of the new
fictions. People are still so slow to comprehend their meaning\" (ibid.,
100). These new maps or fictions of global war, I suggest, describe what
Etienne Balibar calls ultra-objective and ultra-subjective violence and
characterize how global civil war both generates bare life and manages
and instrumentalizes death.¶ According to Balibar, [ultra-objective
violence suggests the systematic \"naturalization of asymmetrical
relations of power]{.underline}\" (2001, 27) brought about, for
instance, by the Sri Lankan government\'s prolonged abuse of the
Prevention of Terrorism Act, which, in the past plunged the country into
a permanent state of emergency, facilitated the random arrest of and
almost absolute rule over citizens, and thus created a culture of fear
and a reversal of moral and social values. As the story clarifies, under
conditions of systematic or ultra-objective violence, \"corruption\"
becomes \"virtue\" and \"the most vile\" man wears the mask of the sage
and \"innocent householder\" (Arasanayagam 1995, 102). In this milieu,
the mercenary has no need for a mask, because he bears a face of
ordinary violence that is \"perfectly safe\" (ibid., 102) in a society
structured by habitual and systemic violence. [But the logic of the
\"new fictions\" of political violence is also ultra-subjective because
it]{.underline} is \"intentional\" and [has a \"determinate
goal]{.underline}\" (Balibar 2001, 25), namely [the making and
elimination of]{.underline} what Balibar calls \"[disposable
people]{.underline}\" in order [to generate and maintain a profitable
global economy of violence.]{.underline} The logic of ultra-subjective
violence presents itself through the fictions of ethnicity and identity
as they are advanced and instrumentalized in the name of national
sovereignty. The mercenary perfectly symbolizes what Balibar means when
he writes that \"we have entered a world of the banality of objective
cruelty\" (ibid.). For if the fictions of global violence are scratched
into the tortured bodies of war victims, the mercenary\'s detached
behavior dramatizes a \"will to \'de-corporation\',\" that is, to force
disaffiliation from the other and from oneself ??? not just from
belonging to the community and the political unity, but from the human
condition\" (ibid.). In other words, [[while]{.underline}]{.mark}
[global civil [war becomes embodied in those whom it **negates as social
beings**]{.mark}]{.underline} and thereby reduces to mere \"flesh,\"
[[it remains]{.mark} a [disembodied]{.mark} enterprise [for those
who]{.mark}]{.underline} manage and [[orchestrate]{.mark} the
[politics]{.mark} of death of global war. [It is through]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [dialectics of the embodiment and]{.underline}
[[**disembodiment** of]{.mark} global violence [that the
**dehumanization of the majority of the globe\'s population** takes on
a]{.mark} normative and [naturalized state]{.mark} of
existence.¶]{.underline} Arasanayagam\'s short story also casts light on
the limitations of Hardt and Negri\'s understanding of the biopolitics
of global civil war, for the latter can account neither for the new
fictions of violence in former colonial spaces nor for what Mbembe calls
the \"necropolitics\" (2003, 11) of late modernity. Mbembe\'s term
refers to his analysis of global warfare as the continuation of earlier
and the development of new \"forms of subjugation of life to the power
of death\" and its attendant reconfiguration of the \"the relationship
between resistance, sacrifice, and terror\" (2003, 39). 4 Despite the
many theoretical intersections of Hardt and Negri\'s and Mbembe\'s work,
Mbembe\'s notion of [necropolitics sees contemporary warfare as a
species of]{.underline} such [earlier]{.underline} \"[topographies of
cruelty]{.underline}\" (2003, 40) [as the]{.underline} plantation system
and [the colony]{.underline}. Thus, in contrast to Hardt and Negri,
Mbembe argues that [the ways in which global violence and warfare
produce subjectivities cannot be dissociated from the ways in which race
serves as a means]{.underline} of both deciding over life and death and
[of legitimizing and making killing without impunity a customary
practice of imperial population control.]{.underline} If global civil
war is a continuation of imperial forms of warfare, it must rely on
strategies of embodiment, that is, of politicizing and racializing the
colonized or now \"disposable\" body for purposes of
self-legitimization, specifically when taking decisions over the value
of human life. After all, on a global level, [race propels the
ideological dynamics of ethnic and global civil war, while, on the local
plane, it serves to orchestrate the brutalization and polarization of
the domestic population, reinforcing and enacting patterns of racist
exclusion and violence on the non-white body]{.underline}. In contrast
to Hardt and Negri, then, Mbembe invites us to articulate imperial
genealogies for the necropolitics of today\'s global civil wars.¶ In
other words, if imperialism was a form of perpetual low-intensity global
war, the biopolitics of imperialism aimed at creating different forms of
subjectivization. For example, while in India, the imperial
administration sought to create a functional class of native informants,
in Africa and the Caribbean, the British Empire created the figure of
homo sacer. The latter, as Agamben argues, refers to the one who can be
killed but not sacrificed. Homo sacer, Agamben clarifies, constitutes
\"the originary exception in which human life is included in the
political order in being exposed to an unconditional capacity to be
killed\" (1998, 85). Thus, the native is included in the imperial order
only through her exclusion, while, simultaneously her humanity is
stripped of social life and transformed into bare life, ready to be
commodified on slavery\'s auction blocs and foreclosed from the dominant
imperial psyche. Agamben\'s understanding of bare life derives from his
reading of the Nazi death camps as the paradigmatic space of modernity
in which the distinction between \"fact and law\" (ibid., 171),
\"outside and inside, exception and rule, licit and illicit\" (ibid.,
170) dissolves and in which biopolitics takes the place of politics and
\"homo sacer\" replaces the \"citizen\" (ibid., 171). While the notion
of bare life is instrumental for theorizing biopolitics and the
normalization and legalization of state violence under the pretense of,
for example, protective arrests and preemptive strikes, it also suggests
that the human body can be read as pure matter or in empirical terms.
What goes unnoticed is to what extent the production of bare life
depends on ideologies of race, that is, on the racialization of bodies,
citizenship, and the concept of the human. For instance, under imperial
rule, bare life is subjected to death and its politics in ways slightly
different from those suggested by Agamben. More specifically, the
killing of natives or slaves as bare life ??? then and today, as
Rwanda\'s race-based genocide clarifies ??? not only configures human
life in terms of its \"capacity to be killed\" (Agamben 1998, 114), that
is as homicide and genocide outside of law and accountability, but also
measures the value of human life on grounds of race. **[The
[making]{.mark} of [bare life is a]{.mark} racialized and [racializing
process rooted within the necropolitics of
colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For, killing the native or slave
presupposes the remaking of the human into bare life both through
ideologies of pseudo-scientific racism and by subjecting them to what
Orlando Patterson calls the \"social death\" (1982, 38) of the slave,
that is, to a symbolic death of the human as a communal and social being
that precedes physical death. 5 Thus, imperialism\'s necropolitics
involves the making of disposable lives through practices of
zombification and the \"redefinition of death\" itself (Agamben 1998,
161). In this sense, imperialism not only facilitated the extreme forms
of racialized violence characteristic of global civil war, but it also
helped create the conditions for making bare life the acceptable state
of being for the present majority of the globe\'s population.¶ Not
unlike Jean Arasanayagam\'s short story, Mbembe\'s account of the
Rwandan genocide and the Palestinian intifada suggests that the new
global subjectivities are not so much the networked multitude Hardt and
Negri imagine. Rather, emerging from the \"new fictions\" of global war,
they are the suicide bomber, the mercenary, the martyr, the child
soldier, the victim of mass rape, the refugee, the woman dispossessed of
her family and livelihood, the mutilated civilian, and the skeleton of
the disappeared and murdered victims of global civil war. What these
subjectivities witness is that, on one hand, living under conditions of
global civil war means to live in \"permanent???pain\" (Mbembe 2003, 39)
and, on the other hand, they refer back to the dialectical mechanisms of
colonial violence. For under the Manichaean pressures of colonialism,
colonial violence always inaugurates a double process of subjection and
subject formation. Frantz Fanon famously argues that anti-colonial
violence operates historically on both collective and individual subject
formation. For, on the one hand, \"the native discovers reality
\[colonial alienation\] and transforms it into the pattern of this
customs, into the practice of violence and into his plan for freedom\"
(1963, 58), and on the other, a violent \"war of liberation\" instills
in the individual a sense of \"a collective history\" (ibid., 93). Thus,
as Robert Young suggests, anti-colonial violence \"functions as a kind
of psychotherapy of the oppressed\" (2001, 295). Yet, it seems that read
through the necropolitics of imperialism, global civil warfare no longer
aims at the \"pacification\" of the colonial subject or the
\"degradation\" of the \"postcolonial subject\" (ibid., 293) but, as I
suggested earlier, at the complete abolishment of the human per se. We
may therefore say that if global civil war produces new subjectivities,
it does so through, what I have referred to as a process of
zombification. Understood as sustained acts of negation, zombification
??? a term that harks back to Fanon ??? refers to a dialectical process
of the embodiment and disembodiment of global war. The former refers to
the exercise of ultra-objective violence ??? that is, the systematic
\"naturalization of asymmetrical relations of power\" (Balibar 2001, 27)
??? in order to regulate, racialize, and extinguish human life at will,
while the latter suggests the production of narratives of
\"de-corporation\" (ibid., 25) and detachment by those who manage and
administrate global civil war. The notion of zombification, however,
connotes not only the exercise of, but also the exorcism of, the ways in
which global war is scripted on and through the racialized body. Thus, a
post-colonial understanding of global war needs to think through the
necropolitics of war, including the uneven value historically and
presently assigned to human life and the politicization of death. The
latter issue will be addressed in the last section of this paper. The
next section examines the cultural production and perpetuation of
normative narratives of global warfare.¶ The Rhetoric of the Archaic and
Michael Ondaatje\'s \"Anil\'s Ghost\"¶ Published shortly after Sri
Lanka\'s civil war became entangled with the global politics of the
South and the rise of the Sri Lankan nation-state to one of the war\'s
principal and most corrupt actors, Ondaatje\'s novel Anil\'s Ghost
dramatizes both the transformation of the country\'s civil war into a
permanent state of exception and the failure of global non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to intervene in the war\'s rising human rights
abuses and violent excesses. While the novel presents an extraordinary
search for social justice through narrative and seeks to understand the
operative modes of violence beyond their historical and social
configurations, it also tends to sublimate and aestheticize violence by
treating it as a normative element of human and, indeed, planetary life.
My purpose here is to indicate that the novel\'s own project of
dramatizing the complicity between religious and secular, anti-colonial
and nationalist agents of war, and civilians and global actors (i.e.,
NGOs) remains compromised by the novel\'s aesthetic investment in a
particular rhetoric of the archaic. The latter, I argue, unwittingly
coincides with normative narratives of global war and facilitates the
reader\'s detachment from the ways in which the Global North has
reconstructed global life as a permanent state of exception.¶
Ondaatje\'s novel (2000) opens with an Author\'s Note that locates the
narrative at a time when \"the antigovernment insurgents in the south
and the separatist guerrillas in the north???had declared war on the
government\" and \"legal and illegal government squads were???sent out
to hunt down\" both groups. In this instance, the Hobbesian rhetoric of
a \"war of all against all\" is more than a clich??. In fact, it is
symptomatic of the novel\'s ambiguous critique of the role of the Sri
Lankan nation-state and its elaborate, modernist discourse of violence.
The Note foreshadows what the narrator later repeats on several
occasions, namely that Sri Lanka\'s war is a war fought \"for the
purpose of war\" (ibid., 98) and for which \"\[t\]here is no hope of
affixing blame\" (ibid., 17). In short, the \"reason for war was war\"
(ibid., 43). At first glance, the narrative\'s emphasis on the war\'s
self-perpetuating dynamics implies a Hobbesian understanding of violence
as the natural state of human existence. At the same time, it translates
the actual politics of Sri Lanka\'s war into the Deleuzean idiom of the
\"war machine.\" For, according to Deleuze and Guattari, armed conflict
functions outside the control and accountability of the \"state
apparatus???prior to its laws\" (1987, 352), and beyond its initial
causes. Although such an interpretation of Sri Lanka\'s war reflects
what the political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda calls the
\"intractability of the Sri Lankan crisis\" (1999, 158), its political
and ethical stakes outweigh its gains. 6¶ To begin with, the novel\'s
leitmotif of \"perpetual war\" situates Sri Lanka\'s conflict within a
general context of global war, because, as the narrator reports, it is
fought with \"modern weaponry,\" supported by \"backers on the sidelines
in safe countries,\" and \"sponsored by gun-and drug-runners\" (Ondaajte
2000, 43). In this scenario, the rule of law has deteriorated into \"a
belief in???revenge\" (ibid., 56), and the state is either absent or
part of the country\'s all-consuming anarchy of violence. This absence
suggests that the state no longer functions, in Max Weber\'s famous
words, as \"a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of
the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory\" (2002,
13). It is of course possible to argue that the novel\'s critique of the
Sri Lankan nation-state lies in its absence. It seems to me, however,
that [[the]{.mark} narrative\'s [tendency to locate]{.mark}]{.underline}
the dynamics of Sri Lanka\'s [[war outside the state]{.mark} and within
a post-national vision of a new global order **[generates a normative
narrative of global war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[On the one hand, it
resonates with the]{.mark}]{.underline} popular ??? though
[[misleading]{.underline}]{.mark} ??? [[notion]{.underline}]{.mark} that
the \"appearance [[of]{.mark} \'failed states\']{.underline},\" as
Samuel Huntington argues in his controversial study The Clash of
Civilizations, intensifies \"tribal, ethnic, and religious conflict\"
[and thus \"contributes to \[the\] image of [a world in
anarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (1996, 35). [[On the other,
situating]{.mark} Sri Lanka\'s [war outside]{.mark} the
[institutions]{.mark} of the state [re-inscribes a]{.mark} Hobbesian
[notion of violence that helps]{.mark} **legitimize and [cultivate
structural violence]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} a [permissive]{.mark} way of
conducting politics]{.underline}. Such a reading of violence, however,
overlooks that in a global context violence has become \"profoundly
anti-Hobbesian\" (Balibar 2001, xi). Balibar usefully suggests that [the
twentieth century history of extreme violence has made it impossible to
regard violence as \"a structural condition that precedes
institutions.\"]{.underline} Instead, he maintains, \"we have had to
accept???that extreme **[[violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is not
post-historical but actually post-institutional.\" It \"**[arises from
institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} as much as it arises against them\"
(ibid., xi). Thus, in such popular post-colonial narratives of war as
Anil\'s Ghost, [the normalization of violence figures as a forgetting of
the institutional entrenchment and historical use of violence as a
state-sanctioned political practice]{.underline}.¶ If Ondaatje\'s novel
presents Sri Lanka\'s war as an \"inherently violent\" event (Das 1998),
it is also an event narrated through the symbolism and logic of archaic
primitivism. For example, in the novel\'s central passage on the nature
of human violence, the narrator observes, \"The most precisely recorded
moments of history lay adjacent to the extreme actions of nature or
civilisation ???Tectonic slips and brutal human violence provided random
time-capsules of unhistorical lives???A dog in Pompeii. A gardener in
Hiroshima\" (Ondaatje 2002, 55). [The symbolic leveling of]{.underline}
the arbitrariness of primordial chaos and [the apparently **ahistorical
anarchism of violence** create a rhetoric]{.underline} of the archaic
that is characteristic, as Nancy argues, of \"anything that is properly
to be called war\" (2000, 128). He convincingly argues that archaic
symbolism \"indicates [that \[war\] escapes from being part of
\'history\' understood as]{.underline} the progress of a linear/or
**[cumulative time\"]{.underline}** **[and can be rearticulated as no
more than a \"regrettable\" remnant of an earlier age]{.underline}**
(ibid., 128). In that, Nancy\'s observation coincides with Hardt and
Negri\'s that [[the \"war on terror\"]{.mark} employs a medievalist
[rhetoric of just and unjust wars]{.mark} that [**moralizes**]{.mark}
rather than legitimizes the use of [global violence]{.mark} by putting
it outside the realm of reason and critique]{.underline}. In Nancy\'s
observation, however, two things are at stake. First, what initially
appears to be a postmodern critique of the grand narratives of history
in fact demonstrates that a non-linear account of history may lend
itself to the transformation of extreme violence into exceptional
events. In this way **[[violence is normalized as a]{.mark}
transhistorical [category that fails to address the unequal]{.mark}
political and economic [relations of power, which lie at the heart of
global wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}¶ Second, Nancy rightly
warns us against treating war as an archaic relic that is
\"tendentiously effaced in the progress and project of a global
humanity\" (2000, 128). For not only does war return in the process of
negotiating sovereignty on a global and local plane, but the
representation of war in terms of archaic images also repeats a
primordialist explanation of what are structurally new wars. As
theorists such as Appadurai and Kaldor have argued, the primordialist
hypothesis of global wars merely reinforces those mass mediated images
of global violence that dramatize ethnic wars as pre-modern, tribalist
forms of strife. Huntington\'s notion of civilization or \"fault-line\"
wars as communal conflicts born out of the break-up of earlier political
formations, demographic changes, and the collision of mutually exclusive
religions and civilizations presents the most prominent and politically
influential version of a primordialist and bipolar conceptualization of
global war. In contrast to Huntington\'s approach, however, the
narrative of Anil\'s Ghost contends that all forms of violence \"have
come into their comparison\" (Ondaatje 2000, 203). Notwithstanding its
universalizing impetus, [the novel]{.underline} thus [insists on the
impossibility to think the nation and a new global order outside the
technologies of violence and modernity]{.underline}. Indeed, in the
novel\'s narrative [it is the suffering of all war victims that \"has
come into their comparison\" and]{.underline} suggests that the **[new
wars breed a culture of violence that shapes everyone\'s life yet for
which no one appears to be accountable.]{.underline}** On the one hand,
then, the novel\'s self-critical humanitarian project seeks to initiate
a communal and individual process of mourning by naming, and therefore
accounting for, in Anil\'s words, \"the unhistorical dead\" (ibid, 56).
On the other hand, read as its critical investment in the war\'s
politics of complicity, the novel\'s humanitarian endeavor is countered
by the narrator\'s tendency to articulate violence in archaic and
anarchistic terms. For, to revert to the symbolic language of
\"primitivism and anarchy\" and \"to treat \[the new wars\] as natural
disasters,\" as Kaldor observes (2001, 113), designates a common way of
dealing with them. Thus **[[the rhetoric]{.mark} of the archaic not
merely dehistoricizes violence but [contributes to
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** making of a
**[[normative]{.underline}]{.mark}** and popular **[[imaginary through
which to make global wars thinkable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
comprehensible. Thus, [their [violent excesses appear]{.mark} to be
[rooted in primordialist]{.mark} constructions]{.underline} [of the
failed]{.underline} post-colonial nation-[[state]{.underline} **[rather
than]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a phenomenon with [deep]{.mark}-seated
[roots in the global histories]{.mark} of the present]{.underline}**[.
**[Such a normative imaginary of global war is produced for
the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Global [North]{.mark} so as [to
dehistoricize its]{.mark} own [position]{.mark} in the various colonial
processes of nation formation and global economic restructuring of the
Global South.]{.underline}** In this way, as Ondaatje\'s novel equally
demonstrates, [the]{.underline} Global [North can detach
itself]{.underline} from the Global South [and create the]{.underline}
kind of **[historical]{.underline}** and cultural
**[distance]{.underline}** **[needed to accept ultra-objective violence
as a normative state of existence.]{.underline}**¶ Conceptualizing war
as a phenomenon of criminal and anarchistic violence, however, may do
more than merely conform to the popular imagination about the chaotic
and untamable nature of contemporary warfare. Indeed, anarchistic
notions of violence tend to compress the grand narratives and petite
recits of history into a total, singular present of perpetual
uncertainty, fear, and political confusion and generate what the
post-colonial anthropologist David Scott sees as Sri Lanka\'s
\"dehistoricized\" history. Given the important role the claiming of
ancient Sinhalese and Hindu history played in the violent identity
politics that drive Sri Lanka\'s war, Scott suggests that devaluing or
dehistoricizing history as a founding category of Sri Lanka\'s narrative
of the nation breaks the presumably \"natural???link between past
identities and the legitimacy of present political claims\" (1999, 103).
This strategy seems useful because it uncouples Sri Lanka\'s colonially
shaped and glorified Sinhalese past from its present claims to political
power. We need to note, however, that, according to Scott,
dehistoricizing the past does not suggest writing from a historical
vacuum. Rather, it refers to a process of denaturalizing and, thus,
de-legitimizing the normative narratives of ethnicized and racialized
narratives of national identity.¶ Anil\'s Ghost engages in this process
of \"[dehistoricizing]{.underline}\" by foregrounding the fictitious and
fragmented, the elusive and ephemeral character of
[history]{.underline}. Indeed, as the historian Antoinette Burton
suggests, the novel [offers \"a reflection on **the continued
possibility of History itself as an exclusively western epistemological
form**]{.underline}\" (2003, 40). The latter clearly finds expression in
what Sarath\'s brother, Gamini, condemns as \"the last two hundred years
of Western political writing\" (Ondaatje 2000, 285). Steeped in the
imperial project of the West, such writing is facilitated by and serves
to erase the figure of the non-European cultural Other in order to
produce and maintain what Jacques Derrida famously called the \"[white
mythology]{.underline}\" (1982, 207) of Western metaphysics. The novel
usefully [extends]{.underline} its reading of [violence
into]{.underline} a related critique of [[knowledge
production]{.underline},]{.mark} **[so that the latter
[becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}** legible as being **[[complicit
in]{.mark} the production of [perpetual violence]{.mark} and
war]{.underline}**. This critique is perhaps most articulated through
the character of Palipana, Sarath\'s teacher and Sri Lanka\'s formerly
renowned but now fallen anthropologist. Once an agent of Sri Lanka\'s
anti-colonial liberation movement, Palipana represents the generation of
cultural nationalist who sought history and national identity in an
essentially Sinhalese culture and natural environment. Rather than
employing empirical and colonial methods of knowledge production and
historiography, Palipana had left the path of scientific objectivity,
tinkered with translations of historical texts, and \"approached
runes???with the pragmatic awareness of locally inherited skills\"
(Ondaatje 2000, 82) until \"the unprovable truth emerged\" (ibid., 83).
Now, years after his fall from scientific grace, Palipana lives the life
of an ascetic, following the \"strict principles of\" a \"sixth-century
sect of monks\" (ibid., 84). To him, history and nature have become one,
for \"all history was filled with sunlight, every hollow was filled with
rain\" (ibid., 84). Yet, Ondaatje\'s construction of Palipana and his
account of the eye-painting ritual of a Buddha statue ??? a ritual that
assumes a central place in the novel\'s cosmopolitan vision of
artisanship as a practice of cultural and religious syncretism in the
service of post-conflict community building ??? are themselves built on
a number of historical texts listed in the novel\'s \"Acknowledgment\"
section. As Antoinette Burton astutely observes, \"the orientalism of
some of the texts on Ondaatje\'s list is astonishing, a phenomenon which
suggests the ongoing suppleness of \'history\' as an instrument of
political critique and ideological intervention\" (2003, 50). Rather
than effectively \"dehistorizing\" the character of Palipana, then,
Ondaatje bases this character and the eye-painting ceremony on a central
Sri Lankan modernist text, Ananada K. Coomaraswamy\'s Mediaeval
Sinhalese Art (1908/1956).¶ Cont ¶ For Hardt and Negri, then, the state
of exception functions as the universal condition and legitimization of
global civil war, while positioning the United States as a global power,
which transforms war \"into the primary organizing principle of
society\" (2004, 12). They rightly observe that **[the state of
exception blurs the boundaries between peace and war, violence and
mediation]{.underline}**. Yet, curiously enough, Hardt and Negri\'s
understanding of the state of exception largely emphasizes the
concept\'s regulatory and pragmatic politics, so that the United States
emerges as a sovereign power on grounds of its ability to decide on the
state of exception. By exempting itself from international law and
courts of law, protecting its military from being subjected to
international control, allowing preemptive strikes, and engaging in
torture and illegal detention (ibid., 8), the United States
instrumentalizes and maintains war as a state of exception in the name
of global security and thus seeks to consolidate its hegemonic role
within Empire. Although Hardt and Negri openly disagree with Agamben\'s
reading of the state of exception as defining \"power itself as a
\'monopoly of violence\' \" (2004, 364), it seems to me that Agamben\'s
theory of the state of exception, as put forward in Homo Sacer rather
than in States of Exception, might be usefully read alongside Hardt and
Negri\'s crucial claim that global civil war as well as resistance
movements depend on the \"production of subjectivity\" through
immaterial labour (2000, 66). What this argument overlooks is that,
according to Agamben, the state of exception constitutes an abject space
or \"a zone of indistinction between outside and inside, exclusion and
inclusion\" (1998, 181), where subjectivity enters a political and legal
order solely on grounds of its exclusion. Moreover, the sovereign ???
albeit a nation, sovereign power, or global network of power ??? can
only transform the rule of law into the force of law by suspending the
legal system from a position that is simultaneously inside and outside
the law. Through these mechanisms of exclusion and contradiction,
subjectivity is not so much created as it is deprived of its social and
political relationships. Thus [the \"originary activity\" of global
civil war is the violent conflation of political and social relationship
and thereby the \"production of bare life\"]{.underline} (ibid., 83),
[of life that need not be accounted for]{.underline}, [as is the case
with the civilian casualties]{.underline} of the US-led war against
Iraq. The state of exception, however, also figures as a prominent
concept in post-colonial theory, for it raises questions not only about
the ways in which we configure the human but also how we understand
imperial or global war. ¶ In 1940, Benjamin famously wrote, \"[the
tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the \'state of
emergency\']{.underline} in which we live [is not the exception but the
rule. **We must attain to a conception of history that is in keeping
with this insight**]{.underline}\" (1968, 257). Benjamin\'s statement,
as Homi Bhabha reminds us half a century later in his essay
\"Interrogating Identity,\" can be usefully advanced for a critical
analysis of the dialectical ??? if not revolutionary ??? relationship
between oppression, violence, and anti-colonial historiography. Indeed,
\"the state of emergency,\" as Bhabha says, \"is also always a state of
emergence\" (1994, 41). Read in the context of today\'s global state of
exception, namely the recurrence and intensification of ethnic civil
wars across the globe and the coincidence of democratic and totalitarian
forms of political rule, Bhabha\'s statement entails a number of risks
and suggestions for a post-colonial historiography of global civil war.¶
First, Bhabha\'s notion of emergency/emergence reflects his critical
reading of Fanon\'s vision of national identity and thus reconsiders the
state of emergency as a possible site of \"the occult instability where
the people dwell\" (Fanon 1963, 227) and give birth to popular movements
of national liberation. In this context, the state of exception might be
understood as both constitutive to the alienation that is intrinsic to
liberation movements and instrumental for a radical euphoria and
excessive hope that create and spectralize the post-colonial
nation-state as a deferred promise of decolonization. It is through this
perspective that we can critically evaluate Hardt and Negri\'s
endorsement of what they call \"democratic violence\" (2004, 344). This
kind of violence, they argue, belongs to the multitude. It is neither
creative nor revolutionary but used on political rather than moral
grounds. When organized horizontally, according to democratic principles
of decision making, democratic violence serves as a means of defending
\"the accomplishments\" of \"political and social transformation\"
(ibid., 344). Notwithstanding the concept\'s romantic and utopian
inflections, democratic violence also derives from Hardt and Negri\'s
earlier argument that \"the great wars of liberation are (or should be)
oriented ultimately toward a \'war against war,\' that is, an active
effort to destroy the regime of violence that perpetuates our state of
war and supports the systems of inequality and oppression.\" This, they
conclude, is \"a condition necessary for realizing the democracy of the
multitude\" (ibid., 67). In one quick stroke, Hardt and Negri move
anti-colonial liberation wars into their post-national paradigm of
Empire and divest them of their cultural and historical particularities.
Moreover, translating explicitly national liberation movements into a
universalizing narrative of global pacifism precludes a critique of
violence within its particular historical and philosophical formation.
In contrast[, a post-colonial analysis of global war must tease out the
intersections between the ways in which **[racialized violence
constitutes]{.mark}**]{.underline} colonial and post-colonial processes
of **[[nation]{.mark} [formation and]{.mark} helps [construct an]{.mark}
absolute [enemy through which to legitimize]{.mark} global [war
and]{.mark} to [abdicate responsibility for]{.mark} the
[dehumanizing]{.mark} effects of [global]{.mark} [economic
restructuring]{.mark}.]{.underline}**¶ Second, while Bhabha\'s pun is
symptomatic of the resisting properties that he sees as operative in the
various practices of colonial ambiguity, it also, despite Benjamin\'s
opinion, draws attention to the possibility that [oppression alters the
linear flow of Western history and challenges \"the transparency of
social reality, as a pre-given image of human knowledge]{.underline}\"
(Bhabha 1994, 41). Here, Bhabha rightfully asks to what extent do states
of emergency or acts of extreme violence constitute a historical rupture
and, more importantly, call into question the nature of the human
subject. It is at this point that a post-colonial reading of the state
of exception fruitfully coincides with Agamben\'s notion of exception.
For in both cases, the focus of inquiry is the construction of
disposable life through the logic of necropower and the collapse of
social and political relationships that enable the exercise of
particularly racialized forms of violence, including torture and
disappearances.¶ Third, Bhabha\'s notion of the double movement of
emergency and emergence envisions an anti-colonialist historiography in
terms of a dialectical process of perpetual transformation. It is at
this point, however, that the coupling of emergency or exception and
emergence becomes problematic for at least two reasons. First, combining
both terms prematurely translates the violence of the political event
into that of metaphor and risks erasing the [micro- or quotidian
narratives of violence]{.underline} ??? such as Arasanayagam\'s account
of war ??? that both [legitimate]{.underline} and are perpetuated by
political and social [states of emergency]{.underline}. In order to
examine the relationship between global and communal forms of violence,
a critical practice of post-colonial studies, I suggest, must reassess
the term \"transformation\" and, concurrently, the assumption that acts
of extreme global violence can be advanced in the service of \"making
history\" (Balibar 2001, 26). In other words, if, as Hannah Arendt
argues, there has been a historical \"reluctance to deal with violence
as a separate phenomenon in its own right\" (2002, 25), it is time to
examine the possibility of employing post-colonial studies in the
service of a non-dialectical critique of global war. This kind of
[critique must ask to what extent those on whose bodies extreme violence
was exercised are **a priori excluded from articulating any
transformative theory of violence**]{.underline}. [How]{.underline}, in
other words, [does bare life]{.underline} ??? if at all possible ???
[attain the status of subjectivity within the dehumanizing logic of
exception or global civil war?¶]{.underline} Fourth, like Bhabha, [[we
need to take seriously]{.underline}]{.mark} Benjamin\'s insight into
**[[the intrinsic relationship between violence and the
conceptualization of history]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Notwithstanding
Bhabha\'s pivotal argument that the violence of [a \"unitary notion of
history]{.underline}\" generates a \"unitary,\" and therefore extremely
violent, \"concept of man\" (1994, 42), I wish to caution, alongside
Benjamin\'s analysis of fascism, that what enables today\'s global civil
war is that even \"its opponents treat it as a historical norm\"
(Benjamin 1968, 257). What is at stake, then, in dominant as well as
critical narratives of global civil war is their representation as
natural rather than political phenomena, and the acceptance of
globalization as a political fait accompli. Both of these aspects, I
believe, **[contribute to the proliferation of dehistoricized concepts
of the global increase of racialized violence and war]{.underline}**. It
seems to me, however, that **[the [enormous]{.mark} rise of
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [inflicted by global civil
wars]{.underline} **[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}** a post-colonial
historiography and **[critique]{.underline}** of global war **[[that
questions]{.mark} notions of history based on]{.underline}** cultural
**[fragmentation]{.underline}**, rupture, and totalization.
**[Instead]{.underline}**, such a **[historiography must [seek out
patterns of]{.mark} connection and [connectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
But more importantly, as I have argued in this paper, **[[it
must]{.underline}]{.mark}** trace the post-colonial moment of global
civil war and begin to **[[read contemporary war through the
interconnected necropolitics of global and imperial
warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thus, to understand the logic and
practice of global war we need to develop a greater understanding
precisely of those civil wars and national liberation wars that do not
appear to threaten the new global order. Furthermore, a post-colonial
critique of global civil war should facilitate the decoding and
rescripting of both the normalizing narratives and racialized embodiment
of global civil warfare.¶

#### Security threats are [political constructions]{.underline} by experts to justify [constant militarism]{.underline}

Despite such democratic concerns, a large part of [[what makes]{.mark}

two **[purportedly objective]{.mark}** sociological [claims
about]{.mark} the nature of modern [threat]{.mark}. As these claims
undergird the current security concept, this conclusion assesses them
more directly and, in the process, indicates what they suggest about the

that]{.mark} global interdependence means that [the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces]{.mark} near [continuous
threats]{.mark} from abroad]{.underline}. Just as Pearl Harbor presented
a physical attack on the homeland justifying a revised framework, [the
American position]{.underline} in the world since [has been one of
permanent insecurity in the face of new,]{.underline} equally [objective
dangers]{.underline}. Although today [[these

nonetheless [[create **a world of chaos and instability** in
which]{.mark} American domestic [peace is imperiled]{.mark} by
decentralized terrorists and aggressive rogue states]{.underline}. n310¶
\[\*1486\] ¶ [[Second]{.mark}, and relatedly, the objective
[complexity]{.mark} of modern threats [makes it impossible for]{.mark}
ordinary [citizens to comprehend]{.mark} fully the causes and likely
consequences of existing [dangers.]{.mark} Thus, [the best response
is]{.mark} the further [entrenchment of]{.mark} the [national
security]{.mark} state, [with the U.S. **military permanently

wherever they strike]{.underline}-at home or abroad.
[Accordingly]{.underline}, [modern legal and political [institutions

these externally generated crises**. Regardless of these trade-offs, the
security benefits of an empowered presidency]{.underline}-one armed with
countless secret and public agencies as well as with a truly global
military footprint n311 -[greatly outweigh the costs]{.underline}.¶ Yet
although these sociological views have become commonplace, [the
conclusions that Americans should draw about security requirements are
not nearly as clear cut as the conventional wisdom assumes]{.underline}.
In particular, [a closer examination of contemporary arguments about
endemic danger suggests]{.underline} that [**such [claims are not
objective]{.mark} empirical judgments**, but
[rather]{.mark}]{.underline} are [[socially complex and politically
infused]{.mark} interpretations]{.underline}. Indeed, the openness of
existing circumstances to multiple interpretations of threat implies
that the presumptive need for secrecy and centralization is not
self-evident. And as underscored by high profile failures in expert
assessment, [[claims to]{.mark} security [expertise are]{.mark}
themselves [riddled with ideological presuppositions and]{.mark}
subjective [biases]{.mark}]{.underline}. All [this indicates that the
gulf between elite knowledge and lay incomprehension in matters of
security may be far less extensive than is ordinarily thought. It also
means that the question of who decides]{.underline}-and with it the
issue of how democratic or insular our institutions should be-[remains
open]{.underline} as well.¶ Clearly, [technological changes, from
airpower to biological and chemical weapons, have shifted the nature of
America\'s position in the]{.underline} \[\*1487\] [world and its
potential vulnerability]{.underline}. As has been widely remarked for
nearly a century, the oceans alone cannot guarantee our permanent
safety. Yet in truth, they never fully ensured domestic tranquility. The
nineteenth century was one of near continuous violence, especially with
indigenous communities fighting to protect their territory from
expansionist settlers. n312 [But even if technological shifts make
doomsday scenarios more chilling than those faced by Hamilton,
Jefferson, or Taney, **the mere existence of these scenarios tells us
little about their likelihood or how best to address
them**]{.underline}. Indeed, [these latter security judgments are
inevitably permeated with **subjective political
assessments**-assessments that carry with them preexisting ideological
points of view-such as]{.underline} regarding how much risk
constitutional societies should accept or [how interventionist states
should be in foreign policy]{.underline}.¶ In fact, from its emergence
in the 1930s and 1940s, supporters of the modern security concept
have-at times unwittingly-reaffirmed the political rather than purely
objective nature of interpreting external threats. In particular,
commentators have repeatedly noted the link between the idea of
insecurity and America\'s post- World War II position of global primacy,
one which today has only expanded following the Cold War. n313 In 1961,
none other than Senator James William Fulbright declared, in terms
reminiscent of Herring and Frankfurter, that security imperatives meant
that \"our basic constitutional machinery, admirably suited to the needs
of a remote agrarian republic in the 18th century,\" was no longer
\"adequate\" for the \"20th-century nation.\" n314 For Fulbright, the
driving impetus behind the need to jettison antiquated constitutional
practices was the importance of sustaining the country\'s
\"pre-eminen\[ce\] in political and military power.\" n315 Fulbright
believed that greater executive action and war- making capacities were
essential precisely because the United States found itself \"burdened
with all the enormous responsibilities that accompany such power.\" n316
According to Fulbright, the United States had \[\*1488\] both a right
and a duty to suppress those forms of chaos and disorder that existed at
the edges of American authority. n317 Thus, rather than being purely
objective, [[the]{.mark} American [condition of permanent danger
was]{.mark} itself [deeply tied to political calculations about]{.mark}
the importance of global [primacy]{.mark}. What generated the condition
of continual crisis was not only technological change, but also the
belief that the United States\' own national security rested on the
successful projection of power]{.underline} into the internal affairs of
foreign states.¶ The key point is that [**regardless of whether one
agrees with such an underlying project**, the value of this project is
ultimately an open political question]{.underline}. [This suggests
that]{.underline} [[whether distant crises should be viewed as
generating insecurity]{.mark} at home [is]{.mark} similarly [as
much]{.mark} an **[interpretative]{.mark} judgment [as]{.mark} an
empirically [verifiable]{.mark}** []{.mark}conclusion]{.underline}. n318
To appreciate the open nature of security determinations, one need only
look at the presentation of terrorism as a principle and overriding
danger facing the country. According to National Counterterrorism
Center\'s 2009 Report on Terrorism, in 2009 there were just twenty-five
U.S. noncombatant fatalities from terrorism worldwide-nine abroad and
sixteen at home. n319 [While the fear of a terrorist attack is a
legitimate concern, these numbers-which have been consistent in recent
years-place the gravity of the threat in perspective. Rather than a
condition of endemic danger]{.underline}-requiring ever-increasing
secrecy and centralization-[such [facts are]{.mark} perfectly
[consistent with a reading that Americans **do not**]{.mark} **face an
existential [crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} (one presumably comparable to
Pearl Harbor) and [actually enjoy relative security.]{.underline}
Indeed, the [disconnect between numbers and resources
expended]{.underline}, especially in a time of profound economic
insecurity, [highlights the political choice of policymakers and
citizens to persist in interpreting foreign events through
a]{.underline} World War II and early Cold War **[lens of permanent
threat.]{.underline}** In fact, the continuous alteration of basic
constitutional values to fit national security aims emphasizes just how
entrenched Herring\'s old vision of security as pre-political and
foundational has become, regardless of whether other interpretations of
the present moment may be equally compelling.¶ It also underscores a
telling and often ignored point about the nature of \[\*1489\] modern
security expertise, particularly as reproduced by the United States\'
massive intelligence infrastructure. [To the extent that political
assumptions-like the centrality of global primacy or the view that
instability abroad necessarily implicates security at home-shape the
interpretative approach of executive officials, [what passes as]{.mark}
objective security [expertise is]{.mark} itself **[intertwined
with]{.mark} contested claims about [how to view external
actors]{.mark}** []{.mark}and their motivations. These]{.underline}
[assumptions mean that while modern conditions may well be complex, the
conclusions of the presumed experts]{.underline} [may not be
systematically less liable to subjective bias than judgments made by
ordinary citizens]{.underline} based on publicly available information.
[It]{.underline} further [underlines that the question of [who decides
**cannot be foreclosed** ]{.mark}**in advance** [by]{.mark} simply
asserting [deference to elite knowledge.]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ If
anything, one can argue that [[the]{.mark} presumptive [gulf between
elite]{.mark} awareness [and]{.mark} suspect [mass opinion]{.mark} has
[generated]{.mark}]{.underline} its own very [[dramatic]{.mark}
political and legal pathologies]{.underline}. In recent years, [the
country has witnessed a variety of **[security crises built on the basic
failure of \"expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" n320 At present, part
of [what obscures this fact is the very culture of secret
information]{.underline} sustained by the modern security concept.
Today, it is commonplace for government officials to leak security
material about terrorism or external threats to newspapers as a method
of shaping the public debate. n321 These \"open\" secrets allow greater
public access to elite information and embody a central and routine
instrument for incorporating mass voice into state decision-making.

#### Their threat discourse mass structural violence\-\--rational impact calc goes neg 

**Jackson 12**---Director of the National Centre for Peace and Conflict
Studies, the University of Otago. Former. Professor of International
Politics at Aberystwyth University (8/5/12, Richard, The Great Con of
National Security,
http://richardjacksonterrorismblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/the-great-con-of-national-security/)

It may have once been the case that being attacked by another country
was a major threat to the lives of ordinary people. It may also be true
that there are still some pretty serious dangers out there associated
with the spread of nuclear weapons. [For the most part, however, most
of]{.underline} [what you've been told about national
security]{.underline} [and **[all the big threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}
which can supposedly kill you [**[is one]{.mark} big [con designed to
distract you from the things]{.mark} [that can really hurt
you]{.mark}**[, such as]{.mark}]{.underline} the [poverty,
[inequality]{.mark} and [structural violence]{.mark}]{.underline} of
capitalism, global warming, [[and]{.mark} the]{.underline} manufacture
and [proliferation of [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} -- among others.¶
**[[The facts are simple]{.mark} and irrefutable]{.underline}**:
**[[you're far more likely to die from lack of]{.mark} [health
care]{.mark}]{.underline}** provision **[[than]{.underline}]{.mark}**
you are from **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**; from stress and
overwork than **[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**ian or **[[North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**n nuclear missiles; from lack of road safety
than from illegal immigrants; from mental illness and suicide than from
**[[computer hackers]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [from domestic violence
than from]{.underline} [asylum seekers;]{.underline} from the misuse of
legal medicines and alcohol abuse than from international drug lords.
And [yet, politicians and [the]{.mark} servile
[media]{.mark}]{.underline} [spend most of their time [talk]{.mark}ing
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[the [threats]{.mark} posed by
terrorism, immigration, asylum seekers, the]{.underline} international
[drug trade, the]{.underline} [nuclear programmes of Iran and North
Korea]{.underline}, [computer hackers,]{.underline} animal rights
activism, [the]{.underline} [threat of China]{.underline}, [and a host
of other issues]{.underline} which are **[[all]{.mark} about
as]{.underline}** **[[equally unlikely to affect]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** health and **[well-being of [you]{.mark} and your
family]{.underline}**. [[Along with]{.mark} this **[obsessive]{.mark}
and perennial**]{.underline} **[[discussion of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
so-called '**[national [security issues']{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[the
state spends]{.mark}]{.underline} truly [[vast]{.underline} [sums on
security measures which]{.underline}]{.mark} [[have]{.mark} virtually
[no impact on]{.mark} the actual risk of dying from]{.underline} [[these
threats]{.underline},]{.mark} and then engages in massive displays of
'security theatre' designed to show just how seriously the state takes
these threats -- such as the x-ray machines and security measures in
every public building, surveillance cameras everywhere, missile
launchers in urban areas, drones in Afghanistan, armed police in
airports, and a thousand other things. **[[This display is meant to
convince]{.mark} [you that these threats are]{.mark} really, really
[serious]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶ And [while]{.underline} all [this is
going on]{.underline}, [the [rulers]{.mark}]{.underline} of society
[[are **hoping that you won't notice**]{.mark} **that**]{.underline}
**[[increasing]{.mark} social and economic [inequality]{.mark} in
society leads to increased ill health for a growing
underclass;]{.underline}** that suicide and crime always rise when
unemployment rises; **[that workplaces remain highly dangerous and kill
and maim hundreds of people]{.underline}** per year; **[that there are
preventable diseases which plague the poorer sections of
society;]{.underline}** **[[that domestic violence]{.mark} kills and
[injures thousands]{.mark}]{.underline}** of women and children
annually; **[[and that]{.mark} globally, [poverty and preventable
disease kills tens of millions]{.mark} of people]{.underline}**
needlessly every year. In other words, [**they are hoping that you won't
notice how much structural violence there is in the
world.**¶]{.underline} More than this, [they are [hoping]{.mark} that
[you won't notice that while]{.mark} literally
[trillions]{.mark}]{.underline} of dollars [[are spent on military
weapons,]{.mark} foreign wars and security theatre]{.underline} (which
also arguably do nothing to make any us any safer, and may even make us
marginally less safe), [that [domestic]{.mark}]{.underline} [[violence
programmes]{.mark} [struggle]{.mark} to provide even minimal
support]{.underline} for women and children at risk of serious harm from
their partners; that underfunded mental health programmes mean long
waiting lists to receive basic care for at-risk individuals; that drug
and alcohol rehabilitation programmes lack the funding to match the
demand for help; [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[welfare
measures]{.underline}]{.mark} aimed at reducing inequality [[have been
inadequate]{.mark} for decades]{.underline}; [that]{.underline}
[health]{.underline} and safety [measures]{.underline} at many
workplaces [remain insufficiently]{.underline} resourced; and that
measures to tackle global warming and developing alternative energy
remain hopelessly inadequate.¶ Of course, none of this is surprising.
Politicians are a part of the system; they don't want to change it. For
them, all the insecurity, death and ill-health caused by capitalist
inequality are a price worth paying to keep the basic social structures
as they are. A more egalitarian society based on equality, solidarity,
and other non-materialist values would not suit their interests, or the
special interests of the lobby groups they are indebted to. It is also
true that dealing with economic and social inequality, improving public
health, changing international structures of inequality, restructuring
the military-industrial complex, and making the necessary economic and
political changes to deal with global warming will be extremely
difficult and will require long-term commitment and determination. For
politicians looking towards the next election, it is clearly much easier
to paint immigrants as a threat to social order or pontificate about
[the ongoing danger of [terrorists]{.mark}.]{.underline} It
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[more exciting for the]{.mark} [media
than stories about how poor]{.mark}]{.underline} [[people]{.mark} and
people of colour [are discriminated against]{.mark}]{.underline} and
suffer worse health as a consequence.¶ Viewed from this vantage point,
**[national [security is]{.mark} one massive confidence
trick]{.underline}** -- **[[misdirection on an epic
scale.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Its]{.mark} primary [function is to
distract you from]{.mark} the structures and [inequalities]{.mark} in
society [which are the real threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the health
and wellbeing of you and your family, **[[and]{.mark} to convince you
[to be permanently afraid so]{.mark} [that you]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[will]{.underline}**]{.mark} acquiesce to all the security measures
which keep you under state control and [**[keep]{.underline}** **[the
m]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ilitary]{.underline}**-**[[i]{.mark}ndustrial]{.underline}**
**[[c]{.mark}omplex]{.underline}** **[[ticking]{.underline}]{.mark}**
along.¶ Keep this in mind next time you hear a politician talking about
the threat of uncontrolled immigration, the risk posed by asylum seekers
or the threat of Iran, or the need to expand counter-terrorism powers.
The question is: when politicians are talking about national security,
what is that they don't want you to think and talk about? What exactly
is the misdirection they are engaged in? The truth is, [if you think
that terrorists or immigrants]{.underline} or asylum seekers [or Iran
are a greater threat to your safety than the capitalist
system]{.underline}, [you have]{.underline} been well and truly
[conned]{.underline}, my friend. Don't believe the hype: **[you're much
more likely to die from any one of several forms of structural
violence]{.underline}** in society **[than]{.underline}** you are from
immigrants or **[terrorism]{.underline}**. Somehow, we need to challenge
the politicians on this fact.

### Impact\-\--Wars

#### Their paranoid projections guarantee unending wars

studies at California State University (Nancy, \"A Psychoanalytic

In this sense, then, [[9-11]{.mark} has]{.underline} symbolically
[[constituted a]{.mark} relief in the sense of a [decrease in]{.mark}
the persecutory [anxiety provoked by]{.mark} living in a culture
undergoing a deterioration from within. The implosion reflects
the]{.underline} economic and social [trends]{.underline} I described
briefly above and [has been manifest in many]{.underline} related
[symptoms, including]{.underline} the [erosion of family]{.underline}
and community, the [corruption of government]{.underline} in league with
the wealthy and powerful, the [abandonment of working
people]{.underline} [by profit-driven corporations]{.underline} going
international, urban plight, a drug-addicted youth, [a violence addicted
media]{.underline} reflecting and [motivating an escalating real-world
violence, [the corrosion of]{.mark} civic participation by a decadent
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}, a spiritually bereft culture held
prisoner to the almighty consumer ethic, [[racial
discrimination]{.mark}, misogyny, gaybashing]{.underline}, growing
numbers of families joining the homeless, [[and environmental
devastation]{.mark}. Was this not lived as a kind of societal
suicide\--an ongoing assault, an aggressive attack---against life and
emotional well-being waged from within]{.underline} against the societal
self? In this sense, [[9/11 permitted a respite]{.mark} from the sense
of internal decay [by]{.mark}]{.underline} inadvertently [[stimulating
a]{.mark} renewed vitality via a **[reconfiguration of]{.mark} political
and [psychological forces]{.mark}**: tensions]{.underline} within this
country---between the "haves-mores" and "have-lesses," as well as
between the defenders and critics of the status quo, [yielded to a wave
of nationalism in which a united people]{.underline}\--Americans
all\--[stood]{.underline} as one [against external
aggression]{.underline}. At the same time, the generosity, solidarity
and selfsacrifice expressed by Americans toward one another reaffirmed
our sense of ourselves as capable of achieving the "positive" depressive
position sentiments of love and empathy. Fractured social relations were
symbolically repaired. [[The enemy]{.mark}- -the threat to our integrity
as a nation and]{.underline}, in D. W. Winnicott's terms, [to our sense
of going on being\--**[was no longer]{.mark} the web of complex
[internal force]{.mark}**[s]{.mark} so difficult to understand and
change, [but a]{.mark} simple and **[identifiable enemy]{.mark} from
outside of us**, clearly marked by their difference]{.underline}, their
foreignness and their uncanny and unfathomable "uncivilized" pre-modern
character. [The societal [relief came with the **projection of
aggressive impulses** onto an]{.mark} easily dehumanized **[external
enemy]{.mark}, where they could be justifiably** attacked and
**destroyed**. This]{.underline} country's [response to
9/11]{.underline}, then, in part [demonstrates how persecutory [anxiety
is more easily dealt with]{.mark}]{.underline} in individuals and in
groups [[when it is]{.mark} experienced as being [provoked from the
outside]{.mark} rather than from internal sources]{.underline}. As Hanna
Segal9 has argued (IJP, 1987), [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[tend to be narcissistic]{.mark}, self-idealizing, [and
paranoid]{.mark}]{.underline} in relation to other groups [[and]{.mark}
to **[shield themselves from]{.mark} knowledge about the reality of
[their own aggression]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark}]{.underline} of
necessity [[is **projected into an enemy**]{.underline}]{.mark}\-- real
or [**[imagined]{.mark}**\--so that it can be demeaned, held in contempt
and then attacked]{.underline}. In this regard, [9/11 permitted a new
discourse to arise about what is fundamentally wrong in the world:
indeed, the anti-terrorism rhetoric and policies of the U.S. government
functioned]{.underline} for a period [to overshadow the
anti-globalization movement]{.underline} [that has identified the
fundamental global conflict to be between on the one hand the U.S. and
other governments]{.underline} in the First World, transnational
corporations, and powerful international financial institutions, and on
the other, workers' struggles, human rights organizations and
environmental movements throughout the world. [The new discourse
presents the fundamental conflict in the world as one between
civilization and fundamentalist terrorism]{.underline}. [But **this
"civilization" is a wolf in sheep's clothing**]{.underline}, and [those
who claim to represent it reveal the kind of splitting Segal describes:
a hyperbolic idealization of themselves]{.underline} and their culture
[and a projection of all that is bad, including the consequences of the
terrorist underbelly of decades long U.S. foreign policy in the Middle
East and Asia, **onto the denigrated other, who must be
annihilated**]{.underline}. [The U.S. government, tainted for years by
its ties to powerful transnational corporate interests, has recreated
itself as the nationalistic defender of the American
people]{.underline}. In the process, patriotism has kidnapped citizens'
grief and mourning and [[militarism]{.underline}]{.mark} [has
[high]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[jacked people's fears]{.mark} and
anxieties**, [converting them into a passive consensus for]{.mark} an
increasingly [authoritarian government's]{.mark} domestic and foreign
policies]{.underline}. [The defensive significance of this new discourse
has to do with another theme related to death anxiety as well: the
threat of **[species annihilation]{.mark}** that people have lived
with]{.underline} since the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Segal argues that [the [leaders]{.mark} of the U.S. as well as
other countries with nuclear capabilities, have **[disavowed
their]{.mark}** own [**aggressive motivations**]{.mark} as they
developed10 weapons of mass destruction. [The distortion of
language]{.mark} throughout the Cold War, such as
"deterrence,"]{.underline} "flexible response," [Mutual Assured
Destruction", "rational nuclear war]{.underline}," "Strategic Defense
Initiative" [has [served to]{.mark} deny the aggressive nature of the
arms race (p. 8) and "to [disguise]{.mark} from ourselves and others
**[the horror of a nuclear war]{.mark} and our own part in making it
possible or more likely**]{.underline}" (pp. 8-9). Although the policy
makers' destructiveness can be hidden from their respective populations
and justified for "national security" reasons, Segal believes that [such
denial only increases reliance on projective mechanisms and stimulates
paranoia.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Solves Extinction

#### Critical intellectualism key to solve extinction\-\--voting negative outweighs hypothetical plan consequences 

**Jones 99**---IR, Aberystwyth (Richard, "6. Emancipation:
Reconceptualizing Practice," Security, Strategy and Critical Theory,
http://www.ciaonet.org/book/wynjones/wynjones06.html)

[**[The central political task of]{.underline}** t]{.mark}he
[[**intellectuals** is to]{.mark}]{.underline} aid in the
[construct]{.underline}ion of [a counterhegemony]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} thus [[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[prevailing]{.underline}]{.mark} patterns of
[[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} and interaction [that make up
the]{.underline} currently dominant [hegemony]{.underline}.
[**This**]{.underline} task [**is accomplished [through educational
activity]{.mark}**,]{.underline} because, as Gramsci argues, "every
relationship of 'hegemony' is necessarily a pedagogic relationship"
(Gramsci 1971: 350). Discussing the relationship of the "philosophy of
praxis" to political practice, Gramsci claims: It \[the
[theory]{.underline}\] does not tend to leave the "simple" in their
primitive philosophy of common sense, but rather to lead them to a
higher conception of life. If it [affirms the need for contact between
intellectuals and "simple"]{.underline} it is not in order to restrict
scientific activity and preserve unity at the low level of the masses,
but precisely [in order to construct an intellectual--]{.underline}moral
[bloc which can make politically possible the intellectual progress of
the mass]{.underline} and not only of small intellectual groups.
(Gramsci 1971: 332--333) According to Gramsci, this attempt to construct
an alternative "intellectual--moral bloc" should take place under the
auspices of the Communist Party---a body he described as the "modern
prince." Just as Niccolò Machiavelli hoped to see a prince unite Italy,
rid the country of foreign barbarians, and create a virtù--ous state,
Gramsci believed that the modern prince could lead the working class on
its journey toward its revolutionary destiny of an emancipated society
(Gramsci 1971: 125--205). Gramsci's relative optimism about the
possibility of progressive theorists playing a constructive role in
emancipatory political practice was predicated on his belief in the
existence of a universal class (a class whose emancipation would
inevitably presage the emancipation of humanity itself) with
revolutionary potential. It was a gradual loss of faith in this axiom
that led Horkheimer and Adorno to their extremely pessimistic prognosis
about the possibilities of progressive social change. But does a loss of
faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat necessarily lead
to the kind of quietism ultimately embraced by the first generation of
the Frankfurt School? The conflict that erupted in the 1960s between
them and their more radical students suggests not. Indeed, contemporary
critical theorists claim that the deprivileging of the role of the
proletariat in the struggle for emancipation is actually a positive
move. Class remains a very important axis of domination in society, but
it is not the only such axis (Fraser 1995). Nor is it valid to reduce
all other forms of domination---for example, in the case of gender---to
class relations, as orthodox Marxists tend to do. To recognize these
points is not only a first step toward the development of an analysis of
forms of exploitation and exclusion within society that is more attuned
to social reality; it is also a realization that there are other forms
of emancipatory politics than those associated with class conflict. 1
This in turn suggests new possibilities and problems for emancipatory
theory. Furthermore, the abandonment of faith in revolutionary parties
is also a positive development. The history of the European left during
the twentieth century provides myriad examples of the ways in which the
fetishization of party organizations has led to bureaucratic immobility
and the confusion of means with ends (see, for example, Salvadori 1990).
The failure of the Bolshevik experiment illustrates how disciplined,
vanguard parties are an ideal vehicle for totalitarian domination (Serge
1984). Faith in the "infallible party" has obviously been the source of
strength and comfort to many in this period and, as the experience of
the southern Wales coalfield demonstrates, has inspired brave and
progressive behavior (see, for example, the account of support for the
Spanish Republic in Francis 1984). But such parties have so often been
the enemies of emancipation that they should be treated with the utmost
caution. Parties are necessary, but their fetishization is potentially
disastrous. [History furnishes examples of progressive developments that
have been]{.underline} positively [influenced by]{.underline} organic
[intellectuals operating outside the]{.underline} bounds of a particular
[party structure]{.underline} (G. Williams 1984). Some of these
developments have occurred in the particularly intractable realm of
security. These examples may be considered as "resources of hope" for
critical security studies (R. Williams 1989). They illustrate that
[**[ideas are important]{.underline}** or,]{.mark} more correctly, that
[[change is the product of the]{.mark} dialectical [interaction of ideas
and material reality]{.mark}.]{.underline} One clear security--related
example of the role of critical thinking and critical thinkers in aiding
and abetting progressive social change is the experience of [[the peace
movement of the 1980s]{.underline}]{.mark}. At that time the ideas of
dissident [defense [intellectuals]{.mark}]{.underline} (the "alternative
defense" school) [encouraged]{.underline} and drew strength from [peace
activism.]{.underline} Together [they [had an effect **not only on
short--term policy but on the** ]{.mark}**dominant [discourses
of]{.mark}**]{.underline} strategy and [**[security]{.mark}**, a far
more important result in the long run.]{.underline} [The synergy
between]{.underline} critical security [intellectuals and]{.underline}
critical [social movements]{.underline} and the potential influence of
both working in tandem [can be witnessed]{.underline} particularly
clearly [in the fate of common security.]{.underline} As Thomas
Risse--Kappen points out, the term "common security" originated in the
contribution of peace researchers to the German security debate of the
1970s (Risse--Kappen 1994: 186ff.); it was subsequently popularized by
the Palme Commission report (Independent Commission on Disarmament and
Security Issues 1982). [[Initially]{.underline}]{.mark}, mainstream
[defense [intellectuals dismissed the concept as]{.mark}]{.underline}
hopelessly [[idealistic]{.underline}]{.mark}; it certainly had no place
in their allegedly hardheaded and realist view of the world.
[[However]{.mark}, notions of common security were taken up
by]{.underline} a number of [different intellectual
communities]{.underline}, including the liberal arms control community
in the United States, Western European peace researchers, security
specialists in the center--left political parties of Western Europe, and
Soviet "institutchiks"---members of the influential policy institutes in
the Soviet Union such as the United States of America and Canada
Institute (Landau 1996: 52--54; Risse--Kappen 1994: 196--200; Kaldor
1995; Spencer 1995). [These communities were subsequently able to take
advantage of public pressure exerted through social movements in order
to gain]{.underline} broader [acceptance for common
security]{.underline}. In Germany, for example, "in response to social
movement pressure, German social organizations such as churches and
trade unions quickly supported the ideas promoted by peace researchers
and the SPD" (Risse--Kappen 1994: 207). Similar [pressures even had an
effect on the Reagan administration.]{.underline} As Risse--Kappen
notes: When the Reagan administration brought hard--liners into power,
the US arms control community was removed from policy influence. It was
[the American peace movement]{.underline} and what became known as the
"freeze campaign" that [revived the arms control process]{.underline}
together with pressure from the European allies. (Risse--Kappen 1994:
205; also Cortright 1993: 90--110) Although it would be difficult to
sustain a claim that the combination of critical movements and
**[[intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark}** persuaded the Reagan government
to adopt the rhetoric and substance of common security in its entirety,
it is clear that it did at least [**[have a substantial impact on
ameliorating U.S. behavior]{.mark}.** The most dramatic]{.underline} and
certainly the most unexpected [impact of alternative defense ideas was
felt in the Soviet Union]{.underline}. Through various East--West links,
which included arms control institutions, Pugwash conferences,
interparty contacts, and even direct personal links, a coterie of Soviet
policy analysts and advisers were drawn toward common security and such
attendant notions as "nonoffensive defense" (these links are detailed in
Evangelista 1995; Kaldor 1995; Checkel 1993; Risse--Kappen 1994; Landau
1996 and Spencer 1995 concentrate on the role of the Pugwash
conferences). This group, including Palme Commission member Georgii
Arbatov, Pugwash attendee Andrei Kokoshin, and Sergei Karaganov, a
senior adviser who was in regular contact with the Western peace
researchers Anders Boserup and Lutz Unterseher (Risse--Kappen 1994:
203), then influenced Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev's
subsequent championing of common security may be attributed to several
factors. It is clear, for example, that new Soviet leadership had a
strong interest in alleviating tensions in East--West relations in order
to facilitate much--needed domestic reforms ("the interaction of ideas
and material reality"). But what is significant is that [the Soviets'
commitment to common security led to significant changes in force sizes
and postures]{.underline}. These in turn aided in the winding down of
the Cold War, the end of Soviet domination over Eastern Europe, and even
the collapse of Russian control over much of the territory of the former
Soviet Union. At the present time, in marked contrast to the situation
in the early 1980s, common security is part of the common sense of
security discourse. As MccGwire points out, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) (a common defense pact) is using the rhetoric of
common security in order to justify its expansion into Eastern Europe
(MccGwire 1997). This points to an interesting and potentially important
aspect of the impact of ideas on politics. As concepts such as common
security, and collective security before it (Claude 1984: 223--260), are
adopted by governments and military services, they inevitably become
somewhat debased. [The hope is that enough of the residual meaning can
survive [to shift the parameters of the debate]{.mark} in a potentially
progressive direction. Moreover, the adoption of the concept of common
security by official circles [provides critics with a useful tool for
(**immanently) critiquing**]{.mark} **aspects of [security
policy]{.mark}** (as MccGwire 1997 demonstrates in relation to NATO
expansion). [The]{.mark} [example]{.mark} of]{.underline} [common
security]{.underline} is highly instructive. First, it
[[indicates]{.mark} that [critical intellectuals can be politically
engaged and]{.mark} play a role---a significant one]{.underline} at
that---[in making the world]{.underline} a [better]{.underline} and
safer place. Second, it points to potential future addressees for
critical international theory in general, and critical security studies
in particular. Third, [it]{.underline} also [[underlines the role of
ideas in the evolution of society]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although most
proponents of critical security studies reject aspects of Gramsci's
theory of organic intellectuals, in particular his exclusive
concentration on class and his emphasis on the guiding role of the
party, the desire for engagement and relevance must remain at the heart
of their project. The example of the peace movement suggests that
[critical theorists can still play the role of organic intellectuals and
that this organic relationship need not confine itself to a single
class; it can involve alignment with different coalitions of social
movements that campaign on an issue or a series of issues pertinent to
the struggle for emancipation]{.underline} (Shaw 1994b; R. Walker 1994).
Edward Said captures this broader orientation when he suggests that
[critical [intellectuals]{.mark} ["]{.mark}are]{.underline}
[[always]{.mark} tied]{.underline} to [and]{.underline} ought to
[[remain]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline}n organic [[part of an **ongoing
experience in society**]{.underline}]{.mark}: of the poor, the
disadvantaged, the voiceless, the unrepresented, the powerless" (Said
1994: 84). [In the]{.underline} specific [case of critical security
studies]{.underline}, [[this means placing the experience of]{.mark}
those men and [women]{.mark}]{.underline} and communities [[for whom the
present world order is a cause of insecurity]{.mark} rather than
security [at the center of the agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[and
making suffering humanity rather than raison d'état the prism through
which problems are viewed.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Here the project
stands full--square within the critical theory tradition. [[If "all
theory is for someone]{.mark} and for some purpose," [then
critical]{.mark} security [studies is for "the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[voiceless, the [unrepresented]{.mark}, the powerless," [and]{.mark}
[its purpose is]{.mark} their [emancipation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
theoretical implications of this orientation have already been discussed
in the previous chapters. They involve a fundamental reconceptualization
of security with a shift in referent object and a broadening of the
range of issues considered as a legitimate part of the discourse. They
also involve a reconceptualization of strategy within this expanded
notion of security. But the question remains at the conceptual level of
how these [[alternative types of theorizing]{.underline}]{.mark}---even
if they are self--consciously aligned to the practices of critical or
new social movements, such as peace activism, the struggle for human
rights, and the survival of minority cultures---[[can become "a force
for]{.mark} the direction of [action]{.mark}."]{.underline} Again,
Gramsci's work is insightful. In the Prison Notebooks, Gramsci advances
a sophisticated analysis of how [[dominant discourses play a vital role
in upholding]{.underline} [particular political]{.underline}]{.mark} and
economic [[orders]{.underline}]{.mark}, or, in Gramsci's terminology,
"historic blocs" (Gramsci 1971: 323--377). Gramsci adopted Machiavelli's
view of power as a centaur, half man, half beast: a mixture of consent
and coercion. [Consent is]{.underline} produced and [reproduced by
a]{.underline} ruling [hegemony]{.underline} that holds sway through
civil society and [through which]{.underline} ruling or [dominant ideas
become widely dispersed]{.underline}. 2 In particular, Gramsci describes
how [ideology]{.underline} becomes sedimented in society and takes on
the status of common sense; it [becomes subconsciously
accepted]{.underline} [and even regarded as beyond
question]{.underline}. **[Obviously]{.underline}**, for Gramsci,
**[[there is nothing immutable about]{.mark} the [values]{.mark} that
permeate society; [they]{.mark} [can and do
change]{.mark}]{.underline}.** In the social realm, [ideas and
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} that were [[once seen as]{.mark}
natural and [beyond question]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., commonsensical)
in the West, [[such as]{.mark} feudalism and [slavery, are now]{.mark}
seen as anachronistic, unjust, and [unacceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In Marx's well--worn phrase, "All that is solid melts into the air."
Gramsci's intention is to harness this potential for change and ensure
that it moves in the direction of emancipation. To do this he suggests a
strategy of a "war of position" (Gramsci 1971: 229--239). Gramsci argues
that in states with developed civil societies, such as those in Western
liberal democracies, [any successful attempt at]{.underline} progressive
[**[social change requires]{.mark}** a]{.underline} slow[,
**incremental**,]{.underline} even [**[molecular, struggle]{.mark}** to
break down the prevailing hegemony]{.underline} and construct an
alternative counterhegemony to take its place. Organic [**[intellectuals
have a crucial role to play in this process]{.underline}** [by helping
to undermine]{.underline} [the
"natural]{.underline}]{.mark}[,"]{.underline} "commonsense,"
internalized [[nature of the status quo]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn helps **[[create political space
within which alternative conceptions of politics can be
developed]{.underline}]{.mark}** and new historic blocs created. I
contend that Gramsci's strategy of a war of position suggests an
appropriate model for proponents of critical security studies to adopt
in relating their theorizing to political practice. The Tasks of
Critical Security Studies If the project of critical security studies is
conceived in terms of a war of position, then [the [main task of]{.mark}
those [intellectuals]{.mark} who align themselves with the enterprise
[is to]{.mark} attempt to [undermine]{.mark} the prevailing [hegemonic
security discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This may be]{.mark}
[accomplished by]{.mark}]{.underline} utilizing specialist information
and expertise to engage in an immanent [**[critique of the
prevailing]{.mark}** security]{.underline}
**[[regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [that is, **[comparing the
justifications of those regimes with actual
outcomes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [When this is attempted]{.underline} in
the security field, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} prevailing structures and
[[regimes are found to **fail**]{.mark}]{.underline} grievously **[[on
their own terms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Such an approach also
involves]{.underline} [[challenging]{.mark} the
pronouncements]{.underline} [of those
[intellectuals]{.mark}]{.underline}, traditional or organic, [[whose
views]{.mark} serve to legitimate, and hence [reproduce, the prevailing
world]{.mark} [order]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This challenge
[entails]{.mark}]{.underline} [teasing out]{.underline} the often
subconscious and certainly unexamined [assumptions that underlie their
arguments]{.underline} [while [drawing attention to the normative
viewpoints]{.mark} that are [smuggled into]{.mark} mainstream [thinking
about security]{.mark} **behind its positivist facade.**]{.underline} In
this sense, proponents of critical security studies approximate to
Foucault's notion of "[specific intellectuals"]{.underline} who [use
their expert knowledge to challenge the prevailing "regime of
truth]{.underline}" (Foucault 1980: 132). However, critical theorists
might wish to reformulate this sentiment along more familiar Quaker
lines of "speaking truth to power" (this sentiment is also central to
Said 1994) or even along the eisteddfod lines of speaking "truth against
the world." Of course, traditional strategists can, and indeed do,
sometimes claim a similar role. Colin S. Gray, for example, states that
"strategists must be prepared to 'speak truth to power'" (Gray 1982a:
193). But the difference between Gray and proponents of critical
security studies is that, [[whereas the former seeks to influence
policymakers]{.mark} in]{.underline} [particular directions [without
questioning]{.mark} the basis of [their power, the latter aim at
a]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}thoroughgoing [[critique of all
that]{.mark} traditional [security]{.mark}]{.underline} [[studies has
taken for granted]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, critical theorists
base their critique on the presupposition, elegantly stated by Adorno,
that "the need to lend suffering a voice is the precondition of all
truth" (cited in Jameson 1990: 66). [The aim of]{.underline} critical
[security studies in [attempting to undermine]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} prevailing [[orthodoxy is **ultimately
educational**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Gramsci notes, "Every
relationship of 'hegemony' is necessarily a pedagogic relationship"
(Gramsci 1971: 350; see also the discussion of critical pedagogy in
Neufeld 1995: 116--121). Thus, [by criticizing]{.underline} the
[hegemonic discourse]{.underline} and advancing alternative conceptions
of security based on different understandings of human potentialities,
[the approach is simultaneously playing a part in eroding
the]{.underline} legitimacy of the [ruling]{.underline} historic [bloc
and contributing to]{.underline} the development of [a counterhegemonic
position.]{.underline} There are a number of avenues open to critical
security [specialists]{.underline} in [pursuing this educational
strategy]{.underline}. [As [teachers]{.mark}, they [can]{.mark} try to
[foster]{.mark} and encourage [skepticism]{.mark} toward accepted
wisdom]{.underline} and open minds to other possibilities. They can also
take advantage of the seemingly unquenchable thirst of the media for
instant punditry to forward alternative views onto a broader stage.
Nancy Fraser argues: "[As teachers, we try to foster an emergent
pedagogical counterculture]{.underline}\.... As critical public
intellectuals we try to inject our perspectives into whatever cultural
or political public spheres we have access to" (Fraser 1989: 11).
Perhaps significantly, support for this type of emancipatory strategy
can even be found in the work of the ultrapessimistic Adorno, who
argues: [In the history of civilization there have been not a few
instances when delusions were healed not by focused propaganda, but, in
the final analysis, because scholars, with their unobtrusive yet
insistent work habits, studied what lay at the root of the
delusion]{.underline}. (cited in Kellner 1992: vii) Such "unobtrusive
yet insistent work" does not in itself create the social change to which
Adorno alludes. [[The]{.mark} conceptual and the practical [dangers of
collapsing practice into theory must be guarded
against]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rather, [[through]{.mark}]{.underline}
their [[educational activities]{.underline}]{.mark}, [proponents
of]{.underline} critical [security studies should aim to provide support
for those social movements that promote]{.underline} emancipatory
[social change]{.underline}. [By providing [a critique of the prevailing
order]{.mark}]{.underline} and legitimating alternative views, [critical
theorists [can perform a valuable role in]{.mark} supporting the
struggles of [social movements]{.mark}.]{.underline} That said, the role
of theorists is not to direct and instruct those movements with which
they are aligned; instead, the relationship is reciprocal. The
experience of the European, North American, and Antipodean [peace
movements of [the 1980s]{.mark}]{.underline} [[shows how
influential]{.mark} social [movements can become when]{.mark} their
efforts are [harnessed to the intellectual]{.mark} and educational
[activity of critical]{.mark} [thinkers]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, in his account of New Zealand's antinuclear stance in the
1980s, Michael C. Pugh cites the importance of the visits of critical
intellectuals such as Helen Caldicott and Richard Falk in changing the
country's political climate and encouraging the growth of the
antinuclear movement (Pugh 1989: 108; see also Cortright 1993: 5--13).
In the 1980s peace movements and critical intellectuals interested in
issues of security and strategy drew strength and succor from each
other's efforts. If such critical social movements do not exist, then
this creates obvious difficulties for the critical theorist. But even
under these circumstances, the theorist need not abandon all hope of an
eventual orientation toward practice. Once again, the peace movement of
the 1980s provides evidence of the possibilities. At that time, the
movement benefited from the intellectual work undertaken in the lean
years of the peace movement in the late 1970s. Some of the theories and
concepts developed then, such as common security and nonoffensive
defense, were eventually taken up even in the Kremlin and played a
significant role in defusing the second Cold War. Those ideas developed
in the 1970s can be seen in Adornian terms of a "message in a bottle,"
but in this case, contra Adorno's expectations, they were picked up and
used to support a program of emancipatory political practice. Obviously,
one would be naive to understate the difficulties facing those
attempting to develop alternative critical approaches within academia.
Some of these problems have been alluded to already and involve the
structural constraints of academic life itself. Said argues that many
problems are caused by what he describes as the growing
"professionalisation" of academic life (Said 1994: 49--62). Academics
are now so constrained by the requirements of job security and
marketability that they are extremely risk--averse. It pays---in all
senses---to stick with the crowd and avoid the exposed limb by following
the prevalent disciplinary preoccupations, publish in certain prescribed
journals, and so on. The result is the navel gazing so prevalent in the
study of international relations and the seeming inability of security
specialists to deal with the changes brought about by the end of the
Cold War (Kristensen 1997 highlights the search of U.S. nuclear planners
for "new targets for old weapons"). And, of course, the pressures for
conformism are heightened in the field of security studies when
governments have a very real interest in marginalizing dissent.
Nevertheless, [opportunities for critical thinking do
exist,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} this thinking can connect with the
practices of social movements and [become a "force for the direction of
action]{.underline}." The experience of [the 1980s, when,]{.underline}
[in the depths of the second Cold War, [critical thinkers risked
demonization]{.mark}]{.underline} and in some countries far worse in
order **[[to challenge received wisdom]{.underline}]{.mark}**, thus
arguably **[[playing a crucial role in the very survival of the human
race]{.underline}]{.mark}**, should act as both an inspiration and a
challenge to critical security studies.

**Byles 3**---English, U Cyprus (Joanna, Psychoanalysis and War: The
Superego and Projective Identification,
http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/articles/art_byles01.shtml)

[The problem of warfare]{.underline} which includes genocide, and its
most recent manifestation, international terrorism, [brings into focus
the need to understand how the individual is placed in the
social]{.underline} [and the social in the individual]{.underline}.
[Psychoanalytic theories]{.underline} of superego aggression, splitting,
projection, and projective identification [may be useful in helping us
to understand the psychic links involved]{.underline}. [It seems
vital]{.underline} to me writing in the Middle East in September 2002
that [we examine our understanding]{.underline} [of what it is we
understand about war,]{.underline} including genocide and terrorism.
[Some psychoanalysts argue that war is a necessary defence against
psychotic anxiety]{.underline} (Fornari xx; Volkan), and Freud himself
first advanced the idea that war provided an outlet for repressed
impulses. (\"Why War?\"197). [The problematic of these views is the
individual\'s need to translate internal psychotic anxieties into real
external dangers so as to control them]{.underline}. [It
suggests]{.underline} that culturally [[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} and
its most recent manifestation, international terrorism and the so-called
\'\'war on terrorism,\" [[may be a]{.mark} necessary [object for
internal aggression and not a pathology]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed,
Fornari suggests that \"war could be seen as an attempt at therapy,
carried out by a social institution which, precisely by
institutionalizing war, increases to gigantic proportions what is
initially an elementary defensive mechanism of the ego in the
schizo-paranoid phase\" (xvii-xviii). In other words, [the history of
[war might represent the externalization]{.mark}]{.underline} and
articulation [[of]{.mark} shared unconscious
[fantasies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This idea would suggest that [the
culture of war,]{.underline} genocide, and international terrorism
[provides objects of psychic need]{.underline}. [If this is so, with
what can we replace them? If]{.underline} cultural formations and
historical events have their sources in our psychic functioningthat is
to say, in our unconscious fears and desires, and culture itself
provides a framework for expressing, articulating, and coming to terms
with these fears and desires, then [psychoanalysis may help to reveal
why war seems to be an inevitable and ineradicable part of human
history.]{.underline} Superego as an Agent of Aggression In \"The Ego
and the Id,\" Freud formulated a seemingly insoluble dilemma in the very
essence of the human psyche; the eternal conflict between the dual
instincts of eros, the civilizing life instinct, and the indomitable
death instinct (thanatos). He also identified some aspects of the death
instinct with superego aggression, suggesting that the superego was the
agent of the death instinct in its cruel and aggressive need for
punishment and that its operative feeling was frequently a punitive
hatred, while other aspects of the superego were protective. As we know,
Freud thought the source of the superego was the internalization of the
castrating Oedipal father. In chapter seven of Civilization and its
Discontents, he theorized that when de-fusion or separation of the dual
instincts occurred, aspects of aggression frequently dominated and that
it was the purpose of the ego to find objects for eros and/or aggression
either in phanta sv or reality. The role phantasy plays in projective
identification is something to which I shall return. Other theorists,
such as Melanie Klein, trace the beginning of the superego back to early
(infant) oral phantasies of self-destruction, which is a direct
manifestation of the death instinct. Klein transformed the oedipal drama
by making the mother its central figure and thus playing a vital role in
object-relations theory, about which I shall say more later in this
essay. Although Klein\'s work relied on the dual instinct theory
postulated by Freud, she re-defined the drives by emphasizing the way in
which the destructive instincts attached themselves to the object, in
particular the good-bad breast. Thus for Klein, the site of the superego
is derived from oral Incorporation of the good/bad breast, contrary to
Freud, for whom the site of the superego is the paternal law. Although
the formation of the superego is grounded on the renunciation ofloving
and hostile Oedipal wishes, it is subsequently refined, by the
contributions of social and cultural requirements (education, religion,
morality). My argument in this paper is three-fold: (1) These social and
cultural requirements in which the superego is grounded may be used by
the superego of the state and/or its leader to mobilize aspects of the
individual\'s aggression during war-time in a way that does not happen
in peace-time. (2) Klein\'s theory of [[splitting]{.mark} and projective
identification [plays an important role in the concept of]{.mark}
difference and [otherness]{.mark} as enemy]{.underline}. (3) Bion\'s
development of Klein\'s theory into what he called the \"container\" and
the \"contained\" may offer some way out of the psychic dangers of
projective identification by suggesting that [we may be able to access
our internal psychic world as a transformative power to combat violence
both internal and external.]{.underline} In an early attempt to define
war neuroses, or how war mentally traumatizes the psyche, Freud wrote of
the conflict \"between the soldier\'s old peaceful ego and his new
warlike one\" becoming acute as soon as the peace-ego realizes what
danger it runs in losing its own life to the rashness of its newly
formed parasitic double\" (SE 17 209). Accepting the violence that is
within ourselves as well as in the other, the so-called enemy, is a
difficult lesson to learn, and learning to displace our instinctual
destructive aggression peacefully is enormously more difficult. To the
extent the individual superego is connected to society, which assumes
its functions particularly in wartime, the problem of war brings into
focus the psychoanalytic problem of the partial defusion (separation) of
eros and psychic aggression brought about by war through specifically
social processes. These social processes involve the mechanisms by which
aspects of the violent and aggressive social superego of the State
mobilizes and appropriates some of the dynamic aspects of the
individual\'s superego aggression: the need to hate, and to punish, for
its own purposes, such as genocide or so-called \"ethnic cleansing,\"
and for territorial and economic reasons. Many of these actions are
often masked as defending civilization, or an idealized State and/or its
leader. This is also true of the \"holy jihads\" that are rapidly
becoming an enormous threat to the world. In his book Enemies and
Allies, Vamik Volkan suggests that the individual may see the superego
of the State as his/her own idealized superego. And indeed, this may in
turn help to explain how during war-time the social superego is placed
in the individual and how in turn the individual is positioned in the
social. In Civilization and its Discontents, to which I have already
referred, Freud wrote about the ways in which the regulations and
demands of a civilized society harbor the risk of the death instinct
(aggression) being released at any favorable opportunity, especially
when combined with Eros i.e., under the pretext of idealism and
patriotism. This is especially true when t here is a leader who elicits
strong emotional attachments from a group or nation. Of course, [I am
not arguing]{.underline} that [there are not]{.underline} some
[important aspects of the]{.underline} [social superego that are
beneficial]{.underline}, [for example]{.underline} the [ethical and
moral laws]{.underline} which shape society and protect its citizens;
[nevertheless]{.underline}, [in wartime]{.underline} and its most recent
manifestation, international terrorism, [it is precisely these
civilizing aspects of the social superego that are]{.underline} ignored
or [repressed]{.underline}. It seems to me that the [[failure]{.mark} of
civilization historically [to control]{.mark}]{.underline} the
aggression, cruelty, and hatred that characterize
[[war]{.mark}]{.underline} urgently [[requires a psychoanalytic
explanation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of course, I am speaking of psychic,
not biological (survival of the fittest), aggression. [In wartime the
externalized superego of the state sanctions killing]{.underline} and
violence that is [not allowed in peace-time]{.underline} (in fact, such
violence against others during peacetime would be considered criminal)
[sanctions]{.underline}, in fact, [the gratification of warring
aggression]{.underline}, thus [ensuring]{.underline} that acts of
[violence need not incur guilt.]{.underline} Why do we accept this?
Psychoanalysis posits the idea that [aggression is not behavioral but
instinctual; not social but psychological]{.underline}. To quote Volkan,
who follows Freud, \"It is man\'s very nature itself.\" Obviously, [it
is vital that humanity find more mature]{.underline}, less primitive
[ways of dealing with our]{.underline} hatred and [aggression than
war]{.underline}, genocide, and international terrorism. [The most
characteristic thing about]{.underline} this kind of
[violence]{.underline} and cruelty [is its collective
mentality]{.underline}: war requires group co-operation, organization,
and approval. Some theorists argue that [one of the primary cohesive
elements binding individuals into institutionalized]{.underline} human
[association is defence against psychotic anxiety.]{.underline} In Group
Psychology Freud writes that \"[in a group the individual is brought
under conditions which allow him to throw off the repressions of his
unconscious instinctual]{.underline} [impulses]{.underline}. [The
apparently new characteristics he then displays are]{.underline} in fact
the [manifestation of this unconscious, in which all that is evil in the
human mind is contained as a predisposition\"]{.underline} (74). Later
in the same essay, when speaking of the individual and the group mind,
Freud quotes Le Bon : \"Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in
a crowd, he is a barbarian that is, a creature acting by instinct. He
possesses the spontaneity, the violence, the ferocity, and also the
enthusiasm and heroism of primitive beings\" (77). [War]{.underline} is
a collective phenomenon that mobilizes our anxieties and [allows our
original sadistic fantasies of destructive omnipotence to be
re-activated and projected onto \"the enemy.\"]{.underline} [Some
critics have argued that we \"need\" enemies as external]{.underline}
[stabilizers of our sense of identity]{.underline} and inner control. It
has also been argued that the militancy a particular group shows toward
its [[enemies]{.mark}]{.underline} may partly [[mask]{.mark} the
personal [internal conflicts]{.mark} of each member of the
group]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} that [they]{.underline} may
[therefore]{.underline} [have an emotional investment in]{.underline}
the maintenance of the [enmity]{.underline}. In other words, [[they need
the enemy and are]{.mark} unconsciously [afraid to lose it. This fits in
with the]{.mark}]{.underline} well known [[phenomenon of inventing an
enemy when there is not one]{.mark} readily
[available]{.mark}]{.underline}. The individual suicide bomber, or
suicide pilot, is just as much part of this group psychology each
bomber, each terrorist, is acting for his/her group, or even more
immediately his or her family, from whom he/she derives enormous psychic
strength and support. Just as importantly, she/he is acting in the name
of his/her leader. All of these identifications require strong emotional
attachments. Freud writes, \"The mutual tie between members of a group
is in the nature of an identification, based upon an important emotional
common quality. . . . This common quality lies in the nature of the tie
to the leader\" (Group 1078). In Learning from Experience, Bion
theorizes that a social groupfunctions to establish a fixed social order
of things (the establishm ent), and that the individual has to be
contained by the establishment of the group. Sometimes the rigidity of
me system crushes the individual\'s creativity; alternatively, certain
special individuals erupt in the group, which goes to pieces under their
influence (Bion cites Jesus within the constraints of Israel). A final
possibility is the mutual adaptation of one to the other, with a
development of both the individual and the group. The development of a
sense of self, its integration, its separation, and its protection all
begin, or course, in early childhood. Psychoanalyses like Klein,
Winnicott, and Bion have explored these ideas in what is known as object
relations theory. Volkan writes that the [concepts of enemy and
ally]{.underline} and the senses of ethnicity and nationality
[are]{.underline} largely [bound up with the individual\'s sense of
self]{.underline}, and that individuals within an ethnic or national
group tend to see their group as a privileged \"pseudo-species\"
(Erikson) and enemy groups as subhuman (262). [Of course enemies are
threatening and do generate a reactive need for defenses; however, a
basic psychoanalytic question might be to what extent the degree of
defensiveness characteristic of [war]{.mark} behavior
[represents]{.mark} personal]{.underline}, emotional [[need]{.mark}s of
individuals [for an enemy]{.mark} to hate]{.underline}, [[so]{.mark}
that [they can keep their]{.mark} conflicted [selves
together]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and to what extent the State superego
plays a role here. Our capacity for splitting and projection plays an
important part in how]{.underline} [we]{.underline} see others and [feel
about others]{.underline}, and through the process of projective
identification, how we make others feel about ourselves and themselves.
[Projective identification]{.underline} [involves]{.underline} a deep
split, [displacing onto]{.underline} and into [others the
hateful]{.underline}, bad [parts of ourselves]{.underline}, and
frequently making them feehateful to themselves through their own
introjection of our hatred. This hatred is often racial or religious,
frequently both. Moreover, in the process of projective identification,
parts of the self are put into the other, thus depleting the ego. (This
process can be a vicious circle, and it is a profoundly disturbing and
characteristic pathology, often involving envy and/or rivalry, both
corrosive, poisonous forces.) [These]{.underline} Kleinian
[ideas]{.underline}, developed by other theorists, such as Winnicott and
Bion, [are hugely relevant to]{.underline} the problem of
[war]{.underline} and genocide, and most recently, of terrorism. Klein
argues that [[in the paranoid]{.mark} schizoid [position there
is]{.mark} a [splitting]{.mark} of good and bad objects]{.underline},
[with the good being introjected and the bad being
externalized]{.underline} and projected out into someone or onto
something else. As with the infant and child, so with the adult,
[mechanisms of splitting and protection play upon negative and feared
connotations]{.underline} of the other, [of the enemy]{.underline}, and
of difference; [[projection prevents]{.mark} warring [nations
from]{.mark} exploring and thus [understanding what]{.mark} it is that
actually [divides them]{.mark}; it prevents mutual response and
recognition by promoting exclusivity.]{.underline} As already mentioned,
analysts such as Volkan and Erikson have written about the processes by
which an [enemy is dehumanized]{.underline} so as [to provide the
distance a group needs from its perceived enemy]{.underline}. First [the
group becomes preoccupied with the]{.underline} [enemy according to the
psychology of minor differences]{.underline}. Then [mass regression
occurs to permit]{.underline} [the group to]{.underline} recover and
[reactivate more primitive methods]{.underline}. [What they then use in
this regressed state tends to contain]{.underline} aspects of
[childish]{.underline} (pre-oedipal) [fury. The enemy is perceived more
and more as a stereotype of bad and negative qualities]{.underline}. The
use of [[denial allows a group to ignore the fact that]{.mark} its own
[externalizations]{.mark} and projections [are involved in this
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. The stereotyped enemy may be so despised
as to be no longer human, and it will then be referred to in non-human
terms. History teaches us that it was in [this way that the Nazis
perceived the Jews]{.underline} [as vermin to be
exterminated]{.underline}. As I write, Al Qaeda terrorist groups view
all Americans as demons and infidels to be annihilated, and many
[Americans are comforted by demonizing all of bearded]{.underline}
[Islam]{.underline}. Many Israelis consider most Palestinians as dirt
beneath their feet subhuman and most Palestinians think of most Israelis
as despoilers of the land they are supposed to share. In other words,
the problem of [the mentality of war]{.underline} and of terrorism
[mobilizes our anxieties in such a way so as to prevent critical reality
testing.]{.underline} [[If we could]{.underline}]{.mark} [learn
the]{.underline} enormously difficult and painful [task of]{.underline}
re-introjection, of [[tak]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[back
our]{.underline} [projections]{.underline}]{.mark}, our hatreds,
anxieties, [and fears of the other]{.underline} and of difference, long
before they harm the other, [there might be a transition]{.underline}, a
link, [from]{.underline} the state sanctioned violence of
[war]{.underline} back to individual violence. [[We might]{.mark} learn
to [subvert negative]{.mark} projective [identification]{.mark} into a
positive identification [as a means of empathizing]{.mark} with the
other [and]{.mark} thus [containing difference]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The violence of the individual could then be contained and sublimated
in peaceful ways, such as reconciling]{.underline} [and balancing
competing interests by asking what exactly these opposing interests
are]{.underline} and exploring what the dynamics, conscious and
unconscious, are for the hatred of deep war-like antagonisms. In other
words, [we would need to change our relationship with the other, giving
up the]{.underline} dangerously irresponsible [habit of
splitting]{.underline}, projective identification, and exclusivity by
recognizing difference not antagonistically but through an inclusive
process that recognises the totalitv of human relationships in a
peaceful world. We might substitute for the libidinal object-ties
involved in projective identification the re-introjection of the object
into the ego, and thus reach a common feeling of sharing, of being part
of the other, of empathy, in short. As Freud pointed our, the ego is
altered bv introjection, as suggested by his memorable formulation: \"
The shadow of the object has fallen on the ego.\" In his book Second
Thoughts, Bion theorizes that in the infant as in the adult,
re-introjection can be dangerous if the dominance of projective
identification confuses the distinction between s elf and the external
object, since this awareness depends on the recognition of a distinction
between subject and object. But Bion\'s theory of the pairing group, or
the container and the contained, provides a way out of this predicament,
suggesting that the outcome of such pairing is either detrimental to the
contained, or to the container, or mutually developing to both. This
idea is germane to my argument in this paper that the reciprocity of the
container and the contained relationship, through both positive
projective identification (empathy) and introjection or
re[-introjection, results in a positive allowance of
difference]{.underline} in other words, [a healthy acceptance of and
adaptation to the other within the self and the self within the
other]{.underline}.

#### Reject the affirmative\-\--this is crucial to open up individual space for resistance against security

Studies, University of Queensland, 2002 Alternatives: Global, Local,
Political 27.1 page InfoTrac OneFile

It is perhaps easy to become despondent, but [as countless struggles for
freedom, justice, and social transformation have proved, a sense of
seriousness can be tempered with the knowledge that many tools are
already available\--and where they are not, the effort to create a
productive new critical sensibility is well advanced. [There
is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[a crucial political opening within
the]{.mark} liberal [problematic]{.mark} itself, in the sense that it
assumes that [power is most effective when it is absorbed]{.mark} as
truth, consented to and desired\--[which creates an important space for
refusal]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Colin Gordon argues, Foucault thought
that the very possibility of governing was conditional on it being
credible to the governed as well as the governing. (60) This throws
weight onto the question of how security works as a technology of
subjectivity. It is to take up Foucault\'s challenge, framed as a
reversal of the liberal progressive movement of being we have seen in
Hegel, not to discover who or what we are so much as to refuse what we
are. (61 ) Just as security rules subjectivity as both a totalizing and
individualizing blackmail and promise, it is at these levels that we can
intervene. [[We can]{.mark} critique the machinic frameworks of
possibility represented by law, policy, economic regulation, and
diplomacy, while [challeng]{.mark}ing [the way]{.mark} these
[institutions deploy language to draw]{.mark} individual [subjects into
their]{.mark} consensual [web. This suggests]{.mark}]{.underline}, at
least provisionally, a dual strategy. The first asserts [[the space for
agency]{.mark}, both in challenging available possibilities for being
and their larger socioeconomic implications]{.underline}. Roland Bleiker
formulates [an idea of agency that shifts away from the
lone]{.underline} (male[) hero overthrowing the social order in a
decisive act of rebellion to one [that understands]{.mark} both
[the]{.mark} thickness of social power and its \"[fissures]{.mark},\"
\"fragmentation,\" and \"thinness.\"]{.underline} We must, he says,
\"observe how [an individual [may be able to escape the discursive order
and influence its]{.mark} shifting [boundaries]{.mark}\.... By doing so,
[discursive]{.mark} terrains of [dissent all of a sudden appear where
forces of domination previously seemed
invincible]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} (62) Pushing beyond security requires
[tactics]{.underline} that can work at many levels\--that [empower
individuals to recognize the larger social, cultural, and economic
implications of the everyday forms of desire, subjection, and discipline
they encounter, to challenge and rewrite them, and that in turn
contribute to collective efforts to transform the larger structures of
being, exchange, and power that sustain (and have been sustained by)
these forms]{.underline}. As Derrida suggests, [this is to open up
aporetic possibilities that transgress and call into question the
boundaries of the self, society, and the international]{.underline} that
security seeks to imagine and police. The second seeks new ethical
principles based on a critique of the rigid and repressive forms of
identity that security has heretofore offered. Thus writers such as
Rosalyn Diprose, William Conolly, and Moira Gatens have sought to
imagine [a new ethical relationship that thinks difference not on the
basis of the same]{.underline} but on the basis of a dialogue with the
other that [might allow space for the unknown and
unfamiliar]{.underline}, for a \"debate and engagement with the other\'s
law and the other\'s ethics\"\--an encounter that involves a
transformation of the self rather than the other. (63) Thus while the
sweep and [[power]{.underline}]{.mark} of security must be acknowledged,
it [[must]{.mark} also [be refused]{.mark}: at the simultaneous levels
of individual identity, social order, and macroeconomic possibility, it
would entail]{.underline} another kind of work on \"ourselves\"\--[a
political refusal of the One, [the imagination of an other that never
returns to the same]{.mark}.]{.underline} It would be to ask if there is
a world after security, and what its shimmering possibilities might be.

#### Best way to solve the case

Security?," 44 Conn. L. Rev. 1417

But this mode of popular involvement comes at a key cost. Secret
information is generally treated as worthy of a higher status than
information already present in the public realm---the shared collective
information through which ordinary citizens reach conclusions about
emergency and defense. Yet, oftentimes, as with the lead up to the Iraq
War in 2003, although the actual content of this secret information is
flawed,197 its status as secret masks these problems and allows
policymakers to cloak their positions in added authority.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} reality [[highlights]{.underline} [the
importance of]{.underline}]{.mark} [approaching security]{.underline}
information [with]{.underline} far greater **[[collective
skepticism]{.underline}]{.mark}**; it also means that security judgments
may be more 'Hobbesian'---marked fundamentally by epistemological
uncertainty as opposed to verifiable fact---than policymakers admit.

[If the objective sociological claims at the center of the modern
security concept are themselves profoundly contested, what does this
meahn for reform efforts that seek to recalibrate the relationship
between liberty and security? Above all, it indicates that **[the
central problem with]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [**[procedural
solutions]{.mark}** offered by constitutional scholars-[emphasizing
**new statutory frameworks** or]{.mark} greater [judicial
assertiveness-is that they **mistake a question of politics for one of
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In other words, [such [scholars
ignore the extent to which governing practices are the **product of
background political judgments** about threat]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[democratic knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**, professional
[[expertise, and]{.mark} the [necessity for insulated
decision-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[To the extent that Americans are
convinced that they face]{.mark} continuous [danger from hidden]{.mark}
and potentially limitless [assailants]{.mark}]{.underline}-danger too
complex for the average citizen to comprehend independently-[[**it is
inevitable** that institutions (**regardless of legal reform**]{.mark}
initiatives) [will operate to centralize power in those hands presumed
to enjoy military and security expertis]{.mark}e]{.underline}. Thus,
[[any systematic effort to challenge]{.mark} the current framing of the
relationship between [security]{.mark} and liberty [must **begin by
challenging** ]{.mark}**the [underlying assumptions about
knowledge]{.mark}** and **security upon which legal and political
arrangements rest.** [Without]{.mark} a sustained and [public debate
about **the validity of security expertise**]{.mark}]{.underline}, its
supporting institutions, and the broader legitimacy of secret
information, [[**there can be no substantive shift** in]{.mark} our
[constitutional politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} The problem at present,
however, is that it remains unclear which popular base exists in society
to raise these questions. [[Unless such a base]{.mark} fully [emerges,
we can expect our prevailing security arrangements to become ever more
entrenched.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Yet [[**we cannot stop here.** If we did we would deprive
the]{.mark}]{.underline} single [[individual]{.underline}]{.mark} as
diplomat [[of]{.mark} the possibility of [**ethically relevant
action**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[There would be no choice.]{.mark}**
[Obedience would]{.mark} have to [be of the **no-questions- asked
type**]{.mark}, whatever the policy]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
whatever [its consequences]{.underline}.34 But this is not so, and has
never been so even in practice. [It is]{.underline} by now [widely
accepted that for]{.underline} all kinds of [public
servants]{.underline} (and this includes diplo- mats), [obedience to
bureaucratic orders is not a]{.underline} [cause of exemption from
moral]{.underline} ± and legal ± [responsibility]{.underline}. This is
especially evident in the case of major crimes. The road that was opened
in Nuremberg35 has now taken us to Rome, where in July 1998 the approval
of the statutes of the per- manent International Criminal Court would
not have been possible without a wide global consensus on the
moral/legal responsibility of individuals who serve their state in
different capacities but who, by so doing, are in no way exempt from
ethical scrutiny and legal sanction. ¶ It would be untenable to maintain
that diplomats are exempt from such scrutiny (and sanctions), and that
the mandate of the International Criminal Court covers only the actual
physical purveyors of violence. [[It would]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed
[[be a bizarre limitation]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially [[in a world
in which the distinction between military action and diplomacy
is]{.mark} more and more [blurred]{.mark} [in the]{.mark} [framework of
complex conflictive situations]{.mark}]{.underline}; all the more so
since the mandate of the court includes (though for the time being still
wanting a definition) the crime of aggression, one in which diplomats
can play as big a role as soldiers.36 ¶ How can we square the
contradictory needs of impersonal bureaucratic discipline and persistent
moral responsibility? The fact is that we cannot. The fact is that there
must be a limit, a certain threshold beyond which¶ 56¶ the duty of
allegiance and obedience is overruled, annulled by the moral outrage of
certain acts in which the individual \`\`servant of the state\'\' is
instructed to participate. The ethics of the public servant (with its
corol- lary of obedience, of non-personalization of behaviour and
choices) can take us only so far. A morally sane human being should be
capable of determining when that limit is reached, when one must be able
to breach one\'s allegiance and say \`\`no\'\' to the crossing of that
threshold. ¶ It is necessary to recall that decisions to rebel against
orders that are legitimate as to the line of command but that become
illegitimate by their moral unacceptability are de®nitely not unheard of
in the annals of diplomacy. Several historians of the Holocaust have
stressed the role (sometimes merely passive, often active) of Italians,
of®cially allied with the Germans, in saving thousands of Jews from
detention and deporta- tion to death camps.37 Among those Italians were
many military of®cers, but also several diplomats. Though the policy of
the highest levels of fascist Italy, starting from Mussolini himself,
was often wavering, contra- dictory, and ambiguous, there is no doubt
that on many occasions Italian diplomats, in particular in the Balkans,
proceeded totally on their own to perform acts of political indiscipline
and to infringe very basic bureau- cratic rules, for instance by giving
Italian passports to Jews whose only link with Italy was having visited
it once: a rather serious breach of the ethics of an of®cial and one
that would make any self-respecting consu- lar of®cer cringe. 38 In an
unforgettable interview (included in Joseph Rochlitz\'s documentary The
Righteous Enemy), the former Italian consul in Salonica, Guelfo Zamboni,
replied in a half-surprised, half-amused tone to the interviewer, amazed
at this most unusual concession of pass- ports to aliens: \`\`Well, they
were in danger of death, weren\'t they? So, what was I supposed to do,
let them be deported and exterminated?\'\'39 ¶ The threshold at which
personal assessment of moral duties becomes destructive of the ethics of
the public servant is not a clearly defined line. Each - but that of
course is no news in ethical discourse - has to draw that line and act
accordingly. Certainly, if we were to allow the possibility for each
diplomat to turn personal disagreement and mental reservation on any
given issue into undisciplined behaviour and active rebellion we would
revert to that individualistic free-for-all that is the antithesis of a
functioning polis, even the most open and pluralistic one. And yet,
there is always, even in cases that are not as monumentally horrendous
as the Holocaust, a path for a digni®ed stand in the presence of radical
moral disagreement with speci®c policies. In those cases one can avoid
taking the extreme, always-questionable step of breaking loyalty by
opting out ± by resignation. Of course, in non-democratic regimes such
an act can entail consequences that may be as dire as those provoked by
open re- bellion, but outside those regimes resigning means losing
income, pres-¶ 57¶ tige, and career, but not life or freedom. Thus it
becomes more feasible. But where has it happened more frequently, in the
past decades? It seems not without signi®cance to note that it is in the
USA that many diplomats have resigned (over policy issues from Viet Nam
to Bosnia), a country whose citizens give a special relevance to debate
on ethical issues and at the same time are frequently haunted by the
awareness of the respon- sibility that their government\'s actions or
omissions entail in terms of human consequences around the world. [To be
able to raise ethical issues in diplomacy you]{.underline} indeed
[need]{.underline} both: [moral sensitivity,]{.underline} and [the
perception of the impact on human beings outside your borders of the
power wielded by your country]{.underline} in the international arena. ¶
If there is this sort of \`\`ethical switch\'\' that can interrupt
allegiance to the state in the case of moral dissent, wouldn\'t it be
safer for a state, any state, to privilege staunch nationalists as their
diplomats, at least in the highest-ranking positions? Wouldn\'t they be
more reliable in all con- ditions and facing any sort of problem, any
sort of dilemma? The fallacy of this sort of reasoning lies in
forgetting what a government of®cial is supposed to be. It is true that
public servants are not justi®ed in sacri®c- ing their loyalty to the
state and their disciplined behaviour within their administrations to
the vagaries of personal taste, nor to political inclina- tions, local
partiality, or special interests. However, by the same token it is not
necessary, and even counterproductive, that they should be mili- tants
of the nation-state, true believers in king and country. They can be
such as citizens, but no one demands that they be such as of®cials. The
confusion between the two roles (citizen and of®cial) is typically
totali- tarian, and amounts to saying that the only good lawyers are
those who believe that their clients are innocent ± and possibly love
them, too. ¶ Going back to diplomats, we indeed see that if we cast them
as lawyers, and not as crusaders for the cause of their own
nation-state, we will have solved part of our ethical dilemmas.
Diplomats involved in a negotiation or dispute, no more than lawyers in
court, do not have to believe in the righteousness of the cause they are
defending. That is the essence of professionalism, a much more reliable
foundation for good performance and loyalty than is belief. But the
diplomat, as well as the lawyer, may decide at a certain point that
there are some causes that are just too morally uncomfortable to defend,
and opt out. It is of course easier to abandon litigation than to resign
from government service, but concep- tually there do not seem to be
radical moral differences between the two instances. Both are rare, but
both are possible. ¶ The ethical dimension of diplomacy, however, should
not be seen only in negative terms ± as a limit to bureaucratic
allegiance, as a moral safety valve allowing us to escape complicity
with morally outrageous actions[. **[The assumption one should
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in this context, [**[is that of
a]{.mark}** \`\`**[status]{.mark}**]{.underline} ¶ 58¶ **[[quo

## 2NC

### 2NC\-\--Overview

The aff commits itself to sustaining policy that is justified and
prioritized by constant securitization of the Other without thinking of
how they were constructed or their objectivity. The 1AC lives within
their paranoia of conflict which is endless

This expands beyond one act\-\--it is the domestic and international
political justifications that perpetuate conflict and violence by the
institutions they espouse\-\--they were founded on the legacy of the
powerful, and any opposition activates a state of emergency that enables
Western intervention and extermination, ecological, energy, political
and economic catastrophe\-\--that's Mack. It's not worth preserving a
system that perpetuates a **[morally reprehensible]{.underline}**
structure of global apartheid and genocidal violence while destroying
value to life.

Securitization of the 1AC causes serial policy failure\-\--policy reform
is inadequate because it cannot translate conventional policy approaches
into the context of broader systems which prevents epistemological
self-reflection. That normalizes violence against the Other which only
serves to **[reify]{.underline}** the affs impacts\-\--only the alt can
solve by confronting the deeper **[epistemological
assumptions]{.underline}** of the aff that allow for **[a more accurate
version]{.underline}** for implementation and disrupts the system of
securitization\-\--that's Ahmed

### 2NC\-\--Framework

The NEG can test the AFF's consequences or ideological underpinnings.
Debates about political ideology are logically **[prior]{.underline}**
to the aff's security policy. The question of what we should do imports
presuppositions about political subjectivity\-\--if those
presuppositions are wrong, our diagnoses and prescriptions will also be
wrong, so they can't perm away our links. It also means they can't
access the case until they've defended their ideological principles.

Forget the focus on the **[how]{.underline}** of politics, we need to
focus on the **[why]{.underline}**. Learning how to make the existing
system more effective is **[unethical and epistemologically
bankrupt]{.underline}** if that system is violent, so we should learn to
ask why that system exists in the first place. That's enough to vote
neg, even if the alt solves nothing. Their version of debate turns us
into mindless automatons who parrot the policy-of-the-day without
considering the ideological or historical underpinnings.

Fairness---our interp is fair, the aff gets to choose their advantages
and impacts, so they should defend them.

If the 1AC is a package of securitized scholarship, it shouldn't be
included and you should vote neg.

#### The affirmative is foundationally grounded in a narrative about NATO cooperation set in opposition to the enemy Other and in the gaze of the West to generate a shared liberal democratic identity. This is a reason to reject the discourse and representations of the affirmative -- the scholarship is methodologically flawed.

[[To decision-makers locked in a competition with forces regarded as
representing communist otherness, it was imperative that countries of
Western Europe, Canada, and the US cultivate a sense of shared
liberal-democratic identity---set in opposition to
communism]{.underline}]{.mark}---among their peoples. In that context,
[[they sought to articulate a narrative of Western unity, and
disseminate it as widely as possible]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
countries of the Atlantic Alliance. As Erik Ringmar has argued,
identities are constructed, maintained, and transformed via the telling
of "constitutive" narratives.12 [[Narratives provide a set of meanings
within which an actor's identity]{.underline}]{.mark}, the situation
within which they are located and the actions deemed appropriate are
brought together.13 The process of telling constitutive narratives is
especially important during periods of fundamental transformation, when
new identities are being formed and old ones are being pressured to
evolve.14 [[In the eyes of Western leaders, the narrative of unity among
NATO members had to not only cultivate a sense of shared identity, but
also to delegitimize---by casting them as inconsistent with Western
identity---communist forces]{.mark}]{.underline} that were becoming
increasingly powerful in many allied states. Once again, some of the
most influential voices in favour of disseminating a narrative of
Western unity and using that to legitimize community-building practices
within NATO were its middle powers---particularly Canada. For instance,
the Canadian Foreign Minister, Lester Pearson, repeatedly argued in the
early 1950s that NATO's long-term goal had to be the creation of a
community of free nations in the Atlantic area. More broadly, Canadian
officials, together with NATO supporters from Norway, the Netherlands,
Denmark, and the UK, were acutely aware of the fact that, in order for
the alliance to be able to help build "a community of free nations"
united around liberal values, it had to find a way to help publics from
allied states transcend recent memories of war among Western states.
What was required, in other words, was a collective
reinterpretation---and a selective forgetting---of the recent past.15
After all, the newly identified enemy, communist Soviet Union, had
emerged from the war as a hero in the eyes of many in the West. [[The
view of the "West as one" became central to a collective (re)reading of
Western history following the establishment of the alliance.16
Collective efforts at history (re)writing found expression not only
within the public discourse articulated by NATO, but also in
confidential documents]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recently declassified
documents from the 1950s reveal a set of shared understandings among
NATO's decision-makers regarding the way in which the history of member
states should be interpreted in order to foster a sense of Western
community. In addition, [[NATO mobilized its substantial material and
symbolic power to widely disseminate the discourse on Western
unity]{.underline}]{.mark} in all the allied states and, simultaneously,
[[to delegitimize alternative readings of
history]{.underline}]{.mark}---especially those that focused on ideas of
solidarity---and memories of friendship---with the Soviet Union.17 In
particular, as Patrick Jackson has demonstrated, [[the discourse of
Western civilization played a key role]{.underline}]{.mark} in
orchestrating the collective (re)reading of Germany as a member of the
Western community, and on this basis legitimating its incorporation into
NATO. This is not to suggest that the West was an essential entity that
objectively determined a field of outcomes. Rather, "[[Western
civilization" needs to be understood as "rhetorical commonplace," used
by allied policymakers as a discursive resource for de-legitimating
policy options]{.underline}]{.mark} opposed to Germany's incorporation
into American-led institutions.18 In the official NATO discourse,
Germany was interpreted as a member of the Western family that, under
the Nazi regime, had temporarily deviated from its core values.
Following the end of that regime, however, (West) Germany---acting under
the close supervision of allied states---could and should be
reintegrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. Against the background of
the constitutive discourse on Western unity, disagreements and tensions
that continued to occur among member states could be represented as
"family" feuds, and managed within the framework of shared norms and a
persisting sense of community. A full analysis of inter-allied
disagreements during the Cold War is beyond the scope of this paper.
However, it is worthwhile to briefly examine what could be seen as one
of the most significant set of disagreements within NATO: arguments
concerning the accession to the alliance of states that did not comply
with the liberal-democratic norms and values around which the Western
community defined itself. Particularly interesting were arguments over
the inclusion of Portugal in 1949, as well as the accession of Greece
and especially Turkey (completed in 1952). In that context, middle
powers like Canada and Norway emerged as strong proponents of the view
that countries which did not respect basic liberal-democratic values did
not belong---and should not be included---in the alliance which
represented the Western community.19 In the end, however, all the allies
were persuaded to support the inclusion of those "problem" countries.
Several factors were crucial to the emergence of that consensus: a
shared recognition among the allies of the geostrategic importance of
those countries in the context of growing confrontation with the Soviet
Union, and a sense that, in that particular context, the inclusion of
strategically vital but normatively deviant states was an acceptable
compromise in the name of protecting the community of liberal values.
The prevailing view came to be that the integration of states like
Portugal and Turkey could be managed in a way that would not necessarily
endanger the core values of the West. Furthermore, inclusion into the
Western community was seen by some allied policymakers as a course of
action that could help those countries evolve into stable liberal
democracies. It is revealing, in fact, that a normative compromise that
was eventually seen as reasonable in the cases of Portugal and Turkey
was regarded as inappropriate in the case of a country whose political
regime was perceived as an active threat to liberal-democratic values:
Franco's Spain.20 As Mark Smith put it, "Turkey could be accommodated,
and Portugal's dictatorship had less Fascistic origins than Spain's.
Significantly, neither had a history of active antagonism toward Western
European liberalism. Admitting Franco would be admitting a regime of the
very sort that had overturned European democracy in the 1930s and 1940s,
and as such was wholly unacceptable."21 The end of the Cold War was
accompanied by a sense of triumph by the West over its defining other,
and, as a corollary to this, a shared view among allied decision-makers
that a new security environment was emerging in Europe. In a context
marked by the breakdown of the Soviet bloc and the eruption of violence
linked to ethnic conflict and the breakdown of states (most notably in
the former Yugoslavia), there was a shift away from definitions of
security focused on military power, and toward a heavy emphasis on "good
governance" within states. In essence, [[security came to be associated
with the liberal-democratic norms and institutions]{.underline}]{.mark};
negatively, [[risks came to be seen as emerging from the absence of
liberal-democratic
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}.[22](javascript:popRef('fn23-0020702019834645'))

#### NATOs core identity is the expression and military guarantor of Western civilization -- continually heightening threat perceptions and producing foundational narratives of collective unity toward a common purpose of securitization

Bearing these arguments of critical constructivist approaches in mind,
it is of central interest, then, how [[NATO is 'able to mobilize its
longstanding identity as the expression and military guarantor of
Western civilization' closely connected to the democratic and capitalist
bonds among its member countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (Neumann and
Williams, 2000, p. 361; italics added). [[It goes without saying that a
common threat perception during the heydays of the Cold War has
tightened these bonds.]{.underline}]{.mark} However, it does not explain
how Western security cooperation was made possible in the first place
and why it lasted for over 60 years, including the phase of detente ´ in
the 1970s. Hence, the key shortcoming of realist, liberal, and
institutionalist approaches to NATO is that they take the actor's
articulations of threats and interests at face value, while a critical
approach directs our attention to how actors invoke threats, interest,
and identities and to what kind of institutional consequences are made
possible by these acts (Klein, 1990, pp. 315, 317; Jackson, 2003, p.
224). Such a perspective on the usage of concepts and their meaning is
interested in the ways and forms of inscribing plots, characters,
relations, and motives for action. As Trine Flockhart (2012, p. 80)
writes, [['\[n\]arratives describe the history, purpose and achievements
of a collective entity such as NATO, and they contribute in the process
towards its unity and facilitate its continuous
transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}'. These I will call foundational
narratives. Foundational refers to two related aspects characteristic of
most political narratives: first, it directs our attention to the
justifications why something exists. In NATO's case this refers to the
justifications mobilized by the allies in order to found and keep an
'alliance', i.e. to construct meaningful stories about what 'NATO' is
and how its past, present, and future are to be described.
[[Foundational narratives are answers to 'why'- questions -- questions
such as 'why do we still need NATO?'. Second, the term 'foundational'
emphasizes the taken-for-grantedness of these
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}s. Narratives are foundational when they
restore unity in the light of (more or less) serious 'identity crises'
where constructions of common representations appear as problematic.
References to a 'global war on terrorism', for example, where military
intervention and preemption is articulated as necessary, altered the
organizational design of NATO in many ways. [[Within these discursive
patterns the continuing relevance of a transatlantic alliance was never
really questioned, irrespective of whether NATO was defined as a system
of collective defense or a forum for political consultation. Understood
in this way, foundational narratives are powerful and consequential in
the sense that they enable and constrain the re-constitution of
political subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Studies on Security, 1:1, 29-34

Particularly, [Burke]{.underline} suggests that security cosmopolitanism
'rejects a procedural faith in strongly post-Westphalian forms of
government and democracy' (p. 17) and [reiterates that such an approach
includes 'no automatic faith in any one institutional
design']{.underline} (p. 24). This seems to move away from one of the
prominent critiques of, in Anna Agathangelou and Ling's (2009) words,
the 'neoliberal imperium,' as reliant on Western, liberal notions of
governance to the detriment of those on whom such a form of government
is imposed. Burke clearly problematizes this imposition, framing many of
the serious problems in global politics as a result of 'choices that
create destructive dynamics and constraints' (p. 15) at least in part by
Western, liberal governments -- characterizing modernity as culpable for
insecurity. [At the same time, [the solution seems]{.mark} to be clearly
**[situated within the discursive framework of the
problem]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Burke suggests that there should be a
primary concern for 'effectiveness, equality, fairness, and justice --
not for states, per se, but for human beings, and the global biosphere'
(p. 24). Unless the only problem with modernity is the post- Westphalian
structure of the state (which this approach does not eschew, but claims
not to privilege), then this statement of values might entrench the
problem. Many of the ideas of equality, fairness, and justice that come
to mind with the (somewhat rehearsed) use of those words in progressive
politics are inseparable from an ethos of enlightenment modernity. This
may be problematic on a number of levels. First, [[it may **fail to
interrupt** the series of choices that]{.mark}]{.underline} Burke
suggests [[produce]{.mark} [a cycle of insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Second, it may fold back onto itself in the recommendations that
security cosmopolitanism produces. This especially concerned me in
Burke's discussion of how to end 'dangerous processes,' where [[he
places]{.mark} 'greater [faith in]{.mark} the]{.underline} ethical,
normative, and [[legal suppression of dangerous
processes]{.underline}]{.mark} and actions than in formalistic or
procedural solutions' (p. 24). It seems to me that there is a good
argument that '[**[suppression' is itself a 'dangerous
process]{.underline}**,[']{.underline}]{.mark} [yet [Burke's framework
**does not**]{.mark} **really [include a mechanism for internal
critique]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Another problem that seems to confound
security cosmopolitanism is evaluating the relationships between power,
governance, and governmentality. There are certainly several ways in
which Burke uses a notion of the state that distinguishes security
cosmopolitanism from the mainstream neoliberal literature. For example,
he characterizes the 'state as an entity whose national survival depends
on its global participation, obligations, and depen- dencies,' (citing
Burke 2013a, 5). This view of the state sees it as not only
survival-seeking (in the neo-neo synthesis sense) but also dependent on
its positive interactions with other states for survival. Burke's
approach to government/governance initially appears to be global rather
than state-based, another potentially transformative move. For example,
he sees the job of security cosmopolitanism as to 'theorize and defend
norms for the respon- sible conduct and conceptualization of global
security governance' (p. 21). At the same time, later in the article,
Burke suggests entrenching the current structure of the state. His
practical approach of looking for the 'solidarity of the governing with
the governed' seems to simultaneously interrogate the current power
structures and reify them. Burke says: Such a 'solidarity of the
governed' that engages in a 'practical interrogation of power' ought to
be a significant feature of security cosmopolitanism. At the same time,
however, security cosmopolitanism must be concerned with improving the
global governance of security by elites and experts. (p. 21) [[This
attachment to the improvement of existing structures]{.mark} of
governance [seems to be at the heart]{.mark} of what I see as [the
**failure of the radical potential**]{.mark} in the idea of security
cosmopolitanism.]{.underline} When discussing how the power dynamics
between the elite and the subordinated might change, Burke suggests that
'voluntary renunciation of the privileges and powers of both state and
corporate sovereignty will no doubt be a necessary feature of such an
order' (p. 25). [Relying on the voluntary renunciation of power by the
powerful seems both unrealistic and not particularly theoretically
innovative. [This seems to be]{.mark} at [the]{.mark} center of a
[paradox]{.mark} inherent in security cosmopolitanism: [Faith in
the]{.mark} Western liberal [state is insidious, but the]{.mark} Western
liberal [state does not have to be.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Modernity
causes insecurity, but need not be discarded fully]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Some universalizations are dangerous, others are benign. [Dangerous
processes must be stopped, even if by dangerous processes]{.underline}.
Moral entrepreneurship is the key, but ther e is no clear foundation for
what counts as moral. The security cosmopolitanism critique is inspired
by consequentialism, but lacks deontological foundations despite
deontological implications. Burke calls for (and indeed demands) to
'take responsibility for it' (p. 23) in terms of 'both formal and moral
accountability' (p. 24). In so doing, he endorses (Booth's vision of)
'moral progress' (p. 25), despite understanding the insidious deployment
of various notions of moral progress by others. [[Security
cosmopolitanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[is a proclamation
for]{.mark} radical [change that is]{.mark}]{.underline} initially
[**[stalled by its internal contradictions]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} further ~~handicapped~~ [[stalled by its lack
of capacity to enact]{.mark} the very sort of radical
[change]{.mark}]{.underline} Burke sees it as fundamental to righting
the wrongs he sees in the world. [[The result seems to be
the]{.underline}]{.mark} (potential) [**[reification of existing]{.mark}
governments/[governmentality]{.mark}** [through]{.mark} what essentially
appears to be a]{.underline} non-anthropocentric '[[human
security']{.mark} which cannot be clearly distinguished from current
notions of human security]{.underline} (p. 15). [[It]{.mark} appears to
[remain top-down]{.mark} and without clear moral foundation [while
claiming]{.mark} significant [improvement]{.mark} over existing
approaches]{.underline}. **[[This]{.mark} [appearance/]{.mark}seduction

[insidious]{.mark} [than]{.mark}]{.underline}** the

**Neocleous 8** \[Mark Neocleous, Prof. of Government @ Brunel, Critique
of Security, 185-6\]

[[The only way]{.underline}]{.mark} out of such a dilemma, [[to escape
the **fetish**, is]{.mark} perhaps [to **eschew the logic of security**
]{.mark}**altogether** -- to reject it as so ideologically
loaded]{.underline} in favour of the state [that any real political
thought]{.underline} other than the authoritarian and reactionary
[should be pressed to give it up]{.underline}. That is clearly something
that can not be achieved within the limits of bourgeois thought and thus
could never even begin to be imagined by the security intellectual. It
is also something that the constant iteration of the refrain 'this is an
insecure world' and reiteration of one fear, anxiety and insecurity
after another will also make it hard to do. But [it is something that
the critique of security suggests we may have to consider if we want a
political way out of]{.underline} the impasse of [security]{.underline}.
This impasse exists because [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} has now
become so all-encom passing that it [[**marginalises all else**, most
notably]{.underline}]{.mark} the constructive conﬂicts,
[**[debates]{.mark} and discussions that animate political
life**.]{.underline} The con stant [prioritising]{.underline} of a
mythical [security as a political end -- as the political end --
**constitutes a rejection of politics**]{.underline} in any meaningful
sense of the term. That is, as a mode of action in which differences can
be articulated, in which the conﬂicts and struggles that arise from such
differences can be fought for and negotiated, in which [people might
come to believe that another world is possible -- that they might
transform the world and in turn be transformed.]{.underline} [Security
politics simply removes this; worse, it removes it while purportedly
addressing it]{.underline}. In so doing it suppresses all issues of
power and turns political questions into debates about the most efﬁcient
way to achieve 'security', despite the fact that we are never quite told
-- never could be told -- what might count as having achieved it.
[Security politics is,]{.underline} in this sense, an [anti-politics,141
dominating political discourse in much the same manner as the security
state tries to dominate human beings, reinforcing security
fetishism]{.underline} and the monopolistic character of security on the
political imagination. [[We]{.mark} therefore **[need to get beyond
security]{.mark} politics,** **[not add yet more 'sectors' to
it]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a way that simply expands the scope of the
state and legitimises state intervention in yet more and more areas of
our lives. Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael
Williams, co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in
which the latter asks: if you take away security, what do you put in the
hole that's left behind? But I'm inclined to agree with Dalby: maybe
there is no hole.142 [[The mistake has been to think that there is a
hole]{.mark} and that this hole needs [to be ﬁlled with a]{.mark} new
vision or [**revision of security**]{.mark} in which it is **re-mapped
or civilised** or gendered or humanised or expanded]{.underline} or
whatever. All of [**[these]{.mark} ultimately [remain within the
statist]{.mark} political [imaginary,]{.mark}** [and
]{.mark}]{.underline}consequently end up **[[re afﬁrm]{.mark}ing [the
state]{.mark} as the terrain of modern politics]{.underline}**, the
grounds of security. [The real task is not to ﬁll the supposed hole with
yet another vision of security, but to ﬁght for an **alternative
political language** which takes us beyond the narrow horizon of
bourgeois security and which therefore does not constantly throw us into
the arms of the state. That's the point of critical politics: to develop
a new political language]{.underline} more adequate to the kind of
society we want. Thus while much of what I have said here has been of a
negative order, part of the tradition of critical theory is that the
negative may be as signiﬁcant as the positive in setting thought on new
paths. For if security really is the supreme concept of bourgeois
society and the fundamental thematic of liberalism, then to keep harping
on about insecurity and [to]{.underline} keep
[demand]{.underline}ing['more [security']{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}(while meekly hoping that this increased security doesn't
damage our liberty) [[is]{.mark} to]{.underline} ~~blind~~
[**[oblivious]{.mark} ourselves [to]{.mark} the possibility of building
[real alternatives]{.mark} to the authoritarian tendencies in
contemporary politics**. To situate ourselves against security politics
would allow us to circumvent the debilitating effect achieved through
the constant securitising of social and political issues]{.underline},
debilitating in the sense that 'security' helps consolidate the power of
the existing forms of social domination and justiﬁes the
short-circuiting of even the most democratic forms. [It would also allow
us to **forge another kind of politics** centred on a different con
ception of the good]{.underline}. We need a new way of thinking and
talking about social being and politics that moves us beyond security.
[This would perhaps be emancipatory in the true sense of the word. What
this might mean]{.underline}, precisely, [must be open to debate. But it
certainly requires recognising that security is an illusion that has
forgotten it is an illusion]{.underline}; it requires recognising that
security is not the same as solidarity; it requires accepting that
insecurity is part of the human condition, and thus giving up the search
for the certainty of security and instead learning to tolerate the
uncertainties, ambiguities and 'insecurities' that come with being
human; it requires accepting that '[securitizing' an issue does not mean
dealing with it politically, but bracketing it out and handing it to the
state; it requires us to be brave enough to return the
gift]{.underline}.143

[Cognitive approaches concede]{.underline} that [real-life [decision
makers cannot comply with]{.mark} the expectation of [full
rationality]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, political [decision makers
adopt]{.underline} a number of [strategies to deal with]{.underline} the
[limitations imposed]{.underline} on them [by]{.underline} their
[cognitive capabilities]{.underline}. It is important to remember that
[such strategies]{.underline} are, to a certain extent, necessary and
unavoidable. They facilitate information processing and enable actors to
make decisions. However, they may also [lead to misperception and
error]{.underline}. A number of processes are particularly relevant. The
[[study of problem solving has proven the need to pay]{.mark} [attention
to]{.mark} actors' **[definitions of the
problem]{.mark}**.]{.underline}51 [Studies of]{.underline} the
limitations of [memory have drawn attention to the problem of
information overload in]{.underline} both [problem solving]{.underline}
and decision making. Most important, the [development of the concepts of
'cognitive dissonance' versus 'cognitive consistency']{.underline} by
Leon Festinger and Fritz Heider in the 1950s and 1960s has [served to
emphasize the need for stability in beliefs]{.underline} and
perceptions, while at the same time alerting us to the costs of such
stabilit y: "misperception and biased interpretation, with individuals
using denial, bolstering, or other mechanisms to maintain their
beliefs."52 According to Robert Art and Robert Jervis, "\[[[P\]eople
simplify]{.mark} their [processing]{.mark} of complex [information by
permitting]{.mark} their [established frameworks]{.mark} of beliefs [to
guide them]{.mark}]{.underline}. They can then assimilate incoming
information to what they already believe."53 Thus [[there exists "a
tendency]{.mark} for people [to assimilate]{.mark} incoming [information
into their **pre-existing images**]{.mark}]{.underline}**."** 54
[This]{.underline} tendency [is]{.underline} explained by psychological
theor y as [part of a strategy to avoid cognitive dissonance. There is
little to stop this tendency, because "[information is]{.mark} usually
**[ambiguous enough]{.mark}** so [that people can **see it as consistent
with the views** that they already
hold]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}55 Voss and Dorsey observe that
["individuals build mental representations of the world]{.underline} and
. . . [such [representations provide]{.mark} coherence and
[stability]{.mark} to their interpretations of the complexities of the
environment]{.underline}."56 So-called [image theory studies the role
played [in the decision-making process by]{.mark} such **[interpretive
"blueprints]{.mark}**]{.underline}," which have been variously called
"images," "schemata," "scripts," or "mental models."57 The concept of
"image," which is most commonly used in foreign policy analysis,
captures the notion of a schema, which is more popular in cognitive
psychology. In the 1950s, Kenneth Boulding defined the term image as
"the total cognitive, affective, and evaluative structure of the
behavioral unit, or its internal view of itself and its universe."58 He
argued that "the images which are important in international systems are
those which a nation has of itself and of those other bodies in the
system which constitute its international environment."59 [Images can
introduce misperception and error into the decision-making process,
especially if they function as stereotypes]{.underline}. Stereot ypes
can be defined as "images that are assumed to have attributes that
characterize all elements of a particular group."60 [The role of
stereotypical images, such as [the "**enemy image**]{.mark}," has been
explored]{.underline} by authors such as Ole Holsti, Richard Cottam, or
David Finlay and his colleagues. 61 [Such studies find that stereot
yping generally [leads to "over-generalization]{.mark},]{.underline}
that is, [erroneously attributing characteristics to a particular countr
y]{.underline} that may not have one or more of the given
characteristics. The countries are thus not sufficiently
differentiated."62 According to Holsti, "\[[T\]he relationship of
national images to international conf lict is clear: decision-makers act
upon their definition of the situation and their images of
states]{.underline}---others as well as their own[. These images are in
turn dependent upon the decision-maker's belief system, and these may or
may not be accurate representations of 'reality]{.underline}.'"63 [The
impact of stereot ypical national images in policy making was
particularly obvious during the Cold War, when Boulding referred to them
as "the last great stronghold of unsophistication" in international
politics]{.underline}, observing that "nations are divided into 'good'
and 'bad'---the enemy is all bad, one's own nation is of spotless
virtue."64 [The bipolar system was commonly characterized as a "closed"
one, in which "perceptions of low hostilit y are self-liquidating and
perceptions of high hostilit y are self-fulfilling]{.underline}."65 This
is because [both sides continue to interpret new information in ways
that help preserve the enemy image, even if such information is meant to
constitute a conciliatory gesture.]{.underline} Closed systems suffer
from the dangerous problem of distorted "mirror images." Urie
Bronfenbrenner explains: [Herein lies the terrible danger of the
[distorted mirror image]{.mark}, for it is characteristic of such images
that they [are self-confirming;]{.mark} that is, each part y, often
against its own wishes, is increasingly driven to behave in a manner
which fulfills the expectations of the other. . . . \[The mirror image\]
impels each nation to act in a manner which confirms and enhances the
fear of the other to the point that even deliberate efforts to reverse
the process are reinterpreted as evidence of
confirmation.]{.underline}66 (128-130)

#### Performative contradiction isn't a unique voter -- it allows us to prevent a sedimentation of knowledge -- constant fear of it causes people to not write what is important but what doesn't contradict

[In other words, the [disciplines]{.mark} and sub-disciplines quite
literally [organize themselves around]{.mark} aporias and
[paradoxes]{.mark}. They achieve a]{.underline} \[\*925\] [respectable
formalization [not because they \"know\" anything]{.mark}, [but because
they are organized so]{.mark} that [they don\'t have]{.mark} to know
about the [contradictions]{.mark}]{.underline}, aporias, and paradoxes
that surround them and that effectively define and limit their
intellectual jurisdiction. As an example, [[consider]{.mark} the role of
the [perf]{.mark}ormative [con]{.mark}tradiction]{.underline}. Until
very recently, [the worst thing one could do in academic thought was to
get caught in a performative contradiction]{.underline}. Not
surprisingly, [[after]{.mark} decades of [striving to avoid
per]{.mark}formative [con]{.mark}tradictions, [we have a
sedimented]{.mark} academic structure and sedimented
\"[knowledges]{.mark}\" all nicely arranged in discursive formations
constituted to avoid performative contradictions. But after decades of
avoiding performative contradictions, [there is now a new concern: where
don\'t you go, what do you miss]{.mark}, if you keep trying to avoid
performative contradictions?]{.underline} And, of course, there is a
political angle to all this. After all, fear of performative
contradiction discourages and marginalizes reflexive inquiry into the
status of our own statements and our own knowledges. Fear of
performative contradiction thus has a conservative effect. And what is
conserved, of course, is the jurisdictional and structural integrity of
our knowledges. But, of course, because this integrity depends upon such
a truncated definition and establishment of the knowledges and the
disciplines, it is almost a joke: integrity as joke.

You know [the old line]{.underline}: \"you can\'t be too thin or too
rich?\" The foreign policy equivalent would be \"[you can\'t be too
secure]{.underline}.\"  Because there is no agency or institution that
can protect states from each other, [[realists]{.mark} generally [view
security as the highest aim]{.mark} of state]{.underline}s. The need for
security encourages governments to remain watchful about emerging
dangers and to avoid squandering resources unnecessarily on fanciful
projects or special indulgences. The need to compete effectively in the
harsh world of international politics imposes a certain discipline on
domestic political quarrels, and encourages competing parties to limit
partisan backbiting for the good of the country.  When people say that
\"politics stops at the water\'s edge,\" that\'s what they are talking
about.   Nonetheless, [[**being too secure has a downside**: It allows
U.S. politicians to do]{.mark} and say a lot [of]{.mark} ~~stupid~~
[\[bad\] things]{.mark} without thinking that they might actually be
putting the country at risk.]{.underline} Case in point: the Republican
Party\'s absurd
[objections](http://washingtonindependent.com/81743/outright-misreadings-fuel-gop-opposition-to-new-start)
to [the New Start
[treaty](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/04/08/new-start-treaty-and-protocol)]{.underline}
with Russia, which seem to be based solely on the desire to prevent the
Obama administration from logging even a modest political success.   The
New Start treaty is not a major strategic breakthrough, but that\'s just
the point. It\'s a modest agreement that will save us some money in the
long-term, reduce strategic uncertainty, make it easier to enlist
Russian cooperation on other issues, and make the United States look a
bit less hypocritical when we try to convince other states to forego
nuclear weapons themselves. But none of that matters to today\'s Grand
Obstructionist Party (GOP) leaders, in sharp contrast to isolated
Republic moderates like Richard Lugar (R-IN) or veteran officials like
Henry Kissinger or James Baker, all of whom support the treaty.   [But
the taproot of this foolishness isn\'t just the poisonous
know-nothingism]{.underline} of today\'s Republican Party. **[The
underlying permissive condition for this behavior is America\'s
extraordinarily secure international position.
[Although]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[we are constantly bombarded with
alarmist reports about grave dangers facing the nation from
outside]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [remains]{.mark}
remarkably [secure]{.mark}]{.underline}** compared with other states.
[The U.S. economy is still the world\'s largest and most diverse,
despite its recent woes, and it is still more than twice as large as the
number 2 and number 3 economic powers (China and Japan]{.underline}). We
spend more on national security than the rest of the world put together,
are [the only state with global power projection capabilities, and have
the world\'s most sophisticated nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. Many of
the world\'s significant military powers are our allies, so our actual
lead is even greater. [There are no major powers near to our shores, and
we are insulated from many global problems by two enormous oceanic
moats.   **The United States does face a modest problem from terrorist
groups like Al Qaeda, but that is due in good part to our own
ill-advised meddling in the Middle East**]{.underline} and elsewhere.
And assuming [it never acquires a nuclear weapon]{.underline} (which we
can prevent by working with others to enhance nuclear security around
the world**[), Al Qaeda is not an existential threat]{.underline}** to
our prosperity or way of life. **[Even if all their thwarted plots had
succeeded-]{.underline}**-and I\'m very glad they didn\'t\--[the damage
would pale in comparison to the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars]{.underline}. Indeed, if history is any guide, international
**[terrorism at its worst poses [less
threat](http://www.amazon.com/Overblown-Politicians-Terrorism-Industry-National/dp/1416541713)
to American life than]{.underline}** auto accidents**[, nut allergies,
or falling in a bathtub]{.underline}**.   In short, although **[[perfect
security is beyond anyone\'s grasp, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[is as secure as any state could ever]{.mark} expect to
[be]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That\'s a wonderful thing for us Americans,
but [it has at least two negative consequences. First, because [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates doesn\'t have to worry very much about
protecting its own shores from a serious military challenge, it is free
to [run around the world getting involved in various
problems,]{.mark}]{.underline} even when it has lost sight of any
underlying strategic rationale and has no clear idea why it is doing
these things. For example, when you are really secure, very powerful,
and have a lot of wealth to draw upon, you can keep
[extending](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/17/nato-combat-role-in-afgha_n_784680.html)
the deadline in places like Afghanistan almost indefinitely, even when
**[[the costs of doing so far outweigh any]{.mark} likely
[benefits.]{.mark}   ]{.underline}**The second problem with being too
secure is [[that it allows politicians to use foreign policy as a
partisan political football]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to indulge special
interests and other ideological fixations. **[[When a state faces real
dangers]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- as the United States did during World
War II or the Cold War \-- it **[[has to set priorities]{.mark}
carefully and [avoid squandering]{.mark} resources on
whims]{.underline}**. **[But [when]{.mark} a state is as secure as
America is today, then [partisan politics]{.mark} will [loom
larger]{.mark} and become nastier]{.underline}**. Without a \"clear and
present danger\" to focus the national mind, presidents find it harder
to face down pressure from groups with strong but focused agendas,
whether the issue on the table is defense spending, Middle East policy,
or trade. Moreover, exploiting foreign policy issues in order to bash
the president doesn\'t seem to place the country in immediate danger, so
members of the opposition can do so without being accused of
compromising national security.   Don\'t get me wrong: [I\'m not arguing
that the United States would be better off if we faced a really serious
external threat again. On balance, I\'d rather be strong, wealthy, and
insulated from major dangers. But there is a real cost to our present
condition: we end up doing a lot of things we shouldn\'t, and we don\'t
do a lot of things we should. The end result is that our position in the
world will gradually erode, and then we\'ll have to start taking this
stuff seriously again.]{.underline}

### A2: Short Timeframe

#### We have time to think about it\-\--its your role to expose the fantasy of short-termism

Pinar **Bilgin 4** IR @ Bilikent AND Adam David MORTON Senior Lecturer
and Fellow of the Centre for the Study of Social and Global Justice IR @
Nottingham"From 'Rogue' to 'Failed' States? The Fallacy of
Short-termism" Politics 24 (3) p. Wiley Interscience

[[Calls for alternative]{.mark} approache[s]{.mark} to the phenomenon of
state failure [are]{.mark} often [met with the criticism
that]{.mark} such [alternatives could only work in the long term]{.mark}
whereas [\'something\' needs to be done]{.mark} here and [now]{.mark}.
Whilst recognising the need for immediate action[, it is the role of
the political scientist to point to the fallacy of
\'short-termism\']{.mark} in the conduct of current policy.
Short-termism is defined by Ken Booth (1999, p. 4) as \'approaching
security issues within the time frame of the next election, not the next
generation\'. Viewed as such, short-termism is the enemy of true
strategic thinking. The latter requires policymakers to rethink their
long-term goals and take small steps towards achieving them. [It]{.mark}
also [requires heeding against]{.mark} taking [steps that might]{.mark}
eventually [be]{.mark}come [**self-defeating**.  The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} presently [fought three wars
against]{.mark} two of [its]{.mark} Cold War [allies]{.mark} in the
post-Cold War era, namely, the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein and the
Taliban in Afghanistan. Both were supported in an attempt to preserve
the delicate balance between the United States and
the Soviet Union. The Cold War policy of [supporting client
regimes]{.mark} has eventually [backfired]{.mark} in that US
[policymakers now have to face]{.mark} the [instability they]{.mark}
have [caused. Hence the need for]{.mark} a comprehensive
[understanding]{.mark} of state failure and [the role]{.mark} [Western
states]{.mark} have [played]{.mark} in failing them [through]{.mark}
varied forms of [intervention]{.mark}. Although some commentators may
judge that the road to the existing situation is paved with good
intentions, a truly strategic approach to the problem of international
terrorism requires a more sensitive consideration of the
medium-to-long-term implications of state building in different parts of
the world whilst also addressing the root causes of the problem of state
\'failure\'.  Developing this line of argument further, reflection on
different socially relevant meanings of \'state failure\' in relation to
different time increments shaping policymaking might convey alternative
considerations. In line with John Ruggie (1998, pp. 167--170), divergent
issues might then come to the fore when viewed through the different
lenses of particular time increments. Firstly, viewed through the lenses
of an incremental time frame, more immediate concerns to policymakers
usually become apparent when linked to precocious assumptions about
terrorist networks, banditry and the breakdown of social order within
failed states. Hence relevant players and events are readily identified
(al-Qa\'eda), their attributes assessed (axis of evil,
\'strong\'/\'weak\' states) and judgements made about their long-term
significance (war on terrorism). The key analytical problem for
policymaking in this narrow and blinkered domain is the one of choice
given the [constraints of time and energy]{.mark} devoted to a
particular decision. These factors [lead policymakers to **bring
conceptual baggage to bear**]{.mark} on an issue
[that]{.mark} simplifies but also [distorts information]{.mark}.  Taking
a second temporal form, that of a conjunctural time frame, policy
[responses are subject to more fundamental epistemological
concerns]{.mark}. Factors assumed to be constant within an incremental
time frame are more variable and it is more difficult to produce
an intended effect on ongoing processes than it is on actors and
discrete events. For instance, how long should the \'war on terror\' be
waged for? Areas of policy in this realm can therefore begin to become
more concerned with the underlying forces that shape current
trajectories.  Shifting attention to a third temporal form draws
attention to still different dimensions. Within an epochal time frame an
agenda still in the making appears that requires a shift in
decision-making, away from a conventional problem-solving mode \'wherein
doing nothing is favoured on burden-of-proof grounds\', towards a
risk-averting mode, characterised by prudent contingency measures. To
conclude, in relation to \'failed states\', the latter time
frame entails reflecting on the very structural conditions
shaping the problems of \'failure\' raised throughout the present
discussion, which will demand lasting and
delicate attention frompractitioners across the academy and policymaking
communities alike. ]{.underline}

To conclude this chapter, [while]{.underline} modernist and
[postmodernist [debates continue, while we are]{.mark} still [unsure as
to what we can legitimately identify as]{.mark} a]{.underline} feminist
[[ethical]{.mark}/political concern, [while we still are unclear about
the relationship between discourse and experience]{.mark}, **[it
is]{.mark}**]{.underline} particularly
**[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}** for feminists **[[that we proceed
with analysis of]{.underline}]{.mark}** both **[[the]{.mark}
material]{.underline}** ([[institutional]{.underline}]{.mark} and
structural) [[as well as the discursive]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This
holds]{.underline} not only for feminists, but [for all theorists
oriented towards the goal of extending further moral inclusion [in
the]{.mark} present social sciences [climate of epistemological
uncertainty. **Important**]{.mark}]{.underline} ethical/[**[political
concerns hang in the balance. We cannot afford to wait]{.mark} for the
meta-theoretical questions to be conclusively answered**. Those answers
may be unavailable.]{.underline} [[Nor can we wait for]{.mark} a
credible vision of an alternative]{.underline} institutional [order to
appear before an]{.underline} emancipatory [agenda can be kicked into
gear. Nor do we have before us a]{.underline} chicken and egg [question
of which comes first: [sorting out]{.mark} the [meta]{.mark}theoretical
[issues]{.mark} or working out which practices contribute to a credible
institutional vision. [The]{.mark} two]{.underline} [[questions can and
should]{.mark} [be pursued together]{.mark}, and can be
[via]{.mark}]{.underline} moral [[imagination]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Imagination can help us think beyond discursive and material
conditions]{.mark} which limit us, [by pushing]{.mark} the
[boundaries]{.mark} of those limitations in thought [and examining what
yields]{.mark}. In this respect, I believe international ethics as
pragmatic critique can be a useful ally to feminist and normative
theorists generally.

Roland **Bleiker 14**, Professor of International Relations, University
of Queensland, "International Theory Between Reification and
Self-Reflective Critique," International Studies Review, 16(2),
6-17-2014, p.325-327

This book is part of an increasing trend of scholarly works that have
embraced poststructural critique but want to ground it in more positive
political foundations, while retaining a reluctance to return to the
positivist tendencies that implicitly underpin much of constructivist
research. The path that Daniel Levine has carved out is innovative,
sophisticated, and convincing. A superb scholarly achievement. For
Levine, [[the key challenge in]{.underline}]{.mark} international
relations ([[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}) [scholarship
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} what he calls ["unchecked reification": the
widespread and dangerous process of **[forgetting "the distinction
between]{.mark} theoretical [concepts and the]{.mark} real-world [things
they]{.mark} mean to [describe]{.mark}**]{.underline} or to which they
refer" (p. 15). [The **[dangers are real]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Levine
stresses, [because **IR deals with** some of the most difficult issues,
[from **genocides** to **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Upholding one
subjective position without critical scrutiny can]{.underline}]{.mark}
thus [[have **far-reaching consequences**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Following Theodor Adorno---who is the key theoretical influence on this
book---Levine takes a post-positive position and assumes that the world
cannot be known outside of our human perceptions and the values that are
inevitably intertwined with them. His ultimate goal is to overcome
reification, or, to be more precise, to recognize it as an inevitable
aspect of thought so that its dangerous consequences can be mitigated.
[Levine]{.underline} proceeds in three stages: First he reviews several
decades of IR theories to resurrect critical moments when scholars
displayed an acute awareness of the dangers of reification. He
refreshingly breaks down distinctions between conventional and
progressive scholarship, for he [detects self-reflective and critical
moments in]{.underline} scholars that are usually associated with
[straightforward positivist positions]{.underline} (such as E.H. Carr,
Hans Morgenthau, or Graham Allison). But Levine also shows how these
moments of self-reflexivity never lasted long and were driven out by the
compulsion to offer systematic and scientific knowledge. The second
stage of Levine\'s inquiry [outlines why]{.underline} IR scholars
regularly closed down critique. Here, he points to a range of factors
and phenomena, from peer review processes to the speed at which
academics are meant to publish. And here too, he eschews conventional
wisdom, showing that work conducted in the wake of the third debate,
[while explicitly **post-positivist**]{.underline} and critiquing the
reifying tendencies of existing [**IR scholarship**, often **lacked
critical self-awareness**]{.underline}. As a result, Levine believes
that many of the [respective authors failed to appreciate sufficiently
that "reification is a consequence of all thinking---including
itself"]{.underline} (p. 68). The third objective of Levine\'s book is
also the most interesting one. Here, he outlines the path toward what he
calls "[sustainable **critique**]{.underline}": a form of
self-reflection that can counter the dangers of reification. Critique,
for him, [is **not just** something that is **directed outwards**,
against particular theories or theorists]{.underline}. [It is **also
inward**-oriented, ongoing, and sensitive to the "limitations of thought
itself"]{.underline} (p. 12). The challenges that such a sustainable
critique faces are formidable. Two stand out: First, if the natural
tendency to forget the origins and values of our concepts are as strong
as Levine and other Adorno-inspired theorists believe they are, then how
can we actually recognize our own reifying tendencies? Are we not all
inevitably and subconsciously caught in a web of meanings from which we
cannot escape? Second, if one constantly questions one\'s own
perspective, does one not fall into a relativism that loses the ability
to establish the kind of stable foundations that are necessary for
political action? Adorno has, of course, been critiqued as relentlessly
negative, even by his second-generation Frankfurt School successors
(from Jürgen Habermas to his IR interpreters, such as Andrew Linklater
and Ken Booth). The response that Levine has to these two sets of
legitimate criticisms are, in my view, both convincing and useful at a
practical level. [He starts off with depicting reification not as a flaw
that is meant to be expunged, but as an a priori condition for
scholarship]{.underline}. The challenge then is not to let it go
unchecked. [**[Methodological pluralism]{.mark}** lies at the heart
of]{.underline} Levine\'s [sustainable critique]{.underline}. He borrows
from what Adorno calls a "constellation": an attempt to **[[juxtapose,
rather than integrate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, different perspectives. It
is in this spirit that Levine advocates [**[multiple methods to
understand the same event]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### A2 Epistemology First

#### Indicts of our epistemology/knowledge production don't come before or disprove the case

**Jackson 2010** (Patrick Thaddeus Jackson, Associate Professor of
International Relations in the School of International Service at the
American University in Washington, DC, 2010, "The Conduct of Inquiry in
International Relations: Philosophy of Science and its Implications for
the Study of World Politics," ebook)

Faced with the impossibility of putting an end to the science question
within IR by turning to the philosophy of science, what should we do?
Since we cannot resolve the question of what science is by appealing to
a consensus in philosophy, [one option is [to]{.mark} become
philosophers of science ourselves, and to [spend our time]{.mark} and
our scholarly efforts [trying to resolve]{.mark} thorny and [abstract
issues about]{.mark} the status of theory and evidence and [the limits
of epistemic certainty]{.mark}.]{.underline} But [this is an unappealing
option for a scholarly field defined]{.underline}, if loosely, [by its
empirical focus (world politics), and]{.underline} it would be roughly
[akin to advising physicists to become philosophers of physics in order
to resolve the question of what physics was and whether it was a
science. This]{.underline} also [[**mis-states the relationship**
between **philosophical debates and**]{.mark} **scientific
[practice]{.mark}**; [practicing scientists have a pretty good]{.mark}
working definition of what it means for something to be "scientific,"
but this "is less a matter of strategy than of [**ongoing evaluative
practice**," conducted in]{.mark} the course of [everyday
knowledge-producing]{.mark} activities]{.underline} (Taylor 1996, 133).
We do not expect physicists to give philosophical answers to questions
about the scientific status of their scholarship; we expect them to
produce knowledge of the physical world. [Similarly, [we should
not]{.mark} expect IR scholars to [engage in "philosophy of IR" **to the
detriment** of generating knowledge about]{.mark} world [politics; the
latter]{.mark}, not the former, [is our main]{.mark} vocational
[task.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Weigh our specific evidence to get closer to the truth

**Kratochwil 2008** (Friedrich Kratochwil, professor of international
relations at European University Institute, 2008(Friedrich, "The Puzzles
of Politics," pg. 200-213)

In what follows, I claim that the shift in focus from "demonstration" to
science as practice provides strong prima facie reasons to choose
pragmatic rather than traditional epistemological criteria in social
analysis.

Irrespective of its various forms, [the epistemological project includes
an argument that all warranted knowledge has to satisfy certain field-
independent criteria that are specified by philosophy]{.underline} (a
"theory of know- ledge"). The real issue of how our concepts and the
world relate to each other, and on which non-idiosyncratic grounds we
are justified to hold on to our beliefs about the world, is "answered"
by two metaphors. The first is that of an inconvertible ground, be it
the nature of things, certain intuitions (Des- cartes' "clear and
distinct ideas") or methods and inferences; the second is that of a
"mirror" that shows what is the case.¶ There is no need to rehearse the
arguments demonstrating that these under- lying beliefs and metaphors
could not sustain the weight placed upon them. A "method" à la Descartes
could not make good on its claims, as it depended ultimately on the
guarantee of God that concepts and things in the outer world match. On
the other hand, the empiricist belief in direct observation forgot that
"facts" which become "data" are -- as the term suggests -- "made". They
are based on the judgements of the observer using cultural criteria,
even if they appear to be based on direct perception, as is the case
with colours.4¶ Besides, [there had always been a sneaking suspicion
that the [epistemological ideal of certainty]{.mark} and rigour [did
not]{.mark} quite [fit the social world]{.mark}]{.underline}, an
objection voiced first by humanists such as Vico, and later rehearsed in
the continuing controversies about erklären and verstehen (Weber 1991;
for a more recent treatment see Hollis 1994). In short, both the
constitutive nature of our concepts, and the value interest in which
they are embedded, raise peculiar issues of meaning and contestation
that are quite different from those of description. As Vico (1947)
suggested, we "understand" the social world because we have "made it", a
point raised again by Searle concerning both the crucial role played by
ascriptions of meaning (x counts for y) in the social world and the
distinction between institutional "facts" from "brute" or natural facts
(Searle 1995). Similarly, since values are constitutive for our
"interests", the concepts we use always portray an action from a certain
point of view; this involves appraisals and prevents us from accepting
allegedly "neutral" descriptions that would be meaningless. Thus, when
we say that someone "abandoned" another person and hence communicate a
(contestable) appraisal, we want to call attention to certain important
moral implica- tions of an act. [Attempting to eliminate the value-tinge
in the description and insisting that everything has to be cast in
neutral, "objective", observational language]{.underline} -- such as "he
opened the door and went through it" -- [would indeed make the statement
"pointless]{.underline}", even if it is (trivially) "true" (for a
powerful statement of this point, see Connolly 1983).¶ [The most
devastating attack on the epistemological project]{.underline}, however,
[came from the history of [science]{.mark} itself]{.underline}. [It not
only [corrected the naive view of knowledge]{.mark} generation
[as]{.mark} mere [accumulation of data, but]{.mark} it [also
cast]{.mark} increasing [doubt]{.mark} on the viability of various
[field-independent "demarcation criteria]{.mark}]{.underline}[".]{.mark}
This was, for the most part, derived from the old Humean argument that
only sentences with empirical content were "meaningful", while value
statements had to be taken either as statements about individual
preferences or as meaningless, since de gustibus non est disputandum. As
the later dis- cussion in the Vienna circle showed, this distinction was
utterly unhelpful (Popper 1965: ch. 2). It did not solve the problem of
induction, and failed to acknowledge that not all meaningful theoretical
sentences must correspond with natural facts.¶ Karl [Popper's ingenious
solution of making "refutability" the logical cri- terion and
interpreting empirical "tests" as a special mode of
deduction]{.underline} (rather than as a way of increasing supporting
evidence) seemed to respond to this epistemological quandary for a
while. An "historical reconstruction" of science as a progressive
development thus seemed possible, as did the specification of a
pragmatic criterion for conducting research.¶ Yet again, studies in the
history of science undermined both hopes. The different stages in
Popper's own intellectual development are, in fact, rather telling. He
started out with a version of conjectures and refutations that was based
on the notion of a more or less self-correcting demonstration. Con-
fronted with the findings that scientists did not use the refutation
criterion in their research, he emphasised then the role of the
scientific community on which the task of "refutation" devolved. Since
the individual scientist might not be ready to bite the bullet and admit
that she or he might have been wrong, colleagues had to keep him or her
honest. Finally, towards the end of his life, Popper began to rely less
and less on the stock of knowledge or on the scientists' shared
theoretical understandings -- simply devalued as the "myth of the
framework" -- and emphasised instead the processes of communica- tion
and of "translation" among different schools of thought within a scien-
tific community (Popper 1994). He still argued that these processes
follow the pattern of "conjecture and refutation", but the model was
clearly no longer that of logic or of scientific demonstration, but one
that he derived from his social theory -- from his advocacy of an "open
society" (Popper 1966). Thus a near total reversal of the ideal of
knowledge had occurred. While formerly everything was measured in terms
of the epistemological ideal derived from logic and physics, "knowledge"
was now the result of deliberation and of certain procedural notions for
assessing competing knowledge claims. Politics and law, rather than
physics, now provided the template.¶ Thus the history of [science has
gradually moved away from the epistemo- logical ideal to focus
increasingly on the actual practices of various scientific communities
engaged in knowledge production, particularly on how they handle
problems of scientific disagreement]{.underline}.5 [This [reorientation
implied]{.mark} a move away from field-independent criteria and from the
demonstrative [ideal]{.mark} to one [in which "arguments" and]{.mark}
the "[weight" of evidence had to be appraised]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, not only generated a bourgeoning
field of "science studies" and their "social" epistemologies (see Fuller
1991), but also [[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} more generally [that
the traditional [understandings of knowledge production based on]{.mark}
the model of "[theory" were in need of revision.]{.mark}]{.underline}¶
If the history of [[science]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
[[provides]{.mark} strong [reasons for a pragmatic
turn]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the discussion above illustrates, what
remains to be shown is how this turn relates to the historical,
linguistic and constructivist turns that preceded it. To start with,
from the above [it should be clear that, in the social world, we are not
dealing with natural kinds that exist and are awaiting, so to speak,
prepackaged, their placement in the appropriate box. The objects we
investi- gate are rather conceptual creations and they are intrinsically
linked to the language through which the social world is
constituted]{.underline}. Here "[constructivists]{.underline}",
particularly those influenced by Wittgenstein and language philosophy,
[easily link up with "pragmatists]{.underline}" such as Rorty, [who
emphasises the product- ive and pragmatic role of "vocabularies" rather
than conceiving of language as a "mirror of nature"]{.underline} (Rorty
1979).¶ Furthermore, precisely because social facts are not natural, but
have to be reproduced through the actions of agents, any attempt to
treat them like "brute" facts becomes doubly problematic. For one, even
"natural" facts are not simply "there"; they are interpretations based
on our theories. Secondly, different from the observation of natural
facts, in which perceptions address a "thing" through a conceptually
mediated form, [[social reality]{.mark} is entirely "arti- ficial" in
the sense that it [is dependent on]{.mark} the [beliefs]{.mark} and
practices of the actors themselves]{.underline}. This reproductive
process, directed by norms, always engenders change either
interstitially, when change is small-scale or adaptive -- or more
dramatically, when it becomes "transformative" -- for instance when it
produces a new system configuration, as after the advent of national-
ism (Lapid and Kratochwil 1995) or after the demise of the Soviet Union
(Koslowski and Kratochwil 1994). [Consequently, any examination of the
social world has to become in a way "historical" even if some
"structuralist" theories attempt to minimise this
dimension]{.underline}. \[. . .\]¶ [Therefore [a pragmatic approach to
social science]{.mark} and IR [seems]{.mark} both necessary and
[promising]{.mark}.]{.underline} ¶ [On the one hand, it is substantiated
by the failure of the epistemological project that has long dominated
the field. On the other, [it offers a different positive heuristics that
challenges]{.mark} IR's [traditional]{.mark} disciplin- ary
[boundaries]{.mark} and methodological assumptions.]{.underline}
Interest in pragmatism therefore does not seem to be just a passing fad
-- even if such an interpre- tation cannot entirely be discounted, given
the incentives of academia to find, just like advertising agencies, "new
and improved" versions of familiar products.

#### Epistemology doesn't indict observations of material reality

**Wendt 2000** (Alexander Wendt, Professor of International Security and
PolSci, Ohio State, 2000 On the Via Media, Review of International
Studies 26)

In the book I argue that, compared to ontology-talk, [[the value of
epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark} talk [for]{.underline} a discipline
like [IR [is]{.mark} [considerably less]{.mark}]{.underline} than
something as imposing as the third 'Great Debate' might suggest. [[What
matters more is what there is, not how we can know it, since we clearly
do know things, and the 'how']{.underline}]{.mark} of this knowledge
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[vary with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the many [[different]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of
[[questions]{.underline}]{.mark} we ask in our field, and the varied
tools at our disposal for answering them.

#### Indicts of our epistemology/knowledge production don't come before or disprove the case

**Jackson 2010** (Patrick Thaddeus Jackson, Associate Professor of
International Relations in the School of International Service at the
American University in Washington, DC, 2010, "The Conduct of Inquiry in
International Relations: Philosophy of Science and its Implications for
the Study of World Politics," ebook)

Faced with the impossibility of putting an end to the science question
within IR by turning to the philosophy of science, what should we do?
Since we cannot resolve the question of what science is by appealing to
a consensus in philosophy, [one option is [to]{.mark} become
philosophers of science ourselves, and to [spend our time]{.mark} and
our scholarly efforts [trying to resolve]{.mark} thorny and [abstract
issues about]{.mark} the status of theory and evidence and [the limits
of epistemic certainty]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} But [this is an
unappealing option for a scholarly field defined, if loosely, by its
empirical focus (world politics), and]{.underline} it would be roughly
[akin to advising physicists to become philosophers of physics in order
to resolve the question of what physics was and whether it was a
science. This also [mis-states the relationship between philosophical
debates and]{.mark} scientific [practice; practicing scientists have a
pretty good]{.mark} working definition of what it means for something to
be "scientific," but this "is less a matter of strategy than of [ongoing
evaluative practice," conducted in]{.mark} the course of [everyday
knowledge-producing]{.mark} activities]{.underline} (Taylor 1996, 133).
We do not expect physicists to give philosophical answers to questions
about the scientific status of their scholarship; we expect them to
produce knowledge of the physical world. [Similarly, [we should
not]{.mark} expect IR scholars to [engage in "philosophy of IR" to the
detriment of generating knowledge about]{.mark} world [politics; the
latter]{.mark}, not the former, [is our main]{.mark} vocational
[task**.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### A2 Discourse Matters

#### Language focus creates a prison house- prevents solutions to problems

**McNally, 1997** (David McNally, professor of political science at York
University, "in defense of history" p. 26-7)

We are witnessing today a new idealism, infecting large sections of the
intellectual left, which has turned language not merely into an
independent realm, but into an all pervasive realm, a sphere so
omnipresent, so dominant, as virtually to extinguish human agency.
Everything is discourse, you see and discourse is everything. Because
human beings are linguistic creatures, because the world in which we act
is a world we know and describe through language,
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} allegedly follows that there
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} nothing outsides language. Our language, or
"discourse", or "text" -- the jargon varies but not the message --
define and limits what we know, what we can imagine, what we can do.
There is a political theory here too. Oppression is
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} to be rooted ultimately in the way in the
way in which we are and others are defined linguistically, the way in
which we are positioned by words in relation to other words, or by codes
which are said to be "structured like a language." [[Our
very]{.underline}]{.mark} being, our identities and "[[subjectivites,"
are constituted through language]{.underline}]{.mark}. As one trendy
literary theorist puts it in David Lodge's novel Nice Work, it is not
merely that you are what you speak; no, according to the new idealism,
"you are what speaks of you," [[Language is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[the final "prison-house]{.underline}".]{.mark} Our confinement there
is beyond resistance: [[It is impossible to escape from that which makes
us what we are.]{.mark} [This]{.mark} new idealism [corresponds to
a]{.mark} profound [collapse of political
horizons]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is the pseudoradicalism of a
period of retreat for the left, a verbal radicalism of the world without
deed, or, rather, of the word as deed. In response to actual structures
and practices of oppression and exploitation, it offers the rhetorical
gesture, the ironic turn of phrase. It comes as little surprise, then,
when on of the chief philosophers of the new idealism, Jacques Derrida,
tells us that he "would hesitate to use such terms as 'liberation'"
Imprisoned within language, we may play with words; but we can never
hope to liberate ourselves from immutable structures of oppression
rooted in language itself. The new idealism and [[the politics it
entails]{.underline}]{.mark} are not simply harmless curiosities; they
[[are an abdication of political responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially at a time of ferocious capitalist restructuring, of widening
gaps between rich and poor, of ruling class offensives against social
programs. They are also an obstacle to the rebuilding of mass movements
of protest and resistance.

#### Discourse doesn't cause war

**Reiter 95** DAN REITER is a Professor of Political Science at Emory
University and has been an Olin post-doctoral fellow in security studies
at Harvard "Exploring the Powder Keg Myth" International Security v20
No2 Autumn 1995 pp 5-34 JSTOR

A criticism of assessing the frequency of preemptive wars by looking
only at wars themselves is that this misses the non-events, that is,
instances in which preemption would be predicted but did not occur.
However, excluding non-events should bias the results in favor of
finding that preemptive war is an important path to war, as the
inclusion of non-events could only make it seem that the event was less
frequent. There[fore, [if preemptive wars seem infrequent]{.mark} within
the set of wars alone, then [this would]{.mark} have to [be]{.mark}
considered strong evidence in favor of the]{.underline} third, **[[most
skeptical view]{.mark} of preemptive war]{.underline}**, because [even
when the sample is rigged to make preemptive wars seem
frequent]{.underline} (by including only wars), [they are still rare
events]{.underline}. Below, a few cases in which preemption did not
occur are discussed to illustrate factors that constrain preemption.¶
[The rarity of preemptive wars offers preliminary support for
the]{.underline} third, most skeptical [view, that the preemption
scenario does not tell us much about how war breaks out]{.underline}.
[Close]{.mark}r [examination]{.mark} of the three cases of preemption,
set forth below, [**[casts doubt]{.underline}** on the validity
of]{.mark} the two preemption [hypotheses]{.mark} discussed earlier:
[that **[hostile images of the enemy]{.underline}** increase the
chances]{.mark} of preemption, and that belief in the dominance of the
offense increases the chances of preemption. In each case there are
motives for war aside from fear of an imminent attack, indicating that
such [fears may **[not be sufficient to cause
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In addition, in these cases of war the two
conditions hypothesized to stimulate preemption---[hostile
images]{.mark} of the adversary and belief in the military advantages of
striking first---[are **[present to a very high
degree]{.underline}**.]{.mark} This implies that [these are
**[insubstantial causal forces]{.underline}**]{.mark}, as they are
associated with theoutbreak of war only when they are present to a very
high degree. **[[This reduces]{.mark} even further the [significance of
these]{.mark} forces [as causes of war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To
illustrate this point, consider an analogy: say there is a hypothesis
that saccharin causes cancer. Discovering that rats who were fed a lot
of saccharin and also received high levels of X-ray exposure, which we
know causes cancer, had a higher risk for cancer does not, however, set
off alarm bells about the risks of saccharin. Though there might be a
relationship between saccharin consumption and cancer, this is not
demonstrated by the results of such a test.

#### Overemphasis on method destroys their scholarship 

**Wendt 2002** Wendt, Handbook of IR, 2002 p. 68

It should be stressed that in advocating a pragmatic view [we are not
endorsing method-driven social science. [Too much
research]{.mark}]{.underline} in international [relations
[chooses]{.mark}]{.underline} problems or [[things to be
explained]{.mark} [with a view to]{.mark} whether the analysis will
provide support for one or [another]{.mark} [methodological
'ism']{.mark}. But [the point of]{.mark}]{.underline} IR [[scholarship
should be to answer questions]{.mark} about]{.underline} international
[[politics that are of]{.mark} great [normative concern, not to validate
methods.]{.mark} **[Methods are means, not ends]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in themselves. As a matter of personal scholarly choice it may be
reasonable to stick with one method and see how far it takes us. But
since we do not know how far that is, if the goal of the discipline is
insight into world politics then [it makes little sense to rule out one
or the other approach on a priori grounds]{.underline}. In that case
[[a]{.mark} [method]{.mark} indeed [becomes a tacit ontology, which may
lead to neglect of]{.mark} whatever [problems it is poorly suited to
address]{.mark}]{.underline}. Being conscious about these choices is why
it is important to distinguish between the ontological, empirical and
pragmatic levels of the rationalist-constructivist debate. We favor the
pragmatic approach on heuristic grounds, but we certainly believe a
conversation should continue on all three levels.

#### Our reps reflect material reality

**Mearsheimer 1995** John Mearsheimer (International Relations professor
at the University of Chicago) 1995 The False Promise of International
Institutions in International Security Vol 19 Number 3 Winter, pp 43-44.

The main goal of [[critical theorists]{.underline}]{.mark} is to change
state behavior in fundamental ways, to move beyond a world of security
competition and war and establish a pluralistic security community.
However, their [[explanation of how change]{.mark} [occurs is]{.mark} at
best [incomplete]{.mark}, and at worst, internally
contradictory]{.underline}.155 Critical theory maintains that state
behavior changes when discourse changes. But that argument leaves open
the obvious and crucially important question: [[what]{.mark} [determines
why]{.mark} some [discourses become dominant]{.mark} and others lose out
in the marketplace of ideas? What is the mechanism that governs the rise
and fall of discourses?]{.underline} This general question, in turn,
leads to three more specific questions: 1) Why has realism been the
hegemonic discourse in world politics for so long? 2) Why is the time
ripe for its unseating? 3) Why is realism likely to be replaced by a
more peaceful communitarian discourse? [Critical theory provides few
insights on why discourses rise and fall.]{.underline} Thomas Risse-
Kappen writes, \"Research on. . . \'epistemic communities\' of
knowledge-based transna- tional networks has failed so far to specify
the conditions under which specific ideas are selfected and influence
policies while others fall by the wayside.\" 156 Not surprisingly,
critical theorists say little about why realism has been the dominant
discourse, and why its foundations are now so shaky. They certainly do
not offer a well-defined argument that deals with this important issue.
Therefore[, it is difficult to judge the fate of realism through the
lens of critical theory]{.underline}. Nevertheless, critical theorists
occasionally point to particular factors that might lead to changes in
international relations discourse. In such cases, however, they usually
end up arguing that changes in the material world drive changes in
discourse. For example, when Ashley makes surmises about the future of
realism, he claims that \"a crucial issue is whether or not changing
historical conditions have disabled longstanding realist rituals of
power.\" Specifically, he asks whether \"developments in late capitalist
society;\" like the \"fiscal crisis of the state,\" and the
\"internationalization of capital,\" coupled with \"the presence of
vastly destructive and highly automated nuclear arsenals \[has\] de-
prived statesmen of the latitude for competent performance of realist
rituals of power?\" 157 Similarly, [Cox argues]{.underline} that
[fundamental [change occurs when there is a \"disjuncture\" between
\"the stock of ideas people have about the nature of the world and the
practical problems that challenge them]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" He then
writes, \"Some of us think the erstwhile dominant mental construct of
neorealism is inadequate to confront the chal- lenges of global politics
today.\"158 It would be understandable if realists made such arguments,
since they believe there is an objective reality that largely determines
which discourse will be dominant. Critical theorists, however, emphasize
that the world is socially constructed, and not shaped in fundamental
ways by objective factors. Anarchy, after all, is what we make of it.
Yet [when critical theorists attempt to explain why realism may be
losing its hegemonic position, they too point to objective factors as
the ultimate cause of change. [Discourse]{.mark}, so it appears, [turns
out not to be determinative, but]{.mark}]{.underline} mainly [[a]{.mark}
[reflection of developments in the objective world.]{.mark} In short, it
seems that when critical theorists who study inter- national politics
offer glimpses of their thinking about the causes of change in the real
world, they make arguments that directly contradict their own theory,
but which appear to be compatible with the theory they are
challenging.]{.underline}159 There is another problem with the
application of critical theory to international relations. Although
critical theorists hope to replace realism with a discourse that
emphasizes harmony and peace, critical theory per se emphasizes that it
is impossible to know the future. Critical theory, according to its own
logic, can be used to undermine realism and produce change, but it
cannot serve as the basis for predicting which discourse will replace
realism, because the theory says little about the direction change
takes. In fact, Cox argues that although \"utopian expectations may be
an element in stimulating people to act \... such expectations are
almost never realized in practice.\"

### Extinction outweighs

#### Extinction outweighs

Seth D. **Baum &** Anthony M. **Barrett 18**. Global Catastrophic Risk
Institute. 2018. "Global Catastrophes: The Most Extreme Risks." Risk in
Extreme Environments: Preparing, Avoiding, Mitigating, and Managing,
edited by Vicki Bier, Routledge, pp. 174--184.

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? [Taken **literally**, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a rather low threshold]{.underline}
for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death
on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a
global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic
for the deceased and their loved ones. [However, in common usage, a
global catastrophe would be **catastrophic** for a significant portion
of the globe]{.underline}. Minimum thresholds have variously been set
around ten thousand to ten million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter
of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have
emphasized catastrophes that cause **long-term declines in the
trajectory of human civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that
human civilization **does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and
Baum 2013), [that drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). [A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that **[some]{.mark}
[catastrophes]{.mark} [are vastly more important than
others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to
recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983).
[Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred
million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity
would presumably carry on. However, with **nuclear
winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan, [**[humanity]{.mark} [could go
extinct]{.mark}**. The loss would be not just an additional four billion
or so deaths, but the [loss of **all future
generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion lives]{.mark}**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
[may]{.mark} even [be an **underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
analysis here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the
human species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an **infinite length of time** or
instead merely an **astronomically large but finite** length of
time]{.underline} (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the
stakes with global catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives.** Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert
et al. 2007), [but they have **limited practical significance**. This
can be seen when **evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework**. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, [society should **try 500 trillion times harder to
prevent**]{.mark} **a [global catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it
should [to save a person's life]{.mark}**. Or, preventing one million
deaths is equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability
of global catastrophe. This suggests society should **make extremely
large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives.**]{.underline} Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
[society should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to
prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend
at least [\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the
probability of global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable
disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count
future generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**. The discussion thus far
has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is
**not universally held**]{.underline}. [People often value some people
more than others]{.underline}, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. [Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time, or social relation,
as well as the unborn members of future generations. [This debate is
crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed,
if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [[While
everyone has the right to their **own views**]{.mark} **and
feelings**]{.underline}, we find that [[the strongest arguments are for
the **widely held position** that **all human lives should be valued
equally**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This position is succinctly stated in
the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848
Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident:
that all men and 3 women are created equal". [[Philosophers speak of
a]{.mark}n agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere"]{.underline}
(Nagel 1986) [or [a "veil of ignorance"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rawls
1971) [[in which each]{.mark} person [considers what is best for society
**irrespective of which member**]{.mark} **of society [they happen to
be]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such a perspective **suggests [valuing
everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless of who they are or where or when
they live. This in turn [suggests a **very high value for reducing
GCR**]{.mark}, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}

#### Extinction is the only [egalitarian metric]{.underline}\-\--anything else collapses cooperation on [collective action]{.underline} crises and makes extinction inevitable 

**Khan 18** (Risalat, activist and entrepreneur from Bangladesh
passionate about addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and other
existential challenges. He was featured by The Guardian as one of the
"young climate campaigners to watch" (2015). As a campaigner with the
global civic movement Avaaz (2014-17), Risalat was part of a small core
team that spearheaded the largest climate marches in history with a
turnout of over 800,000 across 2,000 cities. After fighting for the
Paris Agreement, Risalat led a campaign joined by over a million people
to stop the Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh to protect the Sundarbans

Environmental Fellow, "5 reasons why we need to start talking about
existential risks,"
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/5-reasons-start-talking-existential-risks-extinction-moriori/)

**[Infinite]{.underline}** future **[possibilities]{.underline}** I find
the story of the Moriori profound. It teaches me two lessons. Firstly,
that [[human culture is **far from immutable**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
That we can struggle against our baser instincts. That **[[we
can]{.mark} master them and [rise to]{.mark} unprecedented
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Secondly, that [even this does not
make us masters of our own destiny. We can make visionary choices, but
the future can still surprise us.]{.underline} This is a humbling
realization. Because **[[faced with an uncertain future, the only wise
thing we can do is prepare]{.underline}]{.mark}** for possibilities.
Standing at the launch pad of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, [the
possibilities seem endless. They range from]{.underline} an era of
[abundance to the end of humanity]{.underline}, and everything in
between. How do we navigate such a wide and divergent spectrum? I am an
optimist. From my bubble of privilege, life feels like a rollercoaster
ride full of ever more impressive wonders, even as I try to fight the
many social injustices that still blight us. However, the accelerating
pace of change amid uncertainty elicits one fundamental observation.
[Among the infinite future possibilities**, [only one outcome is truly
irreversible: extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[Concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} about extinction
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[dismissed]{.mark} as **apocalyptic
alarmism**]{.underline}. Sometimes, they are. But [repeating that
mankind is still here after 70 years of existential warning about
nuclear warfare is a **straw man argument**.]{.underline} **[The fact
that a 1000-year flood has not happened does not negate its
possibility]{.underline}**. And [there have been **far too many nuclear
near-misses to rest easy.**]{.underline} As the World Economic Forum's
Annual Meeting in [Davos discusses]{.underline} how to create a shared
future in a fractured world, here are [five reasons why the possibility
of existential risks should raise the stakes of
conversation:]{.underline} 1. **[[Extinction is the rule]{.mark}, not
the exception]{.underline}** More than [[99.9% of all the species that
ever existed are gone]{.underline}. **[Deep time is
unfathomable]{.underline}**]{.mark} to the human brain. But [if one
cares to take a tour of the billions of years of life's history, we find
a litany of forgotten species.]{.underline} And we have only discovered
a mere fraction of the extinct species that once roamed the planet. In
the speck of time since the first humans evolved, more than [99.9% of
all]{.underline} the distinct [human cultures that have ever existed are
extinct.]{.underline} Each hunter-gatherer tribe had its own
mythologies, traditions and norms. They wiped each other out, or
coalesced into larger formations following the agricultural revolution.
However, as major civilizations emerged, even those that reached
incredible heights, such as the Egyptians and the Romans, eventually
collapsed. [It is only in the very recent past that we became a truly
global civilization]{.underline}. Our interconnectedness continues to
grow rapidly. "Stand or fall, we are the last civilization", as Ricken
Patel, the founder of the global civic movement Avaaz, put it. 2.
Environmental pressures can drive extinction More than [15,000
scientists just issued a 'warning to humanity']{.underline}. They called
on us to reduce our impact on the biosphere, 25 years after their first
such appeal. The warning notes that we are far outstripping the capacity
of our planet in all but one measure of ozone depletion, including
emissions, biodiversity, freshwater availability and more. The
scientists, not a crowd known to overstate facts, conclude: "soon it
will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and
time is running out". In his 2005 book Collapse, Jared [Diamond charts
the history of past societies]{.underline}. He makes the case that
[overpopulation and resource use beyond the carrying capacity have often
been important,]{.underline} if not the only, drivers [of
collapse.]{.underline} Even though we are making important incremental
progress in battles such as climate change, [we must]{.underline} still
[achieve tremendous]{.underline} step [changes in our response to
several major environmental crises.]{.underline} We must do this even
while the world's population continues to grow. These pressures are
bound to exert great stress on our global civilization. 3.
Superintelligence: unplanned obsolescence? Imagine a monkey society that
foresaw the ascendance of humans. Fearing a loss of status and power, it
decided to kill the proverbial Adam and Eve. It crafted the most
ingenious plan it could: starve the humans by taking away all their
bananas. Foolproof plan, right? This story describes the fundamental
difficulty with superintelligence. A superintelligent being may always
do something entirely different from what we, with our mere mortal
intelligence, can foresee. In his 2014 book Superintelligence, Swedish
philosopher Nick Bostrom presents the challenge in thought-provoking
detail, and advises caution. **[Bostrom cites a survey of industry
experts that projected a 50% chance of the development of artificial
superintelligence by 2050]{.underline}**, **[and a 90% chance by
2075]{.underline}**. The latter date is within the life expectancy of
many alive today. [Visionaries]{.underline} like Stephen Hawking and
Elon Musk have [warned of the existential risks from artificial
superintelligence.]{.underline} Their opposite camp includes Larry Page
and Mark Zuckerberg. But on an issue that concerns the future of
humanity, is it really wise to ignore the guy who explained the nature
of space to us and another guy who just put a reusable rocket in it? 4.
Technology: known knowns and unknown unknowns Many fundamentally
disruptive technologies are coming of age, from bioengineering to
quantum computing, 3-D printing, robotics, nanotechnology and more. Lord
Martin Rees describes potential existential challenges from some of
these technologies, such as a bioengineered pandemic, in his book Our
Final Century. Imagine if North Korea, feeling secure in its isolation,
could release a virulent strain of Ebola, engineered to be airborne.
Would it do it? Would ISIS? Projecting decades forward, we will likely
develop capabilities that are unthinkable even now. The unknown unknowns
of our technological path are profoundly humbling. 5. \'The Trump
Factor\' Despite our scientific ingenuity, we are still a confused and
confusing species. Think back to two years ago, and how you thought the
world worked then. Has that not been upended by the election of Donald
Trump as US President, and everything that has happened since? The mix
of billions of messy humans will forever be unpredictable. When the
combustible forces described above are added to this melee, we find
ourselves on a tightrope. What choices must we now make now to create a
shared future, in which we are not at perpetual risk of destroying
ourselves? Common enemy to common cause [Throughout history, we have

#### Existence is a prerequisite to ontological questioning

THE THIRD response to eco-criticism would require critics to acknowledge
the ways in which they themselves silence nature and then to respect the
sheer otherness of the nonhuman world. Postmodernism prides itself on
criticizing the urge toward mastery that characterizes modernity. But
isn\'t mastery exactly what postmodernism is exerting as it captures the
nonhuman world within its own conceptual domain? [Doesn\'t postmodern
cultural criticism deepen the modernist urge toward mastery by
eliminating the ontological weight of the nonhuman world]{.underline}?
What else could it mean to assert that there is no such thing as nature?
I have already suggested the postmodernist response: yes, recognizing
the social construction of \"nature\" does deny the self-expression of
the nonhuman world, but how would we know what such self-expression
means? Indeed, nature doesn\'t speak; rather, some person always speaks
on nature\'s behalf, and whatever that person says is, as we all know, a
social construction. All attempts to listen to nature are social
constructions-except one[. [Even the most radical]{.mark} postmodernist
[must acknowledge the distinction between physical existence and
non-existence.]{.mark}]{.underline} As I have said, [postmodernists
accept that [there is a physical substratum to the]{.mark} phenomenal
[world]{.mark} even if they argue about the different meanings we
ascribe to it. [This]{.mark} acknowledgment of physical existence [is
crucial.]{.mark}]{.underline} We can\'t ascribe meaning to that which
doesn\'t appear. What doesn\'t exist can manifest no character. Put
differently, yes, [the postmodernist should rightly worry about
interpreting nature\'s expressions. And all of us should be wary of
those who claim to speak on nature\'s behalf]{.underline} (including
environmentalists who do that). [But [we need not doubt]{.mark} the
simple idea [that a prerequisite of expression is existence.
This]{.mark} in turn [suggests that preserving the]{.mark} nonhuman
[world]{.mark}-in all its diverse embodiments-[must
be]{.mark}]{.underline} seen by eco-critics as [[a fundamental
good]{.underline}]{.mark}. Eco-critics must be supporters, in some
fashion, of environmental preservation.

#### Existential threats [outweigh]{.underline} -- all life has [infinite value]{.underline} and extinction [eliminates the possibility]{.underline} for future generations -- err against threats, because of innate [cognitive biases]{.underline}

1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK In his book Reasons and Persons,
Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit advanced an influential argument about
the importance of avoiding extinction: I believe that if we destroy
mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people
think. [[Compare]{.mark} three outcomes: (1) [Peace]{.mark}. (2) A
nuclear [war that kills 99%]{.mark} of the world's existing population.
(3) A nuclear [war that kills 100%]{.mark}.]{.underline} (2) would be
worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of
these two differences? [Most people believe that the greater difference
is between (1) and (2).]{.underline} [I believe that [the difference
between (2) and (3) is]{.mark} very [much greater]{.mark}]{.underline}.
\... [The Earth will remain habitable for **at least another billion
years**.]{.underline} [Civilization began only a few thousand years
ago.]{.underline} [[If we do not destroy \[hu\]mankind]{.mark},
[these]{.mark} few thousand [years may be]{.mark} only [**a tiny
fraction** of the whole of civilized]{.mark} human
[history]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The difference between (2) and (3) may
thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of
this history.]{.underline} [If we compare this possible history to a
day, what has occurred so far is only a **fraction of a
second**.65]{.underline} In this argument, it seems that Parfit is
assuming that the survivors of a nuclear war that kills 99% of the
population would eventually be able to recover civilisation without
long-term effect. As we have seen, this may not be a safe assumption --
but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point stands. [What
makes [existential catastrophes]{.mark} especially bad is that they
[would]{.mark} "**[destroy the future]{.mark}**," as]{.underline}
another Oxford philosopher, Nick [Bostrom, puts it.]{.underline}66
[[This future could]{.mark} potentially [be]{.mark} extremely
[long]{.mark} and full of [flourishing]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} would
therefore [have]{.mark} extremely [large value]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
standard risk analysis, when working out how to respond to risk, we work
out the expected value of risk reduction, by weighing the probability
that an action will prevent an adverse event against the severity of the
event. [Because the value of preventing existential catastrophe is so
vast, even a tiny probability of prevention has huge expected
value.]{.underline}67 Of course, there is persisting reasonable
disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one might
resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. [In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future
generations.]{.underline} For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear
waste storage, governments have considered timeframes of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, and even a million years.69 Justifications for
this policy usually appeal to principles of intergenerational equity
according to which future generations ought to get as much protection as
current generations.70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable
development require development that meets the needs of the current
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.71 [However, when it comes to existential risk, it
would seem that we fail to live up to principles of intergenerational
equity.]{.underline} [[Existential catastrophe would]{.mark} not only
[give future generations]{.mark} less than the current generations; **it
would give them [nothing]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing
existential risk plausibly has a quite low cost for us in comparison
with the huge expected value it has for future generations.]{.underline}
In spite of this, relatively little is done to reduce existential risk.
[Unless we give up on norms of intergenerational equity, they give us a
strong case for significantly increasing our efforts to reduce
existential risks.]{.underline} 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE
SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY [In spite of the importance of [existential risk]{.mark}
reduction, it probably [receives less attention than]{.mark} is
[warranted]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international
cooperation is required if we are to receive adequate protection from
existential risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be
underinvested in [There are several reasons why existential risk
reduction is likely to be underinvested in.]{.underline} [Firstly, [it
is a global public]{.mark} good.]{.underline} [Economic theory predicts
that such goods tend to be underprovided.]{.underline} [The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.]{.underline}
Consequently, a country which reduces existential risk gains only a
small portion of the benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs.
Countries thus have strong incentives to free ride, receiving the
benefits of risk reduction without contributing. As a result, too few do
what is in the common interest. [Secondly]{.underline}, as already
suggested above, [existential risk reduction is an
[intergenerational]{.mark} public [good]{.mark}: most of the benefits
are enjoyed by future generations who have no say in the political
process.]{.underline} [For these goods, the problem is temporal free
riding: the current generation enjoys the benefits of inaction while
future generations bear the costs. Thirdly]{.underline}, many
[[existential risks]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as machine
superintelligence, engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering,
[[pose]{.mark} an [unprecedented]{.mark} and uncertain future
threat.]{.underline} Consequently, it is hard to develop a satisfactory
governance regime for them: there are few existing governance
instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is unclear what
shape new instruments should take. In this way, our position with regard
to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we faced when nuclear
weapons first became available. [[Cognitive biases also lead people to
underestimate]{.mark} existential [risks]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Since
there have not been any catastrophes of this magnitude, these risks are
not salient to politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 This is an
example of the misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental
shortcut which assumes that something is important only if it can be
readily recalled. [[Another]{.mark} cognitive bias affecting perceptions
of existential risk [is scope neglect]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a seminal
1992 study, three groups were asked how much they would be willing to
pay to save 2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered
oil ponds. The groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In
this case, the size of the benefits had little effect on the scale of
the preferred response. [People become numbed to the effect of saving
lives when the numbers get too large.]{.underline} 74 [Scope neglect is
a particularly acute problem for existential risk because the numbers at
stake are so large.]{.underline} [Due to scope neglect, decision-makers
are prone to treat existential risks in a similar way to problems which
are less severe by many orders of magnitude.]{.underline} A wide range
of other cognitive biases are likely to affect the evaluation of
existential risks.75

### Realism Good

**Realism is inevitable -- Uncertainty and enmity between states is
[fixed]{.underline} -- Justifies our epistemology and takes out the
alternative.**

**[de Araujo 14]{.underline}** (Marcelo, professor for Ethics at
Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, "Moral Enhancement and
Political Realism," Journal of Evolution and Technology 24(2): 29-43)

Some **[moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline}** that **[a
society of morally enhanced individuals]{.underline}** **[would be in a
better position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely
to face in]{.underline}** the future such as, for instance, the threats
posed by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** **[The assumption here is]{.underline}** quite
simple: **[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems
mainly from a sort of deficit in human beings' moral
motivation]{.underline}**. **[If human beings were morally
better]{.underline}** -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions --
**[there would be fewer wars, less terrorism, and more willingness to
save our environment.]{.underline}** Although simple and attractive,
**[this assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. **[[At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind]{.mark} in the future [is not a deficit]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
our [moral dispositions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[but]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the endurance of [an old political
arrangement]{.mark} that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a
collective basis.]{.underline}** The political arrangement I have in
mind here is the international system of states. In my analysis of the
political implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my
attention only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the
future by making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss
the threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some
human enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will
explain, in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between
"human nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field
of international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been
among the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form
of human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase
of the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in
the "future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
**[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}**, for instance, **[to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline}** or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some **[studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline}**,and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, **[may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}**n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and
Kugler 2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also
been reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of
empathy" (Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would
like to examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. **[The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline}** on the
one hand, **[threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}**, on
the other, **[a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}**learly **[made by]{.underline}** some **[moral
enhancements theorists]{.underline}**. Douglas, for instance, argues
that "according to many plausible theories, some of the world's most
important problems --- such as developing world poverty, climate change
and war --- can be attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230).
Walker, in a similar vein, writes about the possibility of "using
biotechnology to alter our biological natures in an effort to reduce
evil in the world" (2009, 29). And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson
go as far as to defend the "the need for moral enhancement" of humankind
in a series of articles, and in a book published in 2012. One of the
reasons Savulescu and Persson advance for the moral enhancement of
humankind is that our moral dispositions seem to have remained basically
unchanged over the last millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These
dispositions have proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human
beings as a species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other
in the collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, **[both
positions are correct in recognizing the real possibility of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.]{.underline}** The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). **[Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline}** (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The **[attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}**, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, **[Sparrow correctly argues that ["structural issues," rather
than human nature, constitute]{.mark} the main factor underlying
[political conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he
does not explain what exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend
to do later. Sparrow is right in rejecting the human nature theory
underlying the human enhancement project. But this underlying
assumption, in my view, is not trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as
he suggests. Human nature realism has been implicitly or explicitly
endorsed by leading political philosophers ever since Thucydides
speculated on the origins of war in antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003,
23--36). True, it might be objected that "human nature realism," as it
was defended by Morgenthau and earlier political philosophers, relied
upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical conception of human nature, a
conception that, actually, did not have the support of any serious
scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167). Yet, over the last few years
there has been much empirical research in fields such as developmental
psychology and evolutionary biology that apparently gives some support
to the realist claim. Some of these studies suggest that an inclination
to aggression and conflict has its origins in our evolutionary history.
This idea, then, has recently led some authors to resume "human nature
realism" on new foundations, devoid of the metaphysical assumptions of
the early realists, and entirely grounded in empirical research. Indeed,
some recent works in the field of international relations theory already
seek to call attention to evolutionary biology as a possible new start
for political realism. This point is clearly made, for instance, by
Bradley Thayer, who published in 2004 a book called Darwin and
International Relations: On the Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic
Conflict. And in a paper published in 2000, he affirms the following:
Evolutionary theory provides a stronger foundation for realism because
it is based on science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory
to explain two human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the
egoistic and dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly
described as "realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I
focus on these two traits because they are critical components of any
realist argument in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000,
125; see also Thayer 2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to
egoism and domination stems from human evolutionary history. The
predominance of conflict and competition in the domain of international
politics, he argues, is a reflex of dispositions that can now be proved
to be part of our evolved human nature in a way that Morgenthau and
other earlier political philosophers could not have established in their
own time. Now, what some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct
intervention in our "evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to
make us "fit" to cope with some possible devastating consequences from
the predominance of conflict and competition in the domain of
international politics (Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral
enhancement theorists comprehend the nature of war and conflicts,
especially those conflicts that humankind is likely to face in the
future, as the result of human beings' limited moral motivations.
Compared to supporters of human nature realism, however, moral
enhancement theorists are less skeptical about the prospect of our
taming human beings' proclivity to do evil. For our knowledge in fields
such as neurology and pharmacology does already enable us to enhance
people's performance in a variety of activities, and there seems to be
no reason to assume it will not enable us to enhance people morally in
the future. But **[the question]{.underline}**, of course, is **[whether
moral enhancement will]{.underline}** also **[improve the prospect of
our coping successfully]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** some major
threats to the **[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and
Persson propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as
proposed by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call
attention is that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly
presupposed by some moral enhancement theorists -- has been much
criticized over the last decades within the tradition of political
realism itself. "Structural realism," unlike "human nature realism,"
does not seek to derive a theory about conflicts and violence in the
context of international relations from a theory of the moral
shortcomings of human nature. Structural realism was originally proposed
by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State and War, published in 1959, and then
later in another book called Theory of International Politics, published
in 1979. In both works, Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any
specific conception of human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis
is that the thrust of the political realism doctrine can be retained
without our having to commit ourselves to any theory about the
shortcomings of human nature. What is relevant for our understanding of
international politics is, instead, our understanding of the "structure"
of the international system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer,
too, is an important contemporary advocate of political realism.
Although he seeks to distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz,
he also rejects human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself
as a supporter of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of
the basic tenets of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or
"structural realism") is, first, that the **[[states are
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** main, if not the **[[only, relevant
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the context of international relations;
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** second, that states [**[compete for
power]{.underline}** in]{.mark} the international arena.
**[[Moral]{.mark} [considerations]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
international affairs, according to realists, **[[are
secondary]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[when set against]{.mark} the
state's primary goal]{.underline}**, **[namely its own security and
[survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such
as Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human
beings' natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and
Mearsheimer argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem
from human nature, but from the very "structure" of the international
system of states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and
Mearsheimer, **[it is this structure that compels individuals to act as
they do in the domain of international affairs.]{.underline}** And one
distinguishing feature of the international system of states is **[its
"anarchical structure,"]{.underline}** i.e. the lack of a central
government analogous to the central governments that exist in the
context of domestic politics. **[It means that each individual state is
responsible for its own integrity and survival]{.underline}**. **[In the
absence of a superior authority]{.underline}**, over and above the power
of each sovereign state, **[[political leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**
often **[feel compelled to [favor security over
morality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[[even if]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[human beings
turn out to become [morally enhanced]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
future, **[[humankind]{.mark} may [still]{.mark} have to [face the same
scary scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}** described by some moral
enhancement theorists. **[This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}**, **[human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline}** within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But **[under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline}** -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). **[What has to be
changed]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}**, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While **[[moral
enhancement]{.underline}]{.mark}** may possibly have desirable results
in some areas of human cooperation that do not badly threaten our
security -- such as donating food, medicine, and money to poorer
countries -- it **[[will not motivate political leaders to
dismantle]{.mark} their [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Neither will it deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}**, **[at any rate not [as long as the structure
of]{.mark} international [politics compels them to see]{.mark}
prospective [cooperators in the present as possible enemies in the
future]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The idea of a "structure" should not be
understood here in metaphysical terms, as though it mysteriously existed
in a transcendent world and had the magical power of determining
leaders' decisions in this world. The word "structure" denotes merely a
political arrangement in which there are no powerful law-enforcing
institutions. And **[in the absence of the kind of security that
law-enforcing institutions have the force to create]{.underline}**,
**[political [leaders will]{.mark}]{.underline}** often [**[fail to
cooperate,]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} occasionally
**[[engage in]{.underline}]{.mark}** conflicts and
[**[wars]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[in those areas that are critical to
their]{.underline}** security and **[survival]{.underline}**. Given the
structure of international politics and the basic goal of survival,
**[this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}**, **[[even
if,]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the future, political **[[leaders become
less egoistic and power-seeking]{.mark}]{.underline}** through moral
enhancement. On the other hand, since the structure of the international
system of states is itself another human institution, there is no reason
to suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, **[addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
[bioengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[is unlikely to yield]{.mark}
the expected [results]{.mark}, so long as moral enhancement is pursued
[within the present framework]{.mark} of the international system of
states]{.underline}**.

#### Even if realism's [foundations]{.underline} are problematic, it's [theoretically useful]{.underline} for understanding IR -- rejecting it [outright]{.underline} is ahistorical and causes [worse violence]{.underline} by greenlighting [ethically untenable]{.underline} positions like the alt

"Making Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial
Thought,"
https://academic.oup.com/ips/article-abstract/11/3/221/3798787\]

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that **[those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with [a]{.mark} number of possible
[responses]{.mark}: one is to [deem realism, in all its complex]{.mark}
and contradictory [manifestations,]{.mark} as [a failed,
unethical,]{.mark} and [fundamentally racist/imperial
project]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} A second response is to
politically align against liberalism, while holding this partnership at
arm's length. **[A third response]{.underline}**, derived from Ayoob's
(2002) subaltern realism, **[is to work on an epistemic register,
selectively taking insights from realist traditions that help better
explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}**. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this **[[failing does not
delegitimize]{.mark} other [realist insights]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
What is important for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to
combine plausible realist insights with other categories that can grasp
the extent of global politics, including the dynamics of the
postcolonial experience, better.

The final response is the one I advance. To adopt a mode of
argumentation concerned with building a counter-imperial machine is to
neither dismiss constituencies that become caught up in imperial
formations, nor merely to tactically align with them; rather,
establishing resonant connections among postcolonial and realist lines
of thought, highlighting shared dispositions to difference, is to push
the latter toward repositioning itself on new ethical lines that limit
contemporary forms of violence. To recover a minor position in realism
is not to accept all realist positions, nor is it to synthesize or
convert any theoretical line into a coherent framework. It is, however,
to amplify the shared spirituality that informs both realist and
postcolonial thinking, drawing constituencies toward prudential rather
than imperial defenses of difference. It is to furnish current research
agendas with an anti-imperial focus, to seek the creative possibilities
that may arise when divergent constituencies meet, interfuse, and shift.
Thus, our response to Morgenthau, as to other realists, is to cultivate
the connections that do exist, not for epistemic reasons but for a
political project that strengthens counter-imperial movements.

Thinking from the Present

By way of conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that
motivates a theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial
thinking. If the ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of
liberalism and its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a
return to classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and
above postcolonial approaches. However, the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a counter-imperial machine, to cultivate a shared
spirituality that can gather diverse and divergent constituencies to
confront dangerous practices. In my estimation, countering an imperial
machine that operates in complex ways and at complex sites requires a
political strategy as unwieldy and diffuse, linking constituencies that
we may otherwise dismiss. **[[That]{.mark} a tradition of
[realism]{.mark} regularly [circulates through halls of power]{.mark}
across the globe [should be reason not to reject]{.mark} righteously
[but]{.mark} rather [to leverage its authorized status. We can talk
about]{.mark} [imperialism]{.mark}, knowledge production, and race here,
[while they can talk about anarchy]{.mark}, power, [and
self-interest]{.mark} there---or we can theoretically work on the lines
of thought that reverberate among us]{.underline}**. To reiterate,
building a countermachine is not driven to "pragmatic" reconciliation or
consensus and, thus, remains distinct from the "eclecticism" of other
plural approaches popular in IR today. While the combinatory logic of
paradigmatic synthesis has its place, the connections between realist
and postcolonial thought articulated here are made in a far more
agonistic manner. Rather than produce something like a
"postcolonial-realism," **[this]{.underline}** argument **[involves
pushing contemporary realist scholarship toward new research agendas and
new forms of critique]{.underline}** that both capture a spirit internal
to its own traditions while confronting the realities of contemporary
global politics. It engages with minor positions along the realist canon
to orient today's realism away from the logic of great power politics
operating under anarchy toward an understanding of how the logic of
liberal order permits forms of imperial intervention.

Needless to say, **[drawing together realist and postcolonial
thought]{.underline}**, as this essay has done, **[can be met with
analytical skepticism and political hostility. [A mode]{.mark} of
argumentation [that refuses comparisons]{.mark} of theoretical cores or
non-truncated readings of select theorists [strikes a note of analytical
evasion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To this there is no defense---other than
that already discussed at length. On the other hand, if the expressly
political purpose of this work is accepted, the argument anticipates
strong political reservations: why align the project of postcolonial
theory with realism, an unethical tradition of militarism and
realpolitik? To this I would respond that while a kind of strategic
essentialism has its place, **[[reducing "realists"]{.mark} to a
coherent body of thought [not only obscures]{.mark} the
[complexity]{.mark} of their thinking]{.underline}** (see never-ending
interpretations of Machiavelli as an example) **[[but reproduces the
narrative]{.mark} of transhistorical unity [that some]{.mark} realists
[use to authorize unethical]{.mark} policy [programs]{.mark} in the
first place]{.underline}**. More critically, however, **[in embodying an
[unproductive ahistoricism]{.mark}, it [poses]{.mark} conventional
[realist categories of anarchy, selfinterest]{.mark}, and military power
[as the]{.mark} political [problem to confront]{.mark} whereas [the
present]{.mark} historical [context demands attunement to how]{.mark}
some of [these drives]{.mark}]{.underline}** (militarism, national
interest) **[[connect with discrete problems]{.mark} of liberalism and
imperial practices]{.underline}**. In fact, there are good reasons to
think that the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and
Morton 2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR
theory is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of a US
liberal world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while
realism may have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must
theorize from the present. In doing so, we may find that **[[countering
imperial formations may benefit from]{.mark} resonances established not
just among postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and other "critical"
theorists but contemporary [realists who identify links between]{.mark}
[liberalism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Walt 2013). Indeed, **[[if realism]{.mark} as a policy program
defending the national interest [is entangled with]{.mark} current
militaristic and imperial [interventions, we should push the
premise]{.mark} of this statement, [that difference should be defended,
in anti-imperial]{.mark} and prudential
[directions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Doing so may allow new openings to
emerge in the present sense of closure, new strategies to think and
defend alternative politics. In this way, we may more fully embody
postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow critique or
brash conversion but rather attentive translation.

#### Threat con doesn't cause war

[[Even when hostile narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}, group [fears, and

only if these]{.mark} factors [are harnessed]{.mark}. Ethnic narratives

must]{.underline} also [seize the opportunity to manipulate that

or hold power by [riding a wave of chauvinist mobilization.]{.underline}
Such mobilization is often spurred by prominent events (for example,
episodes of violence) that increase feelings of hostility and make
chauvinist appeals seem timely. If the other group also mobilizes and if
each side\'s felt security needs threaten the security of the other
side, [the result is a security dilemma spiral]{.underline} of rising
fear, hostility, and mutual threat that results in violence. [A virtue

[[elites]{.underline}]{.mark} skillfully [[define group needs]{.mark} in

[lines]{.mark}]{.underline} to prevent violence: this is

#### There's no impact to the K -- reps don't shape reality

**Balzacq 5** (Thierry, Professor of Political Science and International
Relations at Namur University, "The Three Faces of Securitization:
Political Agency, Audience and Context" European Journal of
International Relations, London: Jun 2005, Volume 11, Issue 2)

However, despite important insights, this position remains highly
disputable. The reason behind this qualification is not hard to
understand. With great trepidation my contention is that **[one of the
main distinctions we need to take into account while examining
securitization is that between \'institutional\' and \'brute\' threats.
In its attempts to follow a]{.underline}** more **[radical approach to
security problems where]{.underline}**in **[threats are]{.underline}**
institutional, that is, **[mere products of communicative
relations]{.underline}** between agents, the **[CS has neglected the
importance of \'external]{.underline}** or brute threats\', that is,
**[[threats]{.mark} that [do not depend on language mediation to be what
they are]{.mark}]{.underline}**- **[hazards for human life. In
methodological terms]{.underline}**, however, **[any framework
[over-emphasizing ]{.mark}]{.underline}**either
**[institutional]{.underline}** or brute **[threat [risks losing sight
of]{.mark} important aspects of [a multifaceted
phenomenon]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, securitization, as suggested
earlier, is successful when the securitizing agent and the audience
reach a common structured perception of an ominous development. In this
scheme, there is no security problem except through the language game.
Therefore, **[how problems are \'out there\' is exclusively contingent
upon how we linguistically depict them.]{.underline}** This **[is not
always true]{.underline}**. For one, **[[language does not construct
reality]{.mark}; at best, it shapes our perception of it]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[[it is not theoretically useful nor]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is it **[[empirically credible to hold that what we say about a problem
would determine its essence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For instance,
**[[what I say about a typhoon would not change its
essence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The consequence of this position, which
would require a deeper articulation, is that **[some security problems
are the attribute of the development itself]{.underline}**. In short,
**[threats are not only institutional; some of them can actually wreck
entire political communities regardless of the use of
language]{.underline}**. **[Analyzing security problems then becomes a
matter of understanding how external contexts, including external
objective developments, affect securitization.]{.underline}** Thus, far
from being a departure from constructivist approaches to security,
**[external developments are central to it.]{.underline}**

#### No threat inflation

**Ravenal 09** -- (2009, Earl, Professor Emeritus at the Edmund A. Walsh
School of Foreign Service and the Department of Government at Georgetown
University, "What\'s Empire Got to Do with It? The Derivation of
America\'s Foreign Policy," Critical Review: An Interdisciplinary
Journal of Politics and Society 21.1, 21-75)

Rummaging through the concomitants of "imperialism," Eland (2004, 65)
discovers the thesis of [["threat inflation"]{.underline}]{.mark} (in
this case, virtual threat invention): Obviously, much higher spending
for the military, homeland security, and foreign aid are required for a
policy of global intervention than for a policy of merely defending the
republic. For example, after the cold war, the security bureaucracies
began looking for new enemies to justify keeping defense and
intelligence budgets high. Similarly, Eland (ibid., 183), in a section
entitled "Imperial Wars Spike Corporate Welfare," attributes a large
portion of the U.S. defense budget---particularly the procurement of
major weapons systems, such as "Virginia‐class submarines ... aircraft
carriers ... F‐22 fighters ... \[and\] Osprey tilt‐rotor transport
aircraft"---not to the systemically derived requirement for certain
kinds of military capabilities, but, rather, to the imperatives of
corporate pork. He opines that such weapons have no strategic or
operational justification; that "the American empire, militarily more
dominant than any empire in world history, can fight brushfire wars
against terrorists and their 'rogue' state sponsors without those
gold‐plated white elephants." The underlying notion of "the security
bureaucracies ... looking for new enemies" [[is]{.mark} a
[threadbare]{.mark} concept that has somehow taken hold across the
political spectrum]{.underline}, from the radical left (viz. Michael
Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the liberal center
(viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most alleged "threats"
as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen Carpenter
\[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the Cato
Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [[What is
missing]{.mark} from most analysts' claims of "threat inflation,"
however, [is a]{.mark} convincing theory of [why]{.mark}]{.underline},
say, the American government significantly (not merely in excusable
rhetoric) might magnify and even invent threats (and, more seriously,
act on such inflated threat estimates). In a few places,
[Eland]{.underline} (2004, 185) [suggests that such behavior might stem
from military or national security bureaucrats' attempts to enhance
their personal status and organizational budgets]{.underline}, or even
from the influence and dominance of "the military‐industrial complex";
viz.: "Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback from that
empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the military‐industrial
complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section: In the nation's
capital, [vested interests]{.underline}, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies ... [routinely take advantage of "crises"]{.underline}to
satisfy parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to
get pet projects--- a.k.a. pork---funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus,
"bureaucratic‐politics" theory, which once made several reputations
(such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and Graham Allison)
in defense‐intellectual circles, and spawned an entire sub‐industry
within the field of international relations, 5 is put into the service
of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary. So, too, can a
surprisingly cognate theory, "public choice," 6 which can be considered
the right‐wing analog of the "bureaucratic‐politics" model, and is a
preferred interpretation of governmental decision‐making among
libertarian observers. As Eland (2004, 203) summarizes: [Public‐choice
theory argues]{.underline} \[that\] [the government]{.underline} itself
[can develop separate interests from its citizens]{.underline}. The
government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and the
interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although
this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more
severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies
that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of
public‐choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of
contradiction: [Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time,
subservient]{.underline} to societal interest groups [and
autonomous]{.underline} from society in general. This journal has
pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely consequence of
the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity (e.g., Somin
1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But state
autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute their own
interests for those of what could be called the "national society" that
they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that, precisely
because of the public‐ignorance and elite‐expertise factors, and
especially because the opportunities---at least for bureaucrats (a few
notable post‐government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)---for lucrative
self‐dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and diplomatic areas
of government than they are in some of the contract‐dispensing and more
under‐the‐radar‐screen agencies of government, the "public‐choice"
imputation of self‐dealing, rather than working toward the national
interest (which, however may not be synonymous with the interests,
perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is less likely to hold. In short,
state autonomy is likely to mean, in the derivation of foreign policy,
that "state elites" are using rational judgment, in insulation from
self‐promoting interest groups---about what strategies, forces, and
weapons are required for national defense. Ironically, "public
choice"---not even a species of economics, but rather a kind of
political interpretation---is not even about "public" choice, since,
like the bureaucratic‐politics model, it repudiates the very notion that
bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they are held,
axiomatically, to exhibit "rent‐seeking" behavior, wherein they abuse
their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at least to
build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches. Such
sub‐rational models actually explain very little of what they purport to
observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding the
"behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances, under
some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that they
posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives. My treatment of "role" differs from that of the
bureaucratic‐politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of
foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and
specific identification of the role‐playing of organizationally situated
individuals in a partly conflictual "pulling and hauling" process that
"results in" some policy outcome. Even here, bureaucratic‐politics
theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that "some
players are not able to articulate \[sic\] the governmental politics
game because their conception of their job does not legitimate such
activity." This is a crucial admission, and one that
points---empirically---to the need for a broader and generic treatment
of role. [Roles]{.underline} (all theorists state) [give rise to
"expectations" of performance. My point is that [virtually every]{.mark}
governmental role, and especially [national‐security roles]{.mark}, and
particularly]{.underline} the roles of [the]{.underline} uniformed
[military]{.underline}, [[embody]{.mark} expectations of [devotion to
the "national interest"]{.mark}]{.underline}; [**[rationality]{.mark}**
in the derivation of policy]{.underline} at every functional level;
[[and **objectivity**]{.mark} in the treatment of
parameters]{.underline}, especially external parameters [such as
"threats"]{.underline} and the power and capabilities of other nations.
[Sub‐rational models]{.underline} (such as "public choice") [fail to
take into account even a partial dedication to the "national"
interest]{.underline} (or even the possibility that the national
interest may be honestly misconceived in more parochial terms). [In
contrast, an official's role connects the individual to the]{.underline}
(state‐level) [process, and moderates the]{.underline} (perhaps
otherwise) [self‐seeking impulses of the individual]{.underline}.
[[Role‐derived behavior tends to be **formalized and
codified**]{.underline}]{.mark}; relatively [[**transparent**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} at least
**[[peer‐reviewed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, so as to be consistent with
expectations; [surviving the particular individual and transmitted to
successors and ancillaries]{.underline}; [measured against a
standard]{.underline} and thus corrigible; [defined in terms
of]{.underline} the performed [function]{.underline} and therefore
derived from the state function; [and uncorrrupt, because]{.underline}
personal [cheating and]{.underline} even egregious [aggrandizement are
conspicuously discouraged]{.underline}. My own direct observation
suggests that [defense decision‐makers attempt to "frame" the structure
of the problems that they try to solve on the basis of the most accurate
intelligence]{.underline}. [They make it their business to know where
the threats come from]{.underline}. Thus, **[[threats are not "socially
constructed"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even though, of course, some values
are). [A major reason for]{.underline} the [rationality,
and]{.underline} the [objectivity]{.underline}, of the process [is that
much [security planning is done]{.mark}, not in vaguely undefined
circumstances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior,
but [rather in structured]{.mark} and reviewed [organizational
frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Non‐rationalities]{.underline}]{.mark} (which are bad for
understanding and prediction[) tend to [get filtered
out]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[People are fired for]{.mark} presenting
[skewed analysis and]{.mark} for making [bad
predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because [something important
is riding on the causal analysis and the contingent
prediction]{.underline}. For these reasons, "public choice" does not
have the "feel" of reality to many critics who have participated in the
structure of defense decision‐making. In that structure, obvious, and
even not‐so‐obvious[, ["rent‐seeking"]{.underline}]{.mark} [would not
only be shameful; it would present a severe [risk]{.mark} of [career
termination]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, as mentioned, [the defense
[bureaucracy is hardly a]{.mark} [productive place for]{.mark} truly
talented [rent‐seekers]{.mark} to operate]{.underline}, [[compared
to]{.mark} opportunities for personal profit in [the commercial
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. A bureaucrat's very self‐placement in these
reaches of government testifies either to a sincere commitment to the
national interest or to a lack of sufficient imagination to exploit
opportunities for personal profit.

The following section will briefly raise some questions about the
[rejection of the old security framework]{.underline} as it has been
taken up by the most powerful institutions and states. [Here we can
begin to see the political limits to critical and emancipatory
frameworks]{.underline}. In an international system which is marked by
great power inequalities between states, the [[rejection of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} old narrow national interest-based [[security]{.mark}
framework]{.underline} by major international institutions, [and the
adoption of]{.underline} ostensibly [emancipatory policies]{.underline}
and policy rhetoric, [has the consequence of [problematis]{.mark}ing
weak or [unstable states and allow]{.mark}ing international institutions
or major states a more [intervention]{.mark}ary role]{.underline}, yet
[[without]{.mark} establishing mechanisms by which the citizens of
states being intervened in might have any [control]{.mark} over the
agents or agencies of their emancipation. Whatever the problems
associated with the pluralist security framework there were at least
formal and clear demarcations. [This]{.mark} has the consequence of
[entrench]{.mark}ing international [power inequalities and
allow]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark} a shift towards a [hierarchical
international order]{.mark} in which the citizens in weak or unstable
states may arguably have even less freedom or power than
before]{.underline}. Radical critics of contemporary security policies,
such as human security and humanitarian intervention, argue that we see
an assertion of Western power and the creation of liberal subjectivities
in the developing world. For example, see Mark Duffield's important and
insightful contribution to the ongoing debates about contemporary
international security and development. Duffield attempts to provide a
coherent empirical engagement with, and theoretical explanation of,
these shifts. Whilst these shifts, away from a focus on state security,
and the so-called merging of security and development are often
portrayed as positive and progressive shifts that have come about
because of the end of the Cold War, Duffield argues convincingly that
these shifts are highly problematic and unprogressive. For example, the
rejection of sovereignty as formal international equality and a
presumption of nonintervention has eroded the division between the
international and domestic spheres and led to an international
environment in which Western NGOs and powerful states have a major role
in the governance of third world states. Whilst for supporters of
humanitarian intervention this is a good development, Duffield points
out the depoliticising implications, drawing on examples in Mozambique
and Afghanistan. Duffield also draws out the problems of the retreat
from modernisation that is represented by sustainable development. The
Western world has moved away from the development policies of the Cold
War, which aimed to develop third world states industrially. Duffield
describes this in terms of a new division of human life into uninsured
and insured life. Whilst we in the West are 'insured' -- that is we no
longer have to be entirely self-reliant, we have welfare systems, a
modern division of labour and so on -- sustainable development aims to
teach populations in poor states how to survive in the absence of any of
this. [Third world populations must be taught to be self-reliant, they
will remain uninsured. Self-reliance of course means the condemnation of
millions to a barbarous life of inhuman bare survival]{.underline}.
Ironically, although sustainable development is celebrated by many on
the left today, by leaving people to fend for themselves rather than
developing a society wide system which can support people, sustainable
development actually leads to a less human and humane system than that
developed in modern capitalist states. Duffield also describes how many
of these problematic shifts are embodied in the contemporary concept of
human security. For Duffield, we can understand these shifts in terms of
Foucauldian biopolitical framework, which can be understood as a
regulatory power that seeks to support life through intervening in the
biological, social and economic processes that constitute a human
population (2007: 16). Sustainable development and human security are
for Duffield technologies of security which aim to create self-managing
and self-reliant subjectivities in the third world, which can then
survive in a situation of serious underdevelopment (or being uninsured
as Duffield terms it) without causing security problems for the
developed world. For Duffield this is all driven by a neoliberal project
which seeks to control and manage uninsured populations globally.
Radical critic Costas Douzinas (2007) also criticises new forms of
cosmopolitanism such as human rights and interventions for human rights
as a triumph of American hegemony. Whilst we are in agreement with
critics such as Douzinas and Duffield that [these [new security
frameworks cannot be empowering, and]{.mark} ultimately [lead to more
power for powerful states]{.mark}]{.underline}**,** we need to
understand why these frameworks have the effect that they do. We can
understand that these frameworks have political limitations without
having to look for a specific plan on the part of current powerful
states. In new security frameworks such as human security we can see the
political limits of the framework proposed by critical and emancipatory
theoretical approaches.

#### Even if security is a construction, the alt cannot create change in actors that have already internalized it

**Wendt 92** (Alexander, Assistant Professor of Political Science at
Chicago, "Anarchy is what States Make of it: The Social Construction of
Power Politics, International Organization, VOl. 46, no. 2.)

Let us assume that processes of identity- and interest-formation have
created a world in which states do not recognize rights to territory or
existence---a war of all against all. In this world, anarchy has a
"realist" meaning for state action: be insecure and concerned with
relative power. [Anarchy has]{.underline} this [meaning only in virtue
of collective]{.underline}, insecurity-producing [practices, but
[if]{.mark} those [practices are]{.mark} relatively [stable,
they]{.mark} do constitute a system that may [resist change.]{.mark} The
fact [that]{.mark}]{.underline} worlds of [power [politics are]{.mark}
socially [constructed]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words, [[does not
guarantee they are malleable]{.underline},]{.mark} for at least two
reasons. The first reason is that [[once constituted, any]{.mark} social
[system confronts]{.mark} each of its [members as an objective]{.mark}
social [fact that reinforces]{.mark}]{.underline} certain
[[behaviors]{.underline}]{.mark} and discourages others. Self-help
systems, for example, tend to reward competition and punish altruism.
[The possibility of [change depends on whether]{.mark} the
[exigencies]{.mark} of such competition [leave room for]{.mark} actions
that [deviate from the]{.mark} prescribed [script. If they do not, the
system will be reproduced and **deviant actors will**
**not**."]{.mark}]{.underline} The second reason is that [systemic
[change may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[be inhibited]{.underline}
by]{.mark} actors' [[interests in maintaining]{.mark}., relatively
[stable]{.mark} role [identities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such interests
are [rooted]{.underline} not only [in the desire to minimize
uncertainty]{.underline} [and]{.mark} anxiety, [manifested in efforts to
confirm existing-beliefs about the social world, but also in the [desire
to avoid]{.mark} the expected [costs of breaking commitments]{.mark}
made to others---notably domestic constituencies and foreign allies in
the case of states]{.underline}---as part of past practices. The level
of resistance that these commitments induce will depend on the
"salience" of particular role identities to the actor. The United
States, for example, is more likely to resist threats to its identity as
"leader of anticommunist crusades" than to its identity as "promoter of
human rights." But [[for]{.mark} almost [any]{.mark} role [identity,
practices]{.mark}]{.underline} and information [[that challenge
it]{.mark} are likely to [create]{.mark} cognitive dissonance
and]{.underline} even [[perceptions of threat]{.mark}, and
[these]{.mark} may [cause]{.mark} [resistance to transformations]{.mark}
of the self]{.underline} and thus to social change." For both systemic
and "psychological" reasons, then, intersubjective understandings and
expectations may have a self-perpetuating quality, constituting
path-dependencies that new ideas about self and other must transcend.
This does not change the fact that through practice agents are
continuously producing and reproducing identities and interests,
continuously "choosing now the preferences \[they\] will have later."
But it does mean that choices may not be experienced with meaningful
degrees of freedom. [This could be a constructivist justification for
the realist position that only simple learning is possible in self-help
systems.]{.underline} [The realist might concede that such [systems
are]{.mark} socially [constructed]{.mark} and [still]{.mark} argue that
after the corresponding identities and in have become institutionalized,
[they are]{.mark} almost]{.underline} [[impossible to
transform]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Threats are real -- we must securitize them to prevent war 

**Knudsen 1**-- PoliSci Professor at Sodertorn (Olav, Post-Copenhagen
Security Studies, Security Dialogue 32:3)

Moreover, I have a problem with the underlying implication that it is
unimportant whether states \'really\' face dangers from other states or
groups. In the Copenhagen school, threats are seen as coming mainly from
the actors\' own fears, or from what happens when the fears of
individuals turn into paranoid political action[. In my view, this
emphasis on the subjective is [a misleading conception of
threat]{.mark}, in that it [discounts]{.mark} an independent [existence
for]{.mark} what- ever is perceived as [a threat]{.mark}. Granted,
political life is often marked by [misperceptions]{.mark}, mistakes,
pure imaginations, ghosts, or mirages, but such phenomena [do not occur
simultaneously to large numbers of politicians, and hardly most of the
time]{.mark}. During the Cold War, [threats]{.mark} - in the sense of
plausible possibilities of danger - referred to \'real\' phenomena, and
they [refer to \'real\' phenomena]{.mark} now]{.underline}. The objects
referred to are often not the same, but that is a different matter.
Threats have to be dealt with both ín terms of perceptions and in terms
of the phenomena which are perceived to be threatening. The point of
Waever's concept of security is not the potential existence of danger
somewhere but the use of the word itself by political elites. In his
1997 PhD dissertation, he writes, 'One can View "security" as that which
is in language theory called a speech act: it is not interesting as a
sign referring to something more real - it is the utterance itself that
is the act.'24 The deliberate disregard of objective factors is even
more explicitly stated in Buzan & WaeVer's joint article of the same
year." As a consequence, the phenomenon of threat is reduced to a matter
of pure domestic politics." It seems to me that the security dilemma, as
a central notion in security studies, then loses its foundation. Yet I
see that Waever himself has no compunction about referring to the
security dilemma in a recent article.\" This discounting of the
objective aspect of threats shifts security studies to insignificant
concerns. [What has long made \'threats\' and 'threat perceptions'
important phenomena in the study of IR is the implication that [urgent
action may be required]{.mark}. Urgency, of course, is where Waever
first began his argument in favor of an alternative security conception,
because a convincing sense of urgency has been the chief culprit behind
the abuse of \'security\' and the consequent 'politics of
panic\']{.underline}, as Waever aptly calls it." Now, here - in the case
of urgency - another baby is thrown out with the Waeverian bathwater.
When real situations of urgency arise, those situations are challenges
to democracy; they are actually at the core of the problematic arising
with the process of making security policy in parliamentary democracy.
But in Waever's world, threats are merely more or less persuasive, and
the claim of urgency is just another argument[. I hold that [instead of
\'abolishing\' threatening phenomena]{.mark} 'out there' by
reconceptualizing them, as Waever does, [we should]{.mark} continue
[pay]{.mark}ing [attention to them, because situations with]{.mark} a
[credible]{.mark} claim to [urgency will keep coming back]{.mark} and
then we need to know more about how they work in the interrelations of
groups and states (such as civil wars, for instance), not least to find
adequate democratic procedures for dealing with them.]{.underline}

#### Our impact is [epistemologically sound]{.underline} -- it's based on readings of history and statistically strong modelling -- empirics are the best way to make predictions -- the alt causes extinction

Scott D. **Sagan 95**. Assistant professor of political science at
Stanford University. 1995. "The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate."
p.115-116.

[There are [two]{.mark} basic kinds of [errors]{.mark} that one can make
[in assessing nations]{.mark} other than one\'s own]{.underline}. The
first error is [[rooted in **ethnocentrism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
is [a common mistake]{.underline} Americans make when looking at others:
we [too often assume that other nations are less competent, less
intelligent, and less rational than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Kenneth Waltz has performed an important service
in this regard: his analysis of nuclear proliferation is a valuable
corrective against such ethnocentrism and the blind spots it can create
among both scholars and government officials. He is absolutely correct,
in my view, to criticize a number of proliferation pessimists who argue,
in effect, that the United States has been perfect in handling nuclear
weapons (but others will not be), that the United States can control
these awesome weapons forever (but no one else can), or that the United
States has utterly unproblematic civil-military relations (but no one
else does). Waltz\'s analysis should serve as a constant reminder of how
dangerous it is in international affairs to assume, to put it crudely,
that the United States is smart, but that other nuclear states are or
will be stupid. [[The second]{.mark} basic error, however, [is the
opposite: to assume that others are better than we are]{.mark}. This
is]{.underline}, I believe, [the central problem with]{.underline}
Kenneth Waltz\'s [arguments about the consequences of
proliferation]{.underline}. He now appears to accept many of the
arguments made by scholars who have studied the operational accidents
and near-accidents, conflicts in civil-military relations, and other
organizational problems experienced by the United States during the Cold
War. Yet he maintains [that other states will do better, will be
smarter, will learn more quickly, [will]{.mark}, in short, [avoid the
kinds of errors]{.mark} that [we have suffered]{.mark} in the
past]{.underline}. I believe, in contrast, that [[there are]{.mark} both
**[strong theoretical]{.mark} reasons [and]{.mark} emerging [empirical
evidence]{.mark}** [to expect that new states will not avoid such
problems]{.mark}. New nuclear powers [may not make exactly the same
mistakes]{.mark} as their predecessors; [but]{.mark} they are [likely to
make their own serious errors, and some will be
deadly]{.mark}]{.underline}.
