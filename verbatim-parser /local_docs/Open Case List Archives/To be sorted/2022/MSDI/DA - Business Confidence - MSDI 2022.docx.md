WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [[New orders for U.S.-made capital goods and
shipments increased solidly in May]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[pointing to
sustained strength in business spending]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
equipment in the second quarter, but rising interest rates and tighter
financial conditions could slow momentum. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
nearly [[broad rise in orders]{.underline}]{.mark} reported by the
Commerce Department on Monday **[[occurred despite deteriorating
business and consumer sentiment as well as]{.underline}]{.mark}**
heightened **[[fears of a recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The gains
partly reflected higher prices. [The Federal Reserve is aggressively
tightening monetary policy to quell inflation.]{.underline} "There's
some inflation behind the increase in orders, but, nevertheless,
**[[there are a lot of dollars flowing through the economy right
now]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at
FWDBONDS in New York. "[[Businesses would not order new equipment if
they thought consumers]{.underline}]{.mark} and other companies [[were
looking to pull back]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[purchases]{.underline}]{.mark}." [Orders for non-defense capital goods
excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans,
rose 0.5% last month]{.underline}. These [so-called core capital goods
orders gained 0.3% in April]{.underline}. Economists polled by Reuters
had forecast core capital goods orders would climb 0.3%. Those orders
were up 10.2% on a year-on-year basis in May. Last month's increase
reflected a 1.1% rise in machinery orders. There was also [strong demand
for primary metals as well as computers and electronic
product]{.underline}s. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances
and components fell 0.9%, while demand for fabricated metal products was
unchanged.

Carolina-Chapel Hill. "Capital-Spending Surge Further Lifts Economic
Recovery", Wall Street Journal,

[[Business investment is]{.mark} emerging as [a **powerful source**
of]{.mark} U.S. economic [growth that will]{.mark} likely help
**[sustain]{.mark} the [recovery]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Companies]{.mark} are **[ramp]{.mark}ing [up]{.mark}** orders for
computers, machinery and software [as they **grow**]{.mark} **more
[confident]{.mark}** in the outlook]{.underline}.

Nonresidential fixed investment, a proxy for [business spending,
rose]{.underline} at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11.7% in the
first quarter, led by growth in software and tech-equipment spending,
according to the Commerce Department. Business investment also logged
double-digit gains in the third and fourth quarters last year after
falling during pandemic-related shutdowns. It is now higher than its
pre-pandemic peak.

Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, another measure
for business investment, are near the highest levels for records tracing
back to the 1990s, separate Commerce Department figures show.

"[[Business]{.mark} investment [has]{.mark} really [been an **important
engine** powering]{.mark} the U.S. economic
[recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Robert Rosener, senior U.S.
economist at Morgan Stanley. "[In our outlook for the economy, it's
certainly one of the **bright spots**]{.underline}."

Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic
output, is driving the early stages of the recovery. Americans, flush
with savings and government stimulus checks, are spending more on goods
and services, which they shunned for much of the pandemic.

[[Robust]{.mark} capital [investment will be **key**]{.mark} to ensuring
that the recovery maintains strength **[after]{.mark}** the spending
boost from fiscal [**stimulus** and]{.mark} **business
[reopenings]{.mark}** eventually **[fade]{.mark}**s]{.underline},
according to some economists.

[Rising business investment helps fuel **economic output**.
It]{.underline} also [lifts **worker productivity**]{.underline}, or
output per hour. That metric grew at a sluggish pace throughout the last
economic expansion but is now showing signs of resurgence.

The recovery in business investment is shaping up to be much stronger
than in the years following the 2007-09 recession. "The events
especially in late '08, early '09 put a lot of businesses really close
to the edge," said Phil Suttle, founder of Suttle Economics. "I think a
lot of them said, 'We've just got to be really cautious for a long
while.'"

Businesses appear to be less risk-averse now, he said.

After the financial crisis, businesses grew by adding workers, rather
than investing in capital. Hiring was more attractive than capital
spending because labor was abundant and relatively cheap. Now the supply
of workers is tight. Companies are raising pay to lure employees. As a
result, many firms have more incentive to grow by investing in capital.

Economists at Morgan Stanley predict that U.S. capital spending will
rise to 116% of prerecession levels after three years. By comparison,
investment took 10 years to reach those levels once the 2007-09
recession hit.

[Company [executives are **increasingly confident**]{.mark} in the
economy's trajectory]{.underline}. The Business Roundtable's
economic-outlook index---a composite of large companies' plans for
hiring and spending, as well as sales projections---increased by nine
points in the second quarter to 116, just below 2018's record high,
according to a survey conducted between May 25 and June 9. In the second
quarter, the share of companies planning to boost capital investment
increased to 59% from 57% in the first.

"We're seeing really strong reopening demand, and a lot of times capital
investment follows that," said Joe Song, senior U.S. economist at BofA
Securities.

Mr. Song added that [[less **uncertainty**]{.underline}]{.mark}
regarding trade tensions between the U.S. and China [should]{.underline}
further [**[underpin]{.mark}** **[bus]{.mark}**iness
**[con]{.mark}**fidence]{.underline} and investment. "[At the **very

**strategy**]{.mark} that the [Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} administration
[is trying to [follow and]{.mark} will be **able to [plan]{.mark}**
[around that]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

Various [scholars]{.underline} and institutions [regard **global social

decade. [The catalyst has been postulated to be [a **Second**]{.mark}
**Great [Depression]{.mark}** which, in turn, [will have]{.mark}
**profound [implications]{.mark}** [for **global security**]{.mark} and

systems perspective, illustrates how [emerging risks are]{.underline}
getting more complex and **[intertwined]{.underline}**; blurring
boundaries between the economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal
and technological taxonomy used by the World Economic Forum for its
annual global risk forecasts. [**Tight [couplings]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} our [**[global systems]{.mark}**
have]{.underline} also [[enabled risks]{.mark} accrued [in **one area**
to **snowball** into]{.mark} a [**full-blown crisis**
**elsewhere**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The COVID-19 pandemic and its
socioeconomic fallouts exemplify this systemic chain-reaction.
Onceinexorable forces of globalization are rupturing as the current
global system can no longer be sustained due to poor governance and
runaway wealth fractionation. The coronavirus pandemic is also enabling
Big Tech to expropriate the levers of governments and mass
communications worldwide. This paper concludes by highlighting how this
development poses a dilemma for security professionals.

Key Words: Global Systems, Emergence, VUCA, COVID-9, Social Instability,

INTRODUCTION

The new decade is witnessing rising volatility across global systems.
Pick any random "system" today and chart out its trajectory: Are our
education systems becoming more robust and affordable? What about food
security? Are our healthcare systems improving? Are our pension systems
sound? Wherever one looks, there are dark clouds gathering on a global
horizon marked by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity
(VUCA).

But what exactly is a global system? Our planet itself is an autonomous
and selfsustaining mega-system, marked by periodic cycles and elemental
vagaries. Human activities within however are not system isolates as our
[[banking]{.mark}, utility, [farming, **health**]{.mark}care [and
retail]{.mark} sectors etc. [are]{.mark} increasingly
**[entwined]{.mark}**. Risks accrued in **one system** may **cascade**
into an **unforeseen crisis**]{.underline} within and/or without (Choo,
Smith & McCusker, 2007). Scholars call this phenomenon "emergence"; one
where [the behaviour of **intersecting systems** is determined by
**complex** and largely **invisible interactions** at the
**substratum**]{.underline} (Goldstein, 1999; Holland, 1998).

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. While experts remain
divided over the source and morphology of the virus, the contagion has
ramified into a global health crisis and supply chain nightmare. It is
also tilting the geopolitical balance. China is the largest exporter of
intermediate products, and had generated nearly 20% of global imports in
2015 alone (Cousin, 2020). The pharmaceutical sector is particularly
vulnerable. Nearly "85% of medicines in the U.S. strategic national
stockpile" sources components from China (Owens, 2020).

An initial run on respiratory masks has now been eclipsed by rowdy
queues at supermarkets and the bankruptcy of small businesses. The
entire global population -- save for major pockets such as Sweden,
Belarus, Taiwan and Japan -- have been subjected to cyclical lockdowns
and quarantines. Never before in history have humans faced such a
systemic, borderless calamity.

COVID-19 represents a classic emergent crisis that necessitates
real-time response and adaptivity in a real-time world, particularly
since the global Just-in-Time (JIT) production and delivery system
serves as both an enabler and vector for transboundary risks. From a
systems thinking perspective, emerging risk management should therefore
address a whole spectrum of activity across the economic, environmental,
geopolitical, societal and technological (EEGST) taxonomy. Every
emerging threat can be slotted into this taxonomy -- a reason why it is
used by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for its annual global risk
exercises (Maavak, 2019a). As traditional forces of globalization
unravel, security professionals should take cognizance of emerging
threats through a systems thinking approach.

METHODOLOGY

An EEGST sectional breakdown was adopted to illustrate a sampling of
extreme risks facing the world for the 2020-2030 decade. The
transcendental quality of emerging risks, as outlined on Figure 1,
below, was primarily informed by the following pillars of systems
thinking (Rickards, 2020):

> • Diminishing diversity (or increasing homogeneity) of actors in the
> global system (Boli & Thomas, 1997; Meyer, 2000; Young et al, 2006);
>
> • Interconnections in the global system (Homer-Dixon et al, 2015; Lee
> & Preston, 2012);
>
> • Interactions of actors, events and components in the global system
> (Buldyrev et al, 2010; Bashan et al, 2013; Homer-Dixon et al, 2015);
> and
>
> • Adaptive qualities in particular systems (Bodin & Norberg, 2005;
> Scheffer et al, 2012) Since scholastic material on this topic remains
> somewhat inchoate, this paper buttresses many of its contentions
> through secondary (i.e. news/institutional) sources.

ECONOMY

According to Professor Stanislaw Drozdz (2018) of the Polish Academy of
Sciences, "[a global financial crash]{.underline} of a previously
unprecedented scale is highly probable" by the mid- 2020s. This [will
lead to a **trickle-down meltdown**, impacting **all areas** of human
activity]{.underline}.

The economist John Mauldin (2018) similarly warns that the "2020s might
be the worst decade in US history" [and]{.underline} may [lead to a
**Second Great Depression**]{.underline}. Other forecasts are equally
alarming. According to the International Institute of Finance, global
debt may have surpassed \$255 trillion by 2020 (IIF, 2019). Yet another
study revealed that global debts and liabilities amounted to a
staggering \$2.5 quadrillion (Ausman, 2018). The reader should note that
these figures were tabulated before the COVID-19 outbreak.

The IMF singles out widening income inequality as the trigger for the
next Great Depression (Georgieva, 2020). The wealthiest 1% now own more
than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people (Coffey et al, 2020) and
this chasm is widening with each passing month. COVID-19 had, in fact,
boosted global billionaire wealth to an unprecedented \$10.2 trillion by
July 2020 (UBS-PWC, 2020). Global GDP, worth \$88 trillion in 2019, may
have contracted by 5.2% in 2020 (World Bank, 2020).

As the Greek historian Plutarch warned in the 1st century AD: "An
imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of
all republics" (Mauldin, 2014). The stability of a society, as Aristotle
argued even earlier, depends on a robust middle element or middle class.
At the rate the global middle class is facing catastrophic debt and
unemployment levels, widespread social disaffection may morph into
outright anarchy (Maavak, 2012; DCDC, 2007).

[[Economic stressors]{.underline}]{.mark}, in transcendent VUCA fashion,
[may]{.underline} also [[induce]{.mark} **radical [geopolitical
realignments]{.mark}**. Bullions now carry more weight than NATO's
**security guarantees** in **Eastern Europe**]{.underline}. After Poland
repatriated 100 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2019, Slovakia,
Serbia and Hungary quickly followed suit.

According to former Slovak Premier Robert Fico, [this **erosion** in
**regional trust** was based on historical precedents]{.underline} -- in
particular the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded Czechoslovakia's
Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. As Fico reiterated (Dudik & Tomek, 2019):

> "You can hardly trust even the closest allies after the Munich
> Agreement... I guarantee that if something happens, we won't see a
> single gram of this (offshore-held) gold. Let's do it (repatriation)
> as quickly as possible." (Parenthesis added by author).

President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia (a non-NATO nation) justified his
central bank's gold-repatriation program by hinting at economic
headwinds ahead: "We see in which direction the crisis in the world is
moving" (Dudik & Tomek, 2019). Indeed, [[with]{.mark} two global
Titanics -- the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and China]{.underline}]{.mark} --
set [on a **collision course**]{.underline} with a
quadrillions-denominated iceberg in the middle, and a viral outbreak on
its tip, [the **seismic [ripples]{.mark}** [will be felt]{.mark}
**far**, **wide** and for a **considerable period**]{.underline}.

A reality check is nonetheless needed here: Can additional bullions
realistically circumvallate the economies of 80 million plus peoples in
these Eastern European nations, worth a collective \$1.8 trillion by
purchasing power parity? Gold however is a potent psychological symbol
as it represents national sovereignty and economic reassurance in a
potentially hyperinflationary world. The portents are clear: The current
global economic system will be weakened by rising nationalism and
autarkic demands. Much uncertainty remains ahead. Mauldin (2018)
proposes the introduction of Old Testament-style debt jubilees to
facilitate gradual national recoveries. The World Economic Forum, on the
other hand, has long proposed a "Great Reset" by 2030; a socialist
utopia where "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy" (WEF, 2016).

In the final analysis, COVID-19 is not the root cause of the current
global economic turmoil; it is merely an accelerant to a burning house
of cards that was left smouldering since the 2008 Great Recession
(Maavak, 2020a). We also see how the four main pillars of systems
thinking (diversity, interconnectivity, interactivity and "adaptivity")
form the mise en scene in a VUCA decade.

ENVIRONMENTAL

[What happens to the **environment** when our **economies implode**?
[Think of]{.mark} a [**debt-laden** workforce at]{.mark} sensitive
[**nuclear** and **chemical plants**]{.mark}, along [with a]{.mark}
concomitant [**surge** in]{.mark} **industrial [accidents]{.mark}**?
**Economic stressors**]{.underline}, workforce demoralization and
rampant profiteering -- rather than manmade climate change -- arguably
[pose the **biggest threats** to the environment]{.underline}. In a WEF
report, Buehler et al (2017) made the following pre-COVID-19
observation:

> The ILO estimates that the annual cost to the global economy from
> accidents and work-related diseases alone is a staggering \$3
> trillion. Moreover, a recent report suggests the world's 3.2 billion
> workers are increasingly unwell, with the vast majority facing
> significant economic insecurity: 77% work in part-time, temporary,
> "vulnerable" or unpaid jobs.

Shouldn't this phenomenon be better categorized as a societal or
economic risk rather than an environmental one? In line with the systems
thinking approach, however, [global risks can no longer be boxed into a
**taxonomical silo**]{.underline}. Frazzled workforces may precipitate
another Bhopal (1984), Chernobyl (1986), Deepwater Horizon (2010) or
Flint water crisis (2014). These disasters were notably not the result
of manmade climate change. Neither was the Fukushima nuclear disaster
(2011) nor the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004). Indeed, the combustion of a
long-overlooked cargo of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had nearly
levelled the city of Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug 4 2020. The explosion left
204 dead; 7,500 injured; US\$15 billion in property damages; and an
estimated 300,000 people homeless (Urbina, 2020). The environmental
costs have yet to be adequately tabulated.

Environmental disasters are more attributable to Black Swan events,
systems breakdowns and corporate greed rather than to mundane human
activity.

[Our JIT world aggravates the **cascading potential** of
risks]{.underline} (Korowicz, 2012). [Production and delivery
delays]{.underline}, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, [will eventually
require industrial **overcompensation**]{.underline}. This will further
stress senior executives, workers, machines and a variety of
computerized systems. The trickle-down effects will likely include
substandard products, contaminated food and a general lowering in health
and safety standards (Maavak, 2019a). Unpaid or demoralized sanitation
workers may also resort to indiscriminate waste dumping. Many cities
across the United States (and elsewhere in the world) are no longer
recycling wastes due to prohibitive costs in the global corona-economy
(Liacko, 2021).

Even in good times, strict protocols on waste disposals were routinely
ignored. While Sweden championed the global climate change narrative,
its clothing flagship H&M was busy covering up toxic effluences
disgorged by vendors along the Citarum River in Java, Indonesia. As a
result, countless children among 14 million Indonesians straddling the
"world's most polluted river" began to suffer from dermatitis,
intestinal problems, developmental disorders, renal failure, chronic
bronchitis and cancer (DW, 2020). It is also in cauldrons like the
Citarum River where pathogens may mutate with emergent ramifications.

On an equally alarming note, depressed economic conditions have
traditionally provided a waste disposal boon for organized crime
elements. Throughout 1980s, the Calabriabased 'Ndrangheta mafia -- in
collusion with governments in Europe and North America -- began to dump
radioactive wastes along the coast of Somalia. Reeling from pollution
and revenue loss, Somali fisherman eventually resorted to mass piracy
(Knaup, 2008).

The coast of Somalia is now a maritime hotspot, and exemplifies an
entwined form of economic-environmental-geopolitical-societal emergence.
In a VUCA world, indiscriminate waste dumping can unexpectedly morph
into a Black Hawk Down incident. The laws of unintended consequences are
governed by actors, interconnections, interactions and adaptations in a
system under study -- as outlined in the methodology section.

Environmentally-devastating industrial sabotages -- whether by
disgruntled workers, industrial competitors, ideological maniacs or
terrorist groups -- cannot be discounted in a VUCA world. Immiserated
societies, in stark defiance of climate change diktats, may resort to
dirty coal plants and wood stoves for survival. [Interlinked
ecosystems]{.underline}, particularly water resources, [may be
**hijacked**]{.underline} by nationalist sentiments. [The
**environmental fallouts**]{.underline} of critical infrastructure (CI)
breakdowns [loom like a **Sword of Damocles** over this
decade]{.underline}.

GEOPOLITICAL

[The **primary [catalyst]{.mark}** [behind **WWII** was]{.mark} the
**Great [Depression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since [[history]{.mark}
often **[repeats itself]{.mark}**, expect **familiar bogeymen** to
**reappear**]{.underline} [in societies roiling with
**impoverishment**]{.underline} and ideological clefts.
[[Anti-Semitism]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a societal risk on its own --
[[may]{.mark} reach alarming proportions]{.underline} in the West
(Reuters, 2019), [possibly **[forc]{.mark}**ing [Israel]{.mark} to
undertake **[reprisal]{.mark} operations**]{.underline} inside allied
nations. If that happens, [how will **affected nations**
react?]{.underline} Will security resources be reallocated to protect
certain minorities (or the Top 1%) while larger segments of society are
exposed to restive forces? **[[Balloon effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**
like these [present a classic]{.underline} VUCA
[problematic]{.underline}.

[Contemporary geopolitical risks [include]{.mark} a possible
**[Iran]{.mark}-Israel [war]{.mark}**[; **US-China**]{.mark} **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** [over **Taiwan** or]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea; **North [Korean
prolif]{.mark}eration** of **nuclear** and **missile technologies**; an
**[India-Pak]{.mark}istan [nuclear war]{.mark}**; an **Iranian closure**
of the Straits of **Hormuz**; **fundamentalist-driven implosion in the
Islamic world**; [or]{.mark} a [**nuclear confrontation** between
**NATO** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fears that the Jan 3 2020
assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani might lead to WWIII
were grossly overblown. From a systems perspective, the killing of
Soleimani did not fundamentally change the
actor-interconnection-interaction adaptivity equation in the Middle
East. Soleimani was simply a cog who got replaced.

Core capital goods

The **[[better-than-expected increase in core capital

in manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [accounts for 12% of the
economy]{.underline}, despite weak factory surveys. A survey from S&P
Global last week showed business confidence dove in June to the lowest
level since September 2020. [[Demand for goods remains
strong]{.underline}]{.mark} even as spending is reverting back to
services. Production also continues to be underpinned by businesses
still rebuilding inventories, even as some major retailers like Walmart
and Target have reported that they are carrying too much merchandise.
"We've seen two of the [largest inventory builds on record in the past
two quarters]{.underline}, but, taken in the context of still solid
sales, [inventories are not yet at a concerning level in our
view]{.underline}," said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo
in Charlotte, North Carolina. "[We take the rebuild in inventories as a
signal that]{.underline} **[[supply chain problems are slowly
easing]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The
dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
STRONG SHIPMENTS Core capital goods shipments increased 0.8% last month,
matching April's gain. Core capital goods shipments are used to
calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement.
Despite some boost from higher prices, [[shipments still showed strength
after adjusting for inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Business
spending on equipment is on track to grow again]{.underline}]{.mark}**
this quarter, though at a slower pace than the 13.2% annualized rate
notched in the January-March period. [[Robust business

strong domestic demand]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the first quarter
[[even as the economy contracted]{.underline}]{.mark} at a 1.5% rate,
hit by a record trade deficit. [Growth estimates for the second quarter
range from as low as a 0.3% rate to as high as a 2.9% pace]{.underline}.
The Fed this month raised its policy rate by three-quarters of a
percentage point, its biggest hike since 1994. The U.S. central bank has
increased its benchmark overnight interest rate by 150 basis points
since March. "[The unexpected strength won't change anything for
monetary policy except]{.underline}, perhaps, making the Fed just a
smidgen more comfortable with their next rate hike decision," said Will
Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. Orders for
durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to
last three years or more, advanced 0.7% in May after rising 0.4% in
April. They were lifted by a 0.8% gain in orders for transportation
equipment, which followed a 0.7% increase in April.

If a 2023 recession is avoided, it will be because [[U.S.]{.mark}
consumers and [firms]{.mark} are still [in **robust
health**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Household **[balance]{.mark}
[sheets]{.mark}** are **[strong]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and the

Encouragingly, [[we see]{.underline}]{.mark} some [**[cooling]{.mark}**
[of **inflation**]{.mark} **pressures**]{.underline} (such as falling

**weakness**]{.underline}. And though [firms' margins]{.underline} will
decline from here, they're [coming down from **exceedingly strong
levels**]{.underline}. Yet, it's easy to point to the economy's
vulnerabilities. Deteriorating business sentiment can weigh on
investment rapidly, robbing the economy of momentum. And despite the
strong labor market and strong household balance sheets, consumer
confidence has been depressed for a while, likely driven by energy
prices. Add to that the fact that wobbly financial markets shrink
household wealth --- a problem that would get bigger if the housing
market were to turn --- and the cycle looks vulnerable. That said,
[[if]{.mark} a [recession hits]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2023, [there are

[recession]{.mark} are **[less likely]{.mark} today**]{.underline}.
[[Banks]{.mark} are [well **capitalized**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and **unlikely** to drive a
**structural overhang**]{.underline} in recession. This [leaves the
prospect that [demand]{.mark}]{.underline} could [**[return]{.mark}
[quickly]{.mark}** and that [labor markets]{.mark} **[remain]{.mark}
[tight]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which would keep a recession mild.
[[Fears]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} True
"[[Stagflation]{.underline}]{.mark}" [Are
**[Premature]{.mark}**]{.underline} One benefit of a recession would be
the prospect of putting out the inflation fire. But what if a recession
fails to reset price growth to its pre-pandemic slumber? A recession in
2023 or 2024 could easily coexist with above-target (2%) inflation, even
if current levels are implausible. Such inflation could have sustained
drivers, such as wages and housing, as opposed to the idiosyncratic
squeezes we've seen so far. Though a plausible risk, such an outcome
would still not be the true "stagflation" of the 1970s. Though popular
in the headlines today, [stagflation is **more** than the
**coexistence** of **too slow growth** and **too high
inflation**]{.underline}. That era was a structurally broken economy,
one where price growth never calmed because the trust (expectations) in
price stability was deeply damaged. This delivered high long-term
interest rates, hampered monetary and fiscal policy, and sustained
elevated unemployment rates --- a constellation of outcomes that is much
worse than prospects of elevated inflation and slow growth. Such a
nightmare scenario cannot be ruled out today, but it should not be the
base case. What stands between a recession with above-target inflation
and "stagflation" is the Fed. If the central bank has the resolve to
keep monetary policy tight despite recession, [there is **[every]{.mark}
[chance]{.mark}** that [inflation]{.mark} [can be **wrought**]{.mark}
from the system]{.underline}. That requires significant strength and
independence, as politicians, investors, and the public would push for
rate cuts. Yet [faced with the possibility of structural
break]{.underline} we still think [the [Fed would **stand
tall**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Business confidence rising now

[[Business confidence among]{.underline}]{.mark} Massachusetts
[[companies is rising despite persistent supply chain interruptions,
rising prices and other economic pressures]{.underline}]{.mark},
according to a new report. [[The latest Business Confidence
Index,]{.underline}]{.mark} which is compiled by the pro-business group
Associated Industries of Massachusetts, [[shows overall enthusiasm among
employers edged up]{.underline}]{.mark} 0.5 points to 57.2 in March. The
report, which draws upon surveys of about 140 businesses, found that the
index \"remains within optimistic territory\" but is 3.7 points lower
than its level of a year ago, when employers anticipated an early end to
the COVID pandemic. [[Driving the increasing confidence is enthusiasm
among private employers about the prospects of their own companies and
growing optimism among manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark}, the report\'s
authors noted. Despite the positive outlook, businesses face ongoing
challenges from record high inflation, supply chain issues and the
federal reserve decision to raise interest rates. Meanwhile, uncertainty
about another surge in COVID-19 infections and economic fallout of
Russia\'s war of Ukraine are also on the minds of employers. \"We see a
familiar pull and tug in the confidence reading between solid levels of
confidence in the underlying economy and concerns about a multitude of
geopolitical, resource, cost, and public-health issues,\" Sara L.
Johnson, chair of AIM\'s Board of Economic Advisors, said in a statement
on the report. The business group said Massachusetts employers are
confident about the prospects of their own companies this year and that
will translate into an improving labor market. [[Employers\' confidence
in their companies rose 1.6 points]{.underline}]{.mark} to 60.2,
slightly less than it was a year ago. The report cited data from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing employment in the state
increased by 24,000 in the first two months of 2022. \"It's a remarkable
accomplishment that employers have replaced most of the jobs lost during
the initial COVID-19 shutdown,\" said John Regan, AIM\'s president and
CEO. \"That growth underscores the importance of educating and training
the next generation of skilled workers to fill the jobs being created.\"

Odgers Berndtson, a global integrated leadership advisory firm operating
in 33 countries, has found [[business executives worldwide have more
confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in their company\'s leadership [[than
they did two years ago.]{.underline}]{.mark} Leadership Confidence Index
2022, was conducted in conjunction with research and advisory firm
Forrester. The joint Index reveals [[42% of business executives across a
spectrum of sectors and geographies, are confident their organizations
are being led by the right leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}. Two years ago,
Odgers Berndtson published its first Leadership Confidence Index, which
at the time found just 24% of executives were confident in their
company\'s leadership. In the 2022 Index -- which surveyed 1,100
executives -- the majority of respondents (90%) stated that their
organizations had been impacted by disruption while also reporting their
organizations experienced growth (71%). The findings indicate the almost
doubling in confidence in the past two years is a result of leaders
successfully navigating their organizations through the disruption of
the pandemic. The Index also reveals several trends that have played a
role in this increased confidence. [[Technology, the adoption of which
grew significantly during the pandemic, is increasingly viewed as an
enabler]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than a disruptor. 44% of executives
now see it as a disruptive force; a reduction from 62% two years ago.

#### Business confidence high -- record profits in key industries

Sally **Hardin** "These Top 5 Oil Companies Just Raked In \$35 Billion
While Americans Pay More at the Pump" **May** 17, **2022**
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/these-top-5-oil-companies-just-raked-in-35-billion-while-americans-pay-more-at-the-pump/

Since Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which
disrupted the global supply of fossil fuels and caused oil and gas
shortages worldwide, [[oil and gas giants have quietly enjoyed
unprecedented record profits]{.underline}]{.mark}. While people across
the United States have seen gas prices as high as \$6 per
gallon---stretching budgets thin and driving worsening inflation---the
oil majors have been absolutely raking in money, [[lining CEOs' and
shareholders' pockets with profits]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is hard to
overstate how profitable the war in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
resulting financial pain [[have been for]{.underline}]{.mark} oil
[[executives]{.underline}]{.mark}. Companies already benefited from
inflated gas prices in 2021 as the economy bounced back from the
COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns---in fact, [[the top 25 companies made more
than \$205 billion in profits in 2021---but the recently announced
first-quarter profits for 2022 are even more
astounding]{.underline}]{.mark}. The top five oil companies
alone---Shell, ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips---brought in
more than 300 percent more in profits than in the first quarter of 2021.
[[That is a total of more than \$35 billion in profits in just three
months.]{.underline}]{.mark} In fact, these five companies'
first-quarter profits alone are equivalent to almost 28 percent of what
Americans spent to fill up their gas tanks in the same time period.

[[\"CEO pay for the largest corporations are up 30

professor of finance at the University of Stevens Point. He says while
most families are struggling... [[the largest companies in America are

points to, yeah some people, a lot of people struggled last year but
some people not so much,\" said Bahr. Inflation is often measured using
the consumer price index, a combination of household good prices. This
means that if companies raise their prices, inflation rises.

[After a sleepy end to the **year**, [financial markets started
off]{.mark} 20**[22]{.mark}** [with a **bang**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[The yield on the]{.mark} 10-year Treasury [**bond** has risen
by]{.mark} almost [a quarter of a percent]{.mark} in just the first five
trading days of the year.]{.underline} Real [interest
**[rates]{.mark}**]{.underline} (nominal rates less inflation
expectations) [[have risen]{.mark} by even more.]{.underline} [These
have been some of the most aggressive **increases** in interest rates
over the last 20 years.]{.underline}

[At the beginning of the week [the rate move]{.mark} seemed to be [based
on **optimism**]{.mark} that the [omicron]{.mark} wave [would be
**fast** and]{.mark} the [economy would escape]{.mark} **substantial
[damage]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But [then [the Fed]{.mark}]{.underline}
released minutes of their December meeting and [**[suggested]{.mark}**
that [they could remove **stimulus**]{.mark} at a faster pace than the
market expected]{.underline}---specifically, by [reducing their nearly
USD 9 **trillion** of government and mortgage bond holdings at a
quicker-than- expected pace]{.underline}. And then Friday's payroll
report suggested that the labor market is rapidly approaching full
employment. [[As a result]{.mark} of these drivers, we believe the yield
on the 10-year Treasury [bond can continue to **rise** and hit
**2%**]{.mark} in the coming months.]{.underline}

[Growth stocks **benefited** from]{.underline} falling rates and [a
shift in **spending**]{.underline}

The moves in the bond market were mirrored by similar moves in the stock
market. Over the last few years, growth stocks (e.g. tech) have been
some of the biggest beneficiaries of extraordinarily low interest rates.
Over this period, there has been a very strong correlation between the
relative performance of value and growth stocks and the level of real
interest rates. Value stocks significantly underperformed as real rates
fell to some of the lowest levels in history.

The value of any company is the net present value of all expected future
cash flows. Growth companies generate the bulk of their cash flows well
out into the future. Mathematically, this makes growth companies much
more sensitive to changes in the "discount rate" that investors use to
derive the net present value. In contrast, because value companies grow
more slowly, they generate more of their cash flows in the early years
of the forecast horizon. This makes them less sensitive to changes in
the discount rate.

We can observe this by looking at the forward price-to-earnings (P/E)
ratio for growth stocks. The P/E ratio for the Russell 1000 Growth index
has increased from 22x right before the pandemic, to 31x now. The
fastest-growing and most speculative companies have been the biggest
beneficiary of this dynamic. In contrast, the P/E ratio for the Russell
1000 Value index has only risen from 13x to 16x.

Growth companies now trade at 15 P/E points higher than value companies,
compared to the long-term average of 6. As the discount rate rises,
valuations for growth companies should compress more rapidly relative to
value stocks. And that is exactly what has happened in the first week of
the year. Value stocks are up 0.5% while growth stocks have fallen by
4%. More speculative, very rapidly growing, non-profitable tech
companies have fallen even more and are down 10%.

[[Growth **companies**]{.mark}, and especially **tech**]{.underline},
also [[benefited from]{.mark} some of the [trends]{.mark} unleashed by
the pandemic. Businesses have been **scrambling** [to
**digitize**]{.mark} their businesses, driving strong earnings growth
for large **segments** of the tech **complex**. [As the pandemic
**transitions**]{.mark} into something more endemic, [consumer
**behavior** and]{.mark} the [economy should **normalize**]{.mark} and
spending could **shift away** from some of the **winners** in
2021.]{.underline}

[Rotation into **value** is set to continue as market **moves
higher**]{.underline}

As a result of the prospect for higher interest rates and a
normalization in spending patterns, we believe the recent rotation into
value stocks this year could have further to go. Importantly, [overall
economic [growth remains **solid**]{.mark} and value
**[companies]{.mark}**, which are more tied to economic growth, [should
continue to produce]{.mark} relatively strong **[earnings]{.mark}**
growth.]{.underline} In fact, [[profit]{.mark} growth [for value
**companies** looks poised to outpace growth companies]{.mark} in
2022]{.underline} (when stripping out the one-time benefit of bank loan
loss releases in 2021). [This is the crux of our preference for value
over growth stocks.]{.underline} We have a neutral view on the S&P 500
Information Technology sector.

At a market level, [[the]{.mark} more hawkish [Fed shouldn't be
a]{.mark} significant **[headwind]{.mark}** for the
**market**.]{.underline} Bear in mind that, historically, [stocks have
risen about **5%** in the three months **before** the first Fed rate
hike.]{.underline} In addition, [[the Fed has become]{.mark}
**incrementally more [hawkish]{.mark}** since June of last year
[and]{.mark} the **[S&P]{.mark}** 500 [is]{.mark} still [up]{.mark}
**more than [10%]{.mark}** over this time period.]{.underline}
Furthermore, stocks rise by about 5% in the six months after the first
rate hike. [Fourth quarter earnings results will start to be released
next week and we **[expect another good earnings season]{.mark}**, which
should be supportive for the market.]{.underline} Our year-end 2022 S&P
500 price target is 5,100.

#### Growth is [surging]{.underline} despite [other]{.underline} issues -- accounts of omicron, inflation, and interest rates

[[The U.S. **economy** is expected to **grow** above **trend** in
**2022**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [[it may not]{.mark} **always** [feel
that **way**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Find out why --- and what we think
[you shouldn't **lose sight**]{.underline} of.

**[[We are not recovering from a typical
recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The]{.underline} intentional [**[shutdown]{.mark}** of the economy
and]{.underline} the [massive]{.underline}, global synchronous fiscal
and monetary [support [have created **distortions**]{.mark} across the
economy]{.underline} --- from shifts in consumption patterns to the
labor force. [[This has put]{.mark} policymakers and central [bankers in
uncharted waters]{.mark}; it's [unusual to have
**higher**]{.mark}-than-expected **[inflation]{.mark}** alongside a
labor **market** that's still **recovering**.]{.underline}

Inflation data will get worse before it gets better.

[Inflation is [proving]{.mark}]{.underline} to be both more
[**[persistent]{.mark}** and **higher**]{.underline} than the Fed (and
the markets) initially anticipated. [Rising [costs are
**impacting**]{.mark}]{.underline} a wider set of [**[goods]{.mark}**
and **services**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [supply distortions
driving this are not likely to **end quickly**]{.underline}. While the
Fed wants to see some level of inflation, timing the use of its tools to
control higher prices requires new surgical precision. [[If]{.mark} the
various [forces **keeping** inflation high **ease**]{.mark} next year,
t[hen the Fed can implement **rate hikes**]{.mark} in a measured
**fashion**.]{.underline} [[This is]{.mark} the **[Goldilocks]{.mark}**
scenario]{.underline}. The differing expectations on when rate hikes may
occur set the stage for higher volatility in the markets --- so
flexibility in portfolios will be critical. It's also important to
remember that lower inflation (when it happens) will not mean lower
prices for many goods (although used car prices may fall). The price
gains that we've seen for many products will continue to be a reality
and may create an even greater need for retirement income.

Pay attention to the labor market if you want to understand the Fed's
plan for interest rates.

The central bank famously has a dual mandate: stable prices and maximum
employment. While the Fed's inflation target for a rate hike has already
been met, the usually reliable labor market dynamics are much harder to
discern. Sector-specific labor shortages are creating distortions in
wage gains. Meanwhile, the Fed's new maximum employment mandate isn't
well understood. We know that the central bank is looking beyond the
headline unemployment rate at measures such as labor force
participation, but it's unclear how maximum employment is measured.
Given that the Fed has stated that both its inflation and employment
goals must be met for it to hike rates, it will be important to listen
to the language on labor (rather than a magic data point); if we see
continued inflationary pressure and improvement in the labor market, we
may see a much swifter pace of action --- even if the central bank
expects inflation to eventually moderate.

A [[decelerating **growth**]{.mark} environment [is still]{.mark} a
**[growth]{.mark}** environment]{.underline}.

[Amid]{.underline} the concern around [inflation]{.underline}, lower
[fiscal **spending**]{.underline}, the [supply chain and higher energy
price]{.underline}s, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that [[the
U.S. will continue to grow]{.mark} in 2022]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that growth [will likely [be **above** the
long-term **trend**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[The **U.S.**
is]{.mark} still [a **consumer-led** economy]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} we
[expect consumer demand to stay **strong**]{.mark} as we enter the new
year]{.underline}. [The strong labor market and healthy consumer
**balance** sheets will be **helpful**]{.underline}, so keep an eye on
these measures. Historically, above trend growth has been a good
environment for risk assets like equities.

#### The economy will [boom]{.underline} in '22 -- inflation, unemployment, wages, housing, and Covid

**Baker 01-01** -- Dean, economist and co-founder of the Center for
Economic and Policy Research. "Commentary: [The good news in 2022 will
be the **economy**]{.underline}", Fredericksburg,

01-01-2022

THIS IS probably a minority position, but [I feel very confident in
saying that [2022 will be a **very good** year for the economy]{.mark}.
We are looking at a situation where we have [**low unemployment**,
**falling inflation** and **rising**]{.mark} real **[wages]{.mark}**. It
is likely to be the best economy we have seen in many
decades.]{.underline}

In recent weeks, [inflation has been front and center in people's minds
as the media have given us endless stories about higher prices for
gasoline, milk and other items.]{.underline}

[Many have been convinced that inflation will only get
higher]{.underline}, outstripping wages and leaving most workers worse
off. [This is **not** going to be the case]{.underline}.

[We now see inflation driven by supply chain problems associated with
reopening]{.underline}. This is demonstrated by the fact that we see big
jumps in inflation almost everywhere. [The United Kingdom, Germany,
Spain and many other countries have all seen a rise in prices similar to
what we see in the United States]{.underline}.

[The reason this matters is because [we will **get through**]{.mark}
these [supply chain problems]{.mark}. When we do, [inflation will
**slow**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} in many cases, [be
**reversed**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[We are **already** seeing this story]{.underline} in some cases. The
[price of gasoline has risen by almost 50 percent over the last
year]{.underline}. [This was the result of a surge in oil prices
following a pandemic plunge. Oil producers who had shut down in the
pandemic were surprised by the economy's rapid growth]{.underline}.
[They are now catching up, and [the]{.mark} world [price of oil has
fallen]{.mark} by **[20 percent]{.mark}** from its November peaks.
[Gas]{.mark} prices [will]{.mark} soon **[follow]{.mark}** oil prices
down]{.underline}.

There is a similar story with cars. [New- and used-car prices have
soared in the last year primarily because a worldwide shortage of
semiconductors forced auto manufacturers to cut back production. Several
manufacturers are back up to capacity now, and the others are likely to
be soon. This means the price hikes of 2021 will be largely **reversed**
in 2022.]{.underline}

[With inflation coming down rapidly, workers' pay will go
further]{.underline}. And, [many workers should be in a position in 2022
to secure pay increases well in excess of inflation.]{.underline}

[The 4.2 percent [unemployment]{.mark} rate]{.underline} reported for
November is already low by historical standards, but it [[will get still
**lower** in 2022]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[We are likely to see an unemployment rate close to 3.5 percent by the
middle of the year, putting us at a **[50-year
low]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Low unemployment]{.underline} primarily [benefits]{.underline} the most
[disadvantaged workers]{.underline}. Black and Hispanic workers, workers
with less education, and people with criminal records get opportunities
in a tight labor market that they would not typically see.

[We are also likely to see [mortgage interest rates remain
**low**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is good news for both home buyers and
for people who have not yet refinanced a mortgage.

[Low mortgage interest rates should also help fuel the sort of
relocation process that started during the pandemic with increased
opportunities for people to work from home]{.underline}. With many
employers now making work-from-home options permanent, people are moving
from high-priced cities like New York and San Francisco to lower-priced
towns and cities. This process will continue and pick up speed in 2022.

A huge wild card in any forecast for the economy for 2022 is the path of
[the [pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is obviously uncertain, but
[there are some grounds for **[optimism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [even as
we see cases and deaths skyrocket in this holiday season]{.underline}.
[[Vaccination rates]{.mark} continue to **[rise]{.mark}**, and the
evidence shows that fully vaccinated people are largely protected from
serious illness or death.]{.underline}

The other factor that could potentially be very good news is the spread
of the [[omicron]{.underline}]{.mark} variant. We know that omicron is
far more transmissible than delta or other COVID-19 variants. But, the
[evidence to date indicates that it is **[considerably less
severe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Even though cases have skyrocketed in
South Africa, the first country where omicron was identified, there has
been no corresponding **increase** in hospitalizations and
deaths]{.underline}. It's still early, and more data may give us a
different picture. However, [from what we see to date, if omicron
becomes the dominant variant, [we may have **much less to fear** from
the pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### A2: Markets Prove Economic/Confidence Decline 

#### Stock market estimates are always worst case scenario and never as bad as perceived. This overreaction is normal and not a sign that economic decline is coming

potential three-quarter-point hike this year in public speeches and
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester told Japan\'s
The Nikkei that a 0.75 percentage point hike could not be ruled out
later this year in an interview Monday. So [[why are markets fighting
the Fed chair\'s assurances that a larger hike won\'t
come]{.underline}]{.mark} in June --- [[and hurting themselves by
predicting it will? \"When a Fed official suggests a 50 basis points
hike]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[markets immediately start trying to price
in 75 basis point hikes]{.underline}]{.mark},\" said Jamie Cox, Managing
Partner for Harris Financial Group. \"[[It\'s
madness]{.underline}]{.mark} really.\" The Dow has fallen 5,095 points,
or 14% in 2022. The S&P 500 has dropped over 18% and the Nasdaq
Composite has lost about 28%. \"Powell tried to take the 75 basis point
hike off of the table at the last press conference,\" said David
Lebovitz, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
But the following week, the Consumer Price Index, a key measure of
inflation, shot up 8.3% for the year. The measure was lower than
March\'s 8.5% increase, but higher than the 8.1% increase economists
expected.

### A2: Inflation -- 2NC

#### The Fed is confident it can stop [inflation]{.underline}

Yahoo,
<https://www.yahoo.com/now/fed-nominee-brainard-fighting-inflation-165640630.html>,
01-13-2022

WASHINGTON (AP) --- Lael [[Brainard]{.underline}]{.mark}, President Joe
[Biden\'s [nominee for the]{.mark} **[Fed]{.mark}**eral
Reserve\'s]{.underline} No. 2 spot, [[said]{.underline}]{.mark} Thursday
that [[combating]{.mark} high [**inflation** is the]{.mark} central
[bank\'s]{.mark} top [priority and]{.mark}]{.underline} said she
[believed the Fed [could **reduce it** without sacrificing]{.mark}
**economic [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Testifying at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking
Committee, Brainard noted that inflation is "too high, and working
people around the country are concerned about how far their paychecks
will go."

"[We are taking **actions** \... that I have **confidence** will be
bringing inflation **down**, while continuing to **allow** the labor
market to return to **full strength** over time]{.underline}," she said.
Fighting inflation is "our most important task."

Brainard's elevation of inflation-fighting as the Fed's top goal is
notable given that she is, for now, the lone Democrat on the Fed's board
and has long been seen as inclined to keep interest rates low to boost
employment, rather than to back higher rates to curb inflation
pressures. [[Her stance reflects the]{.mark} abrupt **[pivot]{.mark}**
the Fed has recently **made** under Chair Jerome **Powell** toward
[making inflation]{.mark}-fighting [its top
**priority**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Biden nominated Brainard to be the Fed\'s vice chair in late November,
the same day that he announced he would nominate Powell for another
four-year term as Fed chair. Biden is expected soon to nominate three
more people to fill vacancies on the board.

[Brainard **encountered** little]{.underline} hostile questioning or
overt [opposition]{.underline} at Thursday\'s hearing. Both
[**Brainard** and **Powell** are expected to win **approval** from the
committee and final **confirmation** by the full Senate in the **coming
weeks**.]{.underline}

On Wednesday, the government reported that inflation spiked to 7% in
December from a year earlier, the sharpest such increase in four
decades. The acceleration of consumer prices has thrust Fed policy into
the spotlight. The central bank is tasked by Congress with keeping
prices stable and fostering "maximum employment."

Several Republican senators expressed concern that the Fed might
increasingly take account of climate change in its policymaking and use
its supervisory authority over banks to discourage them from lending to
oil and gas companies. Brainard pushed back against such a likelihood.

"We would not want to tell banks what sectors to lend to, or not to lend
to," she said.

Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, questioned whether the Fed
has the "experience or expertise" to incorporate climate change into its
regulation of banks. Last year, Brainard had suggested that the Fed
should evaluate scenarios in which climate change could harm the
financial system. An example would be widespread lending losses or
insurance payouts resulting from weather disasters.

Brainard said the Fed did not engage in "environmental policy" but still
has a duty to evaluate possible risks.

"We do have some sort of responsibility for understanding potential
financial stability implications of a host of different kinds of
things," she said. "We don't have any expertise in disease and
pandemics. But certainly it turned out that the pandemic had enormous
financial stability consequences.\"

In his testimony Tuesday, [[Powell pledged]{.mark} that [the Fed would
**accelerate**]{.mark} its planned **interest rate**
[hikes]{.mark}]{.underline}, if needed, [[to curb]{.mark} high
**[inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The Fed has held its]{.mark}
benchmark **short-term** [rate near zero since March]{.mark} 2020, when
the pandemic plunged the economy into a **deep recession**]{.underline}.

#### Inflation's [temporary]{.underline}, omicron's not as [bad]{.underline} as feared, supply chain [kinks]{.underline} are [mending]{.underline}

also serves as a senior writer for CNN Politics. "Reasons for optimism:
Omicron, gas prices and inflation", CNN,

12-09-2021

[The news that [gas prices]{.mark} have **stabilized**]{.underline} [and
[are]{.mark} now **[dipping]{.mark}** [could be **ev**]{.mark}**idence**
[that **inflation**]{.mark} [may]{.mark} actually [be]{.mark}
**[temporary]{.mark}**, like **many economists** have
**guessed**.]{.underline}

The national average price for gas hit a seven-week low of \$3.35 per
gallon on Tuesday, which is still high and well above prices a year ago,
but down from recent heights. Natural gas prices have also fallen.

\"[Energy sticker shock has been one of the **biggest drivers** behind
the 31-year high in inflation]{.underline},\" according to CNN\'s Matt
Egan. \"**[[Cooling energy prices]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if they last,
[[could take]{.mark} significant [inflationary
pressure]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[off]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the US
economy [and]{.mark} **[inspire confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} among
bummed-out consumers.\"

**[[Omicron]{.underline}]{.mark}** variant [[may not be]{.mark} as
**[dangerous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some of the worst fears about the
Omicron variant may not be coming to pass.

People who received two initial doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and
subsequent booster shots should have sufficient protection against
Omicron, according to a report on laboratory data released by the
companies.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already
recommended vaccine boosters to protect against Omicron. Read more.

Most vaccinated Americans have not yet received their boosters, but
there\'s evidence of an uptick in vaccinations.

Dr. Anthony [[Fauci]{.underline}]{.mark}, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, [[was in an **optimistic
mood**]{.mark} about **Omicron**]{.underline} when he appeared Wednesday
on CNN.

\"You said this is good news. Are you breathing a little easier this
morning with this news?\" CNN\'s Kate Bolduan asked Fauci.

\"Quite frankly, I am, Kate,\" he said. \"When you\'re entering into an
arena of a new variant with very many unknown aspects about it, you
always have a degree of anxiety about how it\'s going to turn out.\"

He said he still wants to know more about Omicron, in particular about
its transmissibility and severity.

But the early indication from South Africa, where Omicron was first
identified and is much more prevalent, is that the new variant is less
severe than Delta.

We\'re also learning more about how Omicron has spread in the US. Some
cases have been tied to an anime convention in New York City, where tens
of thousands of fans gathered at the Javits Center in November.

To be sure, Covid-19 \-- and specifically the Delta variant \-- is still
a massive health emergency. Cases are rising going into the winter and
more than 1,000 American lives are lost every day. The Covid-19 death
toll in the US is likely to hit 800,000 before Christmas.

But it would be undeniably good news for Omicron to be less dangerous
than once feared.

[**[Supply chain kinks]{.underline}** [may be
**easing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This might not be apparent to holiday
shoppers who can\'t find the electronics they want, anyone who needs a
stove, car buyers getting sticker shock or beverage [buyers
with]{.underline} fewer options.

But [[there are]{.mark} some **[indications]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [at
least [to]{.mark} **banks** and **[industry
analysts]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [that the global supply chain problems
are **on the mend**.]{.underline}

It might not be felt until next year, but the **[[improvement is
coming.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Inflation concerns are [temporary]{.underline} and [not holding back optimism.]{.underline}

**Huddleston Jr. 21** -- Tom, entrepreneurs writer at CNBC, He was
previously a reporter at Fortune magazine and The American Lawyer.
"Small-business owners had a devastating year --- but they finally have
hope now, according to a new survey", CNBC,
<https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/survey-small-business-optimism-on-the-rise-despite-inflation-concerns.html>,
12-15-2021

"[I [don't know any]{.mark} small [business that isn't]{.mark} always
[worried]{.mark}, and that worry is certainly strongest \[now\] [when
they]{.mark} [talk about **inflation**]{.mark}," Sullivan says. "**[But
worry is not holding back optimism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That's for
sure."

[[A major **reason**]{.mark} for that **optimism**]{.underline},
Sullivan says: **[[Perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Even once the pandemic **lockdowns** of 2020 **ended**]{.underline},
small [businesses **struggled** to **recover**. The country's **labor
shortages** and **supply chain issues** have persisted all throughout
2021,]{.underline} and U.S. gross domestic product only managed to edge
past its pre-pandemic levels in July.

[[Compared with the **intense hardship**]{.mark} that many
small-[business owners]{.mark} have [experienced]{.mark} since the
**start** of the pandemic, [the **prospect** of **increased consumer
spending**]{.mark}]{.underline} during the holiday season --- and [[into
**2022**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[is enough]{.mark} [for them to feel
**confident about the future**]{.mark},]{.underline} Sullivan suggests.

[If the optimism is **warranted**]{.underline}, the **[[lofty
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}** you've probably noticed at your favorite
small businesses [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} finally
**[[fall]{.underline}]{.mark}** [sometime next year]{.underline}. Just
last month, year-over-year U.S. inflation rose 6.8% --- the country's
fastest rate since 1982, according to the Department of Labor.

#### Inflation's [receding]{.underline}.

to Take Down the Economy", The New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/opinion/omicron-delta-economy-inflation.html>,
12-10-2021

[But [the **worst** of]{.mark} this [**inflation** may]{.mark} well [be
**behind us**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[After]{.mark} the costs of
[**fuel** and **food**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[which can
**fluctuate**]{.mark} **[greatly]{.mark}**]{.underline} [--- [are
**excluded**]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} [[inflation]{.mark} in
November [rose to 4.9 percent]{.mark} for the previous 12
months]{.underline}.

[[The cost of **gas**]{.mark}**oline** [and **heating**]{.mark}
**homes**]{.underline}, among the biggest contributors to the high
inflation in November, [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[already come
down]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the weeks since. [And]{.mark} they
[are]{.mark} **[set to fall more]{.mark}**, [given]{.mark} the **recent
[decline in oil prices]{.mark}**[, as]{.mark} global oil
[suppliers]{.mark} **[continue increasing
production]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Nothing tends to color consumer perceptions of inflation more than
**gasoline prices**. If history is any guide, if those prices fall,
**sentiment should improve.**]{.underline}

[What about the **aftershocks** from the **Delta wave?**]{.underline}

[[**Prices** for **goods** that **surged** when]{.mark} the
**[Delta]{.mark} wave** [scrambled]{.mark} global [supply chains are
also **set to decline** as]{.mark} those]{.underline} [[chains]{.mark}
slowly **[sort themselves out]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Shipping
rates]{.mark}** remain high but [are **down**]{.mark} from **just a few
weeks ago**]{.underline}. Far [**[fewer]{.mark}** container
[ships]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are **stuck**]{.mark} waiting to offload
their goods]{.underline} at the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long
Beach.

The vehicle industry has been the poster child for supply chain
problems. Delta contributed to the closure of semiconductor plants in
Asia, creating a severe shortage of the chips needed to produce cars and
sending the price of cars skyrocketing. But Washington is considering
measures that could ramp up domestic manufacturing. That could help
bring vehicle prices back to earth next year.

Another factor that should take the edge off inflation: the easing of
the acute labor shortage. This shortage has led to runaway labor costs
for lower-wage, lesser-educated and younger workers in service
businesses that reopened en masse with the Covid vaccines. Many of these
workers lost their jobs in the pandemic and have been slow to come back,
since they are particularly at risk of getting sick. At the height of
Delta, millions of people said they weren't working because they were
sick with Covid-19, taking care of someone who was sick or fearful of
getting sick.

But as Delta has receded, **[[people are returning to
work]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The **labor force participation
rate**]{.underline} for younger people and high school graduates with no
college **[surged]{.underline}** in the most recent employment
statistics. [And **many more** may soon **return to work** as they
quickly **spend down** the remaining **financial support** they received
from the government.]{.underline} [As workers fill the still
considerable number of open positions, [**wage growth**
should]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[moderate]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[as
will]{.mark} the **[pressure]{.mark}** on businesses [to **raise
prices.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[To be sure, [Omicron]{.mark}]{.underline} or future variants of the

this]{.mark} [should]{.mark} help **[ensure]{.mark}** that while many

[The next wave of the virus will undoubtedly slow growth and fan

MASKIN: [The biggest questions are: 1) how transmissible and virulent

[The global economy has suffered its biggest shock since the Second
World War. [When]{.mark} **co[rona]{.mark}virus** [hit, we
**battened**]{.mark} **down the [hatches]{.mark}**]{.underline} and it's
driven us into deep recession.

As countries begin to emerge, they face a different landscape. [Massive
[stimulus]{.mark} packages rolled out]{.underline} by hard-hit economies
[have created a seismic shift. They may have [softened]{.mark} the
impact, [but]{.mark} they have [left us]{.mark} **more
[exposed]{.mark}** [to **future**]{.mark} **economic [shocks]{.mark}**
than before]{.underline}.

According to initial figures from the Swiss Re Institute\'s Resilience
Index 2020, we estimate [global [resilience]{.mark} has
**[dropped]{.mark}** by a fifth]{.underline} in 2020 compared to 2019
levels.

[This is a comparable fall to that seen during the]{.underline}
20[**08** Global Financial Crisis. But this time, the impacts have been
**far more rapid**]{.underline}: during the GFC, the same scale of
decline took three years to materialise. [In addition, we went into this
recession less resilient than in 2007]{.underline} ahead of the GFC.
[And despite major bailouts and fiscal stimuli, lockdowns continue to
hamper economic activity]{.underline}.

[In an uncertain global economy, **resilience** is **key** to building
economic stability]{.underline}. Identifying weak spots at a macro and
micro level will put us in a stronger position to manage risk. Alongside
their resilience status prior to the pandemic, fiscal policies are
likely to be key in shaping the economic resilience of each country
post-pandemic.

But, even for some at the top half of the resilience index,
[[monetary]{.mark} policy [buffers are]{.mark} **all but
[exhausted]{.mark}**. Many [levers have **already been
pulled**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This reduced space to manoeuvre means our

may soon return to work as they quickly spend down the remaining

still considerable number of open positions, wage growth should
moderate, as will the pressure on businesses to raise prices.

To be sure, Omicron or future variants of the virus could upend this
optimism. But I expect each new wave to be less disruptive to the health
care system and economy than the previous one. If populations continue
getting vaccinated and taking their booster shots and new antiviral
medications and therapies become available, this should help ensure that
while many more people will get sick, there will be fewer
hospitalizations and deaths.

### A2: Thumpers -- 2NC

#### Thumpers are [Temporary.]{.underline}

**Bokat-Lindell 21** -- Spencer, NYT staff editor. "Americans Are in a
Funk About the Economy. How Long Will It Last?", The New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/inflation-economy-supply-chain.html>,
11-11-2021

Why **[[morale could improve]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[The economy **really** is **recovering**]{.mark}. In April 2020, as
the pandemic cast the economy into **crisis**, the]{.underline}
[unemployment rate reached 14.7 percent]{.underline} --- the highest
level since the Great Depression. [But by l**ast month,** the
[unemployment rate]{.mark} [had **fallen** to]{.mark} a much healthier
**[4.6 percent.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[As a result of the **tighter labor market**]{.underline}, [**workers**
are enjoying **more leverage** than they've had in]{.underline}
**[decades]{.underline}**. "[For the last **25**, maybe **30 years**,
**labor** has been on its **back heels** and **losing** its share of
the]{.underline} **[economic pie]{.underline}**," said Mark Zandi, the
chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "But that dynamic is now
shifting."

[**[Supply chain issues]{.underline}** [could **ease
soon**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**er** rather than later.]{.underline} No
one really knows when the "everything shortage" will end. "We've been
looking at no relief coming until the end of the 2022 calendar year,"
Sarah Banks, the global lead for freight and logistics at consulting
firm Accenture, told The Wall Street Journal. But, she added, "it's
still a guess how long we will be in this situation."

[Some think **relief** is **closer** on the horizon. In an interview
with Bloomberg, Malcolm Wilson, the chief executive of the world's
largest contract logistics provider]{.underline}, [said that the company
is [seeing more]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[goods
arrive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [at its facilities]{.underline} --- [[a
**sign** that **kinks**]{.mark} in the **supply chain**
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[beginning to work]{.mark} [themselves
out]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "We're through the worst of it. I think
**[we've reached the peak,"]{.underline}** he said. "[Hopefully, things
will look a bit **smoother** as we **move forward**."]{.underline}

**[Inflation]{.underline}** [can be **brought back down**]{.underline}.
Economists say that [resolving supply chain issues should help
to]{.underline} **[relieve]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[upward
pressure]{.underline}** [the shortages are putting on
**prices**]{.underline}. "For things like used cars, prices are flexible
in both directions," said David Mericle, [[Goldman Sachs]{.mark}
Research's **[chief]{.mark} U.S. [economist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "And
once you can actually get your hands on a new car, no one is going to
pay the same price for a used car as for a new car, as they are now."

[He [predicts]{.mark} [**inflation** will **come down sharply** in the
**middle of next year**]{.mark}]{.underline} and reach 2.15 percent ---
within range of the Federal Reserve's target --- [by
year-end.]{.underline}

Inflation doesn't tell the whole story. While many Americans are paying
more than they were a year or two ago, the economist Claudia Sahm argues
that [looking at inflation alone risks **obscuring** the]{.underline}
**[positive role]{.underline}** that **[[federal
relief]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has played over the pandemic. In part
because of **interventions** like]{.underline} [the **child tax
credit**]{.underline}, [enhanced **unemployment benefits**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[stimulus payments,]{.underline}**
[[Americans]{.mark} have [accumulated **\$2.3 trillion more in
savings**]{.mark} in the past 19 months than would have been expected in
the prepandemic path.]{.underline}

"We should be cautious when using the spending of specific families to
drive conversations about inflation," Sahm writes in her newsletter.
"[No one likes to pay more for something at the store, but if you have
**more income too**, it's **not** a **problem** that's **getting
worse."**]{.underline}

[**[The pandemic will end]{.underline}**. [Much of the recent economic
turmoil **started** with the **pandemic**, and]{.underline}]{.mark}

Americans have reached a critical point. [[The federal government has
grown to an unprecedented size,]{.underline}]{.mark} has expanded its
scope to virtually every part of the economy, [[and is on a dangerous
fiscal trajectory]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Taxpayers pay enormous amounts
of money to the government, and the government borrows huge sums beyond
the amount it takes from taxpayers]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The
government uses taxes and borrows money to pay for excessive
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}, including many programs that benefit the
well-connected or lock people into low incomes by penalizing work. As of
March 2017, [[the national debt is approaching \$20
trillion]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to the Congressional Budget
Office, if the government remains on its currently planned trajectory,
it will spend at least another \$10 trillion more than it will collect
over the 2017 to 2027 period, piling on even more debt. Annual
debt-service payments are expected to double within five years, and more
than triple over the next 10 years, increasing from \$241 billion in
2016 to \$768 billion in 2027. That \$768 billion in interest that the
government must pay in 2027 represents 52 percent of the entire amount
of the discretionary spending projected for the government in that year.
[[The country cannot and should not sustain the current course of
excessive spending and borrowing]{.underline}]{.mark}. While Congress
cannot solve everything at once, it can and must take the opportunities
available in the annual budget and appropriations processes to make a
down payment on putting the government's finances in order. [[Congress
can do this by immediately reducing discretionary spending and taking
meaningful steps to reduce mandatory spending by reforming mandatory
spending programs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Excessive new spending causes inflation pressures, which spurs fast economic downturn

Many in Washington now seem to think that the federal government can
spend a limitless amount of money without any harmful economic
consequences. They are wrong. [[Excessive federal spending is creating
grave economic and national-security risks]{.underline}]{.mark}.
America's fiscal recklessness must stop. The COVID-19 crisis has
provided the latest impetus for government spending, even to the point
of steering the American mind-set toward socialism---a doctrine that has
always harmed people's well-being. Dangerously shortsighted But some say
there is no need to worry about excessive spending. After all, they
argue, record-low interest rates apparently show no sign of increasing.
The economy was humming along just fine until the pandemic hit, and will
no doubt rebound strongly when it ends. And is there even a whiff of
inflation in the air? This thinking is dangerously shortsighted. The
fundamental laws of economics have not been repealed. As one of us
(Cogan) demonstrated in his book "The High Cost of Good Intentions,"
profligate government spending invariably has damaging consequences.
[High and rising U.S. national debt will eventually crowd out private
investment, thereby slowing economic growth]{.underline} and job
creation. The Federal Reserve's continued accommodation of deficit
spending [[will inevitably lead to rising inflation]{.mark}. Financial
markets will become more prone to turmoil, increasing the chance of
another big economic downturn.]{.underline} Financial markets' [[current
relative calm and low]{.mark} consumer-price [inflation are no cause for
comfort. Previous periods of sharp increases in inflation]{.mark},
rapidly rising interest rates, [and financial crises have followed
periods of excessive debt]{.mark} like a sudden wind, [without
warning]{.mark}.]{.underline} Shultz and Taylor's book "Choose Economic
Freedom" shows that economic indicators in the United States gave no
hint in the late 1960s of the subsequent rapid rise in inflation and
interest rates in the early 1970s. Likewise, financial markets during
the years immediately preceding the 2007-09 Great Recession provided
little indication of the calamity that would ensue. So, what should
today's policy makers do? Higher tax rates are not the answer. Even
before the pandemic hit, every federal tax rate would have had to be
increased by one-third in order to finance the current level of federal
spending without adding to the national debt. Such an increase would
have harmful effects---similar to those of mounting public debt---on
economic growth and job creation. Congress may be tempted to reduce
defense spending to help close the deficit, as it often has done in the
past. But these previous efforts demonstrably failed. Rather than reduce
the budget deficit, Congress instead used the savings from lower defense
outlays to finance additional domestic spending. [Unless policy makers
abandon their misguided beliefs about budget deficits]{.underline},
cutting defense expenditure now would produce the same result. [More
important, it would be a grave strategic mistake, [weakening national
security and emboldening the country's foreign
adversaries---particularly]{.mark} now that [China]{.mark} is flexing
its muscles in Asia and investing heavily in its military.]{.underline}
Throughout U.S. history, the federal government's ability to borrow
during times of international crisis has proven to be an invaluable
national-security asset. Two hundred years ago, the ability to borrow
was instrumental in America maintaining its independence from England.
During the Civil War, it was crucial to preserving the union. And it
proved decisive in defeating totalitarian regimes in the two world wars
of the 20th century. [The U.S. government's [careless spending is
jeopardizing this asset]{.mark}. If the country continues along its
current fiscal path, the federal government's borrowing well will
eventually dry up. [When it does, America will be far less able to
counter]{.mark} national-security threats. As [hostile foreign
governments]{.mark} and terrorist organizations recognize this[, the
world will become a far more dangerous place.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Policy makers' mistaken belief that deficits and debt don't matter is
the sad culmination of a long downward slide in fiscal responsibility.
From 1789 to the 1930s, the federal government adhered to a
balanced-budget norm, incurring fiscal deficits during wartime and
economic recessions, and running modest surpluses during good times to
pay down this debt. This prudent management of the federal finances was
instrumental in establishing America's strong position in world
financial markets.

#### Government spending drives additional inflation and collapsing business confidence

Robert **Pollin** Source: Challenge , NOVEMBER-DECEMBER **2010**, Vol.
53, No. 6 (NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 2010 Austerity Is Not a Solution: Why the
Deficit Hawks Are Wrong), pp. 6-36 Published by: Taylor & Francis, Ltd.
Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/27896625

[[We are]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[in the midst of a high-stakes
debate about fiscal deficits and macroeconomic
policy.]{.underline}]{.mark} In reviewing the arguments developed by
various leading deficit hawks[[, what]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[becomes clear is]{.underline}]{.mark} that they are not advancing one
main argument or even a unified set of positions, but rather four
distinct claims. We can characterize these four arguments as follows:
The traditional view. [[Large fiscal deficits will cause high interest
rates, large government debts, and inflation. Declining business
confidence is the real danger]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even if the current
deficits have not caused high interest rates and inflation, they are
eroding business confidence. When business confidence is low[[, the
economy is highly vulnerable to small changes in
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, what some economists call
\"nonlinearities.\" Fiscal stimulus policies never work. New Classical
economists, Robert Barro most notably, have long argued that the
multiplier for fiscal stimulus policies is zero or thereabouts. A
long-term fiscal train wreck is coming. Regardless of short-term
considerations, [[we are courting disaster in the long run
with]{.underline}]{.mark} structural [[deficits]{.mark}]{.underline}
that the recession has only worsened.

#### Government spending drives inflation and economic collapse

Rate Vanishes, Credit Card Debt Soars 06/22/**2022**
https://mises.org/wire/us-household-saving-rate-vanishes-credit-card-debt-soars

[[The key is inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}. If consumer prices continue
to be elevated into the third quarter, it is very hard to believe that
citizens will be comfortable depleting savings to continue consuming at
the same pace as during the first half of 2022. People in developed
economies are not used to high inflation and seem to be accepting the
mainstream idea that price increases will drop in the next months.
However, this may be a bad idea. [[Food prices are at all-time highs,
oil and gas prices are supported by geopolitical risks and poor
inventory levels, and the government deficit spending means that
consumption of monetary reserves will continue to be
extraordinary]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Despite the perception of a solid economy with a tight labor market and
rising nominal wages, [[the reality of the United States is that massive
deficit spending and inflationary policies are hurting the middle and
working classes.]{.underline}]{.mark} Unemployment may be low, but the
employment-to-population and labor-participation rates remain poor, and
the so-called Great Resignation is starting to reverse as citizens
struggle financially. It seems very difficult to believe that consumers
will end the 2022 fiscal year with the current levels of consumption
growth, but the real challenge will appear in 2023[[. The buffers that
families and businesses built in 2020 have all but
disappeared]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[An offensive cyber organization]{.mark} will also need attack tools to
achieve a certain effect or goal]{.underline}. Payloads greatly vary in
size. On one end of the spectrum, they can come as very lightweight
files that are easy to distribute, but once executed they will trigger
the download of a much larger piece of malware.43 On the other end of
the spectrum, payloads can be multiple megabytes (MBs) in size. A
multipurpose toolkit was discovered in 2012 by researchers from
Kaspersky Lab, which they called Flame. Whereas the Stuxnet code is
"only" about 1 MB in size, Flame's malware code is about twenty times
larger---and still not fully understood.44 [It [is
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}[---**[and cost
inefficient]{.underline}**]{.mark}---[to build an arsenal of tools for a
more mature cyber command or intelligence agency]{.underline}. [Although
early development and stockpiling would be desirable to ensure swift
deployment if the need arises, [tools]{.mark} often [must be tailored to
the target]{.mark} and desired effect]{.underline} (especially if the
actor desires stealth and stability), [which means that in-time
[development is often necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for
example, a case in which the leadership of a command decides there is a
need to target a specific programmable logic controller (PLC) used to
run a certain manufacturing process. The developers will likely have to
build tools that can work on that particular PLC model. If leadership
subsequently decides to target a different process, developers will have
to deploy a new toolset. Finally, [the more features of the target you
can use, the less you need yourself]{.underline}. Napoleon was famous
for making sure his troops were living off the land through which they
moved. It allowed his army to travel light and march long distances.
This notion of living off the land is also commonly applied to cyber
operations. The attacker may use something exotic to get into a target's
network, but it makes a lot of sense to subsequently use the target's
existing infrastructure to gain further network access. For example,
[existing communication lines to push out notifications can be used to
move through an organization's network. Living off the land is not
merely done for cost-efficiency benefits]{.underline}. The practice is
equally, if not more, important for remaining undetected. Fourth, [to
effectively run cyber operations an organization requires
infrastructure, broadly defined as the processes, structures, and
facilities needed to pull off an offensive cyber operation]{.underline}.
This element can be split into two categories: control infrastructure
and preparatory infrastructure. [Control infrastructure refers to
processes directly used to run an operation. This is also the type of
infrastructure that is generally burned down after a failed
operation]{.underline}. It includes domain names of phishing sites,
leaked email addresses, or other abused technologies.45 It also concerns
C&C infrastructure used in remotely conducted operations to maintain
communication with compromised systems within a target network.
Depending on an operation's goal and resources, the C&C infrastructure
might be as basic as a single server operating on the external
network.46 At the same time, an organization may run a whole set of
operations simply to compromise legitimate web servers to use them for
C&C later.

#### Offensive cyber operations are WAY more expensive than defense.

Rebecca **Slayton** \| February **2017** Why Cyber Operations Do Not
Always Favor the Offense
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/why-cyber-operations-do-not-always-favor-offense

Creating unnecessary vulnerabilities. [[Making offensive cyber
operations a national priority can increase instabilities in
international relations and worsen national vulnerabilities to
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. But because the skills needed for offense
and defense are similar, military offensive readiness can be maintained
by focusing on defensive operations that make the world safer, rather
than on offensive operations. Managing complexity. The ease of both
offense and defense increases as organizational skills and capability in
managing complex technology improve; it declines as the complexity of
cyber operations rises. What appears to be offensive advantage is
primarily a result of the offense's relatively simple goals and the
defense's poor management. Assessing kinetic effects. [[It is often more
expensive for the offense to achieve kinetic
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}---for instance, sabotaging
machinery---[[than for the defense to prevent them. An empirical
analysis of the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear enrichment
facilities shows that Stuxnet likely cost the offense more than the
defense and was relatively ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Innovation Is Impacting Society September 19, **2019**
https://datafloq.com/read/how-innovation-is-impacting-society/

It sounds like a bit of a buzzword, but
[[[innovation](https://datafloq.com/read/innovation-must-never-stop/)
actually has a big role to play in societ]{.underline}]{.mark}y. Sure,
anyone can innovate, but it's those significant changes that truly have
an impact. Key though is that the best kind of innovation actually
solves problems by creating effective
[processes](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/processes/), products, and
ideas. By definition, [innovation is the introduction of something
new](https://www.viima.com/blog/importance-of-innovation), furthering
progress in society. Many
[people](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/people/) will say that
[[innovation is the core reason for how we exist in the modern
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. Remember, change is inevitable and
innovation almost always creates positive change. When it comes to
products, the best are often the most innovative, providing a solution
to a common problem. A good example is the [Apple
iPhone](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegreenwald/2014/03/12/what-exactly-is-innovation/#4aa14afb5e5a)
-- they're innovative both aesthetically and in terms of product
features. Each new update provides new features such as voice
recognition, fingerprint
[technology](https://datafloq.com/read/12-myths-about-blockchain-technology/)
and synchronization between devices. Key to remember though is that
innovation does not equate to the invention. It can simply mean making
slight changes to a business model or
[environment](https://datafloq.com/read/mobile-app-development-data-integrity-security/)
to ensure the delivery of products or services. McKinsey and
[Company](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/company/) estimate that
[[[84% of
executives](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/how-we-help-clients/growth-and-innovation)
believe their future success is dependent on
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In terms of businesses,
[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} helps them to grow and [[plays a very
important role in terms of economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
helps problem solve, especially as the world's problems continue to
evolve. Innovation helps companies stay on top of constantly changing
problems, especially in developing countries. There are [other very
important reasons for
innovation](https://www.inc.com/gordon-tredgold/4-reasons-why-you-need-to-focus-on-innovation.html).
A Deloitte Innovation Survey found that [[66% of respondents believe
innovation is important for business growth and
[development](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/development/),]{.underline}]{.mark}
helping the business to scale up. A business is not the only
[company](https://datafloq.com/read/prepare-your-company-for-ai-digital-adoption/)
in that particular [market](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/markets/).
There will always be competitors. Yet [innovation helps businesses stand
out from the
crowd](https://medium.com/swlh/4-important-benefits-of-innovation-in-business-64ed0d78d150),
mainly because you'll be figuring out new ways to solve customer's
problems. Innovation also helps companies meet constantly changing
customer [needs](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/needs/). [[Innovation
helps [predict](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/predict/) how the
market will change,]{.underline}]{.mark} providing solutions before
customers even realize there is a problem. This means when customers
come to you with an issue, you already have a solution. Finally,
innovation helps to attract the cream of the crop when it comes to
employees. Someone is going to join a company that is going somewhere,
that is constantly working to improve and innovate. Perhaps [[the
biggest impact innovation has had on society is regarding
[technology](https://fstechadvisory.accenture.com/how-does-innovation-impact-society/)]{.underline}]{.mark},
which is, in effect, embedded in almost everything we do. From
agriculture to transport, [[technology is changing the way we live our
lives and interact with those around us]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is
especially true in relation to]{.underline}]{.mark} robot process
[automation](https://datafloq.com/read/5-ways-implementing-ai-automation-hr/)
(RPA) and [[[artificial
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://datafloq.com/read/artificial-intelligence-what-is-it-why-now/2471)
(AI). In addition to AI, thereâ€™s also cloud computing and storage
methods, blockchain, augmented and [virtual
reality](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/vr/) and the [Internet of
Things](https://datafloq.com/read/what-is-the-value-of-the-internet-of-things-infogr/379)
(IoT). With these technological innovations, the world is becoming a
more seamless place where almost everything is available to us, any
place, any time. The good news is that society as a whole is ready to
embrace new technologies. It' a given fact of life really, that as
technology changes, society will need to adapt. The senior generation is
no exception, with [69% of seniors feeling
confident](https://www.seniors.com.au/news-insights/discover/seniors-technology-survey)
that they will be able to keep up with future innovations in technology.
As well as technology, [[innovation is also helping in terms of [jobs
and economic
growth](https://www.viima.com/blog/importance-of-innovation#fundamental-outcomes).
It's estimated that the world economy could more than double in size by
2050, due to technology-driven improvements]{.underline}]{.mark}. On top
of this, more than 130 million jobs may be created by 2022. However, on
the flip side, due to innovation such as AI and RPA, millions of jobs
are on the line. There is also some
[research](https://datafloq.com/read/entity/research/) that shows that
wellbeing is inherently linked to innovation. [Living standards rise
alongside innovation and economic
growth](https://www.viima.com/blog/importance-of-innovation#fundamental-outcomes).
When it comes to developing countries,

[[Innovation is an essential driver of economic progress that benefits
consumers, businesses and the economy]{.underline}]{.mark} as a whole.
How does it play that role, how does it contribute to economic growth
and what can be done to promote it? What is innovation? [[In economic
terms, innovation describes the development and application of ideas and
technologies that improve goods and services or make their production
more efficien]{.underline}]{.mark}t. A classic example of innovation is
the development of steam engine technology in the 18th century. Steam
engines could be put to use in factories, enabling mass production, and
they revolutionised transport with the railways. More recently,
information technology transformed the way companies produce and sell
their goods and services, while opening up new markets and new business
models.

11-13-2018

The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: [[in the **current**]{.mark}
**social, political, and technological [landscape]{.mark}**[, a]{.mark}
prolonged [economic crisis]{.mark}, combined with rising income
inequality, [could]{.mark} well [**escalate** into]{.mark} a **[major
global]{.mark} military [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The 20**[08]{.mark}**]{.underline}-09 global financial [crisis
[**almost** bankrupted]{.mark} governments and caused systemic collapse.
Policymakers managed to pull the global economy back from the brink,
using massive]{.underline} monetary [stimulus]{.underline}, including
quantitative easing and near-zero (or even negative) interest rates.

But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure
the disease. Treating a sick economy requires structural reforms, which
can cover everything from financial and labor markets to tax systems,
fertility patterns, and education policies.

Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite
promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. And Greece, for example,
has relied on money from international creditors to keep its head
(barely) above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system
or improving its business environment.

The lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented excess
liquidity that central banks injected into their economies was not
allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it raised global asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008.

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger another economic crisis
-- one that could be even more severe than the last, because we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. A
decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the form of ultra-low interest
rates and unconventional monetary policies, has severely depleted their
power to stabilize and stimulate the economy.

If history is any guide, [the consequences]{.underline} of this mistake
[could extend **far beyond** the economy]{.underline}. According to
Harvard's Benjamin Friedman, [prolonged periods of economic
[distress]{.mark} have been characterized also by public antipathy
toward minority groups or foreign countries -- attitudes that can help
to [fuel **unrest**, **terrorism**, or]{.mark} even
**[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[For example, [during the Great Depression]{.mark}]{.underline}, US
President Herbert [Hoover signed the]{.underline} 1930
[**[Smoot-Hawley]{.mark}** Tariff Act]{.underline}, intended to protect
American workers and farmers from foreign competition. [In the
subsequent five years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. [Within a
decade, **World War II**]{.mark} had begun]{.underline}.

To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors; there is no standard path to war. But there is reason to
believe that [high levels of inequality can play a significant role in
stoking conflict]{.underline}.

[According to research]{.underline} by the economist Thomas Piketty, [a
spike in income inequality is often followed by a great
crisis]{.underline}. Income inequality then declines for a while, before
rising again, until a new peak -- and a new disaster. Though causality
has yet to be proven, given the limited number of data points, this
correlation should not be taken lightly, especially with wealth and
income inequality at historically high levels.

[This is **all the [more worrying]{.mark}** [in view of]{.mark} the
**numerous [other factors]{.mark}** [stoking]{.mark} social unrest and
diplomatic [tension,]{.mark} including **[tech]{.mark}nological
[disruption]{.mark}**, a **record-breaking [migration]{.mark} crisis**,
**anxiety over globalization**, **political [polarization]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} **rising [nationalism]{.mark}**[. All]{.mark} are symptoms
of failed policies that could turn out to be **[trigger points]{.mark}**
for a future crisis]{.underline}.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the emotionally appealing
populists to whom they are increasingly giving their support are
offering ill-advised solutions that will only make matters worse. For
example, [despite the world's unprecedented interconnectedness,
**[multilat]{.mark}eralism [is]{.mark} increasingly being
[eschewed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as countries -- most notably, Donald
Trump's US -- pursue unilateral, isolationist policies. [Meanwhile,
**[proxy wars]{.mark}** are **[raging]{.mark}** in Syria and
Yemen]{.underline}.

[Against this background, we must take seriously the possibility that
[the next]{.mark} economic [crisis]{.mark} could [lead to a
**large-scale**]{.mark} **military confrontation**]{.underline}. By the
logic of the political scientist Samuel Huntington , considering such a
scenario could help us avoid it, because it would force us to take
action. In this case, the key will be for policymakers to pursue the
structural reforms that they have long promised, while replacing
finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible and respectful global
dialogue. [The alternative may well be **[global
conflagration]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To most Americans, diseases with names like dengue fever, chikungunya,
malaria, Chagas and leishmaniasis might sound like something out of a
Victorian explorer's tales of hacking through African jungles. Yet
ongoing epidemics of these diseases are killing millions of people
around the world. Now, disease experts are increasingly concerned these
and other infections may become as familiar in the United States as West
Nile or Lyme disease. Few believe Americans face a killer epidemic from
tropical diseases. But scientists who specialize in emerging [infectious

1\. Introduction

The literature on business confidence is vast. If on the one hand some
studies indicate that [**[bus]{.mark}**iness **[con]{.mark}**fidence
acts as a **leading indicator** of macroeconomic activity and
**[influences the]{.mark} economic [environment]{.mark}**]{.underline},
on the other hand, some studies investigate the determinants of business
confidence (Khan and Upadhayaya, 2020).

Although many advances have been made, the literature on the
determinants of business confidence continues to evolve. Some studies
analyze not only the effects of macroeconomic variables, but also the
effects of other variables able to create (or reduce) uncertainties,
such as corruption (Montes and Almeida, 2017) and monetary policy
credibility (Montes, 2013; de Mendonça and Almeida, 2019). These studies
reveal that low credibility and high levels of corruption reduce
confidence due to the uncertainties that emerge.

[Uncertain]{.underline} economic [scenarios created by]{.underline}
economic [**policy [uncertainty]{.mark}** undermine **confidence**, and
[affect]{.mark} the decision making of [entrepreneurs,
who]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[postpone **investment** and
**employment**]{.mark} decisions]{.underline} in order to gain more
information (Bloom et al., 2018). Regarding the definition of economic
policy uncertainty, Al-Thaqeb and Algharabali (2019) points out that
"*Policy uncertainty is the economic risk associated with undefined
future government policies and regulatory frameworks*" (Al-Thaqeb and
Algharabali, 2019, p. 2). Baker et al. (2016) and Al-Thaqeb and
Algharabali (2019) suggest that economic policy [uncertainty
delay]{.underline} economic [**recoveries** during]{.underline} periods
of [recession as businesses]{.underline} and households
[postpone]{.underline} their decisions about [**investment** and
**consumption**]{.underline} expenditures [due to market
**uncertainty**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, regarding the effects of
economic policy uncertainty on research and development (R&D)
expenditures and innovation outputs, Tajaddini and Gholipour (2020) find
positive relationships for a set of 19 developed and developing
countries, thus, contradicting those that claim a negative association
between economic policy uncertainty and R&D expenditure.

Since the work of Bloom (2009), and due to existing controversies in the
literature, studies investigate the effects of uncertainty shocks on
different economic variables (e.g., Baker et al., 2016; Bachmann et al.,
2013; Colombo, 2013; Nodari, 2014; Donadelli, 2015; Gulen and Ion, 2015;
Moore, 2017; Istiak and Serletis, 2018; Bahmani-Oskooee and Nayeri,
2018; Bahmani- Oskooee et al., 2018; Mumtaz and Surico, 2018; Gholipour,
2019; Greenland et al., 2019; Istiak and Alam, 2019, 2020; Tajaddini and
Gholipour, 2020). In general, the findings suggest that [**macroeconomic
variables** such as **[GDP]{.mark}**, **investment** and **employment**
[are **adversely affected**]{.mark} by increased economic policy
uncertainty]{.underline}.

The political environment is also a source of uncertainty that affects
the economy. [[**Studies** provide **ev**]{.mark}idence [that]{.mark}
the [**instability** of]{.mark} the [**political** environment has
**negative effects** on]{.mark} the **[economic]{.mark}**
environment]{.underline} (e.g., Barro, 1991; Alesina and Perotti, 1996;
Svensson, 1998; Carmignani, 2003; Aisen and Veiga, 2006, 2013; Durnev,
2010; Zouhaier and Kefi, 2012; Julio and Yook, 2012; Uddin et al., 2017;
Azzimonti, 2018; Jens, 2017). These studies show that political
instability has negative effects [on **inflation**, **GDP** and
**unemployment**]{.underline}.

Political uncertainty reflects instabilities on the political scene
(i.e., involving politicians). [The instabilities arising from the
political scenario are associated to [uncertainties
**regard**]{.mark}ing possible [**changes** in]{.mark} the **["rules of
the game"]{.mark}**]{.underline} and in the functioning of institutions.
Hence, the uncertainty related to the political system is a key feature
affecting the business environment, which entrepreneurs must consider
when deciding, for instance, to start or expand their businesses. The
effects of political uncertainty are stronger when firms and politicians
have close connections and political favors might be at play.

One can suggest economic [policy uncertainty reduces entrepreneurs'
optimism]{.underline} about the future of the economy and their
business. Similarly, [[an uncertain]{.mark} political
[environment]{.mark} can **[deteriorate bus]{.mark}iness
[con]{.mark}fidence**, [producing]{.mark} **negative [effects]{.mark}**
[on the **economic environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, some
important questions arise. Does political uncertainty affect business
confidence? Is business confidence affected by economic policy
uncertainty? Are political uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty
transmitted to investment decisions through business confidence? These
questions are particularly important for developing countries since
these countries often present higher levels of political uncertainty and
economic policy uncertainty.

#### Failure causes [bankruptcies]{.underline} and [unemployment]{.underline} -- it's [unique]{.underline}: confidence is [slowly]{.underline} recovering with [stable]{.underline} support

**Boone 20** -- Dr. Laurence, PhD in Economics from London Business
School, OECD Chief Economist, Master Degree in Econometrics from the
University of Reading, MAS in Modelization and Quantitative Analysis
from Paris X-Nanterre University. "Building Confidence Crucial Amid An
Uncertain Economic Recovery", OECD Interim Economic Report,
<https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/building-confidence-crucial-amid-an-uncertain-economic-recovery.htm>,
09-16-2020

[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19
pandemic [continuing to threaten jobs, businesses and]{.underline} the
[health]{.underline} and well-being of millions [amid exceptional
uncertainty, building [**confidence** will be **crucial** to
ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[economies **recover** and
**adapt**]{.underline}]{.mark}, says the OECD's Interim Economic
Outlook.

After an unprecedented collapse in the first half of the year, [economic
[output **recovered**]{.mark} **swiftly**]{.underline} following the
easing of containment measures and the initial re-opening of businesses,
[[but]{.mark} the **[pace]{.mark}**]{.underline} of recovery [has
**[lost]{.mark}**]{.underline} some **[[momentum]{.underline}]{.mark}**
more recently. New restrictions being imposed in some countries to
tackle the resurgence of the virus are likely to have slowed growth, the
report says.

[**Uncertainty** remains **high** and the strength of the
[recovery]{.mark} varies]{.underline} markedly between countries and
between business sectors. Prospects for an inclusive, resilient and
sustainable economic growth [[will depend on]{.underline}]{.mark} a
range of factors including the likelihood of new outbreaks of the virus,
how well individuals observe health measures and restrictions, [consumer
and **[bus]{.mark}iness [con]{.mark}fidence**, [and]{.mark} the extent
to which **[government support]{.mark}** to]{.underline} maintain jobs
and [help businesses **succeeds** in **boosting demand**]{.underline}.

The Interim Economic Outlook projects global GDP to fall by 4½ per cent
this year, before growing by 5% in 2021. The forecasts are less negative
than those in OECD's June Economic Outlook, due primarily to better than
expected outcomes for China and the United States in the first half of
this year and a response by governments on a massive scale. However,
output in many countries at the end of 2021 will still be below the
levels at the end of 2019, and well below what was projected prior to
the pandemic.

If the threat from COVID-19 fades more quickly than expected, improved
business and consumer confidence could boost global activity sharply in
2021. But a stronger resurgence of the virus, or more stringent
lockdowns could cut 2-3 percentage points from global growth in 2021,
with even higher unemployment and a prolonged period of weak investment.

Presenting the Interim Economic Outlook, covering G20 economies, OECD
Chief Economist Laurence Boone said: "The world is facing an acute
health crisis and the most dramatic economic slowdown since the Second
World War. [The end is not yet in sight but [there is]{.mark} still
[**much policymakers can do** to]{.mark} help **[build
confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

She added: "[It is important that governments **avoid** the
**mistake**]{.underline} of tightening fiscal policy too quickly, as
happened after the last financial crisis. [[Without]{.mark} continued
government [support, **bankruptcies** and **unemployment**]{.mark} could
[rise]{.mark} faster]{.underline} than warranted and take a toll on
people's livelihoods for years to come. Policymakers have the
opportunity of a lifetime to implement truly sustainable recovery plans
that reboot the economy and generate investment in the digital upgrades
much needed by small and medium-sized companies, as well as in green
infrastructure, transport and housing to build back a better and greener
economy."

Optimism

In many ways, [[**optimism breeds success**. Sentiment plays a **pivotal
role** in economic recovery. When the **econ**]{.mark}omy [looks
brighter]{.mark} in the days ahead, **[entrepreneurs]{.mark} are willing
to [take risks]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **business [owners]{.mark} become
more willing to [invest]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [expansion]{.mark} of
their companies]{.underline}. Before he has even taken office, Trump
reached deal with Carrier to save the factory jobs that would have been
lost if the company moved its Indianapolis manufacturing plant to
Mexico. While the amount of credit he deserves for Ford\'s decision to
maintain its assembly plant in Kentucky seems to be a topic for debate,
the perception remains that Trump is pro-business.

Donald Trump won the Presidency because of his success in business.
Perhaps his net worth isn\'t as high as other billionaires and, quite
possibly, his real estate holdings are not as valuable as is perceived.
He has failed and come back. He takes risks and has creative ideas.
That\'s part of being an entrepreneur. Trump has long been a master
marketer and a large part of his personal brand is predicated on his
financial success. He chose an out-of-the-box pick of Linda McMahon to
head the Small Business Administration (SBA). The Americans who voted
for him are hoping that this creativity translates into more economic
growth and efficient government.

Business Policy

We already know that **[deregulation]{.underline}** and corporate tax
reform **[will be]{.underline}** two **[pillars of Trump\'s economic
policy]{.underline}**. Lower taxes for business owners provides them
with greater opportunity to invest back into their firms. Additionally,
foreign money will flow back into the United States. [This will make the
country more competitive internationally, **result**ing in greater
investment, business expansion and the resulting jobs
growth]{.underline}. If this does indeed happen, [small businesses will
thrive]{.underline}.

[Trump will enter office with **economic winds at his
back**]{.underline}. The most recent Jobs Report marked the 75th
straight month of job gains and the unemployment rate remains at (4.7
percent), below what most economists consider the full employment rate
(5 percent). Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to
flirt with the 20,000 mark. The National Federation of Independent
Business (NFIB)\'s Index of small-business confidence for December hit
its highest point since 2004, and its increase of 7.4 points to 105.8
from November\'s figure of 98.4 was the biggest month-to-month jump in
30 years.

"This is the second consecutive month in which small business owners
reported a much brighter outlook for the economy and higher expectations
for their businesses," Bill Dunkelberg, the NFIB;s chief economist. "In
this month's report, we are also finding evidence that higher optimism
is leading to increased business activity, such as capital investment."

\"[[Optimistic]{.underline}]{.mark} consumers and [business [owners are
**more likely to**]{.mark} **bet [(spend and hire)]{.mark}** [on a
future that]{.mark} seems to [hold promise]{.mark},\"]{.underline}
Dunkelberg added. \"But to maintain the enthusiasm, reality will play a
supporting role.\"

[To call 2021 the **summer of discontent** would be a **severe
understatement**. [From **Cuba** to]{.mark} **South [Africa]{.mark}**
[to **Colombia** to **Haiti**]{.mark}, often [**violent protests** are
**sweeping**]{.mark} **every corner of [the globe]{.mark}** as angry
citizens are taking to the streets]{.underline}.

[Each country has different histories and realities]{.underline} on the
ground, particularly in Haiti, where years of violence and government
corruption culminated two weeks ago in the assassination of President
Jovenel Moïse. [But they all faced [a **perfect storm**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} preexisting social,
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and political [[**hardships**,
which]{.mark} fallout from]{.underline} the
**[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 pandemic [only **[inflamed]{.mark}
further**]{.underline}. And [they [are]{.mark} merely a
**[foreshadowing]{.mark}** of the **post-coronavirus [global
tinderbox]{.mark}** that's [**looming** as]{.mark} **existing
[tensions]{.mark}** in countries across the world [**morph** into
**broader**]{.mark} **civil unrest and [uprisings]{.mark}** against
**economic hardships** and inequality **deepen**ed by the
pandemic]{.underline}.

The coronavirus pandemic was a once-in-a-century crisis that not only
shocked countries' existing health systems but also demanded a response
that impacted---and was itself shaped by---economic, political, and
security considerations. [The efforts to contain]{.underline} it may
have curbed fatalities in the short term but have inadvertently
[deepened vulnerabilities that laid the groundwork for]{.underline}
longer-term violence, [**conflict**, and **political
upheaval**]{.underline} and should serve as a danger sign to world
leaders as countries reopen---including in the United States.

[**History** is **full of examples** of pandemics being **incubators of
social unrest**]{.underline}, from the Black Death to the Spanish flu to
the great cholera outbreak in Paris, immortalized in Victor Hugo's Les
Miserables. Underlying it all this time around is a pervasive
inequality. COVID-19 has ripped open economic divides and made life
harder for already vulnerable groups, including women and girls and
minority communities.

It has also exposed weaknesses in food security and dramatically
increased the number of people affected by chronic hunger. The United
Nations estimates around one-tenth of the global population---between
720 million people and 811 million---were undernourished last year. The
impacts of climate change and environmental degradation have only
compounded the despair.

[[Take]{.mark} the [**Sahel**, where]{.mark}]{.underline}, due to [[a
**toxic cocktail**]{.mark} of conflict]{.underline}, COVID-19 lockdowns,
and climate change, the scale and severity of food insecurity
[[continues to **rise**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Countries such as Ethiopia
and Sudan are among the world's worst humanitarian crises, with
catastrophic levels of hunger. Droughts and locusts are coming at a
critical time for farmers ready to plant crops and are stopping herders
in their tracks from driving their livestock to greener pastures.

The global vaccine shortage is fueling the instability. A majority of
Africa is lagging far behind the world in vaccinations, meaning COVID-19
will continue to constrain national economies and, in turn, become a
source of potential political instability. [The [same]{.mark} is true
[for]{.mark} much of [**Latin America** and
**Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, where countries don't have enough
vaccines to protect their populations and simmering [sources of
[protest]{.mark}---such as rising **living costs**]{.underline} and
deepening inequalities---[[are]{.mark} more [likely to **boil
over**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The global risk firm Verisk Maplecroft has warned that [as many as [**37
countries** could face large]{.mark} protest
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} for up to three years. A new study by
Mercy Corps examining the intersection of COVID-19 and conflict found
concerning trends that warn of potential for new conflict, deepening
existing conflict, and worsening insecurity and instability shaped by
the pandemic response.

The group found a collapse of public confidence in governments and
institutions was a key driver of instability. People in fragile states,
already suffering from diminished trust in their government, have felt
further abandoned as they face disruptions in public services, rising
food prices, and massive economic hardships, such as unemployment and
reduced wages. Supply chains disrupted during the pandemic have seen
food prices skyrocket, while in the global recession humanitarian aid
budgets are being slashed, bringing many countries to the brink of
famine. For the first time in 22 years, extreme poverty---people living
on less than \$1.90 a day---was on the rise last year. Oxfam
International estimates that "it could take more than a decade for the
world's poorest to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic."

The [[shocks]{.mark} caused by the pandemic]{.underline} have also
[**[erode]{.mark}**d **social [cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, further
fraying relations between communities and deepening polarization. That
is especially true in the United States, where social and political
pressures both deepened the health crisis and were themselves worsened
by it. All of this should serve as a clarion call to
[countries]{.underline} that they can't prepare for, or respond to,
future health crises in a vacuum---but must [anticipate an
**economic**]{.underline}, political, and **[social
crisis]{.underline}**. This is true for [[any **severe
shock**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[brings]{.mark} the [potential for
a **breakdown in**]{.mark} **public [order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This contrasts with an intellectual tradition of arguing that
globalization, business, and [trade]{.mark} may---[by]{.mark}
**[fostering
interdependence]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---**[curb]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**the [incentives]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} engaging in domestic and
international [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. This argument has its
roots ranging as far back as the thinking of De Montesquieu \[1758 (2)\]
or Angell \[1909 (3)\], has been refined verbally by an array of
"liberalist" scholars in international relations (see the survey in ref.
4), and has recently been scrutinized in formal game-theoretical models
(see, e.g., refs. 5 and 6).

While a small body of empirical research has linked trade to interstate
wars (4, 5, 7, 8), the arguably even more pressing question of how
globalization and trade affect domestic conflicts has received even less
attention.† This is a major gap in the literature, given that since
World War II, roughly 80 to 90% of wars have been within rather than
between states (11). Hence, the goal of the current article is to study
the question of how places close to strategically important trade routes
may be more or less subject to civil conflict and how their fate is
affected by surges in globalization.‡

[[We]{.mark} have [built]{.mark}]{.underline} what---to the best of our
knowledge---is [the **[most precise]{.mark}** and **fine-grained
[dataset]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **strategic [location
importance]{.mark}** covering the entire globe. Our dataset allows us to
investigate]{.underline}, using a regression analysis, how a location's
strategic centrality affects its risk of being drawn into an armed
conflict and [how globalization can influence this centrality-conflict
nexus]{.underline}.

In order to develop an empirically testable hypothesis to guide our
statistical investigation, [we have [built a **game-theoretic
model**]{.mark} that systematically studies the incentives for engaging
in conflict]{.underline} (SI Appendix). As discussed in detail in SI
Appendix, our framework [[predicts]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[under]{.mark} mild conditions in years of [low]{.mark} **international
[trade]{.mark} openness**, strategic [territory tends to entail]{.mark}
**above-average levels of [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} (due to the
strategic value of territory providing incentives for appropriation).
[In contrast, [in years of]{.mark} **roaring [globalization]{.mark}**,
[areas]{.mark} with strategic value [are]{.mark}]{.underline}, on
average, [**[less combatted]{.mark}**, as major international [powers
have incentives to]{.mark} intervene in local disputes to **[make
sure]{.mark} that crucial [trade routes remain
open]{.mark}**]{.underline}.§ In what follows, we will present the data
and methods, before confronting these predictions to the data.

Data and Methods

To carry out our empirical analysis, we have constructed a panel dataset
that consists of grid cells of size 0.5 × 0.5 decimal degrees (55 km ×
55 km at the equator) covering the whole world from 1989 to 2018. We
have designed an algorithm to detect strategic zones in the sea,
so-called maritime "choke points" (e.g., straits or capes) that are
points of "natural congestion along two wider and important navigable
passages" that are typically of key strategic importance for
international shipping. Crucially, we have built this measure purely
based on geographical features, which has the advantage of addressing a
series of potential statistical biases---such as reverse
causation---that would arise if we were to focus on measures of actual
water transport volumes.¶ In particular, drawing on a network model, we
compute the betweenness centrality of any water location, allowing us to
uncover where crucial strategic choke points lie. SI Appendix contains
detailed variable definitions and sources and a full discussion of the
construction of all variables.

It is widely accepted that maritime choke points are of crucial
importance to world trade and global energy security. Our algorithm
identifies real ship density and all famous maritime landmarks, such as
the straits of Hormuz or Malacca and the canals of Suez or Panama.
Furthermore, our measure provides a fine-grained scale of strategic
importance for any water spot worldwide, including the great number of
less well-known locations. Fig. 1A depicts for each water location how
close it is to a choke point, as computed using our algorithm. Fig. 1B
displays for illustration major marine traffic routes (observed density
of ships in 2017 from https://www.marinetraffic.com/). Strikingly, the
proximity to waterway choke points, as computed by our algorithm based
on purely geographical features, matches remarkably well the actual
marine trade routes, hence stressing the relevance of our measure.

After having computed strategic water choke points, we have then, in a
second step, constructed, for all land locations, the distance to these
waterway bottlenecks. The obtained values across the world are displayed
in Fig. 1C. Darker colors indicate areas closer to choke points, which
typically lie close to major straits and waterways, and brighter colors
indicate zones that are further away from maritime choke points. This
measure of the strategic importance of any land location worldwide is
used as the main explanatory variable in our statistical analysis. We
study its direct impact as well as how it interacts with the volume of
world trade in a given year, which is measured by using world trade
openness from the World Bank \[trade in percentage of gross domestic
product (GDP) (18)\]. SI Appendix contains a graphical representation of
the evolution of this variable, as well as of other key covariates.

In terms of the dependent outcome variable, for measuring conflict, we
draw on fine-grained geolocalized information on conflict events from
the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) Georeferenced Event Dataset
(GED) (19). This allows us to know for each cell and year whether at
least one conflict event took place, as well as the types of events and
their number. As mentioned, all data, variable construction, and methods
are described in detail in SI Appendix.

Descriptive summary statistics of all variables of the analysis are
provided in SI Appendix. In a nutshell, the final sample is composed of
64,818 cells covering the world from 1989 to 2018, resulting in a total
of 1,944,540 observations. The unconditional likelihood for any type of
violent events for the whole sample at the cell level is 1.5%, while for
state-based it is 0.7%, for nonstate 0.2%, and 0.6% for one-sided
events. The mean number of deaths is 1.126 per year per cell. The
difference between the mean value of the outcome for the cells "close"
to choke points (above median by proximity) and for those "far away"
(below median by proximity) is also displayed. The difference is
statistically significant and positive for any type of violence (using a
t test with a bilateral null hypothesis; SI Appendix). These results
highlight a positive association between the proximity to waterway choke
points and violent events, which we shall investigate in more depth in
what follows.

In terms of the methodology used, we carry out a multivariate regression
analysis, focusing on Linear Probability Models (LPMs) when facing a
binary dependent variable and on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators
otherwise. We will include a battery of fixed effects, filtering out
time-invariant location characteristics, as well as global shocks.
Specifically, in some specifications, we go as far as including fixed
effects at the cell level (i.e., separate constant terms for each cell),
which control for all local, time-invariant potential confounders such
as local climate, elevation, sea access, distance to capital, and
historical population density, among others. We also control for annual
time effects, which analogously capture all global shocks occurring in a
given year, such as, for example, major geo-political shocks like the
fall of the Soviet Union or 9/11, major recessions such as the subprime
crisis, or health shocks such as a pandemic (e.g., severe acute
respiratory syndrome or COVID-19). The various specifications, as well
as additional estimation results, are reported in SI Appendix.

Results

We start by running a very simple regression specification before
gradually increasing complexity. In particular, we focus first on
comparing areas with high strategic importance scores (according to our
measure) with cells for which our algorithm has found a lower strategic
importance (i.e., that are further away from maritime choke points). Our
main explanatory variable is "proximity" (to the nearest choke point),
and the dependent variable of interest is the likelihood of experiencing
at least one violent event in a given cell and year. The goal of this
initial table being to report the parsimonious "raw" correlation, we
limit ourselves to controlling for latitude fixed effects (i.e., a
specific constant term for each latitude, filtering out climate zone
effects and earth perimeter# ) and annual year dummies (which account
for global shocks). All methodological details of this specification are
provided in SI Appendix.

The regression analysis of Table 1 reveals that [overall areas closer to
maritime choke points face a greater risk of conflict]{.underline}, as
shown by the fact that in all columns, the proximity variable has a
positive, statistically significant coefficient. This holds when
including a dummy for any violent event (column \[col.\] 1) and also for
various subcategories of violent events (col. 2--4). It is imprecisely
estimated for a violence intensity measure (col. 5). [The effect is
quantitatively sizable]{.underline}, as one SD greater proximity (i.e.,
1,100 km closer to a choke point, corresponding to the straight-line
distance from Paris to Rome or New York to Chicago) in the main
specification (col. 1) corresponds to a 0.31-percentage-point increase
in conflict risk, which is about a fifth of the baseline conflict risk
for a given cell and year (1.5%). Note that the results of col. 2--4
show that the quantitatively largest effect emanates from state-based
conflict (col. 2).

Next, we investigate the main prediction of our game-theoretic model (SI
Appendix), namely, that [while proximity to maritime choke points
increases the conflict risk for moderate levels of trade openness, for
peak levels of globalization, the **prediction reverses**, and locations
of **strategic importance** are expected to benefit from a relatively
**low likelihood of conflict**]{.underline}. We illustrate graphically
how the locations of strategic choke points relate to conflict
events---both for periods of high trade (Fig. 2 A and C) and low trade
(Fig. 2 B and D). We zoom in on key strategic regions: Panama Canal and
Cape of Good Hope (a full map of the world is depicted in SI Appendix).
Visual inspection suggests---in line with our predictions discussed
above---that strategic territory may bear a conflict potential, in
particular, during periods of low trade, while in times of high trade
volumes (when major powers are particularly keen to keep world trade
routes open and secure), conflicts may be less concentrated around choke
points. While these associations are interesting, they could be driven
by various confounders, and, hence, we need to perform in what follows
an in-depth regression analysis that allows us to control for
confounding variables and statistical biases.

At present, we move to a regression analysis with this interactive
effect. Note that SI Appendix presents a simplified regression
specification (featuring the same controls as in Table 1) and provides
all methodological details for the more demanding main specification
that we shall now discuss. This main regression specification features,
as before, as dependent variables several measures of violent events. As
a main explanatory variable, we still focus on the proximity to maritime
choke points, but now not only as a linear term, but also in interaction
with a measure of world trade openness (imports plus exports) in
percentage of world GDP. In this main baseline specification, we include
a more stringent set of controls. As before, we control for annual time
dummies (which account for global shocks) and latitude fixed effects
(capturing, among others, climate zone effects, earth perimeter, and
cell size), but now we also control for country fixed effects. These
different constant terms for each country allow us to control for any
time-invariant country characteristics (such as colonial heritage,
tradition of autocracy, country size, geographical features, etc.), and,
hence, our identifying statistical variation stems from comparing
different locations of the same country (e.g., Medellin with Bogota or
Miami with Nashville). Note that controlling for annual time dummies
picks up the world trade openness measure (which takes the same value
for each country and varies annually), which, hence, is dropped.

The results are displayed in Table 2. Consider the main specification of
col. 1, where [the linear effect of proximity has a statistically
significant positive coefficient, whereas its interaction with world
trade openness has the expected negative sign]{.underline}. This means
that [strategic territories face,]{.underline} on average, [a **higher
conflict risk**]{.underline} [in periods of **low trade openness**,
while with greater trade openness, they are relatively **more shielded
from armed conflict**]{.underline}, which is fully consistent with our
game-theoretic model in SI Appendix. This result carries over for
subcategories of conflict (col. 2--4) and for a conflict intensity
variable (col. 5). The results of Table 2 are represented graphically in
Fig. 3.

[The impact is **quantitatively sizable**]{.underline}, as moving one SD
(1,100 km) closer to a choke point increases by 0.4 percentage
points∥(24.8% of the unconditional baseline risk) the conflict
likelihood in periods when trade openness is low (0.4), while reducing
it by 0.2 percentage points\*\* (12.1% of the conflict baseline risk)
when trade openness is high (0.6).

In SI Appendix, we present the details of all specifications used in the
main text, in addition to results for alternative specifications. In
particular, we go one step further by running the same regression, but
including controls for cell fixed effects. These constant terms are
specific to each cell of 0.5 × 0.5 decimal degrees (55 km × 55 km at the
equator) and, hence, filter out all time-invariant characteristics of
this very fine-grained local area. In particular, this controls for the
potentially confounding impact of elevation, microclimate, sea access,
ruggedness of terrain, river proximity, and historical road network, to
name a few. This specification is described in detail in SI Appendix. It
is shown that [all [our results go through]{.mark} in this **[demanding
specification]{.mark}** and that the interaction term of interest
between the proximity to maritime choke points and world trade openness
continues [to have]{.mark} a **[statistically significant]{.mark}
negative [sign]{.mark}** in all specifications]{.underline}.

We therefore see that [[COVID-19 may cause a decline in U.S]{.mark}.
economic [power]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which may]{.mark}
**[undermine]{.mark}** its **[military readiness]{.mark}** and ability
to support future economic gains]{.underline}. However, the next
question is: does the PRC seek to challenge the U.S. for global primacy,
and if so, why? In his speech to the Communist Party in 2017, President
[Xi Jinping claimed that China should now]{.underline}, "[take center
stage in the world]{.underline}."4 [A key part in of this effort is
represented by Xi's 2013 Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline} (OBOR),
which seeks to extend the PRC's economic, political, and cultural
influence throughout south Asia to the Middle East and into Europe. The
[OBOR utilizes the]{.underline} newly created Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank ([AIIB]{.underline}), [an alternative to the World
Bank]{.underline}, [to finance infrastructure projects throughout the
different regions]{.underline} (Liao and McDowell 2016). From the power
transition standpoint, it therefore appears that the PRC is developing a
string of assets and bases extending from the Pacific through the Indian
Ocean to the Persian Gulf. Numerous U.S. [military planners view these
developments as a **deliberative effort** to **undermine U.S. power**
and influence in both the Pacific and Middle East theaters]{.underline}.

In theoretical terms, [if we accept that the OBOR represents an effort
by the PRC]{.underline} ([the rising power]{.underline}) [to supplant
the U.S.]{.underline}, [war could still be avoided if the power
transition moves at a relatively slower rate]{.underline}. Powell's
(2006) model establishes that [dominant powers only initiate preemptive
war if they are declining at precipitous rates]{.underline}. This is
where COVID-19 poses a significant threat. [Since the
outbreak]{.underline}, [the U.S. economy has declined by 4.8%, and the
U.S. is borrowing from its future at high levels]{.underline}.5 [[If the
PRC wanted]{.mark} [to challenge the US]{.mark} for
supremacy]{.underline}, **[[this would be the
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and there is some evidence that the PRC is
**exploiting the opportunity**]{.underline}. Beginning in May 2020, the
Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) is engaging in repeated clashes with the
Indian Armed Forces in the Ladekh region as part of a longstanding
border dispute.6 As of July 2020, China is coming close to forming a
strategic partnership with Iran. The pact would give the PRC a foothold
in the Middle East, secure discounted oil, and perhaps allow for more
oil trades to be settled in non-dollar denominations. This effort is in
spite of significant strategic interests in the region and growing
hostilities between Washington and Tehran.

[The greater concern is that [China will use its]{.mark} newfound [clout
to accelerate]{.mark} its [effort to]{.mark} **[take control]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} much of the territory in [the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}. [China has long claimed large portions of
this key area as its own]{.underline}, whereas Vietnam, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Brunei who all have competing claims. The US has long
served as a balancer to prevent China from encroaching. However,
beginning in December 2013, China constructed and later militarized
artificial islands in the South China Sea to reinforce its territorial
claims, despite promises not to do so.7 In this period, [the states of
Southeast Asia have typically looked to the U.S. Navy to challenge
China's claims]{.underline}. It has done so through Freedom of
Navigation exercises. However, now, [with COVID-19]{.underline}, [the
Navy's capabilities are in doubt.]{.underline}

Interestingly, most analysts conclude that China is not exploiting the
opportunity in the area. Instead, the PRC's efforts to build and fortify
their islands continue at the previous rate, indicating "business as
usual."8Nonetheless, [the U.S. seems concerned about the possibility
that China will seek to exploit the opportunity created by
COVID-19]{.underline}. The [Trump]{.underline} administration [is
therefore sending three carrier strike groups]{.underline}, [with a
large influx of naval vessels]{.underline}, [into the area to re-assert
American control of the seas]{.underline}. Although [this]{.underline}
increases U.S. capability, it also [signals weakness]{.underline}, [in
that the U.S. would not need to take such dramatic steps unless it faced
a **significant challenge**]{.underline}. While it does not appear that
the US is ready to initiate a preemptive challenge here, this increased
militarization raises the possibility of accidents, which in turn does
increase the probability of conflict. Empirically, military
mobilizations such as these raise the possibility of accidents that may
trigger militarized interstate disputes, or military crises short of war
(Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004). Theoretically, military mobilizations
may temporarily increase a state's power, but this increase may be
unsustainable given the increasing cost of putting armed forces in
theater. This creates a dynamic where a state that has mobilized may be
forced to use its weapons before it is compelled to redeploy them
(Slantchev 2005; Tarar 2013).

3 COVID-19's Long Term Threat

These [observations lead to several conclusions about the immediate
security situation]{.underline}. [[COVID-19 seems to have]{.mark}
**[cost the U.S.]{.mark}** some of its [military capability relative to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This may encourage China to]{.mark}
**[push the U.S. while it is weak]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and
conversely]{.underline}, [may compel the U.S. to mobilize to counter
this threat]{.underline}. Since each of these activities is a response
to the economic shock of COVID-19, we can see that [the [virus]{.mark}
has **[increased the likelihood]{.mark}** [of a]{.mark} **[militarized
encounter]{.mark}** between the U.S. and China.]{.underline} However, it
is important to recognize that even if China were to succeed in all of
its military challenges to the U.S., this alone would not shift hegemony
from the U.S. The key reason for this is that the majority of economic
actors in the world seem to view the USD as the key reserve currency,
and at this point, the RMB is not in a position to challenge that status
(Norrlof et al. 2020; Oatley et al. 2013; Poast 2015).9 Despite
significant criticism of the Trump administration during the economic
shock of COVID-19, much of the world seems to view Federal Reserve
Chairman Jerome Powell as a critical and stable player in international
monetary policy. Powell indicated that the U.S. will continue to support
global growth by keeping U.S. interest rates low. This allows for more
money to be available for the rest of the world. Indirectly, this move
may make China more powerful by encouraging investments in their market.
However, this is also keeping the world tied to the dollar based system,
which is the key component of American power. So long as the rest of the
world continues to rely on USD as the means to settle transactions, and
so long as the PRC's market seems less transparent and stable, [[the US
will continue to maintain its]{.mark} position of [power]{.mark} in the
international system]{.underline}.

However, this [[is]{.mark} **[based on the assumption]{.mark}** that
[the]{.mark} **[US will be able to recover]{.mark}** whatever power it
has temporarily lost due to COVID-19]{.underline}. [There are a few
reasons to call this assumption into question]{.underline}. First, [the
US right now is the global epicenter of the COVID-19
crisis]{.underline}, despite its economic power and large medical
infrastructure. This is largely attributed to a poor political response,
which is causing the virus to spread at a much faster rate than in other
states. As a result, the US now finds itself facing travel restrictions
from numerous countries. This may give other states less reason to
engage in economic transactions with Americans. These lost exchanges
will likely be replaced by interacting with other citizens throughout
the globe, and will therefore be settled in non-dollar denominations.
The more this occurs, the more demand for USD could decline into the
future. [The US could potentially find itself increasing isolated with
fewer individuals demanding its currency]{.underline}. Should this
occur, the ability of the US to finance its budgets through deficit
spending will decrease, and it will need to raise taxes and cut
spending. Some of this will likely be on defense, which means that the
ability of the US to defend interests in the Pacific and the Middle East
will decline, opening the door for China.

Even worse, [the political rhetoric inside the US is encouraging these
changes]{.underline}. President Trump's foreign policy platform is
described as "American First", which represents a combination of
isolationism and unilateralism, and a general rejection of multilateral
cooperation. If that is the case, each state in the international system
will need to begin planning to move away from the American backed
system. The [damage done by COVID-19 to the US market]{.underline}, [and
the weakening of the US position as a result of the virus]{.underline},
[will accelerate this process.]{.underline}

These changes will not happen overnight, and will not happen so quickly
that a rapid transition will occur. This means that it is unlikely that
COVID-19 will increase the risk of general war between the US and China,
though it does raise the risk of crises and limited encounters. However,
over the long term, [[if the US is unable to get the virus under
control]{.mark} and develop a plan of action]{.underline}, [[COVID-19
does pose]{.mark} **[significant threats]{.mark}** [to US]{.mark}
**military** and **economic [hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Place your bets for [[the]{.mark} coming [race to
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It [[will]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n epic
[contest]{.mark}]{.underline} among the world's most significant
economies, **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}** generational and
**[[geopolitical]{.mark} [consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For
context, [think back to what the United States accomplished after World
War II, when it rose as an economic power to shape a better

[[The]{.underline} [post-COVID19 race]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
**[determine whether]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} rebounds in a manner that allows it to
**[[retain]{.underline}]{.mark}** the mantle of **[global
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More likely [for the moment,
[Beijing could leverage]{.mark} its]{.underline} first-mover advantage
-- alongside a [[faster]{.mark} economic [recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}
across Asian markets -- [accelerating the trend toward a Chinese-centric
globalization]{.underline}.

Elsewhere, as President Macron argued [this]{.underline} week to the
Financial Times, the coming months [**[could determine]{.mark}**
[**whether** the **E**]{.mark}uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion
**[collapses]{.mark}** as a political and economic project]{.underline}.
The days ahead also **[[could]{.mark} [trigger]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
dangerous widening of the economic gap between emerging markets and the
developed world -- with **[[escalating conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and surging migration.

It may seem premature to reflect on which of the globe's economies is
likely to have the most robust and lasting economic comeback -- and with
what geopolitical impact. After all, this was a week in which the
International Monetary Fund projected a 3% contraction in global GDP for
2020, the most dramatic drop since the Great Depression.

Yet it is the details behind that dismal forecast that should raise
concerns within the U.S. and Europe. Their steeper economic decline and
slower recovery could lay the seeds for a long-lasting shift of global
tectonic plates to China's advantage.

The IMF projected a U.S. economic decline of about 6% in 2020 and a
contraction of the eurozone of 7.5%. That compares to projected Chinese
economic growth for 2020 of 1.2% after a first quarter real decline of
6.7% -- far less than the 10%-plus dip many experts had expected. The
only group of countries in the world projected to be in positive
territory are East Asian, at roughly 1%.

Even if one accepts that Chinese coronavirus fatalities likely are
greater than their public figures and that the growth decline is likely
larger, that doesn't change the potential for a scenario that Deloitte
and Salesforce this week referred to as "Sunrise in the East."

Describing this scenario, as one of four possibilities they list, they
write, "The global center of power shifts decisively east as China and
other East Asian nations take the reigns as primary powers on the world
stage and lead global coordination of the health system and other
multilateral institutions."

That comes with the broader acceptance of greater surveillance
mechanisms as part of the public good, a faster recovery of East Asian
countries with less economic impact from COVID19, and a significant
ramping up of Chinese foreign direct investment to burnish its global
reputation.

Still, the U.S. has a host of incumbent advantages that could serve it
well if it uses its economic recovery to also strengthen its
infrastructure, if it reverses runaway unemployment quickly, if it can
tame political polarization and, most significantly, if it rediscovers
its taste for collaborative global leadership.

In the economic race, no advantage is greater than the dollar.

China may be the world's second largest economy, but the Chinese yuan
makes up only 2% of global payments and reserves while the dollar
accounts for roughly two thirds of foreign exchange reserves. The dollar
underpins four-fifths of global supply chains.

The Economist reckons China could chip away at U.S. economic advantages
through three underestimated strengths of its own: as a trusted debtor,
an attractive creditor, and increasingly as a tech partner.

As a debtor, China's \$13 trillion bond market is the world's second
largest and has weathered the crisis well. Chinese debt returned 1.3% in
the first quarter, vastly better than the 15.5% decline for other
emerging market bonds. Over the same period, the Chinese market added
\$8.5 billion (60 billion yuan) in net inflows.

As a creditor, China has remained willing and generous, an approach that
served the U.S. well after World War II. For example, it declared its
willingness to back a G20 deal to suspend bilateral loan repayments by
poorer countries, a sizable benefit also at its own cost.

On the tech front, few countries were as ready as China for money and
people to go entirely online. Tencent and Ant Financial have more than a
billion users each for their digital wallets, and they are expanding
rapidly throughout Asia. OneConnect, an offshoot of China's largest
insurer, provides financial institutions in sixteen Asian countries with
cloud-based services.

So, what other advantages can the United States leverage in this race?

Never underestimate the brittleness of an authoritarian country under
stress. Its broad censorship, it's opaque legal system, and the nature
of its surveillance state are hardly models to emulate.

Beyond that, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is not alone in
proposing that his country relocate high-value supply chains from China.
If many countries do the same, the manufacturing foundation of China's
economy could erode.

The Financial Times' Gideon Rachman adds that the global trust in the
dollar is just one of two built-in U.S. advantages that are difficult to
dislodge.

The other?

"Where, outside your home country, would you most like your children to
go to university or to work?" he writes.

Most significant in this race would be if **[[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [regained]{.mark}]{.underline}** its appetite for
political and economic **[[leadership as the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
world's premier "[**[convening power."]{.underline}**]{.mark}

That need not be done at the cost of China -- or anyone else.

The race still can be won if U.S. leaders see it as a marathon and
recall that much of the world long embraced their global leadership
because partners learned they were more likely to win as American
partners.

This economic rebound from COVID19 will be patchy and uneven. [**[Being
first out the gate will be significant]{.mark}**, and [that is likely to
be China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet history has taught the United States
that it's victory will be longest lasting if it can achieved alongside
partners and allies.4.

Nearly [[300 U.S. CEOs]{.underline}]{.mark} participated in Chief
Executive's CEO Confidence Index poll in June, [[sharing their prospect
of the U.S. economy and business]{.underline}]{.mark} landscape. While
their ratings of [[current business conditions remained
flat]{.underline}]{.mark} month-over-month, [[at 6.4 out of
10]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[their forecast for business 12 months from
now dropped another 6 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [down to
5.6/10]{.underline} from 5.9/10 in May. That reading is now 20 percent
off where it was at the beginning of the year, before Russia's invasion
of Ukraine, when [CEOs told us they were increasingly]{.underline}
[hopeful that]{.underline} persistent [issues in the supply chain and
growing inflation]{.underline}---and even Covid-19---[would wind down
this year]{.underline}. **[[It is the lowest level it's been since
January 2013]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the heels of the "Fiscal Cliff"
drama in Washington and ahead of further debt ceiling negotiations. CEOs
say it's the uncertainty of the situation more than specific issues that
is driving their forecast down, although the list of concerns they
shared continues to grow each month. Among those: market volatility, a
chaotic geopolitical scene, uncontrolled inflation, record-high oil
prices, and continued labor and supply chain shortages are all adding to
the mix fueling doubts over the future. "The economy runs on oil, and
until we get more, things are not getting better," said Darrel Box, CEO
at Lafayette Regional Health Center in Lexington, Missouri, who also
lists labor and supply costs and shortages as reasons for his 4 out of
10 rating of business conditions 12 months from now (considered "Weak"
according to our 10-point scale points). "Supply chain issues remain and
do not seem to be getting any better," said the CEO of an electronic
component manufacturer participating in the poll. "Finding people is
another major problem, so even if we find the parts, we will still have
issues executing."

#### Small business confidence collapsed now -- inflation, supply chain disruptions, lack of workers

[[80% of small-business owners say their business\' financial health has

a new Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices survey found. Of
those, [[67% have increased wages to retain employees, and 61% have
increased wages to attract new employees. Meanwhile, 60% said they\'ve
offset their cost increases by passing it off to consumers by raising
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}. Increasing energy costs -- up 32% overall
over the past year -- are having a negative impact on bottom lines, 73%
of small-business owners said. Overall, **[[91% of small-business owners
say broader economic trends, such as inflation, supply chain issues and
workforce challenges are hurting their
businesses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And while the U.S. economy is
considered strong by multiple measurements, 56% of small-business owners
say the economy has worsened since January this year. As small
businesses grapple with inflation -- it\'s adding to other challenges
they\'re already facing. At the top of the list, hiring and retaining
qualified workers remains the top challenge cited by small-business
owners, the survey found, as job openings remain near a record high with
more than 11 million as of the end of February

[increased since the pandemic began]{.mark}]{.underline}** (just 5%

the survey reveals **[leaders were [overly bullish about]{.mark} their

did, however, reveal learnings had been made. Some 70% of leaders
questioned said the pandemic had a positive impact on their digital
strategies; more than 50% said communication had improved, and nearly
60% agreed their attitude to risk management had been positively
impacted. Commenting on the research, CEO of DuPont Sustainable
Solutions, Davide Vassallo, said: "By placing a premium on achieving
cost efficiencies by minimising inventories, streamlining supply chains,
sourcing from low-cost labour markets, and implementing just-in-time
manufacturing, it left companies with little flexibility to absorb the
supply, sourcing, operating, and commercial shocks caused by the
pandemic." According to the report, **[some [64%]{.mark} of respondents
[said]{.mark} the [pandemic]{.mark} had [negatively impacted their
supply chain]{.mark}, with 36% saying it had negatively impacted
operations]{.underline}**.

[[The economic and financial fallout from the war]{.mark}, and the

Because world energy markets are so deeply integrated,]{.underline} a
spike in global oil prices---represented by the Brent BRN00, +0.47%
benchmark---will strongly affect U.S. crude oil (West Texas
Intermediate) prices. Yes, the U.S. is now a minor net energy exporter;
however, the macro-distribution of the shock will be negative. While a
small cohort of energy firms will reap higher profits, households and
[[businesses will experience a massive price shock]{.underline}]{.mark},
leading them to reduce spending. Given these dynamics, [even an
otherwise strong U.S. economy will suffer a sharp slowdown, [tilting

financial conditions [and the resulting effects on business, consumer,

Russia---however large or limited they turn out to be, and however

business confidence as an economic indicator. This is nothing new. It's
surprising headline business confidence figures receive so much
attention.

Commentators make the constant mistake of saying the ANZ survey is a
business confidence survey. The same applies to the NZIER's QSBO. They
are surveys of business views across an array of key indicators
including prospects for growth, hiring, whether firms are planning to
invest and experiences with inflation / costs. These indicators matter.
Business confidence is one question.

The so-called "soft" or "perception" indicators are the hard data of
tomorrow. They are estimates and view based but you can't ignore them.
They are well correlated with growth.

In a perfect world we'd have timely "hard" official data and statistics.
We don't. Official data comes with a lag. So, we need to rely on
sentiment-based indicators if we want timely readings on the economy and
a guide as to the year ahead.

The likes of the ANZ survey are showing a sombre mood when it comes to
indicators that matter. The ANZ survey asks key questions about
activity, employment, investment and profitability. When these
indicators head to zero, which they have done now, growth can do the
same. Those indicators were weak in 2000 during the so-called winter of
discontent -- and growth slowed to 0.9% year on year.

Growth did rebound. But back then the economy was early in the economic
expansion. The economy is late in the business cycle this time around.
The [economy]{.underline} has [[tend]{.mark}ed [to go through
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ten-year cycle]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [so
businesses are]{.underline} **[naturally]{.underline}**
[looking]{.underline} more [nervously over their shoulders]{.underline}
at present. The [economy is going [through]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[substantial]{.underline}**]{.mark} [economic
[change]{.mark}]{.underline} too [and businesses are]{.underline}
**[wary]{.underline}**. There is little argument over the need to change
the economy. However, there are serious questions about the actual
economic plan and what the new economy looks like. That is a key issue
that needs addressed.

Some of the [[weakness in]{.underline} **[survey]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[measure[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** could [be [put down to the
way]{.mark} survey [questions are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[phrased]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Firms are asked their view and given
three options; will conditions improve, stay the same, or worsen. For a
lot of firms' things are damned good. It's telling that finding skilled
staff is the biggest problem firms are facing. Businesses are facing
capacity constraints. So, zero readings may reflect a levelling out at a
high base.

### Econ defense

#### No Econ Impact 

**Walt 20** -- Stephen M, the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University. "Will a Global Depression
Trigger Another World War?", Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
05-13-2020

One familiar argument is [the]{.underline} so-called
**[[diversionary]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or "scapegoat") [theory of
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [suggests]{.underline} that
[leaders]{.underline} who are worried about their popularity at home
[will]{.underline} try to **[divert attention]{.underline}** from their
failures [by **provoking a crisis**]{.underline} with a foreign power
and maybe even using force against it. Drawing on this logic,
[some]{.underline} Americans now [worry]{.underline} that President
Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [will decide to **attack**]{.underline} a
country like [**Iran** or **Venezuela**]{.underline} in the run-up to
the presidential election and especially if he thinks he's likely to
lose. [This]{.underline} outcome [[strikes me as **unlikely**, even if
one ignores]{.mark} the **logical** and **[empirical flaws]{.mark}** in
the theory **itself**. War is **always a gamble**, and should things go
**badly**---even a **little bit**---it would **hammer the last nail** in
the **coffin** of **Trump's declining fortunes**]{.underline}. Moreover,
none of the countries Trump might consider going after pose an imminent
threat to U.S. security, and even [his **staunchest supporters** may
wonder why he is **wasting time** and **money** going after Iran or
Venezuela]{.underline} at a moment [when **thousands of Americans** are
**dying preventable deaths**]{.underline} at home. [Even a successful
military action won't **put Americans back to work**]{.underline},
[create]{.underline} the sort of **[testing-and-tracing]{.underline}**
regime that competent governments around the world have been able to
implement already, [or **hasten**]{.underline} the development [of a
**vaccine**]{.underline}. [The **same logic** is likely to guide the
decisions of **other world leaders** too.]{.underline} Another familiar
folk theory is "military Keynesianism." War generates a lot of economic
demand, and it can sometimes lift depressed economies out of the
doldrums and back toward prosperity and full employment. The obvious
case in point here is World War II, which did help the U.S economy
finally escape the quicksand of the Great Depression. Those who are
convinced that great powers go to war primarily to keep Big Business (or
the arms industry) happy are naturally drawn to this sort of argument,
and they might worry that governments looking at bleak economic
forecasts will try to restart their economies through some sort of
military adventure. I doubt it. [It takes a **really big war** to
generate a **significant stimulus**]{.underline}, and [[it is hard to
imagine]{.mark} any country launching [a]{.mark} **[large-scale
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}---with all its attendant risks---at a moment
[[when **debt levels** are]{.mark} **already
[soaring]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More importantly, [[there are
lots]{.mark} of **[easier]{.mark}** and more **direct [ways]{.mark}**
[to **stimulate the economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}---infrastructure
spending, unemployment insurance, even "helicopter payments"---and
[**launching a war** has to be one of the least **efficient methods
available**]{.underline}. The threat of war usually spooks investors
too, which any politician with their eye on the stock market would be
loath to do. Economic [[downturns can encourage war in]{.mark} some
**[special circumstances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially when a war
would enable a country facing severe hardships to capture something of
immediate and significant value. Saddam Hussein's decision to seize
Kuwait in 1990 fits this model perfectly: The Iraqi economy was in
terrible shape after its long war with Iran; unemployment was
threatening Saddam's domestic position; Kuwait's vast oil riches were a
considerable prize; and seizing the lightly armed emirate was
exceedingly easy to do. Iraq also owed Kuwait a lot of money, and a
hostile takeover by Baghdad would wipe those debts off the books
overnight. In this case, Iraq's parlous economic condition clearly made
war more likely. Yet [I cannot think of **any country** in **similar
circumstances today**. Now is **hardly the time** for **Russia** to try
to **grab**]{.underline} more of **[Ukraine]{.underline}**---[if it even
**wanted** to]{.underline}---[or for China to **make a play for
Taiwan**]{.underline}, [because the **costs** of doing so would
**clearly outweigh the economic benefits**]{.underline}. [Even
conquering an **oil-rich country**]{.underline}---the sort of greedy
acquisitiveness that Trump occasionally hints at---[**doesn't look
attractive** when there's a **vast glut on the market**]{.underline}. I
might be worried if some weak and defenseless country somehow came to
possess the entire global stock of a successful coronavirus vaccine, but
that scenario is not even remotely possible. If one takes a longer-term
perspective, however, a sustained economic depression could make war
more likely by strengthening fascist or xenophobic political movements,
fueling protectionism and hypernationalism, and making it more difficult
for countries to reach mutually acceptable bargains with each other. The
history of the 1930s shows where such trends can lead, although the
economic effects of the Depression are hardly the only reason world
politics took such a deadly turn in the 1930s. Nationalism, xenophobia,
and authoritarian rule were making a comeback well before COVID-19
struck, but the economic misery now occurring in every corner of the
world could intensify these trends and leave us in a more war-prone
condition when fear of the virus has diminished. **[On
balance]{.underline}**, however, [I do not think that even]{.underline}
the **[extraordinary economic conditions]{.underline}** we are
witnessing today are going to [have **much impact** on the **likelihood
of war**]{.underline}. Why? First of all, [if depressions **were** a
**powerful cause of war**, there would be a **lot more** of the
**latter**]{.underline}. To take one example, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has suffered
**40**]{.mark} **or more [recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the
country was founded, [[yet]{.mark} it has [fought]{.mark} perhaps
[20]{.mark} interstate [wars]{.mark}, most of them **[unrelated
to]{.mark} the state of [the economy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To
paraphrase the economist Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock
market, [if recessions were a **powerful cause of war,** they would have
predicted "**nine out of the last five** (or fewer)."]{.underline}
Second, [[states **do not start wars** unless they believe they will win
a **quick** and]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively **[[cheap
victory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As John Mearsheimer showed in his
classic book Conventional Deterrence, [national leaders **avoid** war
when they are convinced it will be **long, bloody, costly**, and
**uncertain**]{.underline}. To choose war, political leaders have to
convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive
victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost. [**Europe** went
to war in **1914**]{.underline} [with each side believing it would win a
**rapid and easy victory**]{.underline}, and Nazi Germany developed the
strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as quickly and
cheaply as possible. [**Iraq** attacked **Iran** in 1980]{.underline}
[because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in **disarray** and
would be **easy to defeat**]{.underline}, and George W. [Bush **invaded
Iraq** in 2003 convinced the war would be **short, successful**, and
**pay for itself.** The fact that each of these leaders **miscalculated
badly** does not alter the **main point**: **No matter** what a
country's **economic condition** might be, its leaders **will not go to
war** unless they think they can do so **quickly, cheaply**, and with a
**reasonable probability of success.**]{.underline} Third, and most
important, [[the]{.mark} primary [**motivation** for]{.mark} most [wars
is]{.mark} the desire for **[security]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[not
**economic gain**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For this reason, the odds of war
increase when states believe the long-term balance of power may be
shifting against them, when they are convinced that adversaries are
unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when they are
confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish a secure
position if they act now. The historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that
"[**every war** between **Great Powers**]{.underline} \[between 1848 and
1918\] ... [started as a **preventive** war, not as a **war of
conquest**]{.underline}," and [that **remains true**]{.underline} of
most wars fought since then. The bottom line: **[Economic
conditions]{.underline}** (i.e., a depression) may affect the broader
political environment in which decisions for war or peace are made, but
they [are only **one factor among many** and **rarely** the most
significant]{.underline}. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic has large,
lasting, and negative effects on the world economy---as seems quite
likely---it is not likely to affect the probability of war very much,
especially in the short term. To be sure, I can't rule out another
powerful cause of war---stupidity---especially when it is so much in
evidence in some quarters these days. So there is no guarantee that we
won't see misguided leaders stumbling into another foolish bloodletting.
But given that it's hard to find any rays of sunshine at this particular
moment in history, I'm going to hope I'm right about this one.

**[[We identify]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[structural
shocks]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[by [using]{.mark} a [Cholesky
decomposition of the covariance matrix]{.mark} of the VAR reduced-form

[on]{.mark} the [macro variables]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
characteristics of the GPR index discussed in Section 2---as well as the
comparison to the EPU index in Section 3---lend support to this
assumption. For instance, **[Jackson and Morelli]{.underline}** (2011)
**[list [religion, revenge, ethnic cleansing, and bargaining

A.4 in the Appendix we explore robustness to an alternative Cholesky
ordering, as well as to alternative specifications of the baseline VAR
model.

The solid lines in Figure 9 show the median impulse responses to an
exogenous increase in the GPR index of 167 points, while the light- and
dark-shaded areas represent the corresponding 68 percent and 90 percent
pointwise credible bands, respectively. The size of the shock equals the
average change in the index following the nine episodes of largest
increases in the GPR index.29 The rise in the GPR index induces a small
and short-lived increase in the EPU index and a decline in consumer
sentiment. Intuitively, geopolitical risk can induce some economic
policy uncertainty on items such as national security and the fiscal
budget and negatively weigh on consumer sentiment. On the real side, IP
declines quickly, bottoming out at negative 0.9 percent after about 6
months, before reverting back to trend. The deterioration in labor
market conditions is substantial but more gradual, with payroll
employment reaching a trough of negative 0.4 percent a year after the
shock. Gross trade also drops, with U.S. imports and exports falling
nearly 2 percent relative to the baseline. Figure A.7 in the Appendix
plots the response of private investment to a GPR shock, based on an
extension of the baseline model estimated on quarterly data. The
economically significant decline in investment following a GPR shock,
together with the decline in employment, is consistent with models of
investment under uncertainty a la Dixit and Pindyck (1994).30

On the financial side, the response of the stock market is economically
and statistically significant. Stock prices drop by almost 3 percent on
impact and remain below baseline for a little over three months. The
increase in the GPR leads to a decrease in oil prices, which bottom out
at 7 percent below baseline after three months. This result stands in
contrast with much of the conventionally held view that higher
geopolitical risk drives up oil prices persistently---a view that might
reflect a selective memory that confounds all geopolitical tensions with
oil supply shocks driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
Finally, the yield on two-year Treasuries declines by about 20 basis
points, indicating both a worsening of the macroeconomic outlook and a
loosening of the monetary policy stance.

One useful way to assess the exposure to GPR of various sectors of the
U.S. economy is depicted in Figure 10. We add to the VAR model the
cumulative excess return of firms in given industries relative to the
S&P 500.n The solid lines show the excess return for 6 industries. The
defense industry, which is perhaps directly exposed to geopolitical
risk, records a positive but short-lived excess return; by contrast,
industries that are exposed to the overall U.S. economy---such as
aircraft, steelworks, and mining---display somewhat persistent negative
returns. The oil industry, which some commentators argued could benefit
from wars, especially in the Middle East, displays an initial positive
excess return followed by a persistent decline, a response that mimics
the path of oil prices. Finally, the insurance industry moves in sync
with the overall U.S. stock market.

4.2 Threats versus Acts

Next, we evaluate the difference between innovations in the two broad
components of the GPR index, the GPA geopolitical acts index and the GPT
geopolitical threats index, by replacing the GPR index with the GPA and
GPT indexes in the benchmark VAR. To achieve identification, we use a
Cholesky ordering, with the GPA index ordered first and the GPT index
ordered second. We interpret the first shock the GPA shock -as the
realization of some adverse geopolitical events that could induce an
increase in geopolitical threats; we interpret the second shock the GPT
shock -as capturing geopolitical threats that are not contemporaneously
associated with geopolitical acts, such as tensions building up before
wars or after terrorist attacks.

The impulse responses to the GPA and GPT shocks are shown for selected
variables in Figure 11. In presenting the results, we adopt the
following exposition scheme, which is best viewed in color.
Specifically, the responses to the GPA shock are plotted using a
green-based color motif, while the responses to the GPT shock are
plotted using a red-based color motif.

Starting from the responses of the three uncertainty proxies, a GPA
shock of size 288---a shock sized to be equal to the 7 largest spikes in
GPA, shown in panel (a)---induces an initial increase in the GPT and EPU
indexes, followed by a period of below-average GPT and EPU that lasts
for about a year. Thus, these responses are consistent with the
realization of acts leading to the resolution of threats and
uncertainty. By contrast, a GPT shock---shown in panel (b)---leads to a
persistent increase in GPT which remains elevated for over a year- and
in EPU. The GPA index, which by assumption does not move on impact,
increases for about one year, as in our sample many geopolitical threats
precede geopolitical acts.

The responses of activity, trade, and the stock market show that the GPA
and GPT shocks have asymmetric effects on the U.S. economy. A shock to
the GPA leads to a small but short-lived decline in economic activity
and trade, whereas the stock market rises sharply one month after the
shock. By contrast, a shock to the GPT induces large and protracted
recessionary effects, as well as a decline in stock prices.
Incidentally, the response of the stock market lends support to the old
idea, attributed to London financier Nathan Rothschild, that one should
buy stocks "on cannons," and sell them "on trumpets."

Figure 12 further elaborates on the asymmetric response of the stock
market by depicting the response of cumulative excess returns in six
industries to GPA and GPT shocks. Excess returns in all industries
feature an asymmetric response, albeit to a various degree. The defense
industry features the largest asymmetry: defense companies, on average,
earn an excess return of about 5 percent for more than two years
following a GPA shock, while they earn only a modest and shortlived
excess return following a GPT shock. Excess returns in the steel and
mining industries are also asymmetric---positive when geopolitical acts
materialize and negative when threats are high. By contrast, the
asymmetry in excess returns for insurance companies is economically
modest.

One possible interpretation of the asymmetric effects of shocks to acts
and threats is that the act component of GPR leads to a resolution of
the uncertainty around a particular set of events, as well as to a
coordinated policy response that ends up giving protection on the worst
possible outcomes. By contrast, threat shocks depress asset prices and
economic activity because they increase uncertainty and send signals
about future adverse events. 2 The finding that the realization of the
event has only modest economic consequences compared to the threat
echoes the findings of theoretical models where agents form expectations
using a worst case probability, as for instance in lint and Schneider
(2014).

5 International Effects of Higher Geopolitical Risk

This section characterizes the international effects of rising
geopolitical tensions. We first estimate a battery of structural VAR
models, which we use to track the macroeconomic implications of an
exogenous rise in geopolitical risk on real activity. We then test
whether global stock market returns depend on geopolitical risk.
Finally, we estimate panel regressions to unveil whether geopolitical
risk affects international capital flows.

5.1 Geopolitical Risk and Real Activity

We first study whether GPR shocks have adverse consequences on the real
economy outside the United States. We start by looking at the response
of world IP and IP in advanced and emerging economies. Importantly, the
emerging economies' IP index includes mostly Asian, European, and Latin
American countries. Reliable data on IP in major oil producing
countries---which are likely to be highly exposed to the geopolitical
risks captured by our index---are not available. We then estimate the
response of real activity in three countries: Canada and the United
Kingdom---as we used newspapers from these two countries in the
construction of the index---and Mexico, an emerging economy selected for
its large exposure to the U.S. economy.

We estimate a battery of VAR models consisting of the GPR index, the EPU
index for the United States, and IP.\'14 As for the U.S. model, we
identify a GPR shock ordering the GPR index first in a Cholesky
decomposition of the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals. The black
lines in Figure 13 depict the median responses of IP for the six
countries and regions listed above. These impulse responses suggest that
a GPR shock has global consequences---world IP declines by about 0.5
percent one year after the shock---but its effects are mostly
concentrated in advanced economies. By contrast, the emerging economies
included in our index, on average, do not respond to geopolitical risks.
Yet, Mexico---possibly through its large exposure to U.S.
trade---experiences a modest but persistent decline in real activity.\
5.2 Geopolitical Risk and Stock Returns

We now turn to examining the reaction of stock market returns to changes
in geopolitical risk. We do so both for the sample covered by the
historical GPR index and for the sample covered by the benchmark GPR
index.

The baseline econometric specification echoes the work of Berkman,
Jacobsen, and Lee (2011). These authors find that disaster risk
depresses stock returns. They measure disaster risk by counting the
number of active crises recorded in the International Crisis Database
discussed in Section 3 and plotted in Figure 7. Since their measure of
disaster risk is tightly linked to geopolitical events, in this section
we ask if our proxy, which displays only a weak correlation with their
crisis index, can help us uncover a significant relationship between
geopolitical risk and stock returns.

We obtain data on monthly stock returns based on general market price
indexes from Global Financial Data. Our sample ranges from 1900 to 2016,
although data availability varies by country, and the world stock price
index is available starting in 1919. We select 17 countries---all
countries that are currently classified as advanced economies, with the
exception of India, Peru, and South Africa---for which data before World
War II are available. The world stock price index is the Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) index from 1970. Prior to 1970, world
returns are calculated using the weighted average of country-specific
returns. Nine countries have data starting before World War I. Many
countries included in our regressions have gaps in the coverage that
range from one month to over a year. Since these gaps partly coincide
with World War II---as some stock markets did not operate in those
years---we follow Berkman, Jacobsen, and Lee (2011) and use all
available information.

We start by estimating the following regression:

rwtd,t --- fa + otwidQPRSHOCKt + PnijCRISESt + £wid,t\>

where rw\[jt is the world stock market return in month t, GPRSHOCKt is
the residual of an autoregressive process of order one estimated for the
GPR index, and CRISESt is the crisis index constructed by Berkman,
Jacobsen, and Lee (2011). In columns (1) and (3) of Table 2 we report
results for two samples, starting in 1919 and 1985, respectively. To
compare the impact on the GPR and on the crisis index, the coefficients
measure the impact on stock returns of a one standard deviation shock in
the GPR, and of having 2.41 active crises per month, the average number
of crises over our sample.

For the historical sample, we find that a 1 standard deviation increase
in the GPR induces a statistically significant decline in monthly stock
returns of 0.5 percent. The sensitivity of world stock returns to
geopolitical risk is larger after 1985, with an estimated drop of 0.75
percent. Interestingly, the coefficient on the crisis variable is
negative for the historical sample---albeit not statistically
significant---and becomes positive and not significant in the post-1985
sample. Thus, the GPR index correlates with negative stock returns
controlling for the realizations of international crises. Moreover, the
result over the post-1985 sample suggests that an advantage of the GPR
index over the crisis index is that, having substantially more time
variation, allows for the estimation of the impact of geopolitical
events on stock returns over relatively short samples.

World stock returns react more to threats about geopolitical events than
their realizations. This result is based on a modified version of
equation (1), where we replace GPRSHOCKt with the residuals of AR(1)
processes estimated for the GPR acts and threats indexes. As tabulated
in column (2) of Table 2, for the historical sample, world stock returns
decline in response to both GPA and GPT shocks, but the response to the
former is small and not statistically significant. By contrast, in the
post-1985 sample, stock returns rise in response to a positive GPA
shock, while they experience a large and statistically significant
decline in response to a GPT shock. Thus, as in the United States, world
stock returns respond asymmetrically to the threats and realizations of
geopolitical events.

We also estimate the following regression on country stock returns data:

rM = p, + aMGPRSHOCKt + eM,

where ri t is the stock market return in country i and month t. We
exclude the crisis index from the country regressions because for the 11
countries we have stock returns data starting prior to 1919, the first
year the crisis index is available. Table 3 tabulates the results for
the historical and the post-1985 samples.

Three results emerge from this exercise. First, both in the historical
and post-1985 sample, geopolitical risk depresses stock returns in all
but one of the countries included in our regressions--- the only
positive coefficient is estimated for Japan and is close to zero.
Second, on average, the sensitivity of stock returns to geopolitical
risk is larger in the post-1985 sample relative to the historical
sample, with countries like the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain having
a coefficient about 3 times larger in the short sample. Third, the
response of stock returns varies substantially across countries. For the
historical sample, the response ranges from about negative 0.9 for Italy
and South Africa, to 0 for countries like Japan and Germany. Similarly,
for the post-1985 sample, coefficients range from negative 1.50 for
Italy and Germany, to negative 0.3 for Australia and Japan. Furthermore,
while stock returns in some countries have remained particularly
responsive (such as Italy or South Africa) or unresponsive (such as
Japan) over time, stock returns have become more sensitive in others
most notably in Germany.

5.3 Geopolitical Risk and Capital Flows

Finally, we present additional evidence on the global economic
consequences of changes in geopolitical risk by showing how geopolitical
risk affects capital inflows in a sample of advanced and emerging
economies. The procyclical and volatile nature of capital flows makes
them a leading policy concern, especially in economies that rely heavily
on foreign sources of financing. We use country-level, quarterly data on
capital inflows from the IMF's Balance of Payments Statistics database.
Our sample consists of 22 advanced economies, 23 emerging economies, and
the United States, and covers the period from 1986:Q1 through 2015:Q4.36

Our baseline specification tests whether movements in geopolitical risk
have explanatory power for gross capital inflows. We choose gross
inflows---net purchases of domestic assets by foreign residents
excluding official reserves---in line with a large and growing body of
empirical evidence that shows that gross capital flows respond
systematically to changes in global conditions, and in line with the
notion that our measure of geopolitical risk is more likely to matter
for the economic-decisions of global investors on where to allocate
capital across countries. \*7

Our regression takes the form:

Vi,t --- ai + PDi.t-i + PGP Rt + rXt + Uit,

where yi t --- inflowsi t/GDP,t are gross capital inflows divided by
annualized GDP, a, are country fixed effects, GPRt is our geopolitical
risk index, and Xt is a vector of control variables. We estimate
equation (3) separately for emerging economies, for advanced economies
excluding the United States, and for the United States. Throughout, we
assume that the effect of the GPR index on capital inflows is equal
within each group of countries. Following the work of Ahmed and Zlate
(2014), our model specification includes the VIX to control for global
economic risk, lagged capital flows to control for persistence in
capital flows, as well as country-specific GDP growth to capture
demand-side factors that could drive capital flows towards one country.

Table 4 reports regressions coefficients scaled to denote the impact of
a 1 standard deviation increase in the GPR index and the VIX. Comparing
columns (1) and (2) of the table, an increase in GPR produces different
effects on capital inflows in emerging versus advanced economies. In
emerging economies, high GPR reduces capital inflows by 0.23 percentage
points, while an equally sized increase in the VIX reduces capital
inflows by more than one percentage point. By contrast, in advanced
economies, increases in GPR lead to a sizable increase in capital
inflows--- about one percentage point---whereas increases in the VIX
reduces capital inflows by 1.5 percentage points. GPR and VIX also have
opposite effects on inflows for the United States: as tabulated in
column (3), the effect of an increase in geopolitical risk is negative
(albeit the coefficient is not statistically different from zero) while
the effect of an increase in the VIX is positive and statistically
significant. In all specifications, the coefficient on lagged GDP growth
is positive, confirming the findings in Broner, Didier, Erce, and
Schmukler (2013) that a better investment climate (as proxied by GDP
growth) leads to larger inflows in both advanced and emerging economies.

In additional regressions results, we have verified that the asymmetric
effect of geopolitical risk on capital inflows for emerging and advanced
economies is present for all three subcomponents of capital inflows:
portfolio flows, foreign direct investment, and other investments.38
However, such effects are especially pronounced for portfolio flows and
other investments compared to foreign direct investment.

All told, the results suggest a marked difference between the effects on
capital flows of global economic risk (as measured by the VIX) and
geopolitical risk. While higher economic uncertainty leads to a
repatriation of foreign capital across the board, increases in
geopolitical risk appear to shift purchases of foreign capital away from
emerging and toward advanced economies, consistent with a
flight-to-safety hypothesis.311 However, the relatively small estimate
of the effect of GPR on emerging economies\' inflows suggests that
adverse geopolitical events fall short of causing full-blown sudden
stops in these economies. This finding mirrors our international VAR
evidence showing little effects of higher geopolitical risk on activity
in emerging economies.
