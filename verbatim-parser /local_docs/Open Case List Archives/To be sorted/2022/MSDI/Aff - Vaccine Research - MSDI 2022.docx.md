## What's all this?

<https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnImOvt9q0jkYfqiTYcRbb3P4IkLPQ_NC>

Much of the discussion about long term vaccine funding is focused on the
CEPI project, which includes a lot of private funding streams, but the
NFHS case list recommends it for the 2022-2023 case list. There are lots
of cards on NATO cooperation to retain and expand from lessons learned
via Covid, some of which at least mention a vaccine element.

As with many other cases, it is important to justify the plan in
relation to TWO topic anchors -- "Why use NATO?" and "Why biotech (or
other area)?" -- and this aff focused on each in ways that could work
with a variety of other cases.

This aff is also designed to show how a case can be written to defend
status quo mechanisms by saying additional action is needed to reach
their potential (instead of setting up something entirely new based on a
single proposal).

It is also designed to play "whack-a-mole" with the negative by having
several layers of solvency concepts such that the 2AR can emphasize
whatever concepts they did NOT attack. I recommend playing with
different extension cards in practice rounds to achieve this effect. The
current version of the plan text is word soup, and there are plenty of
other words that could be considered.

## Case

### Inherency

#### NATO lack vaccine stockpiles, although its Covid cooperation in other areas could thump DA's

Vaccines

[[Although NATO does not have a supply of vaccines, the Alliance avails
the clearing house mechanism to Allies and
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus far, four nations requested vaccines
: Montenegro, North Macedonia, Georgia and Tunisia.

Research and Innovation

[[NATO is supporting innovation through research and scientific
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} on COVID-19. For example, the NATO
Science & Technology Organization has tapped into its network of 6,000
defence scientists through the NATO Chief Scientist's Challenge.
Launched in April, the Challenge tasked Alliance researchers with
identifying solutions to some of the most pressing challenges posed by
COVID-19. [[More than 40 projects are now being taken
forward]{.underline}]{.mark}, addressing topics such as understanding
and [[countering pandemic disinformation, as well
as]{.underline}]{.mark} improving [[military training for pandemic
relief operations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Furthermore, the NATO Science & Technology Organization's Centre for
Maritime Research and Experimentation directly supported the US state of
Connecticut in developing a modelling capability to help forecast the
spread of COVID-19.

Through the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme, Italian and
Swiss scientists are collaborating on a NATO supported project to
develop rapid COVID-19 diagnostics.

### Plan

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in biotechnology through a vaccine research program emphasizing biosafety, resilience, foresight, and experimentalist governance. 

### Solvency

#### The plan builds NATO resilience to contain all global threats -- Article 3 and current agencies prove they say yes

\"The best defense: Why NATO should invest in resilience,\" Atlantic
Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified not only the successes and failures
of the world's health systems but also the importance of multilateral
partnerships in biosecurity. [[Preparing for the next pandemic will
require adaptation, interconnectivity, and
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}---the capacity to resist and recover
quickly from major infrastructure shocks. [[Intergovernmental alliances
like NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[play a **critical** role
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the relationship- and
[[capacity-building]{.underline}]{.mark} necessary for a healthy global
biosecurity sphere, [[which ensures a more secure
world]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There are many lessons from the last fifteen months, but among them is a
time-honored proverb: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Many public-health and security crises are a product of critical
infrastructure vulnerabilities, but an expanded focus on resilience in
developing a global security strategy can prevent the next crisis.
Responding to emergencies such as pandemics is far more expensive than
preventing them and creates additional costs such as strained political
cohesion and waning support for public institutions. Policies
emphasizing resilience should fundamentally aim to minimize damage,
restore stability quickly, and generate improved strategies for similar
issues. To this end, [[there are several steps NATO can
take]{.underline}]{.mark} to build a preventive, resilience-based
approach to emerging global challenges.

[[Article 3]{.underline}]{.mark} of the North Atlantic Treaty [[includes
**resilience** as a **critical** element of]{.underline}]{.mark} its
mission to achieve [[collective defense]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the
Alliance supports multiple programs to build resilience against
non-traditional threats. At its 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO committed to
"continue to enhance our resilience [[against the **full spectrum** of
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}, including hybrid threats, [[from **any**
direction]{.underline}]{.mark}," and added that "resilience is an
essential basis [[for credible deterrence and]{.underline}]{.mark}
defence and effective [[fulfilment of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Alliance's [[**core** tasks]{.underline}]{.mark}." In June, NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during an appearance at the
Atlantic Council that a critical part of the Alliance's agenda over the
coming decade is to support "resilience technologies."

The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear NATO's value in an unpredictable
world. [[In 2020, NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} troops [[supported civilian
efforts to combat]{.underline}]{.mark} the spread of
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 by airlifting patients and medical
equipment, building field hospitals, distributing supplies, repatriating
civilians, establishing quarantine facilities and triage centers,
assisting with decontamination, and sharing medical expertise. [[After
this pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark} recedes,
[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} proposals for [[responding to
biothreats]{.underline}]{.mark} and other novel challenges
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} include [[invest]{.underline}]{.mark}ments
[[in resilience to help combat "black swan" events]{.underline}]{.mark},
which may turn existing health or environmental emergencies into
security crises. "Resilient societies are our first line of defense,"
said NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană in December, adding
that "we have to put a much greater emphasis on resilience" across
government, the private sector, and civil society.

NATO should start advancing resilience by leveraging and strengthening
the following policies, programs, and partnerships:

Looking ahead, the [[NATO 2030]{.underline}]{.mark} initiative [[aims to
elevate democratic leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} around the world,
[[advance]{.underline}]{.mark} biomedical science and global
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, and position NATO and its partners
[[to tackle]{.underline}]{.mark} novel [[global security
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} through a lens of flexibility and
adaptation. [[Strategic investments]{.underline}]{.mark} in these
efforts [[**will establish resilient** frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark}
for addressing emerging threats, which is critical for successful
collective defense.

Realizing the full potential of these and other programs will require
additional support from NATO operations, planning, policy, and civilian
divisions. [[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and international organizations
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[continue working with
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} on the ground to support equipment procurement
and regional needs. In today's unpredictable security environment,
successfully responding to threats requires resilience---and NATO is
well-positioned to make resilience a reality.

#### NATO vaccine cooperation is vital to resilience -- this approach avoids trade offs with other parts of the core mission

Giovanna **De Maio** 20**20** visiting fellow at **GWU** George
Washington University, former visiting fellow Center for the United
States and Europe (CUSE) at Brookings,

\",\" Brookings Institution (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

So far, NATO has set up a [[Lessons Learned]{.underline}]{.mark}
Steering Group (LLSG)66 on COVID-19, which collects inputs by agencies,
divisions, and delegations to help the alliance design a strategy for
both future waves of this coronavirus and for future pandemics. Stemming
from the inputs of the LLSG and from the reflections of officials
interviewed for this paper, the following [[recommendations to the
alliance focus on resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} and readiness in
crisis management.

● Resilience: [[NATO must remain vigilant against malign exploitation of
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under whatever circumstances may arise,
[[the Atlantic alliance should not shift its focus away from its main
objectives of pushing back against adversaries through deterrence and
response-readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}.67

○ NATO should have a protocol to follow in case of crises like pandemics
to ensure continuity of operations. So far, the alliance has shown
impressive adaptability and was able to keep its missions running and
continue with training and exercises, even if at a reduced level.
However, military activities have been reduced by 33% with 80% fewer
personnel participating,68 and the climate of uncertainty surrounding
the impact of COVID-19 on NATO missions, training, and exercises could
have left gaps for malign actors to exploit, especially in more fragile
settings like in Iraq. [[To prevent future
pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} or similar events [[from eroding NATO's
readiness]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities, it is paramount to develop
structured plans and protocols that would allow timely adaptation,
personnel protection, and resilience against external threats. To
further protect core combat capabilities, [[it would be **necessary**
for NATO personnel]{.underline}]{.mark} employed in quick-response units
[[to receive early access to **vaccines**]{.underline}]{.mark}; the
alliance should also be prepared with contact-tracing capabilities to
identify outbreaks quickly.69

○ [[NATO should increase its counterdisinformation
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} and protect its member states against
malign actors exploiting crises to promote their geopolitical and
economic interests. Although disinformation has been included among the
list of threats to NATO since the 2014 summit in Wales, the alliance has
not established a special agency or team to focus on countering
disinformation. During COVID-19, when NATO member states were targeted
by Chinese "mask diplomacy" and Russia's claims about the inability of
Western countries to deal with COVID-19, the organization resorted to
its Public Diplomacy Division --- in cooperation with the European
Union's East Stratcom Task Force70 --- to increase its public profile
and debunk Chinese and Russian fake news. However, this is not yet
enough to counter the volume and reach of such propaganda, which
requires real-time investigation and fact-checking and outreach to the
audience that has been targeted by disinformation, with the possibility
of providing training for soldiers and commanders to react to
information warfare.71 For this reason, the alliance should consider
setting up a dedicated team and establish a framework of coordination
with the East Stratcom Task Force to broaden the scope of
counterdisinformation efforts and take more targeted actions to
strengthen societal resilience across member states.

Readiness: NATO must further enhance its crisis management toolkit. The
core lesson COVID-19 taught NATO concerned crisis management
capabilities and culture. The alliance adjusted fairly quickly and made
an incredibly efficient use of its logistical apparatus; yet, more can
be done to enhance NATO readiness to face challenges of this nature.

○ Strengthen [the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Relief Coordination
Center]{.underline}. As mentioned, over the past few years, the EADRCC
staff had been reduced to three people; as COVID-19 hit Europe, NATO was
forced to rapidly reallocate military personnel from other departments
to support the work of NATO's clearinghouse for aid requests and
delivery. At a time when the impact of global challenges can no longer
be ignored, [[NATO should invest in and expand the EADRCC's capacity and
scope to increase preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark} in preparation for
subsequent COVID-19 waves [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} other future
catastrophic events. Along with the EADRCC, the alliance should
[[enhance]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[flexibility in]{.underline}]{.mark}
the NSPA [[procurement]{.underline}]{.mark} process in order to speed up
access to cost-effective airlifting as well as to the procurement of
medical equipment. Beyond overseeing the transportation supplies and
medical assistance, the EADRCC could also play a role in coordinating
NATO's support to national armed forces in member states, in the event
that such forces experience significant losses.

○ Increase knowledge, prediction capabilities, and awareness. Building
on existing analytical platforms and programs72 and intelligence sharing
between allied nations, [[NATO should increase its understanding and
awareness of how global]{.underline}]{.mark} challenges and threats such
as [[pandemics can affect NATO operations]{.underline}]{.mark} and
personnel [[and increase preparation of tailored contingency
plans]{.underline}]{.mark} for suitable responses. Some of these actions
may include several aspects of the alliance's activities, from
decisionmaking to technological potential and research through its own
laboratory (the Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation located
in La Spezia, Italy) and its Science for Peace and Security (SPS)
Program.73 Given NATO's renewed sensitivity to biological risks,
intelligence sharing could be crucial to elaborate plans for
[[countering new threats such as bioterrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}.74

○ Coordination with the European Union. NATO's logistical apparatus was
crucial in delivering aid when the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism was
under stress, and after initial hesitation, in coordination with the EU
mechanism. Moving forward, in the words of Malcom Chalmers, deputy
director-general of Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI),
the EU-NATO relationship will be crucial "if the West is to survive as a
coherent entity."75 Given that many NATO countries are also EU member
states, all that applies to logistics, transportations, and purchases
falls under the regulatory umbrella of the European Union. For this
reason, a more established framework of cooperation between NATO and the
EU will be crucial to ensure a smoother application of crisis protocols
and ease the transportation of essential items within alliance
territory, similarly to what was envisaged to ensure military mobility
for the DEFENDER-Europe 20 drilling. [[In particular, the EU and NATO
should also **collaborate** to establish permanent stockpiles76 and
reduce the alliance's dependence from global supply chain for crucial
medical material]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also to develop
cost-effective strategies [[for the production and distribution of a
COVID-19 vaccine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such coordination should also
remain wary of duplicating efforts --- as in the case of the NATO
pandemic relief trust fund,77 which risks creating overlapping with the
Civil Protection Mechanism for the accumulation of medical supplies.

### Advantage 1 NATO resilience

#### Multinational Medical Coordination Centre / European Medical Command (MMCC/EMC ) capacity is key to surge against future pandemics, but vaccine response needs to move from just-in-time focus to long term planning

\"M3-EPS: A Surge Capacity Concept for Pandemics and Crises,\" No
Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first
identified and has since led to the ongoing global
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 pandemic. This pandemic has
[[highlighted the **lack** of rapidly deployable]{.underline}]{.mark}
reinforcement elements and systems as well as the benefits of
[[stockpiles]{.underline}]{.mark} of medical equipment. A
differentiation must be made between non-expendable medical supplies
(i.e. medical devices1) and individually issued expendable medical
supplies. The need for both expendable and non-expendable [[medical
supplies could **not** be sufficiently satisfied]{.underline}]{.mark} in
all areas as manufacturing nowadays is [[based on just-in-time
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} without contingency stockpiling.

Production losses and market contractions as well as the concentration
of production facilities in countries outside of Europe have in recent
years frequently led to supply shortages across Europe for various drugs
([[**including** antibiotics, cytostatic agents, and
**vaccines**]{.underline}]{.mark}). What is more, the [[pressure to
reduce costs]{.underline}]{.mark} has in recent years [[led to a
considerable reduction in civilian and military stockpiles of medical
materials]{.underline}]{.mark}, including non-expendable medical
supplies, in favour of just-in-time production.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased awareness among
policymakers and the general public of pandemic and epidemic threat
scenarios and their consequences.

In response to the rapid spread of COVID-19, the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) made
recommendations for improving preparations for further possible waves of
COVID-19. In addition, the European Commission announced the creation of
the rescEU strategic stockpile of medical equipment. (2)

[[The mission]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Multinational Medical
Coordination Centre / European Medical Command [[is to
support]{.underline}]{.mark} the medical services of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the EU [[by coordinating medical
capability development]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of the lessons learned
in the management of major incidents, the Ebola crisis, and the current
pandemic is that public health is becoming increasingly important for
external and internal security.

As part of its programme of work, the MMCC/EMC was tasked in the spring
of 2020 with improving cooperation between medical services and with
enhancing their responsiveness so that they are better prepared for
possible further COVID-19 waves, which may occur in combination with a
seasonal flu epidemic.

In April 2020, the MMCC/EMC was asked by the Euro-Atlantic Disaster
Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) of NATO Headquarters in Brussels
to quickly develop a concept for military medical stockpiling. This is
the basis for the NATO Pandemic Response Trust Fund. Many nations have
contributed financial resources and material to the trust fund on the
basis of this concept. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) is
responsible for managing the purchase and storage of trust fund items.
The NATO Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre helps
coordinate requests for assistance from countries. In October and
November 2020, the NATO member states Albania, Montenegro and North
Macedonia received ventilators and medical supplies with a total value
of €1.5 million.

The purpose of the M3-EPS concept developed by the MMCC/EMC is to
maintain limited stockpiles to ensure surge capacity in the event of a
critical development such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective is to learn from the current COVID-19 pandemic
[[so]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[medical services are more effectively
and efficiently prepared for future epidemics]{.underline}]{.mark} and
pandemics and are able to respond quickly. Rapidly deployable and
modular standard packages with expendable and non-expendable medical
materials are to be identified and defined for stockpiling. At the same
time, the stockpiling efforts of the medical services must be supported.

Three Phases of Development

The concept was developed in three phases:

• Phase 1: The response capability of medical forces of the
multinational EU Battlegroup 2020-2 (EU-BG-2020-2) will be improved for
deployment with a modular initial COVID-19 capability (focusing on
self-protection) to manage the COVID-19 pandemic or a local COVID-19
outbreak.

• Phase 2: The various modular, rapidly deployable standard packages
will be harmonised with the nations participating in the MMCC/EMC and --
wherever possible -- will be aligned with comparable stockpiling
preparations of the military and civilian bodies of NATO and the EU.

• Phase 3: A multinational concept will be developed which can be used
not only for deployments to manage COVID-19 but also for other
infectious diseases (those caused by other pathogens).

The modular standard packages can be used to support military medical
facilities in international missions, to help hospitals in Germany and
the EU, and to provide assistance, including administrative support, in
theatres of operation. The concept includes a calculator that is used to
compute costs, storage space, and personnel requirements for each
module. The calculator uses defined parameters to generate a list of
generic names for essential expendable and non-expendable medical
material. This list helps users determine and procure what is actually
needed.

#### Plan enables effective NATO resilience via publicity and battlefield readiness

Jamie **Shea**, 4-1-20**20**, Senior Fellow for Peace, Security and
Defence at Friends of Europe and **former** **DASG-ESC** Deputy
Assistant Secretary General for emerging security challenges at NATO,
https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/never-waste-a-good-crisis-are-pandemics-natos-new-security-challenge/,
\"Never waste a good crisis: are pandemics NATO's new security
challenge?,\" Friends of Europe (ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

Rahm Emmanuel, the former chief of staff to President Obama and mayor of
Chicago, was fond of telling his boss that he should "never let a good
crisis go to waste". The word "crisis" in Chinese also translates as
opportunity. T[[he international institutions that will emerge
successfully from]{.underline}]{.mark} the current
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 crisis [[will not only be those that act
swiftly and usefully, but also]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[use the
crisis to adapt]{.underline}]{.mark} [[their]{.underline}]{.mark}
missions and their business [[models]{.underline}]{.mark}.

So far NATO is indeed having a good crisis, which may seem surprising as
the alliance has never referred to pandemics in its list of emerging
security challenges nor the various strategic concepts that it has
developed since the end of the Cold War. New threats for NATO have been
more in the realms of cyber-attacks, energy cut-offs, terrorism and
state-driven hybrid campaigns. NATO's forte has always been to focus on
the man-made, human-driven threats to the future of humanity rather than
those originating from natural causes.

Yet already in recent times the security implications of climate change
were beginning to change this calculus, as evidenced by a spate of
extreme weather events calling out the armed forces to fight floods and
forest fires rather than Russians or jihadists. Indeed, on the eve of
the outbreak of the [[COVID-19]{.underline}]{.mark} pandemic, NATO
ambassadors were planning their first away-day to brainstorm on climate
change as a driver of security threats. Now coronavirus [[will force
NATO's leadership to review how the disruptive
impact]{.underline}]{.mark} of natural disasters
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} [[complicate]{.underline}]{.mark} the
alliance's [[traditional missions as well as compel]{.underline}]{.mark}
it to take on [[new ones]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In the first place, [[collective defence is being re-interpreted to
mean]{.underline}]{.mark} solidarity in upholding domestic order and
[[resilience rather than]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly protecting
[[external borders]{.underline}]{.mark}. This change was already
foreshadowed back in 2014 when NATO's leaders proclaimed that a
cyber-attack against an ally could be considered as an armed attack and
trigger a collective response under Article 5 of the NATO treaty. In
doing so, the alliance raised to the level of a treaty commitment for
the first time a threat that was societal rather than military, which
could impact the private sector as much as the state, and which was not
based on physical violence or a kinetic effect.

Yet in taking this decision six years ago, NATO leaders were still
thinking of potential retaliation against a state aggressor once its
actions could be reliably identified. [[Coronavirus]{.underline}]{.mark}
on the other hand [[is largely an invisible threat]{.underline}]{.mark}
than can come from anywhere and which can be just as destructive as of a
deliberate act of aggression, only without anyone being criminally or
legally responsible. [[So, NATO's defence
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} in this new area
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[founded on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
promise of retaliation but on the promise of [[assistance and
recovery]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is keeping its member states safe from
within rather than without.

Moreover, any previous act of aggression was based on the notion that
only a few NATO allies would be stricken by an attack and the other
allies, less afflicted, would come to their help. Estonia, for instance,
was the only ally to be crippled by a cyber-attack in 2007 and the
United States the only ally to be targeted by Al Qaeda on 9/11 (when the
alliance invoked its Article 5 defence clause for the first time in its
70 year history). Yet now, given the universality of the coronavirus,
NATO has to defend all 30 of its equally-stricken member states all at
once. This is totally new.

NATO's foreign ministers -- who met last week for the first time by
video conference -- can be satisfied with the organisation's initial
response. The [[Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre has
served as a clearinghouse to transport vital medical
supplies]{.underline}]{.mark} from one ally to another. Turkey and the
Czech Republic have flown equipment to Italy and Spain. NATO's C17
heavy-lift aircraft based in Hungary have transported supplies to
Romania. NATO civil response experts have coordinated logistics and
communications. Yet rather than simply repeat these positive news
stories, the foreign ministers should use this opportunity to see what
more NATO can contribute.

For instance, the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe
([[SACEUR]{.underline}]{.mark}) could be tasked to establish an
[[airlift]{.underline}]{.mark} capability to transport troops from one
ally to another quickly if they are needed to help national armed forces
to deal with the crisis, such as establishing field hospitals or
transferring patients or transporting the dead for burial. The UK
military has built the Nightingale hospital in an exhibition centre in
East London with a capacity of up to 4,000 beds and is now building
similar facilities in other UK cities.

This type of expertise [[could be useful in]{.underline}]{.mark} other
allied countries, for instance in [[Eastern Europe and the Balkans
where]{.underline}]{.mark} the national [[health and disaster
response]{.underline}]{.mark} services [[are less
developed]{.underline}]{.mark}. SACEUR could be tasked with drawing up
an alliance-wide contingency and resilience plan to track the likely
evolution of COVID-19 to the end of the year and identify the vulnerable
points, and likely needs for assistance. On this basis, SACEUR can plan
with the allies to generate the required force packages and ensure that
they are trained, equipped and certified for disease control
deployments.

NATO has highly professional military forces to buttress national
resilience but they are useless if they cannot be used, and so [[another
urgent task is to better protect NATO's forces against disease and
biological agents]{.underline}]{.mark}. The military have proven no more
resilient to coronavirus than the civilian population. A US
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is out of action in Guam with a crew of
4,000 stricken with the virus. A Dutch submarine has had to return home
and two German corvettes have stopped operation. Navies with their
personnel working at close quarters seem to be particularly vulnerable
to diseases. Meanwhile, allies have been withdrawing their contingents
home early from important overseas missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. So,
for the first time, allies have to choose between deploying their troops
at home or abroad.

[[The future operating environment will]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
probably [[see armed forces]{.underline}]{.mark} being [[more evenly
distributed between home and overseas]{.underline}]{.mark} duties. This
implies more stress, a higher operational tempo and less training and
recovery time. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} consequently [[will need to
overhaul its operational planning to be much more
responsive]{.underline}]{.mark} to sudden crises and rapid force
redeployments.

For instance, if a Dutch submarine has to suddenly go into quarantine,
who will replace it, and how quickly? If a French training company is
pulled out of Iraq, how can the gap be filled before the training
activity suffers? If military medics or chemical, biological,
radiological and nuclear ([[CBRN]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[decontamination
units]{.underline}]{.mark} are sent home from the Baltic states without
warning, how much reserve and deployable
[[capability]{.underline}]{.mark} does NATO have [[in its
inventory]{.underline}]{.mark}? Can all alliance deployed forces have a
backup, rather like the understudy soprano in an opera, to fill the
space if they become ill or are re-assigned?

Looking to the future, NATO will also need to re-think the concept of
force protection. Up to now it has largely meant the protection of
soldiers against improvised explosive devices or of bases against rocket
attack. In the future, [[military planners will need
t]{.underline}]{.mark}o think of ways to [[improve
soldiers']{.underline}]{.mark} hygiene, rapid access to protective
clothing, separation techniques, [[vaccination]{.underline}]{.mark} and
training and exercise schedules to learn [[to operate in
disease-infested environments without rapid loss of operational
effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Finally, [[a challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} for the alliance [[will be
to prevent adversaries from exploiting]{.underline}]{.mark} this
newfound [[preoccupation with domestic resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In the age of hybrid warfare, adversaries do not need to carry out
attacks to inflict damage. It is enough to exploit opportunities to
increase their influence and undermine public trust in NATO solidarity.
Russia has sent medical supplies to Northern Italy using military
aircraft. These may not be especially useful but the gesture has given
Russia the opportunity to set up a military cell in Bergamo, close to
the NATO airbase in Vincenza. It could be used for intelligence
gathering or to observe NATO operations at close quarters. China has
also been opportunistically sending medical supplies to Italy and Spain
to rebrand its image at a time when its own transparency in handling the
coronavirus outbreak is open to scrutiny.

Cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns are on the increase, while
this battle of the PR narrative goes on in official government
pronouncements. Consequently, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}'s developing
role in societal resilience also has to involve the virtual and societal
domains as much as the physical domain of transport flights and field
hospitals. Solidarity also means helping allies to counter false claims
and unwelcome foreign influence. It [[needs to work closely with the
European Union]{.underline}]{.mark} and national intelligence agencies
to spot deliberate influence campaigns.

A line must also be drawn between genuine humanitarian gestures and
outright attempts at political manipulation. [[If NATO does a lot but
receives little visibility]{.underline}]{.mark} and recognition while
Russia and China hype a few aid flights and donations to portray
themselves as the saviours in our hour of need, then clearly [[this
lesson will not have been learned]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign ministers [[can
ask]{.underline}]{.mark} the NATO Secretary-General and the EU High
Representative [[to produce a monthly report on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
political exploitation of [[the health crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} with
geopolitical implications for the EU and NATO, [[and
recommendations]{.underline}]{.mark} for joint or at least coordinated
responses

The NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, is fond of saying that "we
must not allow the health crisis to become a security crisis". Yet it is
already a security crisis as governments will be over-burdened for
months managing the fallout from the virus. Defence budgets will be
compressed and responses to foreign crises will be constrained. It will
be an uphill struggle to resource existing missions and to keep the
front-line forces fighting-fit.

The NATO of the future will have to find a new balance between defending
a few of its member states at any one time against man-made threats,
versus scenarios where potentially all member states are at risk from
natural disasters. This is a heavy agenda, but the prospect of future
pandemics as well as extreme weather events driven by global warming
means it is one that cannot be avoided.

Last week, Jens Stoltenberg announced the names of his group of experts
who will come up with ideas to improve NATO's political consultations
and machinery at the request of France and Germany. But the [[valuable
time]{.underline}]{.mark} of these distinguished individuals and the
money devoted to their review [[might be much more usefully spent in
analysing the strategic implications of COVID-19 for the future of the
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} instead.

#### Resilience solves all impacts

This shift in the Alliance's culture and architecture would yield
several benefits. First, [[by adding an adequately
resourced]{.underline}]{.mark} fourth [[core task focused on resilience,
NATO could effectively]{.underline}]{.mark} conceptualize how to
[[address]{.underline}]{.mark} [[non-traditional security
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}, and do so [[in time to prevent and
mitigate future COVID-like scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}. Threats like
climate change are a certainty; the only unknown is the level of damage
they will cause. This variable depends on current efforts to adapt and
bolster allies' resilience, a capacity thus far underutilized at NATO
headquarters.12 By starting now and using an improved and expanded
resilience framework, NATO will be better prepared for and better able
to bounce "forward" from future non-traditional threats.

[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, improving [[resilience is
essential]{.underline}]{.mark} across the entire threat spectrum [[and
reinforces traditional defense and deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}.13
Proactive investments in community resilience are helpful not only in
preventing non-traditional threats, but also in ensuring societal and
state continuity and resistance in the case of an armed attack. Such
measures can also serve to deter aggression by convincing adversaries
their plans will not have the desired impact. In this new security
environment, civilian and military components are intrinsically
connected. As an ETH Zurich report notes, "[[solutions that mix military
and non-military elements]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[and cooperation
across silos]{.underline}]{.mark} [[are necessary to
achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} a "whole-of-society approach to
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}."14

Finally, [[investing in resilience saves]{.underline}]{.mark}
significant taxpayer [[money]{.underline}]{.mark}. Estimated savings
resulting from the implementation of resilience frameworks vary between
\$4 to \$6 in return for every \$1 invested.15 The alternative, as
COVID-19 has shown, is untenable. According to estimates, [[the pandemic
will]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[end up costing]{.underline}]{.mark} between
\$8.1 and \$15.8 trillion globally---roughly **[[500
times]{.underline}]{.mark}** as costly as [[what it would take to invest
in]{.underline}]{.mark} proposed [[preventive
measures]{.underline}]{.mark}."16 The conclusion is clear: responding to
crises instead of preventing them is exceptionally more expensive. While
this holds true in any economic environment, it is particularly relevant
in [[the post-COVID-19 world defined by slumping economic growth,
ballooning debt, and decreasing defense budgets]{.underline}]{.mark}.17
While nearly incalculable, these numbers do not consider intangible
losses, such as strained NATO political cohesion or waning public
support for the Alliance when it cannot adequately handle a crisis.
[[When every dollar counts, the smart investment is
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In a complex environment where it must grapple with multiple,
interrelated strategic shocks and a combination of traditional and
non-traditional threats, [[NATO has only one option: transform to meet
the moment]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the Alliance considers how to adapt
today for tomorrow's challenges as part of the NATO 2030 process,18 one
solution can help it "stay strong militarily, be more united
politically, and take a broader approach globally"19: [[including
resilience as a fourth core task]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### NTT's increase security dangers from Russia & China -- will control all future wars -- NATO key

Acc:6-17-2022)

The novel coronavirus is one of the most formative events of the
twenty-first century. [[Despite warnings about
pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} from public health and intelligence
officials, [[the world was caught off guard by
COVID19]{.underline}]{.mark}. Though they had experience containing MERS
and SARS, scientists and doctors had to learn about COVID-19 while
trying to control it. Further, governments across the globe were forced
to make impossible decisions between saving lives and saving economies.

Unfortunately, [[threats like COVID-19 might be a **blueprint of the
future**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A rise in environmentally destabilizing
human activity and extreme economic inequality]{.underline}]{.mark},
coupled with patchy investments in social safety nets and frail
governance, [[have degraded human security]{.underline}]{.mark}
conditions around the world. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} combustible
combination [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
[[result]{.underline}]{.mark} in a rise [[in non-traditional security
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. By definition, these threats are
transnational, impacting entire regions or continents; systemic,
resulting from an accumulation of widespread permissive and causal
factors; and outside the realm of traditional military concepts and
operations, in that they are normally associated with development
issues. [[Non-traditional security threats include climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, irregular [[migration]{.underline}]{.mark},
resource [[scarcity]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[criminality]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of course
[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Their pattern is
similar]{.underline}]{.mark}: in the shortterm, they lead to loss of
life in catastrophic events; however, more perniciously, [[they
undermine societal functioning and therefore weaken
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities in the long-term. In light
of this trend, COVID-19 might be just the canary in the coal mine.

[[Non-traditional threats]{.underline}]{.mark} are particularly complex
because they [[can have a threat-multiplying effect, leading to
cascading economic, political, and security shocks]{.underline}]{.mark},
as COVID-19 has shown. [[They can]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[decrease]{.underline}]{.mark} the efficacy of [[conventional
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} measures by showing potential
adversaries that an attack in the midst of such destabilizing
circumstances would achieve more significant destruction. The rise of
non-traditional security threats therefore can [[exacerbate existing
conventional challenges, such as]{.underline}]{.mark} those posed by
[[Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this world, disruption will
become the norm, not the exception.

The scope, scale, and impact of [[future non-traditional threats require
NATO allies to think outside]{.underline}]{.mark} the framework of
[[traditional security concepts and]{.underline}]{.mark} prepare the
Alliance for missions that do not neatly fit an Article 5 scenario. To
this end, the Alliance should approve a fourth core task
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[on **resilience**]{.underline}]{.mark},
preparing the Alliance to protect the populations of member states
against novel threats while reinforcing collective defense.

#### MMCC coop checks CBRN impacts

Stefan Kowitz,\" No Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

During the COVID pandemic, the current role of MMCC/EMC has been to use
lessons identified for its future work to support military medical
collaboration and coordination across our participating nations, NATO
and the EU.

Our Telehealth Workshop in May 2021 is an excellent example.
[[Telehealth has been a game-changer during the]{.underline}]{.mark}
COVID [[pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the use of telehealth has
increased in different areas of medical support. Telehealth provides
significant means to measure the health of our soldiers and to improve
the outcome of their medical treatment. COVID has been a trigger for
transformation in telemedicine and telehealth. A follow-on Biosensor and
Telehealth Workshop is planned in June 2022

We have just finalised an overview of COVID vaccination policies. The
most notable finding is that [[most nations have not made COVID
vaccination compulsory for]{.underline}]{.mark} members of the [[armed
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} (as of Sep 2021). [[This may be
hampering]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[success]{.underline}]{.mark} of
vaccination programmes and reducing benefits for this population of
risk. However, the [[vaccines' success]{.underline}]{.mark} in
preventing COVID infection and their limited side effects [[may change
the situation, until a new variant]{.underline}]{.mark} of the virus
[[appears]{.underline}]{.mark}.

MMCC/EMC is increasing its work in civil-military cooperation for the
evacuation of patients in large-scale emergencies and in crises,
including a higher number of infectious patients. We are working in
close cooperation with the NATO Joint Healthcare Working Group and other
participating nations on this issue. A workshop on this topic with
participants of the responsible civilian and military stakeholders is
planned in June 2022.

The MMCC/EMC was able to gain initial experience in stockpiling concepts
in April 2020, when it was asked by the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response
Coordination Centre (EADRCC) of NATO to develop a medical stockpiling
concept for the NATO COVID Trust Fund. An important part of the concept
is a calculator that can be used to compute costs, storage space, and
required personnel for each module. The NATO COVID Trust Fund has
provided many donations based on this concept.

Based on these experiences, the [[MMCC/EMC has extended this medical
stockpiling concept]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Military Modular
Multipurpose Epidemic/Pandemic Stockpiling
([[M3-EPS]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[Concept]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
can be used by EU and NATO nations and medical stakeholders. [[As a
surge capacity, rapidly deployable]{.underline}]{.mark} and modular
standard [[packages]{.underline}]{.mark} of medical materiel [[have been
identified]{.underline}]{.mark} and defined [[for
stockpiling]{.underline}]{.mark}. The seven modular standard packages,
such as support for intensive care units, can be used to support both
military and civilian medical facilities. For example, the bilateral
support that the Bundeswehr Medical Service provided to Portugal was
based on the principles of M3-EPS and included an ICU capability to
enhance a civilian hospital. The French medical services use a similar
approach. We hope to bring these results into NATO standardisation work
and into national developments. [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[aim to
increase]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}
with regard [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[stockpiling of CBRN chemical
and radiation antidotes.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[If]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[MMCC/EMC has the **time and
resources**, it will develop technical guidelines]{.underline}]{.mark} -
based on existing NATO STANAGS - for deployed outbreak investigation
team, [[which can be used for **both** infectious diseases **and** CBRN
agents]{.underline}]{.mark}. We would like to combine deployable medical
CBRN capabilities and public health capabilities. Civil-military
collaboration regarding reachback laboratories with their sophisticated
diagnostic capabilities has to be included in this concept.

#### NATO weakness fuels Russian influence in the region causing a dynamic shift in power balance---that goes nuclear

Hans **Binnendijk**, 06-09-**2020**, (Hans Binnendijk is a distinguished
fellow at the Atlantic Council. He has served two tours on the National
Security Council and as director of the Institute for National Strategic
Studies. He has worked on NATO issues for four decades.), "The folly of
a NATO troop withdrawal decision", Defense News,
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/09/the-folly-of-a-nato-troop-withdrawal-decision/ceng

[[A]{.mark} reported [decision]{.mark} by President Trump [to remove
some]{.mark} 9,500 American [troops]{.mark} from Germany [could
undercut]{.mark} a half decade long [effort to prevent war by enhancing
NATO's deterrent posture in the **Baltic area**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The prospect of a withdrawal came without warning to American commanders
in Europe and has no known strategic underpinning. **[[NATO has been
clear about the Russian threat]{.mark} and how to counter
it.]{.underline}** During the 2018 Brussels summit, [**[NATO leaders
concluded that "Russia's aggressive actions,]{.mark} including the
threat and use of force to attain political goals, [challenge the
Alliance and are undermining Euro-Atlantic security and the rules-based
international order]{.mark}**." NATO's response has been to construct a
deterrent posture with several thousand NATO troops forward deployed in
the Baltic states and Poland as a solid trip wire and with ready
reserves further back poised for quick reinforcement should the trip
wire fail. **[This deterrent posture is already
fragile]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are doubts that the NATO Response
Force and other national forces are adequately ready and that the
logistics infrastructure is capable of enabling the rapid forward
movement of troops. To deal with this fragility, NATO adopted two
initiatives on readiness and mobility to assure that reserve forces
would arrive in time. [[All of this has been constructed to deal
with]{.mark} what U.S. commanders in Europe have called [their nightmare
scenario. They fear a quick Russian land grab in the Baltic
states]{.mark} followed by Russian propaganda, a Russian call for a
cease fire, [and a nuclear threat]{.mark} are all designed to divide
NATO in time of crisis and make it impotent. If this scenario is not
adequately countered, [NATO leaders fear Russia might take the gamble as
they have gambled in Ukraine]{.mark}, Georgia, Syria, and now
Libya.]{.underline} U.S. Russian experts note [that President Vladimir
[Putin may take risky foreign policy steps to counter the growing
COVID-19 crisis]{.mark} in Russia]{.underline}. Russia just announced
the forward deployment of a motorized brigade to the Western Military
District bordering the Baltic States. This is not the time to remove
American troops. So how would a withdrawal decision undercut NATO's
strategy to deter the nightmare scenario? The U.S. forces most likely to
be cut are F-16s and support troops in Germany. They are both crucial to
NATO's reinforcement strategy. Support forces are needed for training
and as part of the mobility effort to move NATO troops forward in time
of crisis. American air power is needed since it is able to launch
strikes quickly in support of forward forces while other ground forces,
both American and European, mobilize and move forward. Without these
9,500 troops, Poland and the Baltic states will be more vulnerable,
along with the American personnel that remain. But the problem goes
deeper. A withdrawal would be a clear signal that Trump is not serious
about defending Europe. It would undercut the very deterrent strategy
that both the Obama and Trump administrations have put in place to
contain an aggressive Russia. It further undermines European confidence
that America has Europe's back. European powers may think twice before
extending the deployment of their now more vulnerable forward deployed
troops, further reducing deterrence. Plus the flawed decision could lead
to the demise of the NATO Readiness Initiative and the Mobility
Initiative, both of which the United States pressed hard for and Europe
has supported. If the United States undercuts the reinforcement strategy
that underpins these two initiatives, why would Europe have faith in
them? This decision would compound the damage done to transatlantic
security by earlier Trump decisions. For example, Trump's withdrawal
from the INF mid-range nuclear agreement --- rather than fixing it ---
now gives Russia a significant and legal nuclear advantage over NATO's
nuclear deterrent on the continent. [**[So if that nightmare scenario
takes place, NATO will be less well prepared to deal with a nuclear
threat]{.mark}**, again tempting the Kremlin to take the risk. All is
not lost. Both houses of Congress have shown strong support for the NATO
alliance in face of continuous Trump assaults and should pass
legislation aimed at overturning such an unwise decision.]{.underline}

The studies of a few cases of earlier CBRN actions have led experts to
identify the key characteristics of terrorist groups that could
potentially have an interest to use these weapons. It is thought that
conservatism is inherent in terrorist organizations, but it must not be
forgotten that [some terrorists are inclined to innovations in weapons
and tactics, as well as to taking risks in actions or in the choice of
weapons]{.underline}. Many experts agree that most terrorist
organizations want to use proven methods to achieve desired effects.
Innovations, especially in the field of CBRN weapons, often indicate
terrorists are likely to be led by other factors rather than by pure
curiosity and desire to experiment. For some individuals, repression and
democratic and strong rule of law are positive determinants of the
emergence of CBRN actions which points to a new and more complex global
security environment with an increasing risk of terrorists trying to
perform a CBRN attack. It is a frightening fact that [[a **single
terrorist**]{.mark} or isolated terrorist group [could improvise a
**biological weapon**]{.mark} or use other ways to spread anthrax,
smallpox or other biological agents and thereby cause mass casualties
and destroy the health care system of a state.]{.underline} CBRN weapons
are secretly shipped to terrorists or hostile governments and represent
a significant and growing threat to many countries. Although the threat
of CBRN attacks is widely recognized as the central issue of national
security, most analysts assume that the primary danger is a threat of
the military use of these weapons in conventional wars with tra-ditional
military means while [the **threat** of covert attacks, which include
terrorism, is rashly and **unfairly neglected.**]{.underline} [Covert
attacks are difficult to deter or prevent and **[CBRN weapons]{.mark}
suitable for this type of attack [are available to a growing number of
enemy]{.mark} states and [groups]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same
time, restrictions on their use appear to be diminishing, and so-called
new terrorists do not always escalate and become apparent only by using
unconventional weapons. These weapons are easily spread or transmitted
from person to person, have a high mortality rate and a potential impact
on public health, causing mass casualties that can crush health systems
and cause public panic and social disruption, thus requiring special
efforts to suppress them. When assessing the threat of CBRN weapons, we
should take into account the change in capacity to carry out terrorist
attacks that are on the rise among countries and non-government
elements. Analysts believe that the fear of chemical and biological
terrorist attacks is excessive, they point out that, in the past, very
few attacks involved these weapons, and even those few attempts that
have occurred were mostly thwarted by the authorities. A relative ease
with which biological weapons can be obtained, along with other current
changes and turbulences in the world, sets the stage for another type of
warfare in the 21st century. The potential for CBRN terrorism has widely
grown since 11 September, when some of these materials were used. The
danger of terrorist use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction represents a very serious threat for many countries; if a
terrorist group could gain access to this weapon, it is highly likely it
would use it, or threaten to use it. Although there is very little
information on terrorists and their ability to come into possession of
nuclear weapons or on their intentions to get them, the risk of CBRN
weapons has certainly increased since the terrorists started to become
more familiar with these agents and their harmful consequences.
Discovering the nature of the threat of biological weapons, as well as
the appropriate response to them requires an emphasis on the biological
characteristics of these instruments of war and terror. Preparing for a
terrorist attack may seem daunting and there are a small number of
people with practical experience and a good knowledge of CBRN weapons,
because until recently there was no need to own them. In the past, most
of the planning regarding emergency response to terrorism concentrated
on the concerns of open attacks (bombing). However, the threats of CBRN
weapons are taken seriously, especially in the USA, where media,
fascinated by new weapons of mass destruction, encourage a growing fear
for public safety. Terrorists who have significant human and material
resources are much more likely to realize their intentions than lone
perpetrators or small terrorist groups. A CBRN terrorism threat is
certainly a matter of concern; however, terrorists will face many
obstacles in the implementation of an attack of this kind. This includes
the acquisition of materials and preparation for spreading them as well
as a selection and a survey of a chosen objective and a correct dose
required to achieve a desired effect. The growing threat of CBRN
terrorism Terrorism can be defined as a deliberate act of violence
intended to cause damage, but also to create an appropriate political
and ideological situation, so that the use of these non-traditional
weapons of terror outside the context is obvious, and the goals will not
be military, but civilian ones (Bioterrorism, chemical weapons, and
radiation terrorism, nd). Toxic substances, regardless of whether they
are of animal, vegetable or mineral origin, were used throughout the
history for political assassinations and sabotage; despite the risk of
severe penalties, the prospects for success favoured the use of toxic
substances. Such use has always been reduced, however, since only a
small number of people had access to substances and possessed the
ability of learn how to use them (Pascal, 1999). CBRN weapons are
rightly viewed with a special sense of horror, their effects can be
devastating and indiscriminating, and they take the most stringent toll
among the most vulnerable population, non-combatants (e.g. a biological
attack cannot be detected sufficiently fast after the disease spreads
through the population). Moreover, chemical and biological weapons are a
particularly attractive alternative for groups that do not have the
ability to produce nuclear weapons, and this risk raises complex but
important ethical issues (London, 2003). The common name for CBRN
terrorism which causes the death of a large number of people, large
scale damage and a strong echo worldwide is post-industrial or
hyper-terrorism. This means that non-state elements possess and dispose
of assets that were previously held only by states, but unlike them,
which often fear reprisals after WMD attacks, terrorists, having no
geographical location, are ready to use WMD with much less
scrupulousness and fear (Kurmnik, Ribnikar, 2003). Some authors have
described the factors that make chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear terrorist attacks in many ways unique and demanding, such as an
element of surprise, invisible agents, ordnance, the risk of repetition
and new types of risks (Ruggiero, Voss, 2015). In the past 30 years, the
use of CBRN weapons has become a major concern for many nations around
the world. The public has become insensitive to traditional terrorist
attacks that seem to be a less efficient way for terrorist organizations
to achieve their goals. What causes shock and fear is actually
presenting the properties of weapons which can be used by terrorist
organizations to enhance their efforts and the effectiveness of attacks.
CBRN terrorism is often a synonym for weapons of mass destruction,
although this form of terrorism and related incidents do not require
attacks and inflicting harm to large numbers of people - they do not
even require deadly attacks at all. The number of studies on this type
of terrorism is limited due to the lack of available data on this
terrorism type. There is a very small number of databases of CBRN
incidents, and even the existing ones have relatively little to do with
them and they are compared to conventional terrorism (Jesse, 2012). Some
experts emphasize the factors that promote such attacks and these
factors include the availability of information and expertise, increased
frustration of terrorists, demonization of the target population, as
well as a millennial, apocalyptic or messianic vision. Experts also
differ in opinion when it comes to possible perpetrators of CBRN
incidents, and include religious fundamentalists and cults1 as possible
perpetrators of such attacks, especially when these groups address to
ethereal audience, emphasizing the hatred of unbelievers (Ivanova,
Sandler, 2007). Concerns about super terrorism which involves the use of
CBRN weapons are mainly focused on what terrorists can do in the context
of our social reality, with an emphasis on terrorist motivations,
initiatives and limitations. When considering which terrorist groups may
be inclined to commit CBRN terrorism, it is important to recognize the
spectrum of these acts, as well as to analyze the following
categorization: (a) massive casualty events produced by conventional
weapons; (b) CBRN scams; (c) conventional attack on a nuclear facility;
(d) limited-scale chemical or biological attack or a radiological
dispersion; (e) large scale chemical or biological attack or a
radiological dispersion; and (f) CBRN strikes (super terrorism) that can
lead to thousands of victims. In addition to the motivation and
willingness to inflict mass casualties in any way, terrorists must have
technical and financial capabilities to come into possession of material
and acquire skills for these types of weapons and materials and carry
out a successful attack. Chemical and biological weapons can pose a risk
to terrorists thus deterring them from using such weapons (Post, 2005,
pp.148-151). The possibility that terrorists use chemical or biological
substances may increase over the next decade, according to US
intelligence agencies. According to CIA2 , an interest among non-state
actors, including terrorists, for biological and chemical materials is
real and growing, and the number of potential perpetrators is
increasing. The agency also noted that many of these groups had
developed an international network and did not need to rely on state
sponsors for financial and technical support. However, it is believed
that it is less likely that terrorists would choose chemical and
biological weapons over conventional explosives, because these weapons
are difficult to control and their results are unpredictable (Condesman,
Burke, 2001). The risk of CBRN weapons is growing since terrorists are
better acquainted with these agents and their potential for causing
harm3 . These agents possess desirable characteristics as weapons of
terror; they are biologically invisible to the naked eye, odorless and
potentially lethal in the form of particles; natural organisms are so
readily available, and can be \"camouflaged\" in natural disasters and
used to spread fear and various diseases. Chemical agents quickly attack
the critical physiological centers of the body, disabling or killing the
victim. Biological and chemical weapons require the application of huge
amounts of resources and result in different effects, causing fear and
panic in the contaminated areas. Often referred to as \"weapons of mass
destruction\", but, in medical terms, they are weapons of potential mass
casualties because they can lead to massive death toll in the absence of
preventive measures and timely response (Meyer, Spinella, 2014,
pp.645-656). \"Bioterrorism is the intentional use of microorganisms or
toxins derived from living organisms used for hostile purposes intended
to cause disease or death in man, animals and plants, on which they
depend\". The threat of bioterrorist attacks is real, and each
individual is a potential terrorist, when terrorists are \"invisible\"
prior to an attack which also can be \"invisible\" in the form of
causing infectious disea-ses or epidemics. Citizens who are not aware
they are infected are potential safety hazard and so-called dangerous
bodies (Mijalković, 2011). In the last ten years, the issue of CBRN
weapons has attracted the attention of experts, but a list of priorities
by the heads of states has never been established. Biological weapons
almost became forgotten after they had been banned by the 1972
Convention on Biological Weapons. A significant attention was paid to
them during the 90s of the last century. The important thing is that
biological weapons attract much less attention than other similar
weapons, but probably represent the greatest danger, and in addition to
their use in war, they are available as instruments of terror in peace.
Some countries showed willingness to use such weapons against
defenseless populations to achieve strategic objectives, and in this
regard, some analysts believe that those who attacked the World Trade
Center in 1993 applied cyanide on their bombs (this was not confirmed,
but a large amount of cyanide was found in possession of the
perpetrators). Such a group will prove to be less inefficient, because
if terrorists decide to shock and surprise the government by inflicting
enormous damage, CBRN weapons will become more attractive and more
accessible (Bettis, 1998). Motives and forms of behavior of individuals
and groups who acquired or used CBRN weapons have existed since long ago
and there is no doubt that modern society is vulnerable to such attacks
(Tucker, 2000). Fear of biological terrorism is certainly greater than
the fear of the conventional forms of terrorism; some of these fears are
justified and some are often exaggerated. Some agents are really very
contagious and deadly, and if used properly, have a potential to result
in casualties similar to those in a nuclear attack. Perhaps the scariest
aspect of biological weapons is that the body is attacked without
warning, people are afraid of the threat as it is invisible, and cannot
be heard or felt. The history of warfare, terrorism and crime involving
biological agents in the last century is considerably less dangerous and
more deadly than the history of conventional warfare (Parachini, 2001).
[Today, some states and some terrorist [groups]{.mark} can more
**[easily overcome]{.mark}** technological [**barriers** due to]{.mark}
the increased flow of **[info]{.mark}**rmation [and]{.mark} **access**
to previously unavailable **[tech]{.mark}**nologies.]{.underline}
**[Along with nuclear and chemical weapons, biological weapons are part
of an unholy trinity of weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}**
(Davis, Johnson-Winegar, 2000, pp.15-28). [The **[society is]{.mark} now
[faced with]{.mark} the threat of [an apocalyptic]{.mark} and asymmetric
[war]{.mark} scenario** in which kamikaze attackers are able to arm
themselves with WMD4]{.underline} without even having to have a
\"physical\" weapon to create fear; they probably still prefer simple,
proven methods: a stampede in an enclosed place, or just an explosive
device, which will kill many people5 (Palmer, 2004, pp.3-9). Early
detection and response to biological or chemical terrorism are crucial
to solving this problem (U.S. Congress House, 2003, p.117).

#### MMCC Stockpiling spurs NATO resilience -- they will say yes, but more resources are vital

\"M3-EPS: A Surge Capacity Concept for Pandemics and Crises,\" No
Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

Conclusion and Outlook

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} ongoing pandemic has
[[highlighted]{.underline}]{.mark} not just the lack of and need for
emergency elements / systems that can be deployed easily and quickly but
also [[the benefits of stockpiling medical supplies. The goal of the
M3-EPS concept is to increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**medical
resilience** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the European nations and
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} member states. The project also serves to
actively highlight the increasingly close connections and
interdependences with the civilian health care system. This increasingly
contributes to the positive perception of the solidarity between nations
when it comes to this issue. The military medical services should not
take on tasks of civilian agencies responsible for medical civil
protection, however. [[Harmonising]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[stockpiling and resilience-building efforts of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} civilian and military health care systems,
however, is a positive and productive effort to put both systems in a
position to better support each other in a crisis. As part of
civil-military cooperation, the [[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark} aims to
make an important contribution to such efforts.

The common goal is to develop and maintain easily deployable medical
surge capacities [[through innovative stockpiling]{.underline}]{.mark}
in order [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} be [[better]{.mark}
[prepare]{.mark}]{.underline}d [[for future]{.underline}]{.mark}
epidemics and [[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}. In recent years,
priority access to and stockpiling of medical supplies has been
drastically reduced in order to cut costs. In the course of further
concept development, options and opportunities for multinational,
standardised pre-positioning can be analysed. Binational and
multinational warehousing solutions may also be reviewed. Stockpiling as
part of preparing for a pandemic as per the M3-EPS concept also
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} considerably [[**greater**
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}. The concept has already been shared with
NATO and the EU as well as their member states, and modules have been
planned based on those established by the MMCC/EMC. The M3-EPS project
and its implementation can supplement these multinational modules. Any
potential [duplications are uncritical since all modules can be used
independently]{.underline} and, if necessary, can become all the more
effective when combined.

Initial procurements for NATO and the EU have already been implemented
based on this concept.

#### Long term investment is vital to NATO's security

2.0: A Critical Inflection Point,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-20-2022)

Julie Gerberding, M.D.: I realize that, you know, it's tempting to want
to keep [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} in the mindset of public health,
because it is a [[public health issue]{.underline}]{.mark}. But it's far
more than a public health issue. This [[has been an economic
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark} for countries, for businesses, and for
individual families. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} it's [[also a threat
to]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[national security]{.underline}]{.mark} in
a very direct way. When I saw the Navy ship with the outbreak of
SARS-CoV-2, I realized a really important dimension of that threat, that
[[you could **take out a Navy** with a respiratory
pathogen]{.underline}]{.mark}. And that makes it something that is
germane not just to the civilian population, but [[it's germane to our
force protection and our whole ability to defend our
nation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Now, that's an extreme example. I wouldn't use that as my leading
argument. But I think we have to get ourselves into a mindset that this
isn't an outbreak. It is a threat to individuals, to businesses, to
countries, and to the global order. And [[we need to approach it with
the **level** of strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}, the level of
**[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[**long-term sustained commitment** that we]{.underline}]{.mark} do
[[approach other threats to national security]{.underline}]{.mark}. I'm
not saying put it in the Pentagon, but I'm saying that it's a
commensurate threat. And it's significant enough that [[it merits the
same level of]{.underline}]{.mark} intention and political support,
[[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} long-term
strategic **[[investments]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Advantage 2 Biosafety

#### Next pandemic will exceed Covid-19, preparedness funding mitigates impact

\"Next pandemic could be more lethal than COVID, vaccine creator says,\"
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Future pandemics could be even more lethal
than COVID-19 so the [[lessons]{.underline}]{.mark} learned [[from the
outbreak must not be squandered]{.underline}]{.mark} and the world
should ensure it is prepared for the next viral onslaught, one of the
creators of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine said.

The novel [[coronavirus]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[killed 5.26
million]{.underline}]{.mark} people across the world, according to Johns
Hopkins University, [[wiped out trillions]{.underline}]{.mark} of
dollars [[in economic output and]{.underline}]{.mark} turned life upside
down for billions of people.

\"The truth is, [[the next one could be]{.underline}]{.mark} worse. It
could be [[more **contagious**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or [[more
**lethal**, or both]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Sarah Gilbert said in the
Richard Dimbleby Lecture, the BBC reported. \"This will not be the last
time a virus threatens our lives and our livelihoods.\"

Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said
the world should make sure it is better prepared for the next virus.

\"[[The advances]{.underline}]{.mark} we have made, and the knowledge we
have gained, [[**must not** be lost]{.underline}]{.mark},\" she said.

[[Efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} to end the COVID-19 pandemic [[have been
**uneven and fragmented**]{.underline}]{.mark}, marked by limited access
to vaccines in low-income countries while the \"healthy and wealthy\" in
rich countries get boosters, health experts say.

A panel of [[health experts]{.underline}]{.mark} set up by the World
Health Organisation to review the handling of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
has [[call]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[**permanent** funding]{.underline}]{.mark} and for greater ability to
investigate pandemics through a new treaty.

One proposal was for new financing [[of at least **\$10 billion** a
year]{.underline}]{.mark} for pandemic preparedness.

#### Biotech NATO coop on biotech builds cascading resilience to address a wide range of risks

Mircea **Geoană**, 12-10-20**20**, Deputy Secretary General, NATO,
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_180067.htm, \"Building
transatlantic resilience: Why critical infrastructure is a matter of
national security,\" NATO (ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

You know, as an Alliance we face and we've faced and we will face many
challenges, and some of them we have been dealing with for many years.
Look at [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, they continue to seek to
undermine our democracy, they\'re expanding their military they\'re
[[attempting to dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[neighbours like
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, Georgia or the Republic of Moldova. These
things [[are not new]{.underline}]{.mark}. There\'s also the scourge of
terrorism that continues to haunt our societies. And our mission in
Afghanistan to ensure it can deliver a place which should be, you know,
not becoming again a safe haven for terrorists to launch attacks on our
lands, or on their neighbours is also something which is very important.

There\'s also things that are relatively 'new-er', which is the rise of
China, not an adversary to NATO per se but the global actor whom we must
understand, and with its rise, it brings a lot of challenges, a lot of
problems, a lot of opportunities and we have to act accordingly. And of
course the use of emerging technologies as instruments of disruption and
instruments of power. We are speaking of geo-technology. We are in the
midst of the most, one of most, intense technological races in recent
history. And for the political West and for democratic societies, this
is also part of a very important conversation, because [[maintaining the
security of our vital technologies is central]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
way in which we can do, not only defending our people, but also
protecting everything we do from airports, to power plants to
infrastructures.

So, this persistent confrontation with novel and impactful issues is
also becoming even more complicated because [[we start seeing
more]{.underline}]{.mark} and more of the [[Black
Swan]{.underline}]{.mark}s, [[tsunami-kind risks]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and the pandemic is just one example]{.underline}]{.mark} of things
that might come, that eventually would come. And I think the issue of
[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} that we are talking today about, [[is
at the essence of the lessons learned from this
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark} and also from the other things. [[NATO is
in the business of **making sure** that all these complicated issues
will not come together in a sort of a **perfect
storm**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} making sure that
health crisis or environmental crisis or financial crisis, will not
[[become a security crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, so that\'s where [[NATO
is **very, very, very, very** important because resilience is the
reflex, and the remedy, at the same time]{.underline}]{.mark}. Resilient
societies, are our first line of defence.

Our security and prosperity depend on this. In the years ahead, we have
to put a much greater emphasis on resilience, and this is not only about
[[resilience of]{.underline}]{.mark} our governments, it\'s a whole of
society resilience and engaging with [[the triple helix of
government]{.underline}]{.mark}, of [[private
sector]{.underline}]{.mark}, essentially importantly engaging the
private sector, [[and also]{.underline}]{.mark} engaging our [[civil
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is what societal resilience is all
about. So that\'s why I\'m so happy to be today with you, and also I
thank again the American Enterprise Institute for bringing this topic to
a broader audience\'s attention. Of course, NATO has already worked
closely with industry, but also the nature of this relationship is
changing. I am chairing the Innovation Board in NATO, and we know that
much of the [[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} in technology, [[in
biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}, in AI, in quantum computing, in
human enhancement, in space, in everything, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
done by the private sector.

So if we speak about resilience and security, we are you know, in a way,
obliged to talk more to our private sector to the innovators, they\'re
not only in governments, but also they are [[in the private sector, in
academia]{.underline}]{.mark}. And this is also very important for our
communications, for our equipments, and also for our armed forces as
NATO and also as allies individually. So this effort is very important
to us. Of course, there are other dimensions of resilience in a more
sectoral way if you want. We speak in NATO for many years already - for
five years - about the baseline requirements on resilience from
infrastructure, from energy, from telecoms, now logistics and supply
chain. And I think [[this kind of conversation is **adding** to the
breadth and the depth of]{.underline}]{.mark} this conversation [[where
NATO is already]{.underline}]{.mark} exceptionally, exceptionally [[well
equipped]{.underline}]{.mark}.

We also, you know, in NATO resilience is part of our DNA. Because our
founding fathers, in writing the brilliant piece of our Constitution,
the Washington Treaty in Article Three they already spoke about the
obligation for allies individually and collectively to improve their
resilience to attack. Of course, the Washington treaty was conceived and
imagined in a moment of Cold War with the Soviet Union, but the
principle is relevant today and probably is more relevant today than
ever before. In a complex and unpredictable world, to maintain our
security, [[NATO allies need robust supply chains and civilian
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}. We need to protect civilian
controlled undersea cables and satellite systems upon which our
communications rely.

During large operations and military exercises. for example, around
90% - 9, 0, %, of military transport relies today on civilian ships,
railways and aircrafts. There is no difference between civilian security
and military strength, they're one and the same. So NATO allies have
already agreed high standards for resilience in areas including the
continuity of government, transport, energy, food and water supply. We
are now looking as we speak into the security of our infrastructure
supply chains, as I mentioned, and also we are now contemplating
screening; templates, methods, to screen foreign investments in our key
infrastructures and also our key intellectual and technology companies.

Let\'s take telecoms for an example. In 2019, so before the pandemic,
NATO updated our baseline resilience requirement for civil
communications networks, including 5g, a topic which is much discussed.
Allies must conduct thorough risk and vulnerability assessments,
identify and mitigate cyber threats and assess the consequences of
foreign ownership control, or direct investment of critical
infrastructure. It is crucial that 5g infrastructure is safe, secure,
and trusted. We have seen significant and welcome progress here. For
example, through the US Clean Network Initiative, and also, a very good
example of NATO US-EU cooperation: European Union\'s 5g toolbox, and
together with NATO\'s baseline requirements on resilience.

This is why here [[at NATO we work closely with the EU, with the private
sector, civil society, academia, **because**]{.underline}]{.mark} as I
mentioned earlier, [[resilience is a national
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is also a **collective**
effort]{.underline}]{.mark}. And also our Defence Ministers, the virtual
meeting, only last month, they received a comprehensive report on the
state of our critical infrastructure. While we have made progress there
still vulnerabilities. For instance on foreign control of critical
components on which our societies and our militaries rely, we have to
further strengthen our resilience, we need to go further and agree
stronger requirements for resilience.

At the meeting next year of NATO Heads of State and Government, we do
hope that this will be, and this will be, on the agenda of our leaders,
when our leaders will be meeting next year. So as we go through the
current global crisis, we rediscover our reflex towards partnerships
with like-minded organisations like the EU, the OECD, the World Bank or
the UN. Cooperation among governments, cooperation among our civil and
private sectors. And I think this kind of [[**deep cooperation** within
the bodies of our societies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[is key to our
success]{.underline}]{.mark}. Because [[together we can tackle the novel
elements and find solutions to otherwise very complex ,very long
lasting, equations of **risks and threats**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Because together we are stronger and more efficient. And this is very,
very important as the challenges we face in the political West, and we
face a challenge, like we never had probably in centuries.

We are also, for the moment, not only a competition on geopolitical
grounds, not only on geo-technological grounds, not only on financial
and economic grounds, but also to the very resilience of our democratic
societies, and the competition for the commanding heights of how human
societies are organized is now raging. We are open, free societies. This
is our strength. This is the value, foundation on which NATO is based.
This is what we have been building for decades and decades. So when we
speak about resilience. Please also think not only in terms of physical
resilience in front of so many complicated issues, but also look at the
deeper meaning of resilience, which is the very essence of defending our
democratic way of life.

And also I have to say, speaking of our partners, look at [[NATO
partners]{.underline}]{.mark} like, Finland, working together with the
private sector to strengthen their resilience. Sweden another very
important partner of ours is doing the same. We [[are learning from each
other]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are working together, and we stand ready
as NATO, to continue [[to engage even more
ambitiously]{.underline}]{.mark} and more thoroughly with the private
sector, with academia, with like-minded nations and partners around the
world. And this is why we continue [[to put resilience at the very
**heart** of]{.underline}]{.mark} what we do in
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, because, as I mentioned, and as Stoltenberg
mentioned just a few days ago, our first line of defence starts with
resilient societies that we are coming from. That\'s where we are. And
this will continue to go forward in the period ahead. So thank you so
very much for having me. I look forward to our conversation down the
road.

#### The foresight model is key to avert biosafety dangers

The study of the future dates back to antiquity. Understanding what
could lie ahead was of strategic importance to rulers and military
leaders and was of great general interest to ancient societies and
religions. While cultures developed different ways of thinking about the
future that evolved over time, a historically common point of view was
that there was one single predetermined future (Cuhls et al. 2012).
[[The systematic study of different possible
futures]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how these could be shaped by present
actions, emerged as a new field of inquiry in the mid-twentieth century,
in part due to pioneering work conducted by the Research and Development
(RAND) corporation in Santa Monica, California (Kaplan et al. 1950;
Helmer 1967). Since its emergence, the field of futures studies has
undergone rapid expansion with the refinement of its conceptual
underpinnings and development of different methodologies.

Today, futures work is [[undertaken by governments, militaries and
scientific institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, and other interested
groups, with the aim of [[gaining]{.underline}]{.mark} actionable
[[insight into]{.underline}]{.mark} possible emerging futures. In fields
like [[synthetic biology and biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark} that are
undergoing rapid and continuous change, the ability to gain strategic
insight from possible futures [[is highly relevant to policy
development]{.underline}]{.mark}, risk assessment and threat analysis.
It is particularly important to be able to identify the underlying
drivers, range of uncertainty, points of convergence, and potential
opportunities and challenges in these developing fields, and how these
might be affected by particular policy interventions. For all of these,
**[[foresight]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- a process of conducting futures
work -- [[can offer strategic insight]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Foresight]{.underline}]{.mark} has been defined in multiple ways. In
this chapter, we use an understanding commonly found in the literature,
which highlights that it is first and foremost a process that [[involves
"systematically attempting to look into the longer-term future of
science, technology, the economy and society"
through]{.underline}]{.mark} which "one comes to a fuller
[[understanding of the forces]{.underline}]{.mark} shaping the long-term
future" (Martin 1995; Miles 2010). [[Foresight]{.underline}]{.mark},
therefore, [[**differs from** forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark}, in that
it does not aim to predict the future. Although the two terms are
sometimes used interchangeably, forecasting is concerned with making "a
probabilistic statement, on a relatively high confidence level, about
the future" (Martin 2010).

Foresight can also be contrasted with hindsight, which is a systematic
examination of the past. While the past offers useful information that
can inform a foresight process, hindsight has access to outcome
information that foresight does not. Care should be taken when combining
these processes in order to avoid "observation selection effects" or
biasing thinking towards historical occurrences (Fischhoff 1975).

Many additional terms specific to futures studies have been introduced
and refined in the literature, with some confusion arising given shared
and contradictory wording used in colloquial contexts (Trump et al.
2019). In order to use clear terminology in describing futures research,
with the aim of [[developing a consistent lexicon across NATO
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}, a definitions list is provided below.
This is followed by examples of foresight research conducted on the
topics of emerging synthetic biology and biotechnology.

The two subsequent sections provide an overview of different foresight
methodologies and present an approach to foresight question choice,
highlighting some specific questions for synthetic biology and
biotechnology. Finally, recommendations for [[the design of a foresight
process]{.underline}]{.mark} are offered, with the intention of
[[providing a useable resource for NATO partners investigating emerging
synthetic biology and biotechnology threats]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\"The Blessing and Curse of Biotechnology: A Primer on Biosafety and
Biosecurity,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

SECURITY THREATS

Recent [[advances in]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[synth]{.underline}]{.mark}etic [[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}logy, a
technology that [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to artificially
[[create]{.underline}]{.mark} organisms in labs, carry the foreboding
potential to develop [[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}logical
[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, the emergence of the
[[DIY]{.underline}]{.mark} community and the
[[open-source]{.underline}]{.mark} nature of this movement have
[[sparked concerns that terrorists could easily]{.underline}]{.mark}
acquire the information needed to [[weaponize
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, although none of these DIY groups
have exhibited any nefarious intentions. [[Nefarious
actors]{.underline}]{.mark} who previously acquired pathogens from a lab
or from nature with the intention of developing a bioweapon
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} now either [[order DNA
fragments]{.underline}]{.mark} online [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
assemble them to create dangerous pathogens or synthesize lethal
pathogens from scratch using genomic information available online.
Moreover, such actors can [[leverage vulnerabilities in the cyber
defenses of labs]{.underline}]{.mark} and private companies to gain
access to sensitive information that is not publicly available online.

To better understand the security threats emerging from recent
developments in biotechnology, it is worthwhile to return to the
aforementioned hypothetical Ebola scenario. Imagine for a moment that
the researchers involved, in collaboration with an editor at an esteemed
journal, decided that they would publish a redacted version of the
methods and the results section of their research due to security
concerns. A month after the paper was published, the lab noticed unusual
activity on their servers. The lab immediately reported the incident to
the university's information technology department. The department
contacted local law enforcement officials, and together they traced the
hack to a suspected terrorist organization. The group was trying to gain
access to the methodology that led to the accidental creation of a more
virulent Ebola strain so as [[to launch a deliberate biological
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. Law enforcement put DNA synthesis companies
on high alert for any orders that closely aligned with research on the
Ebola virus or other high-risk pathogens. Thankfully, a company was able
to flag an order and law enforcement was able to cooperate with local
officials to shut down the unauthorized lab before it began creating and
releasing harmful products.

In reality, individuals have at times tried to acquire deadly pathogens
and other sensitive biological information. For example, two Canadians
were arrested in the city of Buffalo, New York in 1984 after they were
suspected of illegally acquiring and smuggling strains of botulism and
tetanus to Canada. The Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo made unsuccessful
attempts in 1995 to acquire strains of Ebola from Central Africa to
develop the group's biological weapons program. More recently, two
Chinese hackers were indicted in the United States for seeking to obtain
intellectual property related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines.
Similar incidents were reported in Spain; allegedly Chinese hackers were
trying to steal data from Spanish labs conducting vaccine research.

In addition to [[strategically embedding members into research
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} to acquire these deadly pathogens,
some [[terrorist organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[have sought
to rely on lab insiders]{.underline}]{.mark} to either develop
biological weapons or grant access to organisms or sensitive
information. For example, a Malaysian scientist tried to develop anthrax
weapons for Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda.

[[While most countries have national guidelines]{.underline}]{.mark} for
handling safety and security threats, the
[[examples]{.underline}]{.mark} described above [[highlight the global
implications]{.underline}]{.mark} of such threats. [[It is therefore
important to evaluate **global**]{.mark}]{.underline} best
[[practices]{.underline}]{.mark}, treaties, and conventions that deal
with such risks and devise strategies [[to update these safeguards to
govern dual-use]{.underline}]{.mark} applications of emerging
[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies.

(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

Abstract: [[Dual-use biotechnology faces the risks of availability,
novel biological agents, knowledge, normative, and other dual-use risks.
If left unchecked, these may **destroy** human living conditions and
social order]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Despite the benefits of dual-use
technology, good governance is needed to **mitigate its
risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The predicaments facing all governments in
managing the dual-use risks of biotechnology deserve special attention.
On the one hand, [[the information asymmetry risk of dual-use
biotechnology prevents the traditional self-governance
model]{.underline}]{.mark} in the field of biotechnology from playing
its role. On the other hand, [[top-down public regulation often lags
behind technological iteration]{.underline}]{.mark} due to the
difficulty of predicting the human-made risks of dual-use biotechnology.
[[Therefore]{.underline}]{.mark}, we argue that [[governance of the
dual-use risks of biotechnology should avoid the traditional bottom-up
or top-down modes]{.underline}]{.mark}. We suggest the governance for
dual-use biotechnology could be improved [[if the four-stage
experimentalist governance model is followed]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
first stage is to achieve [[consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} on a broad
governance framework with open-ended principles. The second stage is for
countries to take [[action based on local
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} and the open-ended framework. The third
stage is to [[establish a]{.underline}]{.mark} [[dynamic consultation
mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark} for transnational information sharing
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} action review. The fourth and final stage is
to [[evaluate and revise the global governance
framework]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Before turning to the safety and security of biotechnology research and
the need to balance risk mitigation with innovations in the field, it is
important to understand the scope and applications of such technologies.
[[Biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, as defined by the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development, [[refers to]{.underline}]{.mark}
"the [[application of scientific and engineering principles to the
processing]{.underline}]{.mark} of materials [[by biological

applications of biotechnology include [[developing
food]{.underline}]{.mark} products, bio[[chemicals]{.underline}]{.mark},
beverages, and [[pharma]{.underline}]{.mark}ceuticals, as well as
services like using [[genetically altered organisms]{.underline}]{.mark}
for water purification, waste management, [[and sustainable resource
procurement]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Scientific developments in [[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} offer solutions to [[address global

#### Climate change threatens human extinction

[[There is increasing concern that climate change poses **an existential
risk to humanity**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Understanding these worst-case
scenarios is essential for good risk management. However, our knowledge
of the causal pathways through which climate change could cause societal
collapse is underdeveloped. This paper aims to identify and structure an
empirical evidence base of the climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse pathway. We first review the societal collapse and
existential risk literature and define a set of determinants of societal
collapse. We develop an original methodology, using these determinants
as societal collapse proxies, to identify an empirical evidence base of
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary
society and then structure it using a novel-format causal loop diagram
(CLD) defined at global scale and national granularity. The resulting
evidence base varies in temporal and spatial distribution of study and
in the type of data-driven methods used. The resulting CLD documents the
spread of the evidence base, using line thickness and colour to depict
density and type of data-driven method respectively. It enables
exploration of how the effects of climate change may undermine
agricultural systems and disrupt food supply, which can lead to economic
shocks, socio-political instability as well as starvation, migration and
conflict. Suggestions are made for future work that could build on this
paper to further develop our qualitative understanding of, and
quantitative complex systems modelling capabilities for analysing, the
causal pathways between climate change and societal collapse.
Introduction Despite recent social protests and climate emergency
declarations, [[efforts to mitigate climate change to-date **are
insufficient**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ripple et al. 2019). Greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions continue to rise and global warming above 3 °C is
increasingly likely this century (Raftery et al. 2017). There is
emerging evidence of amplifying feedbacks accelerating (Natali 2019) and
dampening feedbacks decelerating (Walker et al. 2019). These feedbacks
exacerbate the possibility of runaway global warming (Steffen et al.
2018), estimated at 8 °C or greater by 2100 (Schneider et al. 2019).
Such temperature increases translate to a range of real dangers (The
Center for Climate and Security 2020), shifting the narrow climate niche
within which humans have resided for millennia (Xu et al. 2020). Looking
beyond the framing of 'global warming', [[there is concern that the
effects of climate change may pose an **existential risk to humanity**,
one that threatens 'societal collapse' or **even
extinction**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ord 2020). Understanding these
worst-case scenarios is essential for good risk management (Kunreuther
et al. 2013). Improving awareness of potential pathways through which
climate change poses such a risk can help inform decision-making about
interventions (Shepherd et al. 2018). Considering societal impacts that
are more tangible for individuals, businesses and governments (Briggs et
al. 2015), and better aligned with conventional risk priorities (Wagner
and Weitzman 2015), may facilitate more effective action to mitigate
climate change (Weber 2006). [[A number of pathways through which
climate change could cause societal collapse have been identified, one
being via **food insecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Gowdy 2020).
[[Climate change is predicted to **undermine agricultural systems** and
disrupt food supply]{.underline}]{.mark} (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF 2020),
[[which may **lead to economic shocks**]{.underline}]{.mark},
socio-**[[political instability]{.mark}]{.underline}** as well as
[[**starvation**, **migration and conflict** at local through to
**global scale**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Rivington et al. 2015). While the
climate science underpinning global warming estimates is well
established (IPCC 2014), albeit subject to sensitivities, the
uncertainties increase significantly when we start to consider these
tangible societal impacts given the complex relationships involved
(Butzer 2012). Our understanding of worst-case scenarios, and
particularly of empirical evidence addressing the causal pathways
through which climate change may cause societal collapse, is
underdeveloped (Kemp 2020).

#### Synth-bio engineered pandemics are the #1 existential risk

Bryan **Walsh**, 5-14-20**20**, Axios, \"The coronavirus pandemic
reawakens bioweapon fears,\"
https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-pandemic-pathogen-bioweapon-45417c86-52aa-41b1-8a99-44a6e597d3a8.html
(ermo/sms, Acc 9-26-2020)

The immense human and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic only
underscores the threat posed by pathogens that could be deliberately
engineered and released[.]{.underline}

Why it matters: New technology like [[gene editing and **DNA synthesis**
has made]{.underline}]{.mark} the creation of more virulent pathogens
easier. Yet security and regulation efforts haven\'t kept pace with the
science.

What\'s happening: Despite some claims by the White House, overwhelming
scientific evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus was not
accidentally released from a lab or deliberately engineered, but
naturally spilled over from an animal source[.]{.underline}

That doesn\'t mean the threat from bioweapons isn\'t dire. Along with
AI, [[engineered pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} are widely considered
[[the **biggest existential risk** facing humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}.

That\'s in part [[because a pathogen could be
**engineered**]{.underline}]{.mark} in a lab [[for maximum
contagiousness and virulence, well beyond]{.underline}]{.mark} what
would arise through [[**natural** selection]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Case in point: a 2018 pandemic simulation put on by the Johns Hopkins
Center for Health Security featured a fictional engineered virus called
Clade X that combined the contagiousness of the common cold with the
virulence of the real-life Nipah virus, which has a mortality rate of
40-75%. The resulting simulated global outbreak killed 150 million
people[.]{.underline}

[COVID-19]{.underline} isn\'t anywhere near that fatal, but the pandemic
[has shown the vulnerability]{.underline} of the U.S. and the world [to
biological threats]{.underline} both natural and manmade.

\"[Potential adversaries are]{.underline} of course [seeing the same
things]{.underline} we're seeing,\" says Richard Pilch of the Middlebury
Institute of International Studies. \"Anyone looking for a radical
leveling approach --- whether a state actor like North Korea or [[a
motivated **terrorist** organization --- may be influenced by COVID-19
to]{.underline}]{.mark} consider [[pursuing a **biological weapons**
capability]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

Background: Bioweapons were officially banned by the Biological Weapons
Convention in 1975, though North Korea is suspected of maintaining an
offensive bioweapons program[.]{.underline}

A particular concern about biowarfare and bioterror, though, is that
many of the tools and methods that could be used to create a weaponized
virus are largely indistinguishable from those used in the course of
legitimate scientific research. This makes biotechnology \"dual-use\"
--- and that much more difficult to safely regulate without cutting off
research that could be vitally important[.]{.underline}

While earlier [bioweapons fears focused on]{.underline} the possibility
that a state or terror group could try to [weaponize a known dangerous
agent like smallpox]{.underline} --- which would require somehow
obtaining restricted pathogens --- [[**new technology** means that
someone could obtain the genetic sequence]{.underline}]{.mark} of a germ
[[online and synthesize it in the lab]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Food price spikes ends civilization

**Ahmed, 15**---citing models from Anglia Ruskin University's Global
Sustainability Institute Global Resource Organization Project (Nafeez,

dml)

The report explores the scenario of [a near-term global food supply
disruption]{.underline}, considered plausible on the basis of past
events, especially in relation to future climate trends. [[The global
food system]{.underline}]{.mark}, the authors find, [[is]{.mark} "[under
chronic pressure]{.mark}]{.underline} to meet an ever-rising demand,
[and its vulnerability to acute disruptions is compounded]{.underline}
by factors such as climate change, water stress, ongoing globalisation
and heightening political instability." Three steps from crisis Lloyd's
scenario analysis shows that [food production across the planet could be
significantly undermined]{.underline} due to a combination of just three
catastrophic weather events, leading to shortfalls in the production of
staple crops, and ensuing [[price spikes]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the
scenario, which is "set in the near future," wheat, maize and soybean
prices "increase to quadruple the levels seen around 2000," while rice
prices increase by 500%. This [[leads to rocketing stock prices for
agricultural commodities, agricultural chemicals and agriculture
engineering supply chains]{.underline}]{.mark}: "[Food [riots break
out]{.mark}]{.underline} in urban areas across the Middle East, North
Africa and Latin America. [The euro weakens]{.underline} and the main
European stock markets lose 10% of their value; [US stock markets
follow]{.underline} and lose 5% of their value." The scenario analysis
demonstrates that [[a key outcome]{.mark} of any such systemic shock to
the global food supply]{.underline} --- apart from "negative
humanitarian consequences and major financial losses
worldwide" --- [[would be geopolitical mayhem as well as escalating
terrorism]{.mark} and civil unrest]{.underline}.

[As the threat from domestic terrorism is **clearly
increasing**]{.underline}, one must ask if [violent tactics]{.underline}
used [by these attackers might develop beyond]{.underline} the use of
**[explosives and guns]{.underline}**. [The vehicle attack in
[Charlottesville]{.mark} was an [indicat]{.mark}ion of]{.underline} that
[[tactics diversification]{.underline}]{.mark}, even though this was not
the first incident of its kind in the United States. As the Oklahoma
plot shows, [[far-right terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[see
themselves in]{.underline}]{.mark} some kind of
[**[competition]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [public
[recognition with]{.mark}]{.underline} Jihadist groups like
[[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which]{.mark} could lead to]{.underline}
a further **[[escalat]{.mark}ion of [tactics]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[used]{.underline} for example [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[deployment of [chemical, biological]{.mark}, radiological or nuclear
**(CBRN) [weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, [right-wing
terrorists have for **decades**]{.underline} [been attempting to develop
and use chemical and biological weapons]{.underline}. This article aims
to give a short overview on the history of such efforts, the potential
for right-wing terrorism to use chemical and biological agents in the
future, and how authorities can counter this threat.

A Look at the Cases

Even though no significant cases of successful right-wing CBRN terror
attacks in Western countries are known, [a number of [plots]{.mark}
[have been]{.mark} [uncovered]{.mark} that indicate]{.underline} the
**[motives and tactics]{.underline}** of these extremists. In 2009 Ian
[Davidson]{.underline}, who was the leader of the right-wing terrorist
Aryan Strike Force (ASF), [became]{.underline} the first British citizen
[convicted of producing a chemical **weapon of mass
destruction**]{.underline}. When Davidson and his son Nicky were
arrested in the United Kingdom, the subsequent trial and conviction made
history. His plot aimed to poison water supplies of Muslims in Serbia
using the toxin ricin, which he already had produced in a significant
amount. Estimations by investigators regarding the lethality of the
material varied drastically but some thought the amount produced by
Davison could have killed up to 1,000 people.

In the mid-1980s one of the few right-wing terrorist organizations in
the United States, "[The Covenant]{.underline}, the Sword, and the Arm
of the Lord", [acquired large amounts of cyanide,]{.underline} intending
to poison water supplies in major U.S. cities, but failed to overcome
the technical difficulties of dissemination. In May 1996, [a
**laboratory staff member and white supremacist**]{.underline} in Ohio,
Larry Wayne [Harris]{.underline}, [successfully acquired plague
bacteria]{.underline} -- not illegal at that time. Two years later,
[Harris and a co-conspirator were arrested]{.underline} for [threatening
to release **anthrax**]{.underline} in Las Vegas, even though his strain
was a vaccine grade and harmless version. Material to extract ricin was
also found at the home of white supremacist James Kenneth Gluck in
Tampa, Fla., who was arrested by the FBI in November 1999 after he
threatened judges with biological warfare. [More serious seems to
have]{.underline} been the plot led by [neo-Nazi]{.underline} William
[Krar]{.underline} of Texas, arrested in April 2003. [Investigators
found]{.underline} more than 500,000 rounds of ammunition, 65 pipe bombs
and remote-control briefcase bombs, and almost [two pounds of deadly
sodium cyanide]{.underline}. Along with white supremacist and
anti-government material, [components to convert the cyanide into a
bomb]{.underline} capable of killing thousands [were]{.underline} also
[secured]{.underline}. In November 2011, [a plot to]{.underline} blow up
government buildings and [kill masses]{.underline} of people [using
ricin]{.underline} by a group of four men belonging to an
anti-government militia in Georgia [was uncovered.]{.underline}
Especially concerning was the fact that [[one]{.mark} of the four [was
working for the]{.mark} **federal [Department of
Ag]{.mark}riculture**]{.underline}, [[giving]{.mark} him [**access** to
chemicals]{.mark}, **[tech]{.mark}nical equipment** [and ways to
**disseminate**]{.mark} **the poison**]{.underline} into food and water
supplies. In February 2017, 27 year old William Christopher Gibbs,
member of the white supremacist Creativity Movement, was arrested after
hospitalizing himself for side effects of his experiments with ricin,
triggering a large FBI operation.

When looking at these cases, [[far-right extremists]{.mark} [attempting
to acquire]{.mark}]{.underline} and use [[CBRN]{.underline}]{.mark}
weapons [have]{.underline} very mixed [backgrounds, [rang]{.mark}ing
[from **career criminals**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} **[senior
biodefense researchers at]{.mark} United States [Army
institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, the more [serious [plots
came from **well-educated individuals**]{.mark} **[with]{.mark}
necessary [access to]{.mark} [equipment]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
**dissemination**]{.underline}]{.mark} ways indicating that [right-wing
terrorists might]{.underline} [be]{.underline} quite [**well embedded**
in Western societies]{.underline}. In his seminal study about far-right
terrorists' recruitment and radicalization from 2012 for example, Pete
Simi found 56% of his sample belonged to middle or upper social class
and 53% had some form of college or higher education (with and without
degrees). The majority of far-right CBRN plotters were part of groups
and networks associated with their ideological and criminal conduct but
not all of them. However, [[every far-right CBRN incident]{.mark}
[appears]{.mark} to be [a culmination of a **radicalization**
]{.mark}**escalation [process]{.mark}**]{.underline}, sometimes even
over years, with long histories of openly expressed violent, right-wing
extremist, racist or anti-government opinions. Many of the plotters
repeatedly threatened to use CBRN weapons in public to bystanders,
families or friends. Even the lone actors were known to have gradually
distanced themselves from their social environments getting more and
more agitated and aggressive.

Now, the key question is: what makes a threat of far-right CBRN
terrorism more likely and dangerous than compared with other violent
ideologies, such as left-wing or jihadi terrorism? Of course, far-right
extremists have equal access to open market technical equipment and
supplies for manufacturing such weaponry as all other extremists in the
country and their ideology is not more or less dangerous than jihadi or
left-wing extremism, for example. Nevertheless, in 2012 international
terrorism expert Peter Bergen stated, that "[11 right-wing and left-wing
extremists]{.underline} have [managed to acquire CBRN material that they
planned to use]{.underline} against the public, government employees or
both" while there was no evidence of jihadists in the United States
managing to do that. From these 11 cases [only one]{.underline} (Joseph
Konopka) [was]{.underline} [motivated by left-wing
extremist]{.underline} (more specifically anarchist) political
[ideals]{.underline}. This fact is striking, since other violent
extremists, especially Jihadists, certainly do not lack the willingness
to use weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), as it is currently
experienced in Syria and Iraq. But how indicative is this
retrospectively almost singular right-wing CBRN terror threat for the
future?

To assess the possibility of an attack, one has to take three factors
into account: 1) the feasibility of the used weapon (acquisition,
available know-how, technology, materials or agents), 2) the
"effectivity" or costs and benefits of the weapon and 3) the motivation
to use the weapon regarding the pursued aims. The assassination of an
individual person with a plain firearm is feasible (through the ease of
acquiring a firearm), effective (since a single, well-placed bullet will
"do the job") and sends a clear message in terms of motivation, however
not to an extent exceeding every-day criminality encountered on the
streets of big cities. Using a deadly toxin, like ricin, presents bigger
hurdles in terms of feasibility, but is also highly effective (in terms
of toxicity and evasion of forensic investigation) and, more important,
will provide added value in terms of public attention and media coverage
about the attack and the very ideology of the originators. Considering
the attack on a crowded public space, planting explosives will lead to
severe damage as well potentially high lethality. However, by mixing the
explosives with radioactive material -- a so called dirty bomb -- will
not only cause more fatalities through radiation, but also evoke a
higher level of fear and terror. Additionally, such an incident would
represent a difficult challenge for first responders and might render
the government incompetent of an appropriate response and preparation in
the eyes of the public. All terrorists potentially share this goal to
make their attacks more impactful and deadly, even though right-wing
terrorists rarely have aimed to produce mass casualties, so far.

Factor 2, the effectivity of a weapon is, depending on the planned
operation, similar for all kinds of terrorist as well. However, the
[[feasibility]{.mark} to use CBRN weapons]{.underline} (factor 1)
[[might be **higher**]{.mark} for far-right terrorists]{.underline} than
for others, e.g. jihadists, [[since the]{.mark} extreme [right]{.mark}
can [rely on]{.mark} **[established]{.mark} and much larger [support
networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[which]{.mark} can
[provide]{.mark} the **required [material]{.mark}, know-how and
dissemination** ways]{.underline}. Of course, it is not impossible for
lone actors from all ideological strands to acquire the material as well
as the know-how. Regarding factor 3, the motive, the violent far-right
might be in an extraordinary position right now, making it more
dangerous than ever.

The current Trump administration is openly courting the extreme right
and -- in the eyes of observers -- fuelling a rising far-right terror
threat, for example through the inadequate reaction to the
Charlottesville attack. In addition, [the]{.underline} general [public
is]{.underline} much [less likely to perceive violent actions from
far-right extremists as "terrorism"]{.underline} compared, for example,
with those acts by Islamic extremists. [[This gives]{.mark} violent
[extremists]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [the far-right]{.mark} considerably
more [space to]{.mark} **[radicalize, escalate]{.mark} violent tactics
[and plot]{.mark} attacks**]{.underline} without interference from the
outside than from any other violent extremist group in Western
countries. The most significant danger, however, will come to light
after the demise of the Trump administration. A future US government
trying to put the far-right jinni that Trump has released back into the
bottle will face a much stronger, self-confident and aggressive
opponent, already dreaming of a race war. The current government is
favoured by anti-government militias and sovereign citizens and they are
looking for a new enemy: those "counter-revolutionaries" attempting to
return the United States to a pre-Trump state. Even open civil war was
threatened in a case of impeachment. far-right extremists of all
different strands might have heavily stockpiled firearms and explosives,
but they know they cannot outgun and outman law enforcement, National
Guard or the Military. A fight to retain their perceived newly gained
freedom and powers therefore must include a tactical edge forcing the
government to refrain from a too aggressive crackdown. CBRN agents or
even the potential to quickly acquire them are the most effective and
logical way to ensure the government's passivity, especially giving the
history of CBRN plots within the far-right.

What is Likely, What is Not? A Choice of Weapons

Some CBRN agents are more likely to be used in a terrorist attack than
others, depending on factors such as ease of acquiring raw materials,
difficulty of production, the required know-how, danger of storing the
material for the terrorist, degradation of the material over time,
deliverance, dispersion, and potential countermeasures. Nuclear and
radiological weapons require radioactive elements that are generally
stored under high-security and thus hard to obtain without a state
sponsor. Low-level radioactive elements unsuitable for nuclear weapons,
but sufficient for the construction of a 'dirty bomb' might be easier to
obtain, since industry, agriculture and medical institutions are
dependent on them. Americium, which is used in household smoke
detectors, has indeed been found in the homes of far-right extremists,
e.g. Tampa resident Brandon Russell. However, its actual effectiveness
as a dirty-bomb ingredient is debated. Further, neo-Nazi James Cummings
acquired four 1-gallon containers with a radioactive uranium and thorium
mix in 2008, along with highly toxic beryllium powder and instructions
to build a dirty bomb.

[Chemicals and biological material]{.underline}, while for some part
underlying governmental restrictions concerning proliferation and
acquisition, [are much easier to access]{.underline}. As noted by Edward
You of the FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate, Biological
Countermeasures Unit, "[The materials are **readily
available**]{.underline} (...), and the majority of equipment can be
purchased outright and do not fall under any regulatory regime."
[Precursors for chemical warfare agents]{.underline}, as sodium cyanide
in the case of William Krar, **[can be simply bought
online]{.underline}**. Manuals explaining the synthesis of the active
agents in small laboratory or kitchen setups have been found in many
cases, illustrating that the [required knowledge has already spread and
advanced **significantly**]{.underline}. Explosives that have been found
and used in terror associated cases include the so called 'mother of
Satan', triacetone peroxide (TATP), and hexamethylene triperoxide
diamine (HTMD). TATP can be synthesized from easily accessible household
chemicals (acetone, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid). Synthesis of
chemical warfare agents like sarin, a nerve agent used by the Aum
Shinrikyo attacks on the Tokyo subway, is highly demanding in terms of
technology and know-how. Considering the difficulties of achieving
sufficient quality of the material and the high risk for the producers
during manufacturing and storage make and attack with nerve agents
appear unlikely. However, structurally more simple chemicals, like
cyanide compounds which can be commercially obtained, have been used in
far-right terror plots.

Another potential dual-use chemical is chlorine. The highly reactive gas
is nowadays widely used as disinfectant, bleaching agent and within
different industry branches. Millions of tons are transported on roads
and railways within the US every year, and may as such be targets for
terrorist attacks. Upon contact with the human mucosa, the water soluble
chlorine will at first cause local irritations and, during prolonged
exposition of higher doses, evoke the deadly "dry-land drowning". While
no large scale attacks on hazardous material (HAZMAT) transports have
been reported so far, guides to derail trains carrying such materials
have been published by Jihadists and could easily be used by far-right
terrorists as well. Additionally, application of commercially acquired
chlorine as choking agent in local, small scale attacks pose a risk.

Alternatives to chemicals are agents of biological origin: toxins,
bacteria (or spores -- robust and dormant forms) and viruses. Toxins are
harmful products of biological organisms, which interfere with vital
body functions. Production and purification of these substances require
in-depth knowledge and large amounts are thus hard to obtain. Ricin,
which can be isolated from the castor oil plant, has been detected in
multiple cases of far-right terror plots. While ricin is extremely
deadly when taken up into the body, a wide spread application of ricin
to target large groups of people is rather unlikely, just by the large
amounts needed for such operation and the very proteinaceous nature. The
isolation and cultivation of bacteria, although requiring some
microbiological knowledge, can be done in improvised laboratory setups.
Highly pathogenic strains are usually kept in isolated, high-security
laboratories. However, Bacillus anthracis is an omnipresent, easy to
isolate soil bacterium. Anthrax, as in the case of Larry Wayne Harris,
is according to the CDC generally considered to be the most likely agent
which might be used in large-scale bioterror. Viruses are dependent on
cells as hosts for multiplication and thus require an even more
complicated production process, which is highly unlikely to be
established outside of academic or industrial laboratories. While the
deadliest infectious diseases, like ebola or lassa, are caused by viral
infections, application of viruses as terror agent by far-right
extremist is unlikely. However, the growing industry and
professionalization of DIY bio-laboratories across the United States was
also noted by the FBI, which might also increase accessibility of the
necessary technical equipment for potential biological and chemical
terrorism.

Likely **[[Goals of Right-Wing Terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Existing [research on right-wing CBRN terrorism is **scarce and
outdated**]{.underline}. Few experts have even considered the potential
threat, mostly in the late 1990s looking at Christian Millenarianism as
a form of religious terrorism aiming for the apocalypse in a
"sacrificial ritual of mass murder and suicide ". Even though Christian
millenarian groups have not attempted to develop CBRN weapons, they were
scrutinized for such a potential threat after the Aum attack in Tokyo.
Jessica Stern wrote in 1999 that "the costs of escalation to biological
weapons seem to outweigh the benefits" for domestic extremists. Paul
Blister and Nina Kollars confirmed this notion regarding the Christian
Patriot Movement in 2011. [Right-wing terrorism]{.underline}, however,
[goes beyond Christian fundamentalism]{.underline} and fanaticism
circling around Armageddon. Especially given the dramatic increase in
anti-government sentiment and militia groups in some western countries
(e.g. the US and Germany) and their partial overlap with white
supremacist and nationalist groups, [there is potential for a future
**escalation of violent tactics**]{.underline} if anyone might attempt
to contain them again. Right-wing [[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} have
usually not [[sought large]{.mark} public
[audiences]{.mark}]{.underline} for their attacks in order to
communicate specific political programs but rather [to annihilate their
enemies by **every means possible**]{.underline}. [In addition, to
create **chaos and panic**]{.underline}, [as well as erode a public's
trust in]{.underline} the [government]{.underline}'s ability to provide
safety [by demonstrating its helplessness]{.underline} -- a concept
known as 'strategy of tension' among right-wing extremists -- [is
thought to break the government's monopoly of force]{.underline} and
core political legitimacy.

Other research about right-wing extremism and terrorism has also shown,
that [an [overlap between]{.mark} violent activists from [the far-right
and **organized crime exists**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which means that
the [**[acquisition of WMDs]{.mark}** by these groups]{.underline} and
actors [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be]{.mark} used as
[significant]{.mark} tool to shift the power base]{.underline} in
extortion operations [towards]{.underline} what could become [right-wing
extremist crime syndicates]{.underline}. In Austria for example a
neo-Nazi group called 'Object 21' controlled large parts of the red
light milieu along the Austrian-German border through the use of
explosives, arson and attacks with butyric acid. In the United States,
neo-Nazi oriented networks such as the Aryan Brotherhood for example,
are deeply involved in drug trafficking. Highly militant and criminal
hybrid networks could have severe impact within the organized crime
world if they get their hands on CBRN weaponry, which is of course true
not only of far-right but also for other terrorists.

### Resilience is key

#### Resilience is key to ALL NATO objectives

**CCOE** 20**19** Civil-Military Cooperation Centre of Excellence (The
Hague), "Resilience through Civil Preparedness A CCOE Info Sheet"
https://www.cimic-coe.org/resources/fact-sheets/resilience-through-civil-preparedness.pdf,
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

What is Resilience?

[[Resilience has been defined as a society's ability to resist and
recover easily and quickly from a major shock]{.underline}]{.mark}, such
as natural disaster or an armed attack.1 Resilience is a combination of
Civil Preparedness and military capacity. [[Each NATO member state needs
to be resilient]{.underline}]{.mark} to major shocks. [[A resilient
country is less attractive as a target]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and
therefore]{.underline}]{.mark} contributes to the alliance's overall
security. Robust resilience through [[civil
preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark} in allied states [[is crucial to
NATO's collective security and defence]{.underline}]{.mark}. 2

What is Civil Preparedness?

Civil Preparedness is defined as all measures and means taken in
peacetime, by national and Allied agencies, to enable a nation to
survive an enemy attack and to contribute more effectively to the common
war effort3. Civil preparedness refers to the ability to sustain the
functions vital to society, ensuring basic supply for the population and
the State\'s capacity to act in a crisis situation. This also means that
the private sector in allied nations is ready to provide support to NATO
military operation.4 Civil preparedness is a central pillar of allies'
resilience and a critical enabler for alliance collective defence. 5
While civil preparedness remains a national responsibility, [[NATO can
support Allies in assessing and, upon request, enhancing their civil
preparedness6]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### NATO says yes

#### Individual cooperation spurs MMC capacity -- The FOC declaration proves they will say yes

Rico **Maderthoner**, 3-6-20**22**, Commander J.G. (OF-3) Germany Navy

\"Multinational Medical Coordination Centre/ European Medical Command is
operational,\" No Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022) FOC = Full
Operational Capability declaration

An intensive, demanding, but also common path

The Director of the MMC/EMC, Brigadier General Dr. Stefan Kowitz, also
briefly described once again \"the very busy and challenging path\" that
had been taken to get here. \"In the light of the current security
challenges, multinational cohesion is all the most important. [[The FOC
Declaration is a symbol of the will to cooperate and integrate the
medical services\"]{.underline}]{.mark}. This development process was
not only very sporting in terms of time, but also extraordinary in its
demands. Special challenges in the last two and a half years were the
creation of conceptual, infrastructural and organisational foundations,
the increase in personnel as well as the development of the Programme of
Work combined with the implementation of many demanding projects. In
addition, [[the **necessary** positioning of the MMCC/EMC in NATO and
the EU]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as the development of important
contacts and the establishment of a civil-military network under
difficult COVID 19 conditions [[was of vital
importance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Projects for EU, NATO and partner nations

The FOC Declaration is important in two respects: on the one hand, to
document what has been achieved and, on the other, to show what the
MMCC/EMC stands for. The Mission Statement states that the [[MMCC/EMC
focuses]{.underline}]{.mark} its activities [[on three main
areas]{.underline}]{.mark} for the benefit of the nations, NATO and the
EU: Preparation of operational [[engagements]{.underline}]{.mark},
Operational [[readiness of medical]{.underline}]{.mark} C3 and
organisations [[and Support]{.underline}]{.mark} of operational
engagements of the participating nations. This orientation sets a clear
framework and grants the necessary flexibility to react to new
developments.

Thus, the [[participating nations **benefit directly** from the
**projects**]{.underline}]{.mark} and developments [[of the
multinational coordination element]{.underline}]{.mark}. Projects are
commissioned and accompanied directly by the participating nations or by
NATO and the EU. As a multinational service provider, [[the innovative
cooperation project of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the EU is also
responsible for [[support]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[individual countries
in medical issues]{.underline}]{.mark} and acts here at the same time as
a civil-military link. Currently, representatives of seven nations work
together on a permanent basis in the MMCC/EMC. [[The United States has
established a liaison]{.underline}]{.mark} element.

Situation Centre and wargaming expertise are core competencies

In the field of wargaming, the MMCC/EMC has been able to establish
itself with numerous references as a permanent planning and advisory
element in the international network as a unique specialist. Likewise,
the established Situation Centre is the hub and interface for the
coordination services of the MMCC/EMC. [[By pooling **all** the
capabilities of the MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark} and its network of
experts, [[it is intended to respond **quickly**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
the needs of individual member nations or NATO and EU institutions.

Lighthouse project as a bridge between NATO and the EU

As an agile and flexible project-driven service, the [[MMCC/EMC is
always ready to fulfil missions for its partner
nations]{.underline}]{.mark} and for the responsible institutions of
NATO and the EU. [[Currently]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[MMCC/EMC is
acting]{.underline}]{.mark} as a link between civilian and military
services of the EU and NATO in the area of support [[for the evacuation
of Ukrainian wounded and sick]{.underline}]{.mark}. This lighthouse
project is intended to improve cooperation between the capabilities of
the NATO and EU medical services involved.

### Current MMCC isn't enough

#### Lack of MMCC resourcing is limiting cooperation now

Stefan Kowitz,\" No Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

Bricknell, Martin:

What do you think are the lessons for international military alliances
like NATO and the EU?

BG Kowitz:

As stated in the EU-NATO Joint Declaration (Warsaw, 8 July 2016), "our
security is interconnected and together a broad range of tools can be
mobilised to respond to the challenges we currently face, and make most
efficient use of scarce resources. A stronger NATO and a stronger EU are
mutually reinforcing. Together they can better provide security in
Europe and beyond." The leadership of NATO and the EU has requested the
cooperation of both organisations. [[NATO-EU cooperation will prevent a
duplication of efforts and offers a greater economy of scales in a
resource-strained environment. The medical community can be with the
MMCC/EMC at the forefront]{.underline}]{.mark} of NATO-EU cooperation.
The medical challenges, now and in the future, are requesting
coordination and the efficient use of our limited resources.

Bricknell, Martin:

Do you think there are any risks to military medical services arising
from the pandemic?

BG Kowitz:

[[As a result of]{.underline}]{.mark} the possible
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 global economic [[recession, the main
risk is **inadequate financial resources**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
armed forces and their medical services. Within the armed forces, we
have to emphasise how important the support of our military medical
services has been during the response to this crisis.

#### New steps help MMCC capacity

The NATO Centre of Excellence for Military Medicine (NATO
[[MILMED]{.underline}]{.mark} COE) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Multinational Medical Coordination Centre/ European Medical Command
([[MMCC]{.underline}]{.mark}/EMC -- more info at: Multinational Medical
Coordination Centre / European Medical Command (bundeswehr.de) ), [[are
combining their expertise]{.underline}]{.mark} and know-how to create a
unique training event for the benefit of NATO's medical realm.

The Main Planning Conference is a key milestone in the planning process
which was demonstrated by the attendance of 64 participants with
representatives from NATO and partner nations. During the main planning
conference in Budapest, planned by the NATO MILMED COE as host and
taking place from Oct. 20-2021 to Oct. 21-2021, both entities set the
framework and goals for next year\'s event. \"I am glad that the
conference, despite the large number of participants, 64 from NATO and
partner nations, worked smoothly and in accordance with the
specifications,\" said the Dutch planning officer of the NATO MILMED
COE, Lieutenant Colonel Jos Schepers.

A partnership where 1+1 makes more than 2.: In his opening remarks,
MILMED CoE Director Surgeon General Dr. Klagges reflected on the
Vigorous Warrior Exercise Series: "The exercise series date back to 2011
in Hungary with 5 participating Nations, expanded to 11 Nations by 2013
in Germany, 14 by 2015 in the Czech Republic, 26 by 2017 in Germany
again and in 2019 in Romania with 39 Nations and a considerable civilian
component making it the largest NATO medical exercise ever." Then he
further stated that while the pandemic affected planning, it also proved
to be an opportunity where a new format with new benefits could be
tested. He also said he was pleased \"that [[conducting a tabletop
exercise led us to look for partners]{.underline}]{.mark} who were
specifically knowledgeable about this format, and that we were able to
partner with the Military Medical Coordination Centre / European Medical
Command to host this event. There is no better example of synergy [[in
the NATO medical field]{.underline}]{.mark} than our partnership,
[[where 1+1 certainly makes more than 2]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

Patient Tracking and Management in the NATO Alliance Case.

From March 28-April 09, 2022, exercise participants will coordinate and
administratively manage patients and their transport from the time they
are wounded to their respective home countries in an alliance case
scenario under Article 5 of NATO\'s North Atlantic Treaty.

[[Core challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Col. Juergen
Muntenaar, MMCC/EMC deputy director for NATO affairs[[, will be the
systematic flow of patient tracking]{.underline}]{.mark} because \"the
systems and procedures were known 30 years ago. We as NATO are currently
in the process of rediscovering them.\"

Caring for our wounded is paramount

Surgeon General Dr. Kowitz, the director of the MMCC/EMC was equally
positive and focused: \"I am pleased that we can bring our wargaming
expertise to such a large exercise. But in the end, it\'s all about
improving processes and getting the best care for our wounded.\"

[[The **next step**]{.underline}]{.mark} in planning [[will be to
**further refine**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[individual exercise
sections]{.underline}]{.mark} that have been roughly outlined so far. In
renewed joint conferences in Budapest and Koblenz, the results of the
planning teams will be perfected by next April.

capabilities,\" No Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

More than just a tent

"[[This is not just about procuring medical
equipment]{.underline}]{.mark} such as respirators or surgical tables.
The [[medical capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} we are aiming for [[will
be built on the **interaction** of qualified personnel and
material]{.underline}]{.mark}. Developing a new medical capability takes
patience and commitment and it requires the relevant Georgian agencies
to assume responsibility for the various steps of development," said
Brigadier General (MC) Stefan Kowitz of the new, interesting challenge
for the Koblenz agency. During the visit to Georgia, the delegation was
able to visit the medical facilities and engage in conversation with
military medical personnel in charge.

Common understanding as a solid foundation for missions

The purpose of this exchange was to gain a common understanding of NATO
standards as a foundation for the joint development of a project plan
with the Georgian delegation. To Sergeant Jan M., who works in the
department of medical logistics and is an expert for medical material,
"[[**interoperability** and **joint** medical standards are absolutely
vital]{.underline}]{.mark}. They have proven their worth in the past."
He cites NATO missions as an example of this.

Intermediate objectives ensure progress

Individual stages and intermediate objectives of the initiative were
jointly determined during the visit. This approach will ensure and the
efficient buildup of capabilities and targeted support by the
[[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}, which the Georgian side welcomes, and
[[will drive the initiative forward]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Military Medical Capacity Development Initiative is part of the
extension of the existing Substantial NATO-Georgia Package (SNGP).

Its goal is [[to improve]{.underline}]{.mark} the defence and security
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} of Georgia, strengthen [[resilience
and]{.underline}]{.mark} improve [[interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}
with NATO.

Stockpiling of medical materiel

The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that [[stockpiling medical
materiel and supplies increases the response capability and resilience
of civilian and military health care systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under
the 2020 German EU Council Presidency, the Bundeswehr Medical Service
[[in cooperation with MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark} will develop modular
medical materiel packages to be stockpiled for employment [[during
outbreaks of infectious pathogens and epidemics. This concept is also
known as]{.underline}]{.mark} \"Military Modular Multipurpose
Epidemic/[[Pandemic Stockpiling]{.underline}]{.mark}\". Within the scope
of resupply, hence, rapid materiel support of military medical
facilities in theatre, in particular for EU Battle Group II/2020, can be
ensured. In a subsequent step, the different modular, rapidly usable
standard packages shall be further harmonised with the MMCC/EMC nations.

In line with Germany\'s role as Framework Nation for MMCC/EMC, the
Bundeswehr Medical Service [[will demonstrate]{.underline}]{.mark} - in
coordination with the 17 MMCC/EMC partner nations - that we have [[the
capability to act **jointly**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Plan's stockpiling vital to MMCC effectiveness

Quick response to epidemics and pandemics as the objective

During the first wave of COVID-19, the NATO\'s Euro-Atlantic Disaster
Response Coordination Centre ([[EADRCC]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[requested]{.underline}]{.mark} [[MMCC/EMC to
**develop**]{.underline}]{.mark} a concept on [[medical
**stockpiling**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which in a further step was
refined under the \"European Medical Cooperation 2.0\" during the German
EU Council Presidency. The aim is [[to be prepared more quickly and
effectively for]{.underline}]{.mark} epidemic or [[pandemic situations
in the future]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A calculator is the basis of stockpiling

The Military Modular Multipurpose Epidemic/Pandemic Stockpiling
([[M3-EPS]{.underline}]{.mark}) concept [[consists
of]{.underline}]{.mark} altogether [[seven modules]{.underline}]{.mark}
some of which are employed independently of each other, while some
others must be employed collectively. These rapidly usable standard
packages are [[to reinforce existing medical treatment
facilities]{.underline}]{.mark} or hospitals. Core of the concept is a
calculator that quickly and simply determines personnel, materiel and
storage area requirements as well as costs.

The projects have made visible many details, which will help to respond
better to pandemics in the future. MMCC/EMC will make its contribution
to this effect [[in order to support a coordinated, multinational
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}, be it in the NATO or EU context.

### Vaccine focus key to solvency

#### Both USA and vaccine focus are critical to solvency

Richard **Hatchett**, 6-29-2021, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovation, CEPI & former BARDA, acting director U.S.
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/cepi-20-critical-inflection-point, \"CEPI
2.0: A Critical Inflection Point,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-20-2022)

Richard Hatchett, M.D.: Well, I think there's basically three, you know,
areas that there's good alignment. I mean, [[there's good alignment
around the scientific agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}. I mean, our adoption
of the---you know, focusing on the prototype pathogens, you know, we've
drawn from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Barney Graham and colleagues [[at the Vaccine Research
Center]{.underline}]{.mark} have evolved that concept and, you know,
have promulgated it. And we think they're right. So the scientific
approach, there's already alignment. We're ready to work hand-in-hand
with the major science funding agencies within the U.S. to divide and
conquer what is a very big R&D agenda.

There's a political aspect, a political moment for the United States in
terms of sort of its return to multilateral efforts. And I think, you
know, [[this is a good opportunity for the U.S. to be
forward-looking]{.underline}]{.mark}, to, you know, take a progressive
and longer-term view, and to do that [[in a way that invites other
global partners]{.underline}]{.mark} to participate. And CEPI, as
a---you know, I mean, we aren't a country. We don't have a point of
view. We're just trying to solve one particular problem. And I think
it's a good way for the U.S. to join with the 25 or so other countries
that are supporting CEPI in a global effort around countermeasures
development for epidemic and pandemic threats.

And then finally, I think [[there's an argument from
self-interest]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is that [[if we see
future]{.underline}]{.mark} epidemic or [[pandemic
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the U.S. government has dual
responsibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. They have a responsibility [[to
their own population]{.underline}]{.mark}, obviously, that will always
be primary. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} CEPI I think offers an
opportunity for the U.S. to support [[international
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} and to [[support global
equity]{.underline}]{.mark} simultaneously and in parallel, as---in
future responses---as they're addressing the needs of the U.S.
population. So I think the value proposition that CEPI can bring in
terms of, you know, a partnership with the U.S. are, you know, operating
on multiple levels. And they're [[all align]{.underline}]{.mark}ed
[[with U.S. interests]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Vaccine funding includes delivery, requiring a global infrastructure

Julie **Gerberding**, 6-29-2021, co-chair of the **CSIS** commission and
executive vice president at Merck
https://www.csis.org/analysis/cepi-20-critical-inflection-point, \"CEPI
2.0: A Critical Inflection Point,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-20-2022)

Julie Gerberding, M.D.: Well, we do have to finish the job in front of
us. And I think everyone agrees that that has to happen. I think that
there are some pieces to this plan that are upstream from where CEPI's
focus is with the G7, and then there's some pieces that are downstream
from there. [[The upstream pieces are]{.underline}]{.mark} really
[[getting into a mindset]{.underline}]{.mark}, first of all, and then
applying our science and technology to better be able [[to predict where
spillovers will occur, and maybe preempt them]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Which is very different from mitigation once you have an outbreak and
it's beginning to propagate.

So how do we move upstream? [[That means]{.underline}]{.mark} improving
detection. It means [[using AI and geo-medicine tools to try to
understand the human, animal ecological interface]{.underline}]{.mark},
the one health kind of space here. There's a lot of science and a lot of
collaboration. And [[it goes missing because the funding mechanisms
don't address the intersection]{.underline}]{.mark} of that space. [[The
downstream piece that's missing has to do with the deployment of
vaccine]{.underline}]{.mark}. And we're seeing now that even [[in some
resource-limited]{.underline}]{.mark} [[environments where vaccines have
been delivered they can't be used because there is no infrastructure to
get the vaccine into the arms]{.underline}]{.mark} of the people who
need them. I mean, the world just doesn't have adult immunization
programs everywhere, like we do in the resource-rich countries.

So we've got to also deal with that, because even, in fact, in some
ways, in some environments we're already there, where [[the rate
limiting step isn't the number of doses. It's the
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, the people power, and the trust
necessary to get them utilized. And we have to solve both of the
extremes of the end-to-end. But the middle piece right now is job one,
because that's the here and now of this pandemic.

J. Stephen Morrison: Let's talk about the relationship with the United
States. [[There's a proposal for multiyear funding over a five-year
period, about a billion dollars]{.underline}]{.mark} in support [[over
those five years]{.underline}]{.mark}. There's a proposal for one of the
emergency allocations, for a chunk of that to go towards supporting your
efforts. There's the hope that there will be strong political and
technical partnership, that the United States will see CEPI as an
integral asset in its future engagement internationally. And these are
ideas that we've kicked around and been very supportive of.

### Solves Pandemics

#### Collective biosurveillance checks another pandemic

Preparedness Innovation, CEPI & former BARDA, acting director U.S.

https://www.csis.org/analysis/cepi-20-critical-inflection-point, \"CEPI
2.0: A Critical Inflection Point,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-20-2022)

Richard Hatchett, M.D.: Well, I think everyone in the world, frankly,
has now had this common experience with the pandemic. And it doesn't
matter where you are on the political spectrum, it doesn't matter,
frankly, where you are on the spectrum in terms of the different
interventions that we use. We've all been hugely impacted by the
pandemic. None of us ever wants to see another pandemic again.

My colleague in the Bush White House, and actually now a CEPI board
member, Rajeev Venkayya, has made the point that if we had in front of
us an opportunity for \$20 or \$30 billion, which is probably what a
global effort to accomplish the agenda that I talked about would cost
over five or 10 years---if we had that opportunity to, you know, stop
climate change, to---you know, to secure global temperatures below the
1.5 degree threshold, we would jump at that opportunity. And we would
jump at it collectively as the world.

[[We are going to have the technologies coming out of this pandemic to
respond rapidly in the future. We understand the bio-surveillance
requirements. We understand the need now for empowered public health to
respond rapidly when new diseases emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} there---and we know and see [[a pathway to
making definitive countermeasures like vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark} and
therapeutics [[much more rapidly than ever before]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And [[it comes at a]{.underline}]{.mark} significant cost, but a, you
know, [[microscopic cost compared to the risk of another
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And [[we can accomplish that goal much faster]{.underline}]{.mark}, much
more effectively, [[if we work at it collectively]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And I think an organization like CEPI, operating in the international
space, filling gaps, focused on equity, has an important role to play in
that collective solution. And I would hope that that opportunity would
appeal to everyone, whatever their experience, whatever, you know, their
potential political leanings or position.

#### NATO coordination enable dual use spillover

\"Next step towards interoperability,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-20-2022)

This milestone describes the starting point of the implementation
phase,\" says the director of the multinational element, Dr. Stefan
Kowitz, looking ahead to the steps ahead. [[The capabilities for the
brigades\' medical forces will be built up]{.underline}]{.mark}
gradually and in modules. Two lines of development are in the
foreground. Building up the personnel capabilities
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the appropriate training to operate [[a
highly mobile medical unit **as well as**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
necessary [[material supplements]{.underline}]{.mark} to enable a
treatment outcome in line with NATO and civilian requirements.

Civilian and military usability as a factor

\"According to our analysis, [[the capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} to
be built up in the future [[enable use **both** for military tasks but
also in crises]{.underline}]{.mark} or disasters [[to support the
civilian health system]{.underline}]{.mark}, so-called [[**dual-use**
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark},\" adds the MMCC/EMC director.

In her opening remarks, the Deputy Minister of Defence, Ms. Lela
Chikovani, also honoured the \"dedicated and hard work\" and the joint
team effort of the Georgian Medical Service and the MMCC/EMC delegation.
She also mentioned additional cooperation opportunities with the EU. The
possible [[**harmonisation** of NATO **and EU** activities, is not a
difficulty for the **MMCC/EMC**, as it closely cooperates and
collaborates with both]{.underline}]{.mark} institutions according to
its mission.

Familiarisation with and practice in the NATO structure

Knowledge and understanding of NATO standards form the foundation for
the development of the respective medical service capabilities of the
Georgian armed forces. Following the kick-off of the implementation
phase, a training team from the MMCC/EMC relocated to Georgia.
\"[[Working]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[new knowledge **into** existing
structures]{.underline}]{.mark} in a guided environment and adjusting it
for one\'s own system generally [[has a **far greater effect** than just
imparting knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} would have.\" This is how
Colonel Jürgen Muntenaar, head of the training team and MMCC/EMC deputy
director for NATO affairs, describes his training method.

Rescue chain: focus on communication and transport

During the training, the exercise participants not only learned about
NATO structures, standardisation documents and terminology, but also
applied their knowledge in a table-top exercise. In this exercise, the
medical care of sick and wounded people was practised along the rescue
chain. As a member of the [[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark} team,
Oberstabsbootsmann Stefanie Hippler also
[[supported]{.underline}]{.mark} the Georgian comrades and saw \"[[the

[[A military alliance such as NATO is not a first responder in a health
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, as most tasks must be implemented at the
domestic level. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, given [[the impact and
the spillover effects]{.underline}]{.mark} of COVID-19
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the very [[day-to-day operations of the
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} --- military personnel are not immune from
viruses --- as well as on supply chains, and economies and societies
around the world, [[it was paramount for NATO to take
**initiative**]{.underline}]{.mark} both to protect its member states
against malign actors [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[offer crucial
support in the spirit of solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In spite of these successful initiatives, the Operations Division of
[[NATO headquarters]{.underline}]{.mark} in Brussels has
[[admitted]{.underline}]{.mark}64 that [[the alliance was ill-prepared
to handle such a crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Rittimann noted, the
alliance lacked its own means and political bandwidth to do more.65 For
this reason, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its member states [[should
not miss the opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the COVID-19 crisis
offers to set up more structured plans to ensure readiness in crisis
management]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, they should expand the
concept of security [[to include]{.underline}]{.mark} the most pressing
non-military [[global security threats: climate change, health risks,

Command,\" No Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

Task of the Multinational Medical Coordination Centre / European Medical
Command ([[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is to provide coordinating
support]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to the medical services of NATO and
EU]{.underline}]{.mark}. The experience made in the management of
large-scale medical emergencies or the Ebola crisis has shown that the
[[interdependencies between public health]{.underline}]{.mark}
protection [[and external and internal security are
increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}. A future core task of MMCC/EMC will be
civil-military cooperation, in particular with the organisations and
institutions of the EU nations and establishments. MMCC/EMC supports in
the provision and assessment of the medical situation picture for NATO
and EU, which is jointly developed with the nations and NATO/EU
organisations.

The task spectrum covered ranges from cross-border crisis management to
collective and national defence. [[A particular focus is on
CBRN]{.underline}]{.mark} \[chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear\] [[medical defence and]{.underline}]{.mark} on the coordination
of strategic, supra-national medical [[evacuation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

On the Way to Multinationality

[[None of the nations is capable of ensuring]{.underline}]{.mark} the
provision of [[all facets of medical support]{.underline}]{.mark}
required for a NATO- or EU-led operation [[on its own. This is
**why**]{.underline}]{.mark} in autumn 2018 the [[Surgeon Generals
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Medical Services of [[NATO and EU called for
an additional coordinating medical organisation]{.underline}]{.mark} as
an urgent necessity. On 4 September 2019, the 14 member states during a
solemn ceremony signed initial operational capability (IOC) of MMCC/EMC.
Most recently, during the COMEDS Plenary held in Brussels in late
November 2019, the Slovak Republic signed the IOC declaration. By
mid-2020, three more states, Poland, Lithuania and Spain, joined the
MMCCMultinational Medical Coordination Centre/EMCEuropean Medical
Command project.

One of the goals is [[to increase operational readiness and
interoperability of our military medical services through common
standards, combined planning and cooperative
procurement]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Solves quickly

#### NATO coordination solves fast -- MMCC wargaming exercises prove

\"Largest planning game of the medical services,\" No Publication
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

The Multinational Medical Coordination Centre/European Medical Command
([[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}) in Koblenz and the NATO Centre of
Excellence for Military Medicine (NATO MILMED COE) in Budapest shared
the success of the [[wargaming]{.underline}]{.mark} exercise, which
[[focused on medical care]{.underline}]{.mark} and wound
[[transport]{.underline}]{.mark} in the context of national and alliance
defence.

From 02 April to 08 April 2022, the international wargaming took place
in Balatonakarattya, Hungary, with a total of 144 military and civilian
participants from 23 nations.

In addition, the Koblenzers were linked in as support with their
Situation Centre and ensured the connection to the national military
patient evacuation centres in Rome (Italy), Zeist (Netherlands) and
Koblenz.

Difficult conditions for planning

[[There were particular challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} in preparing for
the exercise: a comparatively [[short preparation
time]{.underline}]{.mark} of nine months, the challenges to EU and NATO
medical services caused by the COVID pandemic and the Russian attack on
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[reduced]{.underline}]{.mark} number of [[planning]{.underline}]{.mark}
conferences to prepare for the exercise. \"[[Despite
this]{.underline}]{.mark} difficult situation, the exercise [[planning
was successful]{.underline}]{.mark}; a lot was just done over the
internet,\" said the head of the planning team, Lieutenant Colonel
Andreas G.

The MMCC/EMC contributed its wargaming expertise to the exercise and was
responsible for developing the exercise scenario and vignettes as well
as the overall exercise control.

Exchange was in the foreground

During the wargaming, the participants had the opportunity for personal
interaction in their respective planning sections and spaces - on a
tactical and operational level. After two years of COVID pandemic
restrictions, this was a great advantage for all participants. Lively
discussions enriched with the experiences and skills of the experts from
the different countries led to creative approaches and to overcoming the
challenges.

Two successful exercises - one business game

[[By combining]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}
VIGOROUS WARRIOR and CASUALTY MOVE 22 (VW-CAMO 22) into one joint
planning simulation, the management of multinational patient flows
[[across different command levels]{.underline}]{.mark} of a large joint
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} operation was practised and analysed.

The VIGOROUS WARRIOR portion of the NATO MILMED COE focused on patient
care at the tactical level in the brigade and division areas. The
MMCC/EMC CASUALTY MOVE exercise focused on coordinating the flow of
patients at the operational level above the divisions back to the home
countries.

Initial findings and potential

\"The VW22-CAMO22 [[wargaming was a success]{.underline}]{.mark} at all
levels [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the main objectives of the exercise
were achieved. Considering the complexity of the exercise - the
operational level was combined with the tactical level - all
participants were challenged in this multinational exercise and were
able to take important experiences back to their home locations.\" says
the Director of the MMCC/EMC, Surgeon General Dr Stefan Kowitz,
expressing his satisfaction with the initial results of the wargaming
exercise.

The exercise and the extensive accompanying discussions
[[provided]{.underline}]{.mark} extremely [[useful input
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[further development of
concepts]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. Medical Task Force Principle for
Brigade), guidelines (e.g. SHAPE Patient Flow Guideline) and
standardisation documents (e.g. MEDEVAC-STANAGStandardization
Agreement).

Thus, the Koblenz-based company intends to incorporate the knowledge
gained and the resulting work packages into its portfolio in order to
improve and refine existing concepts.

### Expands coordination beyond NATO

#### NATO leadership is vital to civil preparedness and thus resilience

**NATO**, 7-9-20**16**, North Atlantic Treaty Organization,

\"Commitment to enhance resilience,\" Issued by the Heads of State and
Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in
Warsaw, 8-9 July 2016 (ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

We now face a broader and evolving range of military and non-military
security challenges, which is the context for the Alliance's long term
adaptation. [[Being resilient]{.underline}]{.mark} against these
challenges [[requires Allies to maintain and protect critical civilian
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, alongside and in support of military
capabilities, and to work across the whole of government and with the
private sector. [[It also requires the Alliance to continue to
engage]{.underline}]{.mark}, as appropriate, with [[international
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly the European Union, and with
partners.

To complement and enable our military capabilities, we will continue to
improve [[civil preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Noting that civil
preparedness is above all a national responsibility, we will strive to
achieve the agreed requirements for national resilience. We will protect
our populations and territory by strengthening continuity of government,
continuity of essential services and security of critical civilian
infrastructure; and we will work to ensure that our national and NATO
military forces can at all times be adequately supported with civilian
resources, including energy, transportation, and communications. This
[[will include NATO support to assess and, upon request, facilitate
national progress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In paragraph 83 of the 2016 NATO Warsaw Summit Communiqué, it is stated
that "[[NATO will continue to pursue cooperative security through

Together with representatives of its member nations, final arrangements
were made during the two-day online conference regarding the process and
the coordination tasks to be performed by the
[[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}. The MMCC/EMC will cooperate with
military and civilian services of the EU and NATO.

In November, the MMCC/EMC will demonstrate that it [[can support and
relieve]{.underline}]{.mark} its member nation[[s as well as NATO and
the EU]{.mark} [by]{.mark}]{.underline} performing
[[coordination]{.underline}]{.mark} tasks in the supranational
environment.

Multinational evaluation team provides evidence

A multinational evaluation team from the member nations of the MMCC/EMC
will assess the development of the MMCC/EMC over the past two years on
the basis of evaluation criteria. This includes the core capability of
the MMCC/EMC to act as a NATO and EU coordinating element. The REMI 2021
evaluation exercise is an important instrument for this. For this
purpose, the Koblenz team will run through the various processes of
medical crisis response with the participating nations and the
responsible EU/NATO institutions in the hybrid exercise conducted in
November 2021.

The exercise will focus on civil-military cooperation in the context of
cross-border crisis management, in particular with NATO and EU
organisations and institutions, but mainly with the member nations of
the MMCC/EMC. [[Fields of work]{.underline}]{.mark} and topics include:
[[medical protection against biological threats and coordination
of]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic, supranational wounded and sick
[[transport]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\"During the three days during exercise REMI 21, tasks will be performed
individually, interlinked or building on each other, thus highlighting
the various coordination and support services of the MMCC/EMC,\" says
Surgeon General Dr Stefan Kowitz, Director of the MMCC/EMC, looking
ahead to the upcoming event.

Situation Centre as a tool

The MMCC/EMC uses the Situation Centre as a tool for this. If the
complexity of a task requires the involvement of several MMCC/EMC
departments or if the fulfilment of the task is very time-critical, the
Situation Centre is activated. By pooling all the capabilities of the
MMCC/EMC and its network of experts, the aim is [[to react quickly
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the needs of individual member nations or NATO
and EU institutions.

During the REMI, possible medical crises or incidents, some of which may
involve supranational hazards, are simulated at various locations on the
European continent together with the respective nations. In doing so,
the MMCC/EMC tries to provide the affected nations with appropriate
stakeholders or service providers through its coordinative capabilities
and expert network. Examples of such crises are accidents with increased
numbers of casualties or [[outbreaks of transmissible
pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In addition to the final work for the exercise, which is considered an
important milestone for the full operational readiness of the MMCC/EMC,
planning is already underway in the background for Exercise Vigorous
Warrior/Casualty Move 22 (VW/CAMO 22). This exercise is being developed
jointly with the Center of Excellence for Military Medicine (MilMedCOE),
which supports the transformation of NATO\'s medical services. The
[[MMCC/EMC is making its extensive wargaming expertise
available]{.underline}]{.mark} for exercise VW/CAMO 22.

Previously, there were two different approaches to the cooperation
between the military medical services of NATO and EU. On 3 September
2019, the most senior representatives of the medical services from 14
nations signed a declaration aimed at combining both approaches.

The declaration of Initial Operational Capability (IOC), of the
Multinational Medical Coordination Centre/European Medical Command
(MMCC/EMC) marked the actual go-ahead of cooperation. \"The event is so
important because with their signature the most senior representatives
of the medical services document their attachment and commitment to this
important project of the medical services of NATO and EU\", said
Brigadier, Medical Corps, Dr Stefan Kowitz, Director MMCC/EMC.

MMCC/EMC

[[MMCC/EMC serves as connecting link between NATO and
EU]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since its setup in December 2017, the
multinational centre has been tasked with coordinating the medical
capabilities of the different nations. Also, the [[different
requirements on medical operational forces must be harmonised in
accordance with NATO, EU and UN]{.underline}]{.mark}United Nations
[[mandates]{.underline}]{.mark} so as to be able to be equally ready for
all mandates. In the future, MMCC/EMC will also offer services in the
fields of patient flow management and medical logistics.

Round table

Although the \"round table\" in the \"Kuppelsaal\" (domed hall) of
Ehrenbreitstein Fortress was rectangular, it definitely had a signalling
effect. The participating nations shall fill with life the MMCC/EMC
located in Koblenz as equal partners. Beside the German elements, the
multinational element of MMCC/EMC so far consists of a Dutch and a
Norwegian liaison officer, a French liaison officer will join in the
course of 2020. After achieving Initial Operational Capability, the
build-up of MMCC/EMC will continue by the assignment of further liaison
officers of the participating nations.

Formal confirmation

In a military ceremony performed at the Koblenz Rhine Barracks on 4
September, IOC was formally confirmed and declared in the presence of
the representatives of the 14 participating nations and numerous guests.
Witnessed by the representatives of the participating medical services,
the Deputy Surgeon General of the Bundeswehr, Major General, Medical
Corps, Dr Stephan Schoeps declared Initial Operational Capability of the
MMCC/EMC. Subsequently, the Chief Mayor of the city of Koblenz also
addressed the multinational representatives and visitors to the
ceremony.

Together we are strong

The presence of the most senior representatives of the participating
nations underlines the significance of this project. 90% of the EU
citizens are living in a country that is member to NATO. Major General,
Medical Corps, Dr Stephan Schoeps concluded by underlining the
significance of the MMCC/EMC, saying that [[the resulting collective
security needs require the promotion of interoperability between these
states]{.underline}]{.mark}, for \"together we are strong\".

for the assignment of a United States Army Europe and Africa
(USAREUR-AF) Liaison Officer to MMCC/EMC in Koblenz. Brigadier General
Mark Thompson, USAREUR-AF Command Surgeon General and functional
superior to Colonel Wieman, spoke of an important and future-oriented
step. He considers the MMCC/EMC as an important partner for the future
of the Theatre Medical Command Europe.

exchange and assistance

The agreement furthers closer cooperation between the two entities.
Initially limited for one year, an officer of the US Army Medical
Service is available once a week as a liaison person and direct link
between both sides. The goal is to take advantage of multinational
resource management opportunities by improving information sharing.
Another focus is on developing standardized medical approaches [[to
promote multilateral, civil-military cooperation
with]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[medical actors]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\"We are very happy about this strong connection that has grown for
decades and the good camaraderie between our nations and the medical
services on which we will continue to build our future cooperation\"
said the director of the MMCC/EMC, Surgeon General Dr. Stefan Kowitz. He
has a long-standing personal connection with the respective USAREUR-AF
Command Surgeons, who also hold the position of Commanding General of
the Regional Health Command Europe.

[[The focus]{.underline}]{.mark} of the intensified form of cooperation
[[is on information exchange and harmonization]{.underline}]{.mark} for
the development of a detailed, shared medical situation assessment
within Europe. In addition, the MMCC/EMC will be supported in the
participation of multinational exercises and conferences, planning and
coordination of projects. In return, the
[[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its network of

MMCC/EMC.

Practise complementary and coordinated cooperation here

The clear definition of the main tasks of both organisations enables to
make effective use of resources. Core task of MMCC/EMC is the medical
cooperation with SHAPE and its subordinate commands at operational
level. [[These activities are supplemented]{.underline}]{.mark} by the
improvement of civil-military cooperation and [[Medical Service
**resilience**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

MMCC/EMC and NATO MILMED COE will continue to harmonise their work
programme to avoid duplication of effort. Both organisations have agreed
on regular coordination meetings on a quarterly basis.

From 23 to 27 November 2020, the Multinational Medical Coordination
Centre / European Medical Command ([[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}) in
Koblenz conducted the exercise Resilient Response 2020 (RERE 20).
Fifteen nations had enrolled for the war game. Owed to the current
Corona situation, this exercise was carried out only online.

All of the more than 70 participants in exercise RERE 20 agreed that
communication is the key to success. During the three-day war game,
representatives of international armed forces and authorities
[[simulated]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[strategies and
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the event of an epidemic/pandemic
situation and exercised different responses to the outbreak of a highly
contagious virus disease.

For more than seven months, the military personnel of MMCC/EMC in
Koblenz had prepared the pandemic simulation exercise in cooperation
with the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats
(Hybrid CoE) in Helsinki and the Federal Office of Civil Protection and
Disaster Assistance. Coordinator on the part of the Federal Office of
Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance was Dr Martin Weber who at the
same time acted as Lead Facilitator of the exercise. In this function,
he briefed the players on the scenario at the beginning of the
respective round of the game. In one round for instance, this was the
approach to phenomena of a second wave of infection.

Corona-Pandemic challlenges

The fact that owing to the current quarantine and travel restrictions
most of the exercise had to be carried out online faced the organisers
with additional challenges. In order to enable a smooth exchange between
the players, a complex IT infrastructure was temporarily installed at
MMCC/EMC, and more than 100 virtual chatrooms were established at short
notice.

\"After months of preparation and under the given, adverse conditions,
it is great to see how our war game is filled with life by the
players,\" said Lieutenant Colonel, Pharmacy Corps, Ronnie Michel. As
Exercise Director and responsible developer of the exercise RERE 20, he
was enthousiastic about the commitment and the creativity of the 15
nations enrolled for the exercise.

Complexes instructions

To make the simulation as realistic as possible for the participants,
MMCC/EMC developed complex models simulating the course of a virus
epidemic. During the war game, data were updated continuously based on
the decisions made by the players. \"The days of the exercise were a
challenge for my team\", said Lieutenant Colonel (Medical Corps) Dr
Maren Kosak, Head of the Medical Situational Awareness / Civil-military
Interface Branch at MMCC/EMC. In her function as head of the simulation
cell she was responsible for the data base of the war game. \"At the end
of each action phase, within a very short time key figures on the
development of the pandemic, the economic situation, and also on the
mood among the population had to be calculated on the basis of the
decisions made by the participants and re-transmitted to the
countries.\"

Additional hybrid threats

In the course of the four rounds [[between the initial
outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark} of the novel disease [[and availability
and distribution of a vaccine]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[participants
had to deal not only with]{.underline}]{.mark} the occurrence and course
of [[the infection and]{.underline}]{.mark} its impact on the
[[economy]{.underline}]{.mark} and the mood of their respective nations.
Various [[hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark} introduced by the members
of the Hybrid CoE unexpe[[ctedly provided additional
depth]{.underline}]{.mark} to the game.

While in one country prominent personalities doubted the dangerous
nature of the virus and, thus, irritated the population, [[cyber
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} in other countries
[[brought]{.underline}]{.mark} important clinics and [[research
facilities to a standstill]{.underline}]{.mark}. Also [[these challenges
were swiftly overcome by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[close
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} of the participants. \"The war game
offered a great opportunity to bring home to the participating nations
the complexity of a coordinated response to the pandemic\", said Shiho
Rybski, Director for Training and Exercises at Hybrid CoE, with
satisfaction.

The framework has been set since February. During a structured planning
conference carried out per VTC from 26 to 28 April, the planning team
around Lieutenant Colonel Andreas Godau and the participants filled with
life the scenario already introduced in February. \"One of the [[future
core tasks]{.underline}]{.mark} of MMCC/EMC [[will be civil-military
cooperation in cross-border]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis
[[management]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular with the organisations
and institutions of NATO and the EU nations and establishments.\" With
these words, the Director MMCC/EMC, Brigadier Dr Stefan Kowitz, at the
same time describes the framework of the exercise.

Together with its member nations, MMCC/EMC as coordination element of
NATO and EU will demonstrate its capabilities. In November 2021, the
MMCC/EMC team in Koblenz to this end will play through and test the
different processes [[of medical crisis response]{.underline}]{.mark}
with the participating nations and the responsible EU/NATO
establishments during the exercise that will be a hybrid one. During the
three days of exercise REMI 21, the coordination and support services of
MMCC/EMC will be examined by means of various individual tasks to be
accomplished.

Certification for an emergency

[[Events]{.underline}]{.mark} of different levels of intensity will be
[[simulated]{.underline}]{.mark} for the respective individual tasks,
either individually, or in an interconnected or progressive fashion. The
range [[will extend from]{.underline}]{.mark} responding to the
dissemination of [[a biological agent to]{.underline}]{.mark} disaster
assistance in the event of an earthquake. \"For us, a particular focus
lies on the issue of [[medical protection against nuclear, biological
and chemical threats]{.underline}]{.mark} (CBRNchemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear medical defence) and the coordination of strategic
medical evacuation,\" the Director MMCC/EMC elaborates on the numerous
tasks of his organisation.

The aim is multinational cooperation and the identification of potential

The main focus of the exercise will be on the cooperation with the
numerous civilian and military points of contact from the meanwhile wide
international network. The aim, however, will also be to identify
potential that still exists [[to enhance]{.underline}]{.mark} and
improve the portfolio of the multinational hub for [[medical
civil-military cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} and expertise.

#### MMCC biosensor leadership key to telehealth

\"Multinational Workshop on Biosensor Technology,\" No Publication
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

Biosensors Supporting Healthcare in Missions will be the central theme
of the virtual event, during which [[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark} --
together with the Committee of the Chiefs of Military Medical Services
in NATO (COMEDS) and international [[stakeholders
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the fields of telehealth and [[biosensor
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology -- will combine military and civilian
expertise with the latest scientific developments.

More than 80 participants from 14 nations

The wide range of international participants from science and the armed
forces enrolled for this event gives reason to expect an interesting and
multifaceted programme around the core points \"fitness for duty\",
\"biosensor technology in support of health and medicine\", and
potential \"guidelines and limits in the use of biosensors\". MMCC/EMC
[[has been able to win over]{.underline}]{.mark} leading [[military
officers and scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} from the fields of biology,
physics, medicine, cyber and IT, sports and health to identify common
new fields of action and, thus, lay the foundation for future
international projects and high-quality results. MMCC/EMC, thus, breaks
new ground in this rapidly growing subject area. [[**Synergy** effects
can be exploited]{.underline}]{.mark} and parallel developments reduced.

The aim is to support health care on operations

The advantages of using portable Biosensors Supporting Healthcare in
Missions have continuously increased in recent years. Several solutions
are on the brink of being implemented by the military medical services
of several nations.

[[By bringing together]{.underline}]{.mark} leading
[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark} from the bio-sensor technology field,
[[MMCC/EMC as a hub]{.underline}]{.mark} for civil-military medical
expertise [[will make a contribution to]{.underline}]{.mark}
establishing a community of interest (COI) in the field of
[[telehealth]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to identifying common fields of
activity and future projects with participating nations.

### Solves via buzzwords

#### MMCC solves past NATO via Framework Nations Concept

The Multinational Medical Coordination Centre/European Medical Command
([[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}) has been tasked with the coordination
of the multinational medical contributions of the NATO Response Force
Land 2022-2024.

As one of the framework nations, Germany will provide the brigade of the
NRF Land in 2023 again. Altogether eight nations will participate in
this major unit. The threads for the various multinational medical
portions come together in Koblenz. The lead nation has tasked MMCC/EMC
to head the Multinational Medical Working Group (steering element to
coordinate the multinational medical forces) for the NRF brigade. The
brigade constitutes the spearhead of the NRF.

Concept for the development of medical capabilities

Initial focus of efforts is the conceptual buildup of the multinational
medical forces. In this process, it is determined by consensus which
nation can make which medical contribution to the NATO brigade. \"These
[[contribution]{.underline}]{.mark}s range from the commitment of
materiel through to individual posts,\" says Lieutenant Colonel Stephan
Wüsthoff, head of the multinational planning body. He admits, \"Planning
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} much easier [[when]{.underline}]{.mark}
representatives of the [[participating nations are **permanently** on
site]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[as is]{.underline}]{.mark} the case at
[[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}\".

Quick finalisation an early and lasting success

The buildup of forces was followed by the development of the
multinational medical concept. This comprehensive concept, which
describes the medical procedures, responsibilities and collaboration
relationships, meanwhile is in the process of being staffed by the
troop-contributing nations of the brigade. This quick development of the
concept can be assessed as a success for the nations and
[[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}. The head of the planning group is sure
\"that this concept [[will serve as a blueprint for
other]{.underline}]{.mark} nations and [[medical]{.underline}]{.mark}
lead [[units]{.underline}]{.mark} in the future\". \"Our goal, of
course, is to simultaneously develop a data base for this kind of
documents to preserve the expertise for future provisions of materiel
and forces for NRF\", he refers to the result of his efforts.

MMCC/EMC as multinational coordination element

According to the Framework Nations Concept, it is also possible for
other NATO partner nations [[to have MMCC/EMC carry
out]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[coordination]{.underline}]{.mark} tasks
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the medical service parts of the provision of
NATO forces. \"This coordinating function can also be used for the
medical forces of the EU Battle Group, the military crisis response
forces of the European Union. Here, too, we have contributed our
experience and skills,\" says the Director MMCC/EMC, Brigadier, Medical
Corps, Dr Stefan Kowitz with a view to the tasks of his organisation.

Germany as Framework Nation for the spearhead of NATO

Together with the Netherlands and Norway, Germany - all three forming
the Lead Nation Group - will provide the lead unit for NRF(L) 2022
-2024. The focus, here, will be the buildup of the Very High Readiness
Joint Task Force Land 2023 (VJTFVery High Readiness Joint Task Force(L))
as part of [[the NATO Response Force]{.underline}]{.mark}. This rapidly
deployable force was initiated at the Wales NATO Summit in 2014.

#### MMCC cooperation facilitates PESCO

Brigadier, Medical Corps, Dr Stefan Kowitz answers the questions of the
European Parliament on the European Medical Command, one of the first
PESCO (Permanent Structured Cooperation) Projects.

On 25 February 2021, the Director of the Multinational Medical
Coordination Centre / European Medical Command
([[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}), Brigadier, Medical Corps, Dr Stefan
Kowitz, briefed the Subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE) of the
European Parliament on the [[setup of]{.underline}]{.mark} this new
multinational organisation. He explained the roots of the organisation
originating from NATO and EU initiatives, for both of which Germany is
the framework nation. One of the projects is the so-called Permanent
Structured Cooperation ([[PESCO]{.underline}]{.mark}) with the European
Medical Command. PESCO is [[one of the most important defence
initiatives of the EU]{.underline}]{.mark}. Therefore, the members of
the European Parliament were interested in getting an overview on the
development and progress of MMCC/EMC and on the integration of the PESCO
project into MMCC/EMC. Task of MMCC/EMC is to support the medical
services of NATO and the EU. The experiences made in the management of
[[large-scale medical emergencies]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Ebola crisis
and the COVID-19 pandemic [[have shown]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
[[interdependencies between public health protection and external and
internal security are increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Multinational network as a hub for medical expertise

\"In our unique position, we, the Multinational Medical Coordination
Centre/European Medical Command, build bridges between civilian and
military medical expertise and stakeholders of NATO and the EU as well
as their nations and institutions. We are a coordinating body for
military and civilian medical interoperability and the operational
readiness of medical forces\", the Director of MMCC/EMC outlined the
core mission. As demonstrated in the current COVID-19 crisis, the
[[military medical services]{.underline}]{.mark} make an important
contribution to coping with the pandemic, but [[serve
as]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[last reserve beside the civilian
main force. An essential factor for]{.underline}]{.mark} cooperation and
the development of a civil-military multinational medical network
concept, [[procurement, stockpiling and disaster
relief]{.underline}]{.mark} exercises [[must be **harmonised**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} be [[mutually
complementary]{.underline}]{.mark} between the civilian and military
medical services and forces wherever possible and useful. This way,
improvement of the common multinational medical resilience is achieved.
In this context, Brigadier Dr Kowitz mentioned DG ECHO
(Directorate-General European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid
Operations) and DG SANTE (Directorate-General for Health and Food
Safety) as EU institutions and important points of contact for the
common development of future holistic concepts.

Tangible successes during the setup

In his briefing, Dr Kowitz could also report on initial successes. For
instance, MMCC/EMC developed a stockpiling system for NATO and then
extended it into a modular concept (\"M3-EPS\") for the reinforcement of
medical treatment facilities with these modules. The aim is to be
prepared more quickly and effectively for epidemic or pandemic
situations, for instance by increasing intensive care capacities. The
Bundeswehr applied the principle of such a medical augmentation element
for intensive care units for its bilateral support in Portugal.

Another focus is the wargaming conducted at
[[MMCC/EMC]{.underline}]{.mark}. In close cooperation with the European
Centre of Excellence [[for Countering Hybrid
Threats]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hybrid CoE) and the Federal Office of
Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance, MMCC/EMC hosted a war game
[[with a pandemic focus]{.underline}]{.mark} in Koblenz from 23 to 27
November 2020 (\"Resilient Response 2020\"). Exercise Resilient Response
2020 offered the opportunity [[to train necessary
decision-making]{.underline}]{.mark} processes developing
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the course of the different phases of a
pandemic.

[[Functionality, interoperability, and efficiency]{.underline}]{.mark}

Central elements of the work done at MMCC/EMC are the development of a
medical situation picture for Europe and increasing interoperability
through the further harmonisation of national medical standards. This
work is supported essentially by the medical standards already
applicable in the EU.

This year, an important highlight of MMCC/EMC\'s efforts will be a
virtual expert meeting in late May on the use of biosensors and
telemedicine within the scope of medical support. MMCC/EMC offers itself
for bringing together national and international experts and for
contributing to pooling the wide range of activities. In addition,
potential ethical questions and requirements of the regulation on
medical equipment associated with the use of this technology shall be
analysed within the scope of this workshop.

#### STO research leadership key to NATO cred

\"NATO Science and Technology Organization,\" NATO (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-23-2022) NATO [Science and Technology Organization
(STO]{.underline})

Main tasks and responsibilities

The [[STO generates and exploits a leading-edge science and technology
programme]{.underline}]{.mark} of work, [[delivering timely
results]{.underline}]{.mark} and advice [[that advance the defence
capabilities of Allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, partners and NATO [[in
support of]{.underline}]{.mark} the core tasks of [[collective defence,
crisis management and cooperative security]{.underline}]{.mark}.

It also supports decisions made at both national and NATO level by
providing advice to the North Atlantic Council and national leadership.

The STO achieves its mission [[by nurturing a community of more than
**6,000** actively engaged scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}. The STO
network draws upon the expertise of more than 200,000 people in Allied
and partner nations.

Structure

The STO is governed by the NATO Science and Technology Board (STB). The
Board administers the STO's scientific and technical committees and its
three executive bodies: the Centre for Maritime Research and
Experimentation (CMRE) in La Spezia, Italy; the Collaboration Support
Office in Paris, France; and the Office of the Chief Scientist at NATO
Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

The Chief Scientist is the chairman of the STB and the senior science
advisor to the North Atlantic Council.

The scientific and technical committees, composed of members from
national and NATO bodies, direct and execute NATO's collaborative
science and technology activities.

The CMRE organises and conducts scientific research and technology
development, centred on the maritime domain, delivering innovative
solutions to address the Alliance's defence and security needs.

The CMRE conducts hands-on scientific and engineering research for the
direct benefit of both NATO and such customers as research entities and
industry. [[The Centre operates NATO's two research vessels that enable
science and technology solutions to be explored and developed at
sea]{.underline}]{.mark}. This allows unique and specialised research to
be conducted in core areas of interest for NATO. The [[CMRE's
engineering capability enables rapid exploitation of concept
prototypes]{.underline}]{.mark} for use in trials and military
experiments. The Centre also has a scientific and engineering knowledge
base composed of a dedicated science platform and publications, [[for
use **across** NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Evolution

[[To safeguard Alliance freedom]{.underline}]{.mark} and shared values,
[[it is]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}
importance [[for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its partner nations [[to
maintain the edge in defence and security]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Discovering, developing and utilising advanced knowledge and
cutting‑edge science and technology is fundamental to maintaining the
technological edge that has enabled Alliance forces to succeed [[across
the full spectrum of operations]{.underline}]{.mark} over the past
decades.

The STO was created through the amalgamation of the Research and
Technology Organization and the NATO Undersea Research Centre. These
bodies were brought together following a decision at the 2010 NATO
Summit in Lisbon to reform the NATO agency structure.

[[The STO]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with its predecessor
organisations, [[has been instrumental in enabling that
success]{.underline}]{.mark}, both within the nations and for NATO
itself.

By providing a critical venue for knowledge development and delivery,
the STO remains committed to its foundational principle: bringing
together subject matter experts from across the scientific spectrum with
military end users in order to inform decision‑makers on emerging
challenges and opportunities, and [[to ensure the technological
advantage of the Alliance and its partners]{.underline}]{.mark}.

(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

Worldwide collaboration

[[Under **normal** circumstances, making a vaccine can take up to
**10--15 years**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is [[because of the
**complexity**]{.underline}]{.mark} of vaccine development.

Dr. Michael Parry, the chair of infectious diseases at Stamford Health
in Stamford, CT, told MNT that [[vaccines train our immune system to
remember an infectious agent without us having to contract
it]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"Traditionally, they have contained weakened or inactivated parts of a
particular virus (antigen) to trigger an immune response within the
body. These vaccines will prompt the immune system to respond, much as
it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen."

However, [[amid a global pandemic, time was a luxury the world **could
not afford**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Researchers quickly mobilized to
share their coronavirus data with other scientists.

Dr. Yager said that [[thanks to advances in **genomic
sequencing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, researchers successfully [[uncovered
the viral sequence]{.underline}]{.mark} of SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020
--- [[roughly 10 days after the first reported]{.underline}]{.mark}

3\. Governing Dual-Use Biotechnology Based on Experimentalist Governance
Model

3.1. Experimentalist Governance Framework

The risk of [[information asymmetry]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[lack of
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} of risks of abuse associated with
research \[36\], [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[unpredictability
of]{.underline}]{.mark} human-made risks of [[dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology have [[caused]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[systematic dysfunction of "bottom-up"]{.underline}]{.mark} autonomy
mode [[and "top-down"]{.underline}]{.mark} management-based
[[regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} mode \[37\]. For these reasons, [[we
**cannot** hope for a "one size fits all" solution]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[To escape the predicament]{.underline}]{.mark} of dual-use
biotechnology risk governance, [[it is necessary to]{.underline}]{.mark}
re-examine current governance ideas and practices and [[propose
**targeted** governance principles]{.underline}]{.mark} for existing
problems, thus establishing a corresponding and specific governance
mechanism. [[It is better to adopt the **experimentalist governance**
mode, which includes "bottom up" **and** "top down" elements, to
**compensate** for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[limitations
of]{.underline}]{.mark} different [[stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark}
(see Figure 1).

Experimentalist governance is a multi-layered mode of governance. It
establishes an open-ended framework from the top and offers stakeholders
in the field of dual-use biotechnology the freedom of discussion.

The goal of [[experimentalist governance]{.underline}]{.mark} is to
reflect on and institutionalize policies in grassroots practice
according to local conditions \[38\]. This approach [[could
guide]{.underline}]{.mark} the country [[through policy
uncertainties]{.underline}]{.mark}, assist in breaking the fetters of
traditional authority and value norms, help practitioners
[[remove]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[constraints of absolute interest
and]{.underline}]{.mark} relative income distribution, [[optimize
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}, and transform central organization
departments from command-type to service-type \[39,40\].

In 2008, Sabel and Zeitlin first proposed [[experimentalist
governance]{.underline}]{.mark} theory with the practice of EU
governance under the recursive learning in decentralized compliance with
international conventions \[41,42\]. Since then, experimentalist
governance has been applied to global governance. Sandra and Tanya
improved the dynamic structure in international society by relying on
framework goals, reporting obligations, peer review and consultation
processes \[43\]. This [[process included]{.underline}]{.mark} setting
[[framework goals]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[letting]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[grassroots]{.underline}]{.mark} units
[[implement]{.underline}]{.mark} those goals,
[[regular]{.underline}]{.mark}ly reporting and conducting [[peer
evaluation, and periodically revising]{.underline}]{.mark} the
framework.

In the view of the high uncertainty and potential implementation cost,
Sabel and Victor institutionalized global experimentalist governance by
setting of provisional goals under due process \[44\], which were then
reviewed, revised, and promoted during implementation, and such
[[experimentalist governance]{.underline}]{.mark} actions [[must rely on
the robust]{.underline}]{.mark} support of governance mechanisms (for
example, penalty defaults, which could promote [[joint action of public
and private participants]{.underline}]{.mark} and increase the chances
of success).

Global [[experimentalist governance has been **extensively used** in
**environmental** issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among the most
significant achievements of experimentalist governance are the
[[Montreal]{.underline}]{.mark} Protocol \[45,46\], the
[[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark} Agreement on Global Climate Change
\[44,47\], the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived
Climate Pollutants ([[CCAC]{.underline}]{.mark}) \[48\], the Forest Law
Enforcement, Governance and Trade ([[FLEGT]{.underline}]{.mark}) \[49\],
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Global [[Food Safety]{.underline}]{.mark}
Initiative \[50\].

(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

3.2. Stage 1: Achieving Consensus on a General Global Governance
Framework with

Open-Ended Principles

[[The first links of the experimental governance model is to invite as
many stakeholders as possible to participate]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
discussion, to construct an authoritative international platform for the
discussion, to set an open-ended principle, and to form a legally
binding agreement. The Biological Weapons Convention of the United
Nations is an open-ended model platform. [[It can establish
communication among countries, and create opportunities for other
non-state actors to participate]{.underline}]{.mark} in discussions
through the mechanism of experts' meetings, side events and best
practice sharing in order to systematically monitor and review
developments in science and technology. We believe that [[for the risk
of dual-use biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [[all stakeholders need
to reach a consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} on three principles: (1) risk
communication, (2) process transparency, and (3) subjectivity.

First, all States [[Parties should regard multi-party risk communication
as the **basic** principle]{.underline}]{.mark} of governance. The
National Research Council of the U.S. defines "risk communication" as an
"interactive process in which individuals, groups, and institutions
exchange information and ideas" \[51\]. Risk communication plays an
important role in resolving conflicts caused by differing perceptions,
as there is generally disagreement among the public, government
officials, scientists and industries about the nature and severity of
risks \[52\]. [[Under the media rendering of dual-use biotechnology in
animal soldiers, genetic weapons, and super soldiers, the public become
fearful]{.underline}]{.mark} of these artificial creatures as "unknown,
frightening, uncontrollable, catastrophic and may affect future
generations." [[Due to this bias]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} and the public tend to [[pay more
attention to]{.underline}]{.mark} the risk of [[bioterrorism than to
other kinds of risks]{.underline}]{.mark} \[53\]. Therefore, it is
essential to strengthen and extend contact and communication among
biotechnologist, policy makers, social scientists and the public.

[[Second, it is also vital to strengthen the principle of transparent
supervision]{.underline}]{.mark} throughout the process of life science
research. It is important to monitor all dual-use biological testing
activities that may increase the toxicity of biological agents or toxins
or change the host range. All participants in research involving class I
and II pathogenic microorganisms, biosafety level III or above
laboratories, and vaccines and biological drugs production units, should
be required to submit test contents, experiment implementation,
contingency plans and other documents for approval before they conduct
their scientific research. Those process could complete the supervision
chain of "project initiation--review--approval--
implementation--verification", thus ensuring rigorous supervision of
scientific research.

[[Third, systematic and sustained awareness-raising and education in
biorisk management are crucial to building a **culture** of
safe]{.underline}]{.mark}, secure and responsible research of [[dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. The culture of safe, secure and
responsible research emphasizes that enable effective awareness-raising
of the security dimensions of life science research; promote research
integrity and the responsible use of science; enhance accountability
practices among practitioners; and foster access to emerging
capabilities.

4\. Conclusions

[[In the management of dual-use biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology risk,
in addition to the predicament of technology iteration and governance
rules caused by systematic internal attributes, the complex external
environment has also exacerbated the contradiction between the demands
of private subjects and social consensus. To this end, the
[[experimental governance]{.underline}]{.mark} model [[could be a way of
achieving good governance]{.underline}]{.mark} on dual-use
biotechnology. The United Nations' "Living with Risk" proposal states
that the risks facing human beings are the result of multiple
environmental factors \[62\]. Thus, we must continue to develop dual-use
biotechnology. At the same time, [[we need to adjust global governance
strategy periodically to adapt to]{.underline}]{.mark} and meet the new
requirement of [[sustainable development]{.underline}]{.mark}.

On a cold morning [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} February
[[2018]{.underline}]{.mark}, a group of 30 microbiologists, zoologists
and public-health experts from around the world met at the headquarters
of [[the World Health Organization]{.underline}]{.mark} in Geneva. The
group was established by the W.H.O. in 2015 to create a [[priority list
of dangerous viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} --- specifically, those for
which no vaccines or drugs were already in development. The consensus,
at least among those in the room, was that as populations and global
travel continued to grow and development increasingly pushed into wild
areas, it was almost inevitable that once-containable local outbreaks,
like SARS or Ebola, could become global disasters.

"The meeting was in a big room, with all the tables arranged around the
edge, facing each other," one of the group's members, Peter Daszak,
recalled recently. "It was a very formal process. Each person was asked
to present the case for including a particular disease on the list of
top threats. And everything you say is being taken down, and checked
factually, and recorded."

Daszak, who directs the pandemic-prevention group EcoHealth Alliance and
is also chairman of the Forum on Microbial Threats at the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, had been given the task
of presenting on SARS, a lethal coronavirus that killed roughly 800
people after it emerged in 2002. (SARS stands for Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome and is officially known as SARS-CoV-1.) "We'd done
a lot of research on coronaviruses, so we knew they were a clear and
present danger," he told me. "High mortality, no drugs or vaccines in
the pipeline, with new variants that could still be emerging."

The discussion, he said, was intense. "Everyone else in the room knows
the facts already --- they've read all the research," Daszak said. But
for each pathogen, the speaker had to convince the room that it
presented a significant threat --- "that this disease really could take
off, and that we should concentrate on it rather than on Lassa fever or
something else. So, you argue the case, and then people vote. And
sometimes it gets quite heated. I remember that monkey pox was an issue,
because there are outbreaks, but there's really nothing we can do about
them. It was a really rigorous, really excellent debate --- and then
afterward, we went and had fondue."

The final list --- which did contain SARS and MERS, along with seven
other respiratory, hemorrhagic or otherwise-lethal viruses --- also
[[included]{.underline}]{.mark} something the W.H.O. dubbed [["Disease
X": a stand-in for **all**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[unknown
pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}, or devastating variations on existing
pathogens, [[that had yet to emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Daszak
describes Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, as
exactly the kind of threat that Disease X was meant to represent: a
[[novel]{.underline}]{.mark}, highly [[infectious]{.underline}]{.mark}
coronavirus, with a [[high mortality]{.underline}]{.mark} rate, [[and no
existing treatment]{.underline}]{.mark} or prevention. "The problem
isn't that prevention was impossible," Daszak told me. "It was very
possible. But we didn't do it. Governments thought it was too expensive.
Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit." And the
[[W.H.O.]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the most part, [[had
neither]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[funding]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[nor]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[power to enforce]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[large-scale global collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} necessary
[[to combat it]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As Covid-19 has spread around the world, overwhelming hospitals and even
mortuaries, there has been widespread consternation over how we could
have been caught so flat-footed by a virus. Given all the shining
advances of high-tech medicine --- computer-controlled surgery,
unprecedented immunotherapies, artificial-intelligence programs for
assessing heart-disease risk --- this failure feels utterly baffling.
How could the entire world remain so powerless? More important, what
could be different next time?

According to some infectious-disease experts, [[the scientific tools
already exist to create a kind of viral-defense
department]{.underline}]{.mark} --- one that would allow us to pursue a
broad range of vital global projects, from [[developing
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark} and drugs that work against a wide range
of pathogens to [[monitoring disease hot spots]{.underline}]{.mark} and
identifying [[potential high-risk viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}, both
known and unknown. [[What's lacking is resources]{.underline}]{.mark}.
"We really did miss the wake-up call," Daszak says. "The alarm went off
with SARS, and [[we hit the **snooze button**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
then we hit it again [[with Ebola]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
[[MERS]{.underline}]{.mark}, with [[Zika]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Now
that we're **awake**, we should think]{.underline}]{.mark} about where
to go from here."

In late March, Vincent Racaniello, host of the podcast "This Week in
Virology" and a professor at Columbia University, conducted an interview
with the pediatric infectious-disease expert Mark Denison. Denison, who
teaches at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, led a team that
developed one of the most promising current treatments for Covid-19: the
drug remdesivir, currently being tested by the pharmaceutical company
Gilead Sciences.

On the show, Denison noted that [[because it is]{.underline}]{.mark}
almost [[impossible to **predict** which virus might cause the next
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}, researchers had long argued that [[it was
essential to design **panviral**]{.underline}]{.mark} drugs and
[[vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark} that would be effective [[against a
**wide range** of strains]{.underline}]{.mark}: all types of influenza,
for instance, or a substantial group of coronaviruses rather than just
one. When his lab was first applying for a grant to study remdesivir,
Denison recalled, that was already the goal. "We don't want to work with
a compound unless it inhibits every coronavirus we test," Denison said.
"Because we're worried about MERS, we're worried about SARS-1, but
they're not really our problem. The future is the problem."

[[Panviral drugs]{.underline}]{.mark} --- ones that work broadly within
or across virus families --- [[are **harder** to make than
broad-spectrum antibiotics]{.underline}]{.mark}, largely because viruses
work by hijacking the machinery of our cells, harnessing their key
functions in order to replicate. A drug that blocks one of those
functions (e.g., the production of a particular protein) is often also
disrupting something that our own cells need to survive. Researchers
have begun to find ways around that problem, in part by refining which
process a drug targets. But they've also begun to test existing drugs
against a wider array of viruses. It was in just such a follow-up screen
that Gilead discovered that remdesivir, originally developed to treat
hepatitis C and later tried against Ebola, might be effective against
coronaviruses. (Favipiravir, an influenza drug developed in Japan, is
another broad-spectrum candidate.) The reason [[drugs sometimes work in
extremely different diseases]{.underline}]{.mark} --- in, say, Ebola and
coronaviruses and flu --- is that [[they block some common
mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Remdesivir and
favipiravir]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, each
[[mimics]{.underline}]{.mark} a key building block in a virus's
[[RNA]{.underline}]{.mark}, which, when inserted, keeps the virus from
replicating. "It's definitely possible to make a drug that would work
across a good range of coronaviruses," Racaniello says. "We honestly
should have had one long ago, since SARS in 2003. [[It would have taken
care of this outbreak in China **before** it got
out]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[the **only** reason we
didn't]{.underline}]{.mark} is because there wasn't enough [[financial
backing]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Panviral vaccines are also becoming a real possibility. In recent years,
a number of prospective universal flu vaccines have been developed that
work by targeting not the virus's globular head, which mutates easily,
but its stalk, which barely mutates at all. (As Daszak noted, if this
outbreak had been a flu rather than a coronavirus, we'd be in much
better shape.) Another new approach, [[mRNA
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}, works by exploiting messenger RNA --- a
kind of courier that communicates the genetic instructions for making
proteins --- to drive an immune response. The
[[advantages]{.underline}]{.mark} of mRNA vaccines
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[enormous]{.underline}]{.mark},
in part because [[they can be made]{.underline}]{.mark} very
**[[quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}** (one month instead of six for a known
strain; two to three months for a novel virus) but also because they can
be made [[on a **vast** scale]{.underline}]{.mark} (billions of doses,
compared with the 100,000 doses that were needed for the Ebola
epidemic). They're extremely adaptable too: If a researcher can develop
a platform that works with this coronavirus, it's easy to redesign it
for the next one. (One mRNA start-up, Moderna, set a drug-industry
record by creating a prospective Covid-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, in just 42
days, using the virus's genetic sequence. The drug is currently in Phase
1 clinical trials to be safety-tested on healthy volunteers.) And while
no mRNA vaccines have yet received F.D.A. approval, Covid-19 will almost
certainly change that.

But for years, Racaniello notes, [[the real obstacle
to]{.underline}]{.mark} making [[panviral]{.underline}]{.mark} drugs or
[[vaccines has been that no one was willing to pay
for]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[development]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
pharmaceutical companies, he points out, panviral vaccines are simply a
terrible business proposition: Companies have to spend hundreds of
millions of dollars to develop a shot that people will get once a year
at most --- and not at all in years when no particular disease is
ascendant.

Panviral drug treatments are unprofitable for similar reasons. For one,
the course of treatment is short, usually just a few weeks; for chronic
diseases (diabetes, high blood pressure), patients take regimens of
pills daily, often for years. (One person noted that Gilead's stock
price actually dropped after the company produced a revolutionary
hepatitis C drug. Because the treatment completely cured patients, the
market for it started to shrink, undermining the company's bottom line.)

The other problem is that there's currently no way to quickly test for
most viruses, which is essential if a doctor wants to establish a
diagnosis and prescribe the right drug. As a result, Racaniello says,
it's "a chicken-and-egg situation: No one is developing drugs for these
viruses because there's no way to test for them. And no one is
developing tests, because there aren't any drugs to prescribe."

[[Biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology has the potential [[to
create]{.underline}]{.mark} novel diagnostics, vaccines, drugs, and
other [[medical countermeasures]{.underline}]{.mark} needed to detect,
prevent, and treat infectious diseases. For example, the coronavirus
pandemic has highlighted the promising role that biotechnology can play
in this way. Researchers around the globe are actively working [[to
combat the pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}. They have been using different
technologies to develop cheap diagnostics, repurpose existing
antivirals, discover new drugs, [[and create safe and effective
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, biotechnology can be used to
create genetically engineered organisms that can be deliberately
introduced into the environment for purposes such as mosquito control.
As an example, advances in genome engineering technologies---such as
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
([[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}) and CRISPR-associated protein 9
(Cas9)---have enabled the development of gene drives, a technology that
[[allows]{.underline}]{.mark} [[desired genetic alterations to spread
faster]{.mark}]{.underline} through a population over many generations.
This technique can be used [[to cure vector-borne human
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark} such as malaria and dengue fever
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} either [[making]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[mosquitoes resistant to]{.underline}]{.mark} the parasites that cause

Agricultural [[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to [[create genetically
modified]{.underline}]{.mark} crops for [[combating]{.underline}]{.mark}
hunger and [[malnutrition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Traditional
biotechnology techniques such as selective breeding, hybridization, and
fermentation have been modifying living plants for improved yield or
enhanced nutritional value from time immemorial. However, with
improvements in [[knowledge about]{.underline}]{.mark} the role of
[[individual plant genes]{.underline}]{.mark}, modern biotechnology
techniques can be used to add, delete, or edit specific genes to produce
a desired variety, thereby [[reducing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
possibility of [[off-target effects]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
golden rice, an engineered variety of rice, contains two extra genes to
make it produce beta-carotene, a precursor to Vitamin A, that can help
address nutrient deficiencies that lead to blindness, anemia, and
weakened immune systems among children. Scientific advances can also
help develop [[genetically modified crops]{.underline}]{.mark} that
withsta[[nd natural calamities, pests, and
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Such varieties]{.underline}]{.mark} can
increase crop yields, [[lessen]{.underline}]{.mark} the need to use
[[pesticides and]{.underline}]{.mark} insecticides, lift farmers out of
[[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}, and ensure food security. Beyond that,
biotechnology can help produce healthier and faster-growing animals and
improve the quality and quantity of milk, eggs, and meat for human
consumption.

1.2.3. Knowledge Risks

Knowledge risks reflect the fact that as human understanding of life
science at the molecular and system levels deepens, [[research may be
abused to attack knowledge loopholes. For example]{.underline}]{.mark},
the study of immune regulation is intended to improve human immunity to
infectious diseases. However, [[a specific pathogen can be
modified]{.underline}]{.mark} through engineering to
[[bypass]{.underline}]{.mark} acquired or innate [[immune barriers,
while importing immunosuppressants and biological weapons into specific
populations]{.underline}]{.mark} to achieve the double purpose of
[[reducing immunity and causing disease]{.underline}]{.mark} \[11\].
[[In addition, dual-use biotechnology can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used
to [[subvert traditional weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} and equipment and
attack the weaknesses in national defense military facilities. For
example, at the Eighth Review Conference of the States Parties to the
United Nations Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the U.S. military
revealed that it had been able to use gene synthesis technology to
produce material damage factors aimed at non-living substances. Such
[[non-traditional weapons can]{.underline}]{.mark} attack "rubber and
metal parts, fuel, food and equipment",
[[accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[corrosion of rubber and metal
parts of weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, and destroy military fuel,
supplies, instruments and equipment \[5\]. In theory, [[gene drive
technology could]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to [[reduce human
reproductive capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} and alter the size of
specific human populations \[12\]. In recent years, biological
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States, Europe, and
other developed countries [[have repeatedly called for appropriate
biosafety precautions to minimize]{.underline}]{.mark} the uncertain
[[risks of gene drive technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
environment, plants and animals, and human health \[13\].

#### Non-state bioterror is accessible -- 3 reasons

Development,\" Sustainability Volume 13 Issue 24 10.3390/su132414056
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

[[Accessibility]{.underline}]{.mark} is the difficulty [[in obtaining
dual-use]{.underline}]{.mark} biotechnology. It [[is the first step
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[intentional misuse of
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, including obtaining hardware,
software, and intangible information that can be applied to such
technology [[for non-state actors to carry out
bioterrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} activities. In the field of dual-use
biotechnology, non-state [[actors can include ethnic separatists,
transnational criminal organizations]{.underline}]{.mark}, terrorist
organizations, [[cults, biohackers]{.underline}]{.mark}, and others
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} engage in covert behavior, have more freedom
to conduct research, and [[are **more difficult** to supervise than
state actors]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the Eighth Review Conference of
the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological Weapons, the U.S.
government announced that bioterrorism plots had been foiled by Kenya
and Morocco. In addition, more than 15 criminal cases in the past ten
years have involved the use of biological weapons in the U.S. There is
therefore increasing concern over non-state actors using dual-use
biotechnology to carry out bioterrorist attacks \[5\].

[[There are three accessibility risks]{.underline}]{.mark} of dual-use
biotechnology. One is the [[disclosure of key technical information,
such as]{.underline}]{.mark} key [[gene sequences]{.underline}]{.mark}
of highly pathogenic pathogens that can be easily obtained from academic
conferences, journals and public databases. In 2011, scientists from the
United States and the Netherlands published academic papers on the
transmission ability of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in
mammalian cells, in which the methods of modifying the virus so as to
enhance its transmission ability were made public \[6\]. This event that
triggered global concern about the dual-use risk of biotechnology \[7\].
In addition, it is now easier than ever to obtain key [[experimental
materials]{.underline}]{.mark}. In light of the
[[industrial]{.underline}]{.mark}ization of biotechnology,
[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology enterprises [[can provide technical
services and]{.underline}]{.mark} related
[[reagents]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the detailed steps of entire
experiments. Anyone can readily order laboratory equipment, consumables
and substitutes online, and each year these become less expensive, so it
is not difficult to set up a simple biology laboratory \[8\].
[[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}, there are more ways than ever to obtain
technology. More [[methods of communication have emerged outside of
traditional channels]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent years,
[[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the International Genetic Engineering
Machine Competition ([[iGEM]{.underline}]{.mark}) and other
international biology academic competitions, [[as well
as]{.underline}]{.mark} online forums such as [[DIY
biology]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Unregulated CRISPR risks superbug mutations

\"The Blessing and Curse of Biotechnology: A Primer on Biosafety and
Biosecurity,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

Safety concerns extend beyond pathogens that may escape from research
laboratories. Genetically engineered organisms that are introduced into
a natural environment for beneficial purposes can also sometimes have
unintended consequences. For example, [[although
CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}/Cas9-enabled gene drives
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential to eradicate vector-borne
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}, tackle invasive species, and control
pests that target crops, the self-propagating nature of gene drives and
the possibility that [[they could]{.underline}]{.mark} either spread
indefinitely or [[accidently manipulate **non**targeted
species]{.underline}]{.mark} have raised concerns among regulators.

Similar experimental techniques, like sterilizing insects en masse, have
been conducted in the past. One technique involves the mass
sterilization of a targeted pest, such as fruit flies, using
irradiation. Scientists advocating for gene drives argue that
irradiation can cause random mutations, which might also have
unintentional effects on the environment. Such off-target mutations can
be avoided using gene drive technology that relies on genomic
information obtained through [[reliable DNA
sequencing]{.underline}]{.mark} tools. Although the [[technology has
immense beneficial applications]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it is important
to update existing regulations]{.underline}]{.mark} and initiate public
discourse [[on the benefits and the risks]{.underline}]{.mark} of this
emerging technology.

[[Biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[potential to revolutionize]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[societies]{.underline}]{.mark} that humans live in and the organisms

[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} discovery of efficient and accurate
gene-editing tools such as [[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}/Cas9,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} developments in
[[synth]{.underline}]{.mark}etic [[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}logy.
Meanwhile, there is a growing [[do-it-yourself]{.underline}]{.mark}
(DIY) [[community]{.underline}]{.mark} of independent biotechnology
practitioners and enthusiasts who are unaffiliated with any single lab.
Despite their promise, developments in the field do
[[raise]{.underline}]{.mark} certain [[safety and security
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} that policymakers and scientists must bear
in mind.

SAFETY THREATS

To understand the safety threats emerging from biotechnology, let's
consider two hypothetical scenarios.

In the first scenario, researchers in a top-level biosafety lab
rearrange DNA fragments to synthetically create a live Ebola virus. This
pathogen was originally transmitted to people from wild animals, but it
has the potential for human-to-human transmission, causing severe (and
often fatal) symptoms in humans. These scientists are working on a
weakened strain of the Ebola virus to understand its epidemiological
characteristics, like the virus's virulence and transmission factors.
While the aim of the research is to develop vaccines or other treatment
options that can help save human lives, the manipulation experiment
accidently produces a strain of the virus with unexpected
characteristics.

In the second scenario, scientists are working on a new symbiotic plant
bacterium to improve the microbiome of the soil. An organic farm fifty
miles away notices a slight increase in their crop yields, so they test
the soil. The farmers find evidence of the synthetic bacteria, which
they trace back to the lab, and they accuse the lab of trying to force
GMOs on their consumers. The scientist conducting the research denies
the allegations and hypothesizes that some live bacteria accidentally
got out of the lab, either on people's clothing or through the lab's
water system.

These two fictional scenarios illustrate the safety threats that can
emerge from developments in biotechnology, both inside and outside the
laboratory. While the first case represents accidents that can occur in
a lab, the second case highlights the unintended consequences in cases
when a genetically engineered organism accidently escapes a lab.

These fictional scenarios have become reality in numerous cases. For
instance, in 2001, Australian scientists hoping to genetically engineer
the mousepox virus to render lab mice infertile accidentally created a
lethal mousepox virus. In another instance, researchers at the State
University of New York developed a synthetic strain of the polio virus
in 2002 from chemicals and publicly available genetic information. And
the virus that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic---a pathogen that
killed an estimated 50 million people globally in 1918 and 1919---was
resurrected by a group of U.S. scientists in 2005. In another case, a
team at the University of Alberta recreated an infectious horsepox
virus, a close relative of the smallpox virus, by ordering DNA fragments
online for about \$100,000.

Although none of these experiments have led to an infection or an
outbreak, there have been instances when the [[accidental release of
pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark} either [[has led to]{.underline}]{.mark}
infections among laboratory personnel or has resulted in [[disease
outbreaks]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, although smallpox was
eradicated from the UK in the early 1970s, the virus escaped from a
smallpox research lab in Birmingham and infected a researcher, who
subsequently succumbed to the disease in 1978. In another incident, an
experienced Russian scientist died of Ebola after accidentally injecting
herself with the deadly virus while working on the Ebola vaccine. More
recently, almost 3,000 people were infected in China with a bacterial
infection called Brucellosis after a leak occurred at a
biopharmaceutical company in 2019.

Since these accidents happened in regulated research labs, it was easier
to minimize the societal impacts of such mishaps. However, [[the DIY
community involves individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}, enthusiasts, and
small organizations dabbling in genetics that are [[not linked to any
formal institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} and hence are not regulated.
Such unaffiliated communities have been in the news even during the
coronavirus pandemic, when some of them joined the quest for an
effective and safe vaccine. Since [[these groups]{.underline}]{.mark}
sometimes [[have limited formal training]{.underline}]{.mark} [[on the
safety and ethics of]{.underline}]{.mark} using such
[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [[it might be difficult to contain
and mitigate]{.underline}]{.mark} the impact of any
[[accidents]{.underline}]{.mark} that might emerge from their
experiments. Even though no unfortunate incident has happened so far,
the absence of regulations to monitor this community has emerged as
another safety threat.

\"The Blessing and Curse of Biotechnology: A Primer on Biosafety and
Biosecurity,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

There are numerous international treaties and regimes in place to help
mitigate the risks at play with biotechnology. Three of the most
significant ones are [[the Convention on Biological
Diversity]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC),
and the Australian Group. Each of these agreements or regimes tackles a
different aspect of the risk profile---biosafety, bioweapons, and banned
substances---but each of them [[comes with limitations, such as limited
scope, sparse funding, and inadequate verification and monitoring
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}. None of the agreements create a binding
framework to holistically address biosafety and biosecurity risks,
making for an overall lack of accountability and rendering the
development of international standards piecemeal and incomplete. In this
regulatory environment, it is difficult to keep up with rapidly emerging
advances in biotechnology or address pressing issues such as releasing
biotechnology products, like gene drives, into nature.

THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY

The Convention on Biological Diversity is an international legal
instrument for ensuring that countries work together to promote a
sustainable and equitable future that protects biological diversity. It
has been ratified by 196 countries. The convention has two protocols,
the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the Nagoya Protocol, that
promote the safe and equitable use of biotechnology with respect to
biodiversity.

The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety governs the use and transport of
GMOs to protect biological diversity and human health. The Nagoya
Protocol is a benefit-sharing agreement that mandates that---when
researchers enter another country and use genetic sequences from
indigenous plants, animals, or microorganisms and/or employ indigenous
procedural knowledge---indigenous people are either compensated up-front
or receive a fair share of the profits from commercialization.

The Cartagena Protocol, which entered into force in 2003, promotes a
precautionary approach enshrined in the fifteenth principle of the Rio
Declaration on Environment and Development, which states, "Where there
are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific
certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective
measures to prevent environmental degradation." In essence, if the
scientific community is uncertain about how a new organism will impact
the environment, this principle states that scientists should proceed
with extreme caution. In general, the Cartagena Protocol attempts to
balance between the propensity of advances in biotechnology to help
countries protect their biodiversity and develop economically alongside
the threats that biotechnology poses to biodiversity and human health if
something were to go wrong.

The Cartagena Protocol mainly covers the handling, transport, and use of
GMOs across borders. The protocol established the Biosafety
Clearing-House to facilitate the implementation of its guiding
principles. The clearinghouse is designed to "facilitate the exchange of
scientific, technical, environmental and legal information on, and
experience with, living modified organisms \[or GMOs\]." All members of
the protocol must inform the clearinghouse when countries make a new
transfer agreement on GMOs, of any unintentional releases of GMOs that
may cross borders, and any national laws that pertain to the effects
GMOs may have on sustainability. While the protocol ensures safe use and
transport of GMOs, it does not include any penalties for violations or
have any accountability mechanisms for accidental releases of pathogens
from labs or any other laboratory-acquired infections.

One key limitation is that the [[Cartagena]{.underline}]{.mark} Protocol
[[only covers the transfer of **physical** material, whereas
much]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [[information]{.underline}]{.mark} that
tends to be [[transferred involves digital DNA
sequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Nagoya Protocol, which was adopted
in 2010, specifically focuses on benefit sharing from the genetic
information of regional biological diversity or regional know-how. The
[[Nagoya]{.underline}]{.mark} Protocol sets the standards for transfer
agreements between a potential commercial actor and a local population
to ensure that the local population is properly compensated for the use
of its regional biodiversity. Similar to the Cartagena Protocol's
Biosafety Clearing-House, the Nagoya Protocol has an Access and
Benefit-Sharing Clearing-House to help coordinate implementation and
exchanges of information on benefit sharing. Although the protocol
monitors fair utilization of genetic resources until indigenous
communities are compensated, it [[does **not** monitor the safety and
security of experiments]{.underline}]{.mark} that occur once fair
compensation has taken place.

Both the [[Cartagena]{.underline}]{.mark} Protocol
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Nagoya]{.underline}]{.mark} Protocol
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[limited in scope and do not
protect against a wide range of biosafety threats]{.underline}]{.mark}.
For example, neither protocol covers safety concerns from the transfer
of DNA sequences and, therefore, would not prevent a nefarious actor
from ordering sequences that might be used for the development of
dangerous pathogens. In addition, the Cartagena Protocol only covers
GMOs, not DNA sequences or other precursors to GMOs, while the Nagoya
Protocol only covers indigenous benefit sharing, not transborder data on
pathogens.

Fundamentally, the Cartagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol are trade
mechanisms designed to protect local biodiversity from being overtaken
by GMOs or exploited by biotech companies. They do not provide
international guidelines for establishing biosafety protocols. Nor do
they protect against the dangers of cheaper and faster DNA sequencing,
easy DNA synthesis, online access to genomic information, and
developments in synthetic biology, among other issues. Given these
limitations, [[there is a need for the scientific community to expand on
global biosafety]{.underline}]{.mark} standards [[to minimize risks from
laboratories]{.underline}]{.mark} undertaking biotechnology-related
research.

\"The Blessing and Curse of Biotechnology: A Primer on Biosafety and
Biosecurity,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

THE [[BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION]{.underline}]{.mark}

The BWC is a multilateral disarmament treaty banning the development,
production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. The BWC, which
entered into force in 1975, was the first treaty of its kind to ban an
entire category of weapons. In consideration of the inherent dual use
problems in biotechnology, the BWC does not outright ban any biological
material. Rather, it bans the creation and stockpiling of biotoxins and
other biological agents above the amount required for peaceful purposes,
and it bans the use of any biological material as a weapon.

Any member of the BWC can initiate a bilateral or multilateral
consultation to deal with any problems that come up during the
implementation of the treaty. In the event of a suspected biological
weapons attack, members of the BWC can report the perpetrating member to
the UN Security Council for further action. However, the BWC [[currently
has]{.underline}]{.mark} ­­­[[no mechanism for monitoring to ensure
compliance or any means of verification]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is
no set threshold for the amount of biological agents "required for
peaceful purposes" and without monitoring and verification, there is no
way to know if the biological agents a country has are being used
peacefully.

Over the years, [[various review conferences have tried to implement
self-reporting requirements and other confidence-building
measures]{.underline}]{.mark} for members, such as declaring high
containment research centers and vaccine production facilities, [[but
these efforts have largely failed due to a **lack of consensus** among
members]{.underline}]{.mark}. The difference in approach to biological
weapons was most evident in 2001, when attempts to establish an
international organization to monitor and verify compliance failed
following a decade of efforts after the United States withdrew from the
negotiations. [[The United States argued that the verification process
would put]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[proprietary information of biotech
and pharmaceutical companies at risk]{.underline}]{.mark} while not
solving the problem because, it was argued, biological activities are
inherently impossible to verify, a position the U.S. government has
maintained to the present. On the other hand, the United States and
India have recently supported a proposal that would strengthen export
controls on biological material, but they received pushback from
developing countries who want to keep biotechnology accessible and
increase knowledge transfer. Russia, after backing off of verification
in the last few years, has placed a special emphasis on bioweapons
response protocols in the wake of a biological attack. In that vein, the
Russian government has supported the development of mobile medical units
for treating victims of bioweapons and natural epidemics and has
recently gained support for this idea from the UK, but not from the
United States.

Due to these ongoing tensions, instead of creating an international
monitoring organization--- similar to the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which implements the Chemical Weapons
Convention---the BWC instituted an implementation support unit (ISU)
that is housed in the UN Department of Disarmament Affairs in Geneva.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is an
international organization in its own right and is managed by a large
technical secretariat, which is composed of both political appointees
from member states and permanent staff. The technical secretariat
focuses on verification of compliance with and implementation of the
Chemical Weapons Convention. By contrast, the ISU has a permanent staff
of just three people. The ISU's mandate is not verification and
monitoring but rather to offer administrative support and help
facilitate confidence-building measures among members.

In addition to a lack of verification, [[the BWC is often perceived by
scholars as not readily addressing the impact of emerging technologies,
such as **synthetic biology**]{.underline}]{.mark} and artificial
intelligence, despite regular meetings of the member states (and expert
meetings) to keep members up to date on pertinent issues. [[Another
issue]{.underline}]{.mark} [[for the BWC is a lack of
**funding**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as many member states have outstanding
dues---in 2019, ninety-five members owed a collective total of over
\$140,000. The funding shortage for the BWC's current activities, and
the lack of consensus about how to expand its mandate, make it highly
unlikely that the convention will be able to expand its role or the role
of the ISU.

\"The Blessing and Curse of Biotechnology: A Primer on Biosafety and
Biosecurity,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

THE AUSTRALIA GROUP

[[The Australia Group is a multilateral export control regime designed
by an informal group of countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. The group's goal
is to help countries decide which substances need to be governed by
export controls to minimize the risk that exporters may unwittingly
assist in the creation of a biological or chemical weapon. The group,
first convened in 1985 with fifteen countries and the European
Commission, is not a legally binding agreement, but rather a coalition
with a shared commitment to the nonproliferation of chemical and
biological weapons. The group currently has forty-two members plus the
European Commission. The Australia Group claims within its remit
eighty-seven controlled compounds, some human and plant pathogens and
toxins, and "dual-use biological equipment and related technology and
software."

[[While the Australia Group does fill in some gaps]{.underline}]{.mark}
left by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the BWC, namely an
expansive list of precursors to biological weapons that should be
subject to tight export controls, [[it is **not** a legally binding
agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore, [[**many** countries are
not included]{.underline}]{.mark} in the group, limiting its reach.
Overall, there is a need for more international cooperation to help
mitigate the threats of emerging breakthroughs in biotechnology without
curtailing technological progress.

#### Global standards secure the upside of BT and mitigate the downside

Continuing [[advances in biotechnology provide]{.underline}]{.mark} a
plethora of [[opportunities to address]{.underline}]{.mark} global
challenges such as the spread of [[infectious diseases, food insecurity,
and environmental degradation. However, the same technologies
can]{.underline}]{.mark} be deployed by nefarious actors or hostile
states to [[create deadly pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark} that can
deliberately cause human infections, [[negatively target agricultural
supply chains, or disrupt existing ecological balances. The world has
already seen]{.underline}]{.mark} some troubling historical precedents
of the [[deliberate misuse of biotechnology to develop
bioweapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, instances of accidental releases of
living organisms from labs, and cases of laboratory-acquired infections.

To tackle such challenges, [[most countries have adopted informal
guidelines or laws]{.underline}]{.mark} to ensure the safety of
biotechnology-related research, instituted mechanisms to prevent
unauthorized access to biological material, and created export control
regimes to govern the transfer of sensitive biological material.

At a [[global level]{.underline}]{.mark}, treaties, conventions, and
guidelines have been drafted to ensure the fair and transparent
promotion of biotechnology, but these [[mechanisms fall
short]{.underline}]{.mark} of providing the oversight needed to promote
the responsible conduct of biotechnology-related research. This is
[[because these]{.underline}]{.mark} global mechanisms [[either have not
been updated regularly]{.underline}]{.mark} and therefore fail to keep
pace with recent technological developments [[or because they lack the
expertise and **financial** resources]{.underline}]{.mark} needed to
monitor global biotechnology developments.

Moreover, [[there are **no** mandatory global standards on biosafety and
biosecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} that all research laboratories must
abide by, and there is no mechanism that introduces accountability and
proper procedures for judging claims of liability when experiments go
awry. For example, when state actors deliberately misuse biotechnology,
the signatory states of the BWC, in the absence of a verification and
monitoring protocol, can only consult with each other or lodge a
complaint with the UN Security Council.

The above examples highlight that these global mechanisms are
ill-equipped to handle threats emerging from breakthroughs in
biotechnology. [[To ensure that
biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}-related research [[is conducted
responsibly, the international community needs to collaborate to develop
standards that govern the safety and security of
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark}, formulate the long-debated
[[verification]{.underline}]{.mark} and monitoring mechanism under the
BWC, and incorporate clauses that institute [[liability and
accountability]{.underline}]{.mark} mechanisms in cases of violations.
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} steps [[would go a **long way** toward
increasing the odds that the world can **make good** on advances in
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[while **mitigating** the
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} and downsides.

[[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}/Cas9 [[is a major technological feat
with]{.underline}]{.mark} tremendous [[potential to]{.underline}]{.mark}
impact the agriculture and health industries. These tools are currently
being used [[to expedite crop]{.underline}]{.mark} and livestock
[[breeding, engineer new antimicrobials, and
control]{.underline}]{.mark} populations of [[disease-carrying
insects]{.underline}]{.mark} (Gao 2018; Nunez and Lu 2017; Hammond et
al. 2016). For human health, [[CRISPR can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used
to [[treat diseases]{.underline}]{.mark} for which
[[gene]{.underline}]{.mark} editing has previously been considered a
therapeutic strategy, [[including Parkinson's]{.underline}]{.mark}
disease, Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis,
sickle cell disease, hemophilia, autism, [[HIV, and various
cancers]{.underline}]{.mark} among other applications (NASEM 2017). Two
first-in-human safety trials have been initiated to study whether CRISPR
edited immune cells are more efficient at killing tumour cells in people
with terminal cancer (Cyranoski 2016; Reardon 2016). CRISPR technology
has reportedly been used to correct gene defects in human embryos (Ma et
al. 2017) and is considered important in improving assisted reproductive
technologies (Simón 2013; Ishii 2017). [[Research]{.underline}]{.mark}
involving human embryo manipulation, however, [[is largely being
conducted **outside** the United States due to regulatory
restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Several of these applications have
relevance to Department of Defense (DoD) initiatives.

#### CRISPR enables warfighter enhancement

Marsha **Greene** **&** Zubin **Master**, 20**18**, Senior Policy

\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

The development of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system has revived the debate over
gene editing applications in many areas including biological research,
human health, and agriculture and food production among others. What is
discussed less in the literature is the use of CRISPR/Cas and other gene
editing technologies to enhance humans specifically for military
purposes. [[The President's Council on Bioethics
under]{.underline}]{.mark} former President George W.
[[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark} acknowledged that when performance is a
matter of life and death, such as with soldiers on the battlefield,
human enhancement may be more acceptable and indeed allowable
(President's Council for Bioethics 2003). Yet the Council [[cautioned
that it may be unwise to allow]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[warfighter to
become indistinguishable from]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[[weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nevertheless, as evidenced by the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Broad Agency Announcement
(BAA) in 2014, human performance optimization continues to be a major
area of research focus (DARPABAA-14-38). In this call, DARP[[A solicited
proposals to improve warfighter performance]{.underline}]{.mark},
improve [[bioengineering safety, and create a biological based
manufacturing platform]{.underline}]{.mark}. The announcement
underscores the Department's current focus on temporary optimization
measures to include the development of short acting drugs and biologics
designed to enhance everything from wound healing to improvement of a
broad range of cognitive abilities. [[With the emergence of
CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}/Cas technology [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
the possibility for [[permanent gene enhancements]{.underline}]{.mark}
of service members, the debate over where the ethical line should be
drawn in military human performance optimization requires further
consideration.

In this paper, we focus on the ethics of research using CRISPR on adult
military service members, specifically as it relates to potential
exposure to biological agents. This focus is deliberate because warfare
is increasingly becoming asymmetrical with the emergence of guerrilla
and insurgent forces. Military operations have shifted to
counterinsurgency with specific attention regarding how to combat the
threat of non-lethal weapons (e.g., bioagents). We discuss the
governance of research involving humans in the military and follow with
a discussion of how [[CRISPR can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to
[[protect warfighters against biological agents]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Finally, we perform an ethical analysis of research involving military
personnel specifically on issues of risks--benefit analysis, informed
consent, and equality of access and outline several considerations for
institutional review boards (IRBs) and policymakers.

#### CRISPR enhancement improves low light and casualty aversion in soldiers

\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

Other military [[applications of CRISPR could involve directly enhancing
human soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Humans remain the rate-limiting
factor in the conduct of war. While weapons have become increasingly
more sophisticated, provisions must be made in modern wargame exercises
to allow the warfighter to sleep, receive nutrition, and heal after
trauma or injury. Science fiction has conjured images of warfighters
with super strength, enhanced vision, and limited psychosomatic
reactions to the horrors of war. [[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark} research
in the private sector is also trending towards
[[enhancements]{.underline}]{.mark} that could be desirable for military
applications. For example, a study with CRISPR-mediated gene editing of
beagle embryos produced pups with twice the muscle mass having direct
implications for human research (Zou et al. 2015). Scientists have also
isolated genes from other species that [[could]{.underline}]{.mark}
theoretically be genetically engineered to enhance humans such as a
thermal imaging gene in reptiles which may [[confer the ability to see
in low light conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} (Gracheva et al. 2010).
[[Even]{.underline}]{.mark} a potential candidate gene for
[[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]{.underline}]{.mark} has been described
indicating that [[it may be possible to one day
eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark} emotional detachment that warfighters
sometimes encounter in the aftermath of war (Cornelis et al. 2010). Such
experime[[ntal endeavours are likely to face major regulatory hurdles if
they are ever seriously considered]{.underline}]{.mark} for development.

#### CRISPR tech may make gene editing unnecessary

Marsha **Greene** **&** Zubin **Master**, 20**18**, Senior Policy
Analyst, Peraton & Biomedical Ethics Research Program, Mayo Clinic,

\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

More practically, the availability of [[CRISPR gene
editing]{.underline}]{.mark} is likely to impact both policy and
practice in warfighter health and performance research. CRISPR itself
[[could be used to weaponize biological agents and the military will
need to consider how the warfighter could be
optimized]{.underline}]{.mark} for performance during a hypothetical
attack (Hoehn et al. 2017). Historically, [[service members are often
subject to mandatory vaccination programs]{.underline}]{.mark} to
protect [[against biological agents]{.underline}]{.mark} while deployed.
However, [[it may prove difficult to develop effective vaccines
for]{.underline}]{.mark} some of these new and [[emerging biological
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. Initial work aimed at identifying
candidate genes that confers sensitivity to anthrax could lay the ground
work for these types of studies (Martchenko et al. 2012). [[Reduced
expression of one such gene]{.underline}]{.mark}, capillary
morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG 2), [[correlates strongly with lower
susceptibility to anthrax]{.underline}]{.mark}. Interestingly,
individuals who are closely related express CMG2 at similar levels which
could indicate that sensitivity to these types of bioagents may be
heritable traits. If genes such as CMG2 can be validated, the CRISPR
system could be exploited in a variety of ways, some of which may not
involve gene editing at all. In 2012, a team of researchers engineered a
Cas9 enzyme that was unable to cut DNA (Qi et al. 2013). Essentially,
the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery could be directed to a specific locus in the
genome and used as either a gene promoter or suppressor, a sort of
on/off switch for certain genes. More importantly, [[the effects could
be **reversible**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One study did report targeted
silencing of CMG receptors protected against anthrax toxin (Arévalo et
al. 2014). [[Potential advantages are]{.underline}]{.mark} a shorter
time frame between [[warfighter inoculation]{.underline}]{.mark} and
deployment to a hostile zone [[and the ability to naturally reverse
effects]{.underline}]{.mark} over time. More research is needed to
determine the precise timing required for such inoculations and how long
the expected response would be sustained.

#### Gene therapy checks the impact of chemical weapons

Peter H. **Schwartz**, April 20**20**, Indiana University Center for
Bioethics, Indiana University School of
Medicinehttps://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdf/S1525-0016(20)30142-8.pdf,
\" Ethics of Gene Therapy in the Military: Promise and Potential
Problems\" Molecular Therapy Vol. 28 No 4 (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

Recent research on mice has shown that [[gene therapy can **neutralize**
the effect of certain types of chemical weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}.1,2
This approach may one day protect people, but it also raises worries.
Some of these questions stem from it being gene therapy, but most stem
from the fact that its key use would be on the battlefield. The most
challenging questions involve assessing a therapy that is designed to
protect soldiers but could also hurt them.

It's important to begin the discussion by reviewing how dangerous
chemical weapons are and why they have been banned by international
treaty since the 1960s.3,4 The most commonly used nerve agents, such as
sarin, tabun, and VX, are organophosphates that inhibit
acetylcholinesterase and lead to nerve dysfunction, resulting in the
inability to breathe, heart problems, seizures, and death.
Chemoprotective clothing and gas masks provide some defense, but they
are not perfect. Once a person is exposed, medical treatments have
limited efficacy and may not be able to forestall death or brain
damage.3,4

If an attack is expected, then some [[medications
can]{.underline}]{.mark} be given to [[reduce or block the effect of
nerve agents]{.underline}]{.mark}, though these treatments have
limitations too. One approach being tested in animals is to inject an
enzyme that quickly breaks down organophosphates.1,2 But these enzymes
do not last in the bloodstream very long, so they may need to be given
right before a possible attack, perhaps multiple times. The gene therapy
approach may solve this problem: scientists injected a gene into mice
that was taken up by their liver cells and made the protective enzyme.
The study found that the enzyme remained active in the blood for the
entire 5-month study and allowed the mice to survive multiple injections
of the nerve agents.1,2

The experiment is just"proof of concept," of course, since much [[more
research would be needed to make the treatment for humans and identify
its risks and benefits. But the potential advantages are clear. Despite
the international treaty banning their use, chemical warfare is still
being used]{.underline}]{.mark}, most recently in Syria.

The approach will attract the attention of ethicists in part because it
is a possible gene therapy. Of note, though, the approach does not have
two features that often raise the most concern about genetics. First,
the treatment is somatic therapy, not heritable, so it doesn't involve
changes in the germline or affect the next generation.5 Second, it is
[[an intervention countering a physical danger]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
thus [[does **not** fall in the realm of "enhancement" of the sort that
many worry gene therapy will eventually aim at]{.underline}]{.mark},
attempting to make people (or soldiers) smarter, taller, or stronger.6,7

### Plan is vaccine related 

#### mRNA is 5x more effective than natural immunity

\"COVID-19 vaccine: How was it developed so fast?,\" Medical News Today
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

mRNA technology

The [[Pfizer and Moderna]{.underline}]{.mark} COVID-19 vaccines [[were
the **first** mRNA vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark} that humans received
[[outside of clinical trials]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Dr. Thomas Kenyon, chief health officer at Project HOPE and former
director of the CDC Center for Global Health, told MNT that [[mRNA
technology is something the NIH had been working on for some
time]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Dr. Kenyon explained that [[mRNA vaccines deliver the coronavirus S
protein's genetic material]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our own cells then use
the information stored in the mRNA to make the S proteins. The immune
system is then "trained" to recognize these spikes, preparing it for a
future attack.

"When challenged with the real virus, your immune system attacks the
real surface protein of the virus and inactivates it through the immune
system capabilities," Dr. Kenyon told MNT.

Concerns over mRNA vaccine

According to Dr. Kenyon, misinformation surrounding mRNA vaccines stems
from a concern that the vaccine infects people with the virus.

"Nobody is getting infected with a COVID-19 vaccine. It is [[only the
surface protein]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[would be
replicated]{.underline}]{.mark} because we have given you the messenger
RNA. It is [[**not** the entire virus]{.underline}]{.mark}," he
explained.

One misconception is that an mRNA vaccine would not be useful when the
virus mutates.

A July 2020 study that appears in Frontiers in Microbiology confirms
that the virus mutates. After analyzing 48,635 samples of SARS-CoV-2,
the researchers identified an average of 7.23 mutations per sample.

While mutations are a certainty, Dr. Sun said that this should not be a
cause for alarm.

"There has been an estimated 250,000 variants or strains of SARS-CoV-2
sequenced in the lab. For the most part, [[the virus has a low mutation
rate compared to]{.underline}]{.mark} the mutation rate of the
[[influenza]{.underline}]{.mark} virusTrusted Source," Dr. Sun
explained. "[[The spike protein is important]{.underline}]{.mark} for
the ability of the virus to infect humans' cells. I think [[it would not
mutate enough for the vaccines to be ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Another concern is whether natural immunity would be more effective than
a vaccine. However, [[a CDC study]{.underline}]{.mark} from November
2021 [[found]{.underline}]{.mark} that COVID-19 [[mRNA
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark} are about [[five times more
effective]{.underline}]{.mark} in preventing hospitalization
[[than]{.mark} a previous infection]{.underline}.

"[[Natural immunity]{.underline}]{.mark} is not better than

[[Vaccine is a biological substance which stimulates the immune
system]{.underline}]{.mark} by introducing a killed, weakened disease
causing organism, or its surface protein in healthy body. Vaccines
provide acquired immunity against a particular disease. The mode of
action of vaccine is either prophylactic (to prevent the future
infection) or it could be threptic specifically many cancer vaccines are
under experimental stages \[1, 2\]. The term vaccine or vaccination
derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow) was coined for the
first time by an English Physician Edward Jenner to describe cow pox. He
used the term in 1798 for his long experiments to establish protective
role of cow pox against smallpox \[3\]. According to World Health
Organization so far twenty-five (25) licensed vaccines are available for
different infectious diseases \[4\]. The [[traditional vaccines are
either killed microorganism or attenuated]{.underline}]{.mark} one to
generate immune response in body after their inoculation. [[**After**
emergence of Recombinant DNA Technology is a sub-field of Biotechnology
remarkable positive impacts were observed]{.underline}]{.mark} on human
health. From production of safe proteins, antibodies and gene therapy
RDT revolutionized different aspects of biological studies \[5\].

Reverse Genetics Platform

[[Reverse genetics literally means]{.underline}]{.mark} to understand
the effect of gene by [[analyzing phenotypic effects of a specifically
engineered gene sequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. Reverse genetics provide
a low cost, effective and convenient method as compared to conventional
approach for creating live attenuated vaccines. [[The **common** method
to generate a live attenuated **vaccine** is to generate plasmids with
sequences coding]{.underline}]{.mark} for structural and functional
proteins. Influenza virus vaccine contains eight plasmids transfected
tighter to produce vaccine \[21\]. The recent outbreaks of deadly Ebola
virus accelerated the progress for its vaccine production. The vesicular
stomatis virus-based vaccine is develop which is similar to reverse
genetics. In this vaccine G protein of VSV replaced by Ebola Virus
Glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) which is expressed on surface of VSV virus. The
vaccine is now in phase three clinical trials \[21\].

#### Vaccine leadership is possible

**Morrison & Cole**, 10-13-20**20**, J. Stephen Morrisonsenior vice
president here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,

\"Online Event: A Conversation with Congressman Tom Cole,\" No
Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

J. Stephen Morrison: Thank you. I want to ask you about the
international domain and U.S. leadership in the international domain.
There's a couple of big issues there. You know, the global health
security agenda has been an instrument in building capacity in
low-income countries that are vulnerable. That was -- that came about
around the same time as Ebola. It got turbo charged with the
supplemental. But there's a question of sustaining that as a way of
building defenses and preparedness in those countries that are very
vulnerable.

[[There's also the issue of the vaccine facility]{.underline}]{.mark},
to bring vaccines to low and middle-income countries that may really
struggle to get that. And we have the COVAX facility led by CEPI and
Gavi, Gavi playing the procurement and distribution role. [[U.S. has
chosen not to be part of the COVAX facility. The door is still open.
That can be changed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Congress can play a role
there. And related to that is a question of WHO reform. Obviously, the
president has chosen to terminate membership in WHO. That has been a
controversial issue. We need to be thinking about what is the future of
attempting to reconnect with WHO under what basis. We have the
Independent Panel on Preparedness and Response that's underway, an
international group, which is charged with looking at these issues. And
the U.S. has supported that panel.

Tell us your thoughts around what the U.S. leadership role should be in
the international domain, particularly with reference to low and
lower-middle income countries in this next phase.

Rep. Tom Cole: Well, I start with a belief that -- you know, I'm a big
believer in enlightened self-interest. I think some of the best things
we've done in the country -- you know, [[whether it's PEPFAR
or]{.underline}]{.mark} whether it's [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} --
they're very different types of efforts, obviously. But the reality is,
[[helping others to help yourself is pretty smart. And where disease is
concerned, there is no border that will protect you. So, we need to be
engaged globally on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[health-care]{.underline}]{.mark} front. I actually toured yesterday --
or, excuse me -- Monday, I think, a biomedical facility in Maryland
where they manufacture a whole variety of products. But two of the most
interesting are things that, number one, are rapidly test -- you can use
them routinely, but they have surge capacity. So, we would never have
this testing problem if we built these type of things and grouped them
in appropriate places.

The other thing is that a smaller test, they argue, you could spread all
over the world that could test unique things that we would -- we would,
you know, pick it up. Look, as I said, this is actually -- you know, we
had Ebola in Africa. We had one guy get to Dallas that was carrying the
disease. You want to fight Ebola in West Africa or west Dallas? I know
where I would pick. So, [[we need to be very
aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark}. And a lot of the countries don't have
much health-care infrastructure. It's not that they're not fine, but
strengthening their infrastructure strengthens our protection. It's just
that simple. I mean, we live in a world where disease can move with
extraordinary speed.

\"Three Years Is Too Long to Wait for a Global Vaccine Rollout,\"
Foreign Policy (ermo/sms, Acc:6-20-2022)

At first sight, the global vaccination rollout is mesmerizing. At least
2.4 billion people have already received at least one dose. But scrape a
little deeper and the unevenness of vaccine distribution loses its
luster. [[Just 480 million people have been fully vaccinated or 6.2
percent of the global population]{.underline}]{.mark}. What's more,
[[well over half]{.underline}]{.mark} of all administered doses have
been injected into the arms of citizens [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} just
two countries: [[the United States and China]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Following their summit in Cornwall, England, last week, the leaders of
the [[G-7]{.underline}]{.mark} nations [[committed to donating an
additional 1 bi]{.underline}]{.mark}llion COVID-19 vaccines to poorer
countries in 2021 and 2022. The Biden administration said 500 million of
those doses would be provided by the United States, [[mostly
through]{.underline}]{.mark} COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access
([[COVAX]{.underline}]{.mark}), a global vaccine facility managed by the
Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations. China is likewise distributing jabs to advance
foreign-policy goals, having so far exported more than 250 million doses
to other countries.

Notwithstanding the surge in vaccine diplomacy, [[far more investment is
needed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Less than 1 percent of the billions of
vaccine doses administered to date have gone to low-income countries.
[[At the current rate]{.underline}]{.mark} of distribution, [[it will
take until 2024 before all countries have sufficient
supplies]{.underline}]{.mark} to vaccinate their populations. It is not
just vaccine nationalism and supply chain disruptions that are slowing
vaccination in poorer countries, but also financial constraints. [[To
attain even]{.underline}]{.mark} the modest goal of vaccinating [[20
percent]{.underline}]{.mark} of the people in 92 low-income countries by
the end of the year, [[COVAX]{.underline}]{.mark} said it [[needs an
additional \$2.8 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The delay is dangerous and costly for all nations. Recurrent outbreaks
will prolong [[the global economic slowdown]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
[[has already cost the world \$28 trillion]{.underline}]{.mark} in lost
output. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark}, by this summer, wealthier nations are
fully vaccinated yet [[developing nations remain
unvaccinated]{.underline}]{.mark}, global economic [[losses could add an
additional \$9 trillion]{.underline}]{.mark} to the bill. And the longer
more contagious and lethal variants are allowed to incubate and spread,
the greater the risk a vaccine-resistant strain emerges. As U.S.
President Joe Biden has said, "We will ultimately not be safe until the
world is safe."

[[An urgent, **all-hands-on-deck** effort is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}
to fund COVAX and Gavi in particular. So far, the focus has been on what
governments can do. Mapping the funding network for Gavi and COVAX
reveals two intriguing features of the current financing environment.
First, govern[[ments have provided the lion's share of financial
support]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of the \$9.5 billion pledged, \$8.8
billion is from national governments. Second, although the remaining
funding only makes up a small share, it comes from a surprisingly
diverse array of organizations, including philanthropic foundations,
corporations like Visa and Google, and even civil society groups like
the charitable video game festival Gamers Without Borders.

### A2 Security K

#### Disease securitization good -- checks political capture -- link turns their impacts

Eric **Swalwell**, (CA Rep -- D), 7-16-20**21**,
https://www.justsecurity.org/77442/, \"New Legislation Needed to Prepare
for the Next Pandemic,\" Just Security (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

COVID-19 has wreaked havoc upon the United States -- a loss of more than
600,000 lives and a devastating blow to our economy -- and it would be
shameful if we didn't use the lessons we have learned to help blunt
[[the next pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}'s impact.

The United States [[must change the perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}
from which it prepares for and responds to a pandemic. Yes, they're
public health emergencies; however, [[the United States
must]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[approach them as **national security**
threats]{.underline}]{.mark} that need better public monitoring. Experts
long have warned that [[infectious disease]{.underline}]{.mark}
outbreaks could [[bring]{.underline}]{.mark} not only human suffering
but also [[massive economic losses, and **political
instability**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[**especially if**
outbreaks]{.underline}]{.mark} are serious enough to [[overwhelm health
care]{.underline}]{.mark} systems, drain the
[[workforce]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} interrupt
[[supply chains]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Think about what transpired over the past year and a half. Early on,
hospitals ran out of personal protective equipment for healthcare
workers and life-saving ventilators for patients. The aircraft
[[carrier]{.underline}]{.mark}, the USS Theodore
[[Roosevelt]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[had to be]{.underline}]{.mark}
mostly [[evacuated]{.underline}]{.mark} in April 2020 as hundreds of
sailors contracted the disease on board. Supply chains for everything
from toilet paper to pork were disrupted. [[The president was
hospitalized]{.underline}]{.mark} for three days, undergoing special
experimental treatment to ensure his survival.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} our highest-ranking military officers, the
[[Joint Chiefs]{.underline}]{.mark} of Staff, [[were
quarantined]{.underline}]{.mark} for two weeks in October after being
exposed.

These are only a few examples of the many disruptions and scares the
United States suffered, [[leaving the nation more vulnerable to
**other** security risks]{.underline}]{.mark} while it struggled to
mitigate the biological threat.

[[The future]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[will bring
**worse**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to the [[climate-related
crises]{.underline}]{.mark} that are expected, evidence suggests
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} emerging diseases [[will
become]{.underline}]{.mark} more and more likely to reach pandemic
proportions as the world becomes increasingly
[[interconnected]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The next global
outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark} of a deadly disease [[could be **right
around the corner**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

I've introduced the National Security Council Modernization Act [[to
give]{.underline}]{.mark} the secretary of Health and Human Services
([[HHS]{.underline}]{.mark}) -- whose department oversees the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and other disease surveillance
agencies -- [[a seat on]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
National Security Council ([[NSC]{.underline}]{.mark}).

Adding the HHS secretary to the NSC [[would ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}
that emerging [[public health threats are evaluated as potential
national security threats]{.underline}]{.mark}, and would provide a
readily available forum for the secretary to share information on such
diseases with national security-oriented departments, such as the
Department of Defense.

My bill also strengthens the NSC by permanently seating the chair of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of National Intelligence, and by
[[allowing only Senate-confirmed officers]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
United States to serve as full members -- thus
[[limit]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[any president's ability to politicize
the council]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Also, as we have seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, public health
misinformation -- particularly on social media -- can jeopardize
America's response to biological threats, unnecessarily putting people
in harm's way.

Consider the rampant, pernicious myths that accompanied COVID-19. Some
claimed it was desirable to try to achieve herd immunity by letting the
virus spread unchecked through the population; some claimed the number
of COVID-19 deaths was much lower than what was being reported, and that
the disease was being overblown; some claimed only the elderly or those
with underlying health conditions could get seriously ill and require
hospitalization for COVID-19. Some of these lies are still being
propagated today, alongside dangerous conspiracy theories about the
vaccines.

So, I've introduced the BIO Defense Act to strengthen the National
Biodefense Strategy (NBS), a bipartisan plan enacted in 2016 as part of
the National Defense Authorization Act. My bill would
[[formal]{.underline}]{.mark}ize a [[National Biodefense
Directorate]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
include the vice president and the department secretaries. This entity
would be required to [[meet regularly]{.underline}]{.mark}, hire staff,
and establish uniform data collection methods so it can continually
update the NBS [[to address]{.underline}]{.mark} the national [[security
risks posed by pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And, importantly, the Directorate would develop a National Strategy
[[Combating]{.underline}]{.mark} Biodefense
[[Misinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} to make sure the federal
government is prepared to get the best-available public health
information to the American people quickly and effectively in times of
crisis. Knowledge is power during a pandemic, and government must
actively promote fact-based information -- while actively debunking and
preventing the spread of lies, be they deliberate or panic-induced -- to
save lives.

COVID-19 must be seen as a wake-up call, alerting us to the national
security threats posed by major pandemics. It's even clearer now that
former President Donald Trump handled the challenge poorly. He ignored
data and intelligence, assembled but then contradicted expert advisers,
sidestepped Congress, shunned already existing strategy, and lied to
Americans about the scope of the public health threat.

This [[mismanagement exacerbated COVID-19's danger to U.S. national
security]{.underline}]{.mark}. The lack of a national strategy to
mitigate COVID-19's fallout led to a patchwork of state and local public
health policies and contributed to the public's mass anxiety, which made
people more susceptible to violent ideology.

My bills are some [[initial]{.underline}]{.mark}, simple
[[guardrails]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the United States is always]{.underline}]{.mark} vigilant and
[[prepared]{.underline}]{.mark} to respond to biological threats that
impact national security, now and in the future.

#### A2 Security K NATO pandemic leadership is vital to cohesion

\"It's time to consider an enhanced role for NATO to combat pandemics,\"
Hill (ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

In 2019 when the U.S. remained the world's largest defense spender,
governments of the EU member states increased their defense spending to
reach the 2 percent GDP NATO contribution target. The U.S. government
built a wall across its southern border to improve American security;
meanwhile, EU member states increased the number and budget of border
patrols like FRONTEX to protect their borders from refugees and mass
immigration flows, which seem a threat to their security. However,
neither the U.S. nor the EU were well prepared to protect their citizens
from one of the most dangerous and deadly security threats, one that
does not recognize any border: pandemics.

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 reminds us that [[a pandemic can
**kill** as many]{.underline}]{.mark} people [[as a
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, COVID-19 also demonstrates that it
can [[**severely** harm the economy and]{.underline}]{.mark} has the
potential to change the current international economic system.
Furthermore, COVID-19 [[indicates]{.underline}]{.mark} that there is
[[an urgent need for **solidarity** among NATO
allies]{.underline}]{.mark} to battle against the outbreak.

COVID-19 is not the first pandemic --- but [[pandemics were
not]{.underline}]{.mark} accepted as a security threat and were not
[[included in security strategy documents until the early
2000s]{.underline}]{.mark}, only viewed as a national security issue
following the H5N1 and H1N1 outbreaks in 2005 and 2009. The 2006 U.S.
National Security Strategy stated that pandemics like HIV (AIDS), H5N1
(avian influenza) do not recognize borders and should be dealt with
through new strategies and responses. Like the U.S., the EU included
pandemics as public health threats under the section entitled "Security
and Development Nexus" in the 2008 Report on the Implementation of the
European Security Strategy, stating that "pandemics further undermine
development."

[[Both]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U.S. and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[EU]{.underline}]{.mark} and its [[member states]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[define pandemics as a security threat]{.underline}]{.mark} aim to
protect their citizens and try to take measures at national, federal and
union levels. [[Contrary to these]{.underline}]{.mark} national security
strategy documents, [[NATO's 2010 strategic
concept]{.underline}]{.mark}, an official policy document outlining
purpose and fundamental NATO security tasks, [[does **not** mention
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

NATO reconsidered its planning and operations to deal with new security
threats. Accordingly, the head of states underlined "key environmental
and resource constraints, including health risks, climate change, water
scarcity and increasing energy needs will further shape the future
security environment in areas of concern to NATO and have the potential
to significantly affect NATO planning and operations" at the Wales
Summit Declaration of NATO in 2014.

A couple of months ago at the NATO London Summit, leaders and heads of
state stated that "we are stepping up NATO's role in human security."
The concept of human security, which was first introduced in the United
Nations Development Program's 1994 Human Development Report, emphasizes
the necessity of focusing on the protection of individuals from
economic, environmental, social, and other forms of harm, including
pandemics. [[Pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}, which transcend national
frontiers and are described as a global challenge, [[cannot be handled
by state-centered **traditional** security
understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}. Like other global challenges, a
pandemic necessitates a global response.

Among other NATO allies, Italy has been hit worst by the outbreak and
pleaded for help. China, Russia and Cuba responded very quickly to
Italy's request. China sent ventilators, face masks, doctors and nurses
to Italy to help its battle against COVID-19. Russia sent military
doctors, specialists on epidemics and equipment. Cuban doctors and
nurses also travelled to Italy in order to help. This not only shows the
necessity of international cooperation and enhanced partnerships with
other actors and organizations when needed (as stated at the Strategic
Concept of NATO) but also the need for an enhanced role for NATO to help
its allies combat pandemics.

NATO is not unfamiliar with relief operations and humanitarian
assistance. It took an active role in relief operations in the aftermath
of Hurricane Katrina (2005) and an earthquake in Pakistan (2005). NATO's
Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center (EADRCC) providing
medical, logistical and food supplies to the U.S. after Katrina. NATO
also provided food, medical care, and deployed engineers, medical units
to assist in relief operations after the earthquake in Pakistan.

In the London Declaration of 2019, leaders and heads of states
reiterated that NATO guarantees the security of its member states'
territory, citizens and common values, emphasizing the cornerstone of
alliance: solidarity, unity and cohesion.

[[It is time to show this solidarity with NATO allies struggling with
the COVID-19 outbreak. It is time to enhance NATO's role in the fight
against pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### A2 Security K NATO cooperation on pandemic emergence vital to resilience -- prevents social collapse

Olli-Poika **Parviainen**, 12-10-20**20**, State Secretary, Finland
Ministry of the Interior,
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_180067.htm, \"Building
transatlantic resilience: Why critical infrastructure is a matter of
national security,\" NATO (ermo/sms, Acc:6-22-2022)

But I have prepared a little speech for you. It is the Minister's speech
which I have tuned a little bit, so, I think I will proceed to that. I
think [[we\'ve reached a stage in the]{.underline}]{.mark} coronavirus
[[pandemic where we can already reflect on lessons]{.underline}]{.mark}
for ongoing and future crisis and already at this point, it is clear
that [[societal resilience is at the heart of responding efficiently to
a long lasting crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} situation, like the one we
are currently experiencing worldwide. During the past few years,
resilience and critical infrastructure protection, have featured
strongly in international discussions and discussions [[within EU and
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Our societies are characterised by a web of **complex
interdependencies**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[where]{.underline}]{.mark}
private sector actors are principal operators in many fields of services
and infrastructure. The [[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} of modern
societies [[is **not restricted** to state boundaries or a single
actor]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is something that the previous speakers
have also addressed. So in this intervention. I would like to highlight
two areas relevant to the topic of this event.

Firstly, comprehensive security and societal resilience, as tools to
maintain wellbeing and societal order, and secondly the importance of
national security when assessing critical infrastructure, resilience
against both old and new threats such as hybrid influencing and, for
example, fake news even. So, first on comprehensive security and
societal resilience. I want to highlight as national practices, we can
be proud of Finland. And this is something that I think we have achieved
quite well. And we have our own diamond shaped strategy of comprehensive
security on use.

Finland has been using a so called comprehensive security model which I
mentioned in its civil preparedness for decades. The model rests on the
assumption that [[we should be prepared for **all** kinds of
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, from everyday accident to all the way to
military conflict or even to a war. I see internal security, the mandate
of my Ministry in a wide sense, for example, reducing marginalisation
and poverty. It promotes internal security and contributes to resilience
tackling climate change, reduces frequency and magnitude of natural
disasters. Fighting hate speech promotes social inclusion and prevents
hate crimes, and so on.

The [[comprehensive security]{.underline}]{.mark} model [[relies on
**cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark} between authorities and other
relevant actors, the private sector, public partners in education,
society, social and healthcare sectors, and of course, NGOs. Another key
element is building security of supply with national and international
arrangements, and maintaining sufficient in-country reserve storage. The
ongoing pandemic has really demonstrated in practice, how important
security of supply and well functioning, or society preparedness, is for
our everyday resilience.

In Finland, we have maintained reserve storages, but [[COVID-19 showed
us]{.underline}]{.mark} too [[that keeping a good
stock]{.underline}]{.mark} of essential equipment [[is not
enough]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[You]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[have to
build]{.underline}]{.mark} good [[supply production and acquisition
chains]{.underline}]{.mark} to last weeks, and even months. And of
course if you look at Finland, from a global map we are in a certain way
stranded in an island. In Finland, a broad variety of private sector
operators, it\'s about 1000 companies and relevant public authorities,
form a cooperation network called the National Security of Supply
Organisation. These pools, work together across sectors to ensure
security of supply and critical functions of society, such as
telecommunications, logistics, food supply, financial services, and
energy.

When we think about resilience, the role of individual people cannot
also be overlooked. Resilient people are in the foundation of our
resilient society. They play a major role in the preparedness, alongside
government institutions. Based on my experience so far, one of the
strengths in my country has been people\'s trust in authorities, for
example in following guidelines and restrictions. In addition, I want to
emphasise the importance of a good social safety net, in promoting
national resilience. This is a cornerstone of our Nordic Welfare
Society.

For example, [[if you don\'t provide]{.underline}]{.mark} people with
necessary [[health care during a pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark},
undiagnosed and untreated [[diseases will be a **heavy burden** for
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, later on. As another example, I want to
mention homelessness, of course, Finland has set a goal for no
homelessness in Finland, in 2027, and to halve homelessness by 2023.
This is an ambitious goal, but our efforts are paying off the number of
homeless people is declining. Homeless people are extremely vulnerable
to different crimes, and of course we are living in quite harsh climate.
This is a matter of internal security and resilience in many ways,
although often considered only a social security issue, but there is a
strict connection between this phenomenon, and also to certain crime
levels for example.

As an example of promoting resilience and awareness, I would also like
to mention the Finnish National Defence Courses. I have also been on
one, usually I have a pin here, but now it\'s in a different jacket. The
goal of these courses, is to provide leaders in both civilian and
military organisations, with an overview of Finland\'s foreign security
and defence policy. The courses also promote [[**collaboration**
between]{.underline}]{.mark} key [[people working in different areas of
comprehensive security]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
[[means]{.underline}]{.mark} that when [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
participate in the courses we meet other decision makers in key areas of
our society.

And we practically [[practice on how to work together
in]{.underline}]{.mark} unexpected circumstances and in [[crisis
situations]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example we ran a simulation where I
was a Minister, at the time, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} now I get to use
that lesson learned from there as a State Secretary in an actual
Ministry. And then to critical infrastructure protection. Maybe I would
start by saying that it is clear that European societies are
characterised by a web of complex interdependencies where private sector
actors have a growing role, the changed security environment has
[[forced us to consider how disruptions]{.underline}]{.mark} in critical
services and technologies [[can **escalate the de-stabilisation** of our
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

public health and biosecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} for so long.

The response to COVID-19 has shown that
[[simulations]{.underline}]{.mark} and other efforts [[on pandemic
preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark} and response [[may have underestimated
the single most important factor enabling]{.underline}]{.mark} some of
the most [[effective responses]{.underline}]{.mark} to the COVID-19
crisis: the [[revolutions in biotechnology and the
bioeconomy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Turn Back Time

Although pandemic simulations aren\'t much in demand these days, we can
run two hypothetical scenarios that highlight the impact of new
biotechnologies on pandemic preparedness and response.

In the first hypothetical, imagine if SARS-CoV-2 emerged not in 2019,
but, rather, ten years earlier, in 2009. \"COVID-09,\" if you will.

The response to a COVID-09 pandemic would have been radically different
from the COVID-19 response. And much more difficult. To illustrate the
point, consider the response to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-10 and focus
on two major pillars of the COVID-19 response---vaccines and detecting
and tracking variants.

[[Vaccines have been our **best** tool to manage]{.underline}]{.mark}
the risk and impact of [[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19. By the end of
the H1N1 pandemic, countries had administered over 350 million doses of
influenza vaccines by leveraging the significant existing influenza
vaccine manufacturing capacity. For comparison, nations have
administered over 9.8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines that were
developed and manufactured with unprecedented speed and scale in
response to a novel virus. In particular, the leading COVID-19 vaccines,
the mRNA vaccines, moved from the lab bench to billion-dose scale over
the last decade.

How about variant detection and tracking? Identifying and tracking the
emergence of COVID-19 variants---for example, delta and omicron---that
might pose an increased public health risk has been essential to
informing responses to the pandemic. The speed and scale at which these
tasks have happened during COVID-19 would have been impossible a decade
ago. During the H1N1 pandemic, the United States sequenced less than
10,000 influenza samples. Today, over 7 million SARS-CoV-2 sequences
have been shared with the GISAID Initiative. And artificial intelligence
is being used to analyze volumes of sequencing data to provide advance
warning of high-risk variants and to inform the production of adapted
vaccines---something that would have been science fiction in 2009.

The Biotechnology Revolution

What happened [[between 2009 and today]{.underline}]{.mark}? How did we
get from 350 million doses of vaccine and 10,000 sequences during the
H1N1 pandemic, to 9.8 billion doses and 7 million sequences---and
counting---in the current pandemic?

Comparing the two pandemic responses creates challenges, but [[the
difference in the ability to deploy vaccines and detect and track
variants is remarkable]{.underline}]{.mark}. And lessons from the
comparison hold promise for pandemic preparedness and response moving
forward.

No matter how many simulations we convened, the world largely did not
take the risk of pandemics seriously before COVID-19. Even after H1N1,
we were unprepared.

In 2017, a World Bank working group recognized that investments in
health security were generally neglected, outside of bursts of panicked
activity, usually in response to the latest outbreak. In 2019, the
high-level Global Preparedness Monitoring Board issued its first report
just months before the world mobilized in response to COVID-19 and noted
that countries remained unprepared, \"For too long, we have allowed a
cycle of panic and neglect when it comes to pandemics: we ramp up
efforts when there is a serious threat, then quickly forget about them
when the threat subsides.\"

So, if big investments in pandemic preparedness and response were not
the primary driver of the new biotechnology capacities brought to bear
against COVID-19, what was?

The answer is the bioeconomy.

The Bioeconomy Revolution

[[Today\'s bioeconomy is the major reason]{.underline}]{.mark} why our
biotechnology tools for responding to COVID-19 are so much better than
they were for H1N1 in 2009.

[[The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development defines the
bioeconomy as \"the set of economic activities relating to the
invention, development, production and use of biological products and
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Traditionally, these activities have
been concentrated in the pharmaceutical sector, and most people probably
still associate biotechnology with medical applications. But that\'s
changing quickly.

Since the H1N1 pandemic, DNA sequencing has become important to many
economic activities. This need has increased incentives to improve
sequencing technologies and has contributed to the substantial drop in
cost of sequencing DNA. For example, the costs associated with DNA
sequencing were 100 times cheaper in 2019 than in 2009. As a result, DNA
sequencing has become a fundamental capability within the modern
bioeconomy.

[[As the costs of biological engineering drop]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
as production processes utilize automation, artificial intelligence, and
data-analytics, [[the bioeconomy is moving **beyond** health
care]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, [[many]{.underline}]{.mark}, if not
most, of the [[cutting-edge applications]{.underline}]{.mark} of
biotechnology that will shape the future bioeconomy [[are outside of
human health.]{.underline}]{.mark} More and more, biotechnology
contributes [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} products and processes we rely on
for agriculture, food, consumer goods and services, materials, and
energy.

Another reason the bioeconomy is expanding beyond health care is that
new biotechnology tools increasingly [[offer solutions
to]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[major environmental and social
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} we face today. Biotechnology offers new
means to address not only pandemics but also climate change, food
insecurity, and biodiversity loss. For example, biotechnology stands to
play an essential role in removal and reduction of atmospheric carbon.

The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that, when combined with
public sector leadership and support, the bioeconomy offers ready
capacity for biosurveillance, environmental monitoring, and continuous
development and large-scale production of diagnostics, therapeutics, and
vaccines.

Fast Forward

With that in mind, imagine that, in 2029, the world confronts a novel
coronavirus as or more dangerous than SARS-CoV-2. What might [[the
bioeconomy]{.underline}]{.mark} look like [[when COVID-29
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}?

The McKinsey Global Institute has estimated that the bio-based economy
[[could create]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately \$2 trillion to [[\$4
trillion of direct annual economic impact]{.underline}]{.mark} over the
next ten to twenty years. In addition, up to 60 percent of the physical
inputs to the global economy---such as wood, livestock, plastics, and
fuels---could be made through biotechnologies, with up to 30 percent of
private-sector research and development spending focused on
biology-related industries.

With a bioeconomy that big and dynamic, the cutting-edge biotechnology
that produced [[the fastest vaccine development and manufacturing in
history]{.underline}]{.mark} in response to COVID-19 [[is only a preview
of the contributions that biotechnology could make to pandemic
preparedness and response in 2029]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Imagine what such a vibrant bioeconomy might make possible in responding
to COVID-29 in areas where problems have emerged with COVID-19, such as
inequitable vaccine access. For example, in a more advanced bioeconomy,
envisioning a global network of \"evergreen\" vaccine manufacturing
capabilities across both high- and low-income nations is plausible when,
between pandemics, these biomanufacturing facilities are busy providing
day-to-day solutions for, among other things, food insecurity and
climate change.

The response to COVID-19---and the COVID-09 and COVID-29 hypothetical
scenarios---suggests that [[policymakers around the world should take
full advantage of the growing global bioeconomy]{.underline}]{.mark} in
improving pandemic preparedness and response strategies and
capabilities. The bioeconomy of the future offers our best shot at
ending the panic-and-neglect cycle in pandemic policies, [[developing
better tools for preventing, detecting, and responding to epidemics and
pandemics, and supporting sustainable development around the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Cooperating with International Organisations

As part of a coordinated approach, [[NATO is working closely with other
international organisations]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the
[European Union]{.underline}, the [United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,]{.underline} the [World Health
Organization and]{.underline} the United Nations [World Food
Programme]{.underline}.

Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, we have strengthened our cooperation
with the European Union. NATO and EU staffs have been exchanging
information on steps taken by both organisations to support NATO Allies
and partners during the crisis. This ensures that our efforts are
coherent, complementary and transparent. [[Following a global request by
the United Nations for airlift support in response to
the]{.underline}]{.mark} COVID-19 [[pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
July 2020 [[flights coordinated by NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster
Response Coordination Centre]{.underline}]{.mark} transported a field
hospital from Europe to Accra, Ghana. The flights were operated by the
United Kingdom Royal Air Force.

[[With commercial flights **disrupted** and the cost of cargo flights
having **escalated**, this support came at a crucial
time]{.underline}]{.mark}.

How NATO is helping to curb the pandemic

Since the start of the crisis, NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response
Coordination Centre has coordinated requests from the United Nations
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and 18 NATO and
partner countries, garnering more than 130 responses in return.

[[Logistics support provided by the NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Support
and Procurement Agency has helped Allies and partners [[achieve
economies of scale]{.mark}]{.underline} in purchasing COVID-19 relief
materialSeveral Allies and the NATO

Support and Procurement Agency have also helped Allies and partners in
acquiring and transporting urgent relief items to countries in need
through the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC), and the Strategic
Airlift International Solution (SALIS) programmes, as well as through
commercial chartered flights and sealift. In total, around 1,500 tonnes
of medical supplies and equipment were transported to Allied countries,
including Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Netherlands, as well as
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and Poland.

In the first half of 2020, [[almost **half a million** troops from NATO
militaries have supported civilian efforts]{.underline}]{.mark},
building field hospitals, helping with testing, transporting patients,
distributing medical equipment, conducting repatriation, helping with
decontamination, making available laboratories, quarantine facilities,
establishing triage centres and supporting border security across the
Alliance.

Military forces from NATO Allies:

• flew more than 350 flights to transport medical personnel;

• transported more than 1,000 tonnes of equipment;

• helped build almost 100 field hospitals and over 25,000 treatment
beds.

Since the start of the pandemic, the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response
Coordination Centre coordinated critical support for several Allies and
partners in need. [[Deliveries of vital medical supplies from NATO
Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and partners in the first half of the year
have [[eased the burden on the national healthcare systems and helped to
save lives]{.underline}]{.mark}. Allies also helped each other through
bilateral forms of assistance. Spain for example received support
including from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, Poland and Turkey. Italy received support including from
Albania, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Poland,
Turkey and the United States.

3.4. Stage 3: Dynamic Consultation Mechanism for Transnational
Information Sharing and

Action Review

Based on the governance practices of countries tailored to local
conditions, [[experimentalist governance requires]{.underline}]{.mark}
that the [[**multilateral** platforms of international
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} need to further review and supervise
the actions of the country, [[so as to realize the integration of
"bottom-up" and "top-down" governance. International
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} and other specialized associations
[[need to review and supervise]{.underline}]{.mark} [[governments'
implementation of the governance of dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. We believe that to achieve effective
review and supervision functions, international organizations need to
establish a dynamic consultant mechanism for transnational information
sharing, and ensure that the governance of international organizations
and specialized associations is self-regulated and connected by
legislation and regulatory policies of governments of various countries.

Under the current framework of international biotechnology security
governance, the Biological Weapons Convention still has the most
powerful binding force. Therefore, under the framework of the BWC, a
scientific advisory committee of scientists from developed and
developing countries that takes into account the interests of developed
and underdeveloped countries should be established as soon as possible
to conduct regular information tracking, risk research and evaluation,
and information sharing so as to strengthen risk management of dual-use
biotechnology worldwide. Each contracting party may formulate its own
laws and regulatory policies according to the risk evaluation of
dual-use biotechnology carried out by the Scientific Advisory Committee
of the Biological Weapons Convention, based on the self-regulation
established by international professional associations and other
international organizations. Biologists and enterprises, as important
objects of dual-use biotechnology governance, while joining
international professional associations and other international
organizations to constantly improve their self-regulation, have also
achieved a dynamic negotiation process for governance subjects (see
Figure 2).

Regarding the governance of dual-use biotechnology risks, it is
necessary for international organizations to re-examine and update set
principles and objectives as well as to strengthen and specify the key
content under the circumstance of the continuous improvement of
technology application and R and D level.

We believed that the [[global cooperation on risk management of dual-use
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[may benefit from a window of policy
opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn global attention to
global health governance and biosafety, both of which are essential in
**forging a consensus** on global governance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Despite the volatile international climate, many governments have
prioritized responding to and solving the challenges in global
governance. [[The Ninth Review]{.underline}]{.mark} Conference [[of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} States Parties to the [[Biological Weapons
Convention will be held in 2022]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a breakthrough in cooperation is possible.
[[We call on the world to take advantage]{.underline}]{.mark} of this
opportunity [[and allow biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[to benefit

[[Real-world applications are integral to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[successful development]{.underline}]{.mark} and use [[of
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. In the pharmaceutical industry,
[[for instance]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[streamlining]{.underline}]{.mark}
the process of getting [[new treatments to market]{.underline}]{.mark}
is called translational medicine. Standard procedures for proving that a
new treatment is safe and effective include animal models and clinical
trials.

For agricultural biotechnology, this process is less defined. Many
countries, particularly [[members of the European
Union,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[ban]{.underline}]{.mark} the growing of
genetically modified organisms ([[GMOs]{.underline}]{.mark}) or crops.
In countries [[where GMOs are allowed, regulations are often
shifting]{.underline}]{.mark} due to public pressure from anti-GMO
organizations and differing definitions of the term genetically
modified. Once a GMO product enters the market, companies must navigate
the complicated information landscape surrounding GMOs and provide
evidence to consumers that their product is safe.

For environmental biotechnology, [[the processes of getting products to
market has not been established **yet**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[applications]{.underline}]{.mark} of environmental biotechnology
[[often fall outside of existing regulatory
frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark}. Applications often span many national
borders, such as gene drives being considered to help eradicate
malaria-causing mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa. In some cases, these
applications fall outside of national borders altogether, such as in the
case of bacteria designed to break down oil from oil spills.

\" Ethical Issues of Using CRISPR Technologies for Research on Military
Enhancement\" Journal of Bioethical Inquiry (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

The public exposure to several [[unethical experiments conducted in the
United States]{.underline}]{.mark} and abroad [[led to the development
of the Belmont Report]{.underline}]{.mark} (Smith and Master 2014). The
Belmont Report underscores three [[fundamental tenets
of]{.underline}]{.mark} research ethics: [[respect for persons,
beneficence, and justice]{.underline}]{.mark}. Heavily influenced by the
Belmont Report, the Common Rule (45 CFR 46) is an overarching set of
regulations that aims to protect human subjects participating in
research. [[Fifteen Federal agencies, including the DoD, have signed
on]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Common Rule in 1991 with the purpose of
promoting uniformity in how research involving humans is governed. The
Common Rule has several subparts providing additional protections for
vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, human fetuses and
neonates, prisoners, and children (Smith and Master 2014). Provisions
within the Common Rule include the composition and processes of
institutional review boards and informed consent among others. The
Common Rule was revised in January 2017 with an effective date for July
19, 2018.

[[Prior to the Common Rule era, military research involving human
subjects was largely accelerated due to]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of
[[poison gas]{.underline}]{.mark} during World War I and the subsequent
development of a chemical warfare defence programme. During the time
between the two world wars, it is estimated that approximately 60,000
U.S. service members were experimentally exposed to Mustard gas and
Lewistite (Brown 2009). Although the programme ramped down significantly
following the end of World War II, military scientists continued
research and development to seek out more effective compounds that could
act as nerve agents, incapacitating compounds, and psychoactive agents.
An additional 6,720 service members are estimated to have participated
in experiments to test these agents from 1955 to 1979 (Brown 2009).
Experiments were conducted under a shroud of secrecy but were still
based on Nuremberg and Helsinki guidance and emphasized that
participation was voluntary (Brown 2009). Since that time, military
research involving service members has involved everything from human
performance, feeding and nutrition, military medicine, and social
behavioural interactions. Department of Defense human protections
oversight has evolved to ensure more transparency, accountability, and
greater protection for service members and civilians participating in
DoD sponsored research.

[[Each Federal agency has also adopted protections]{.underline}]{.mark}
in their instance of the rule to protect specific populations known to
participate in research they sponsor. The DoD makes additional
provisions for research involving service members. Due to the
superior-subordinate relationship that exists in the military, DoD
research policy provides additional protections to minimize command
influence, to ensure that each individual gives informed consent in
advance, and to limit waivers of informed consent (Amoroso and Wenger
2003). Furthermore, 10 United States Code 980 (10 USC 980) requires that
all human participants of DoD sponsored research be able to give consent
in advance of the research unless such research is intended to directly
benefit the participant, in which case consent may be obtained from a
legal representative (Sec 980 2005). The DoD has developed instructions
that delineate the implementation of the Common Rule and considerations
regarding special protections for service members (DoDI 3216.02, 2002).
[[The DoD has also agreed to comply with]{.underline}]{.mark} all
civilian Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[[regulations]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding the development and use of
new pharmaceuticals, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the requirement to
obtain [[informed consent]{.underline}]{.mark} from human subjects
participating in experimental drug and biologics trials.

### A2 Non-Government CP

#### Reliance on private initiative hampers all NATO operations

https://www.cimic-coe.org/resources/fact-sheets/resilience-through-civil-preparedness.pdf,
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-17-2022)

Why NATO deals with Resilience through Civil Preparedness?

Recognizing that the modern, global environment is characterized by
uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity9. [[New efforts are urgently
needed that extend traditional]{.underline}]{.mark} activities at
territorial [[defence and deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Therefore
[[it is crucial to develop modern approaches to build a society's
capacity to anticipate and resolve disruptive
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} to its critical functions, and to
prevail against direct attacks if necessary.10

The need for Resilience through Civil Preparedness is re-appearing not
just because the landscape of conflict has changed, but also because the
modern conflicts now, target all aspects of states and societies.11
[[NATO forces rely on civilian assets]{.underline}]{.mark} to enable
rapid deployment and support operations across alliance territory.
[[Decades of over-reliance on **private sector capabilities** have left
gaps in the alliance\'s ability to support military
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Lab to field is key to non-scale military use

\"The US Military Is Genetically Engineering New Life Forms To Detect
Enemy Subs,\" Defense One (ermo/sms, Acc:6-8-2022)

U.S. [[Army researchers are focused on]{.underline}]{.mark} getting
synthetic organisms out of the lab and into the field, that also means
getting useful, new reactions out of abundant organisms and finding
[[new nanoscale]{.underline}]{.mark} (one billionth of a meter in size)
[[techniques]{.underline}]{.mark} to engineer those molecular reactions.

"We want [[to move synthetic biology from the laboratory to the
field]{.underline}]{.mark}. That\'s a big thrust of ours and so there\'s
a lot of tool development in order to do that," said Dimitra
Stratis-Cullum, who leads the biomaterials team at the U.S. Army
Research Laboratory. "If you want to move a biological bio-based sensor
to the field you try to ruggedize those organisms. You try to protect
them. You try to encapsulate them. You try to basically increase their
longevity in these harsh environments. So if you had, for example,
embedded in a uniform a sensor that detects a hazard that\'s a bio-based
sensor. And perhaps it also causes more than one color change depending
on the complex input. So there\'s more than one function. Or it would
sense and alert you and also \[decontaminate\] a material for example.
It\'s very difficult now to do that with the organisms that have some
bio tools in them now," like E. coli.

Her near-term focus is "[[using biology to]{.underline}]{.mark} do and
[[**accelerate** the nano-science in traditional coatings that exist
now]{.underline}]{.mark}." The hope is that soldiers will one day be
able to produce or print new coatings in the field to conceal equipment
in the open. "We\'re looking to build next-generation coatings where we
can dovetail into additive manufacturing \[essentially 3D printing\] and
other more point-of-need production technologies." Those could be useful
to "control and minimize detection of our materials or of our assets,"
she said.

Back to the November JHU event, where U.S. Chief of Naval Operations
Adm. John Richardson said the United States, and the Navy in particular,
is investing heavily in synthetic biology [[to better compete with
China, an emerging synthetic-biotechnology
powerhouse]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"We've taken a look at this in terms of its implications in terms of the
operating environment. ... biotechnology as a form of sensing, whether
that be algae, or any number \[of other organisms.\] The ability to
detect DNA as its left behind in the water column, advanced sensors on
the beach heads," he said. "We recently stood up [[Task Force
Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is about getting us back into a
competitive stance in]{.underline}]{.mark} terms of [[ocean

From 18 to 20 May 2021, the Koblenz Multinational Medical Coordination
Centre/European Medical Command (MMCC/EMC) hosted a civil-military
digital event on the subject of biosensors. With 30 high-ranking
lecturers from science and future users, the event offered a
comprehensive programme and forum.

The 130 registered participants [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} approx. 20
countries listened to topical and interesting briefings on the main
topics fitness for duty, [[biosensor technology in support of medical
care]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as ethical and legal provisions
regarding the use of biosensors. Beside the issues from the different
subject and specialised areas like biology, physics, medicine, military
medicine, cyber security, as well as sports and health sciences, a
controversial [[discussion on the use of biosensors]{.underline}]{.mark}
or wearables [[in the medical service was
initiated]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Biosensors in the military

International lecturers demonstrated first positive experience and
illustrated that some of the medical services of [[EU and NATO armed
forces already make use of this tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological
progress. In many situations, military personnel must also go to their
performance limits and even beyond. [[Biosensors]{.underline}]{.mark}
can help to [[support health-promoting and preventive
measures]{.underline}]{.mark}. They offer a particular role in military
medicine, and especially in the treatment of casualties. They can
accelerate decision-making processes, record the medical condition of
the casualties more quickly, and this way relieve medical personnel.

Tried and tested in private life

The sports scientist and passionate runner, Captain Dr Monika Rausch is
supported by biosensors almost every day. \"I monitor physiological and
performance-related data, like my heart rate, running speed, and
distances. Biosensors have long been indispensable in sports, so why not
also in the military?\" asked Rausch.

CAPTAIN DR MONIKA RAUSCH, SPORTS SCIENTIST AND MEMBER OF THE
ORGANISATION TEAM OF MMCC/EMC

\"I am convinced that biosensors can improve military performance and
provide practical support to training.\"

Save lives in critical situations

Lieutenant Alexander Schäbler, who also was part of the team organising
the workshop, can report from his own experience. \"As operations
officer, I have already experienced several grave situations and,
therefore, know how important it is to stay on top of things in critical
moments.\" [[In a mass casualty (MASCAL) incident, the real-time
recording and transmission of casualty data]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
is the data of the injured and wounded service members, [[could be
ensured and, thus, lives saved]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Schäbler.

Biosensors as interface between man and machine

Trust in the evaluation of the data gathered by artificial intelligence
within the scope of casualty care was one of the core issues of the
workshop. Classification of injured and wounded soldiers by means of a
combination of sensors and artificial intelligence, and the decision on
who will receive life-saving treatment and who will not, is not only a
technical but also a moral and ethical issue.

Applications improving and reducing performance

When using biosensors and wearables as a new method for improving the
performance of service members, various ethical questions have to be
answered. Regarding data security, it must be prevented that data
collected by biosensors are manipulated or intercepted. Implementation
of data protection was one of the key issues of this workshop to be
answered in the future.

Focal tasks and challenge of the future

[[MMCC/EMC is involved in the operational use of this promising
field]{.underline}]{.mark} of medical care, which is one of its future
focal tasks. Telemedicine (telehealth) is a highly relevant challenge.
In cooperation with the NATO Telehealth Panel, MMCC/EMC - with the
networking of leading experts in the field of biosensor technology -
will continue to contribute to establishing a community of interest
(COI) on the subject of wearables and telehealth. The workshop provides
the basis for establishing a multinational, civil-military and
interdisciplinary hub. From here, common fields of action and projects
are to be identified in the future.
