## NATO Fails -- Tech Areas

### Best 1NC Ev

#### \*\*Europe won't cooperate on any of the three topic areas

More importantly, [[the Europeans have]{.underline}]{.mark} largely
[[been **unable** to bridge policy divides]{.underline}]{.mark} at
home---[[among member states and between NATO and the EU. Rather than
cooperate internally]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. on how to use an array of [[new
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies to defend NATO nations, [[Europeans
have been doggedly focused on protecting]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[privacy]{.underline}]{.mark} of Europeans---[[highlighting a
difference in cultural values]{.underline}]{.mark} across the Atlantic.
While a critical concern, [[it has often replaced a laser-like focus
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the competitiveness of
[[Europe's]{.underline}]{.mark} own civilian
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[sector]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Meanwhile, Americans have focused intently on limiting China's
technological reach, but have done so unilaterally, without taking the
time to bring Europeans along as full partners in the development of a
strategy. It has been a bad combination. Late to the realization of the
scope and ambition of China's strategic deployment of technology,
surveillance and disinformation, Europe is only now beginning to
consider a common strategy to address these interlinked issues.

The results are obvious. [[Rather than focus on the
connections]{.underline}]{.mark} between technology and the risks to
liberal democracy, common goals [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} artificial
intelligence, data protection or the proper use and limits on offensive
[[cyber weapons, allies have spent their time arguing about taxes,
regulatory differences, antitrust and standard-setting. No structured,
strategically organized transatlantic dialogue currently exists to map
**joint goals** in emerging technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, from
[[artificial intelligence to]{.underline}]{.mark} autonomous vehicles
and factories, aerospace, [[biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark} or Fifth
Generation networks.

### Biotech

#### Biotech discussions lead to strong divisions -- aff's framing increases polarization

Bio-optimism and bio-pessimism

1.4 [[In **all** of the fields in]{.underline}]{.mark} which
[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies may play a role -- [[climate,
food, energy, medicine]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[economy]{.underline}]{.mark} among them -- [[we encounter **both**
utopian and dystopian visions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The emerging field
of synthetic biology, for example, has been compared to the 'green
revolution' in the mid-20th Century and the 'information revolution'
that followed it. Compared to the physical sciences, scientific
understanding in the biosciences during the last few decades has
achieved a very great deal in a very short time. On the other hand,
[[useful biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}, so far, [[been]{.underline}]{.mark} much
[[slower to appear]{.underline}]{.mark} and less transformative
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} public, policy makers and investors may have
hoped or [[expected]{.underline}]{.mark}. External investment has moved
away from the sector, [[business models have been thrown into
**turmoil**]{.underline}]{.mark} and theories of innovation have been
re-examined.3

1.5 As well as uncertainty about the likely scale (or timescale) of the
impacts of prospective biotechnologies, t[[here may also be significant
disagreement about the **nature and desirability** of the
impacts.]{.underline}]{.mark} Experience suggests that few benefits are
obtained without some cost, and that few achievements are secured
without repercussions. This suggests two axes against which attitudes
and expectations concerning prospective biotechnologies may be plotted:
those of impact (ranging from trivial to transformative) and benefit
(beneficial to harmful). As biotechnologies are implemented and
diffused, and evidence begins to accumulate, these expectations may be
confirmed or confounded and the majority of evaluations may converge on
a particular point, although this is by no means necessarily or
inevitably the case.

1.6 [[**Ambivalence** about prospective
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [[may often give way to **polarised
views**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[when key questions]{.underline}]{.mark}
about technology [[are posed **as if**]{.underline}]{.mark} what was
[[at stake was]{.underline}]{.mark} a matter of [[saying 'yes' or 'no'
to]{.underline}]{.mark} some fixed idea of
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark},
rather than considering alternative directions for progress.4 [[The
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[wager]{.underline}]{.mark}, strong
or weak, represents a position taken up in one quadrant of a matrix [[of
possible attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} to prospective biotechnology.
However, it is likely that examples of all these attitudes [[can be
found]{.underline}]{.mark} without too much difficulty in relation [[to
**almost any** prospective biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology.

#### Biotech moral judgments leads to impasse

4.12 [[Different cultures]{.underline}]{.mark} and religions have found
ways of ordering living beings so as to express their relative
importance but also, significantly, their continuity as a class (i.e.
the relatedness, by intermediate steps or degrees of genetic similarity,
of all living beings). The 'great chain of being' developed in medieval
Christianity, for example, with God at its head and other beings
arranged in descending degrees of perfection, has its roots in Plato and
Aristotle; Darwinian evolution, and modern genetics similarly
[[emphasise both continuity and **difference**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
their theories of descent and inheritance. The distinctive autonomy of
living beings is apparent [[in the often **complex** ways in which
living things interact]{.underline}]{.mark} with and transform
themselves and their environment, and by their powers of reproduction,
allowing natural purposes -- or 'ends' -- to be imputed to them.
[[Notions of a natural **order**]{.underline}]{.mark}, harmony and ends
[[are deeply engrained in **almost all** cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}
and bind groups and societies powerfully together. The term '[[the
wisdom of repugnance' has been coined to evoke]{.underline}]{.mark} and
enjoin [[a shared sense of distaste for certain]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological practices that appear 'contrary
to nature' in this sense.260 [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} notion is close
to what, from a less sympathetic perspective, is often referred to as
the '[[yuck factor']{.underline}]{.mark}.261 Where such sentiments are
widely shared they [[can form a]{.underline}]{.mark} powerful basis for
[[moral restraint]{.underline}]{.mark} and, indeed, for positive
legislation262; however, where there are moral disagreements, [[moral
arguments can quickly reach an **impasse**]{.underline}]{.mark} (since
my sentiment towards a given action does not logically contradict your
different sentiment).

#### Biotech incentives lead to distrust

Genetic modification and selection of crops traits

2.8 One of the first biotechnology fields to catch the public
imagination and galvanise opinions was agricultural biotechnology.63
Despite the commercial failure of the first attempts to market GM
tomatoes in the early 1990s,64 take up of the technology in the US has
since proceeded rapidly.65 In the UK, by contrast, brief initial success
with a similar product (Zeneca's GM tomato paste) was halted abruptly by
poor sales.66 Indeed, [[concern about]{.underline}]{.mark} the impact of
[[GM crops]{.underline}]{.mark} on human health, the environment and
economic wellbeing, [[has played a significant part in defining the
political terrain of biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology policy [[in the
UK and]{.mark}]{.underline} continental
[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark},**[67]{.underline}** [[with levels of
distrust and suspicion aggravated by]{.underline}]{.mark} apparently
[[**poorly** **framed**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[attempts]{.underline}]{.mark} on the part [[of policy makers to
engage]{.underline}]{.mark} with them.68

2.9 These [[controversies have been]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[compounded]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} initiatives to introduce GM crops in
developing economies, by [[concerns about economic]{.underline}]{.mark}
and [[social implications]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as concentration of
industrial [[supply chains, ownership of intellectual
property]{.underline}]{.mark}, and selection of products and
technologies that prioritise [[private]{.underline}]{.mark} producer
[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} at the expense of public benefits.
Although the main firms involved use alternatives such as
marker-assisted and genomics-assisted breeding alongside GM (as these
different strategies are likely to have different levels of
effectiveness depending on the traits of interest), [[the major
bottleneck]{.underline}]{.mark} with all of these technologies [[remains
in identifying]{.underline}]{.mark} the combinations of [[genes
and]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[conditions responsible
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[traits of interest]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Blanket bans fail to regulate biotech

(ermo/sms, Acc:7-3-2022)

lisande Nexon, Senior Research Fellow at the French Foundation for
Strategic Research (FRS), noted that [[the
international]{.underline}]{.mark} community has [[witnessed how
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} help
[[address healthcare]{.underline}]{.mark} issues in the context of
COVID-19. Similar impacts, she argued, could be seen in areas like
[[ag]{.underline}]{.mark}riculture, [[environment]{.underline}]{.mark}al
industries, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[materials]{.underline}]{.mark} industry. [[Still]{.underline}]{.mark},
she said, the stakes are high, as [[there are a variety of
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} inherent in biotechnology, including
laboratory leaks, environmental spill over effects and ethical issues.

Both [[experts cautioned **against a blanket approach** to the banning
of certain biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**prevention** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
their [[development as a whole. An appropriate approach would instead be
to focus on]{.underline}]{.mark} legislation and [[multilateral
**cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark}\*\*,\*\* the Committee was
informed. Ms Nexon emphasised that "we need to promote international
cooperation and information exchange," adding that difficulties exist
because, "[[there are **significant** differences between
states]{.underline}]{.mark} -- whether national
[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[regulations]{.underline}]{.mark},
views on \[[[human rights]{.underline}]{.mark}\], [[and financial
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}." The [[promotion of
info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation [[exchanges]{.underline}]{.mark},
emphasis on improved [[transparency]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a general effort to raise awareness with the
public of potential [[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} inherent [[in
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [[are all
valid]{.underline}]{.mark} lines of action, she argued. To that end,
[[NATO Allies should "train, regulate and encourage
scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} to adhere to these approaches,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[evaluate risks and threats
regularly]{.underline}]{.mark} with academia and scientists. [[It is
important]{.underline}]{.mark} that we are able [[to recognise
whether]{.underline}]{.mark} \[[[an incident related to
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology\] [[was accidental or deliberate,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} whether we can [[attribute]{.underline}]{.mark}
responsibility to a human actor \[...\]."

### LAWS Disputes

#### NATO faces internal conflict over how to approach LAWS

Melissa **Heikkilä**, 3-29-20**21**, \"NATO wants to set AI standards.
If only its members agreed on the basics.,\" POLITICO,
<https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/>
(MDUFF/MSDI, Acc: 6-28-2022)

The problem is that **[NATO\'s members are at very different stages when
it comes to thinking about AI in the military context]{.underline}**.
The U.S., the world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use
of AI in the defense realm. But in Europe, most countries --- France and
the Netherlands excepting --- barely mention the technology's defense
and military implications in their national AI strategies. "It's
absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI strategy before
it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did it exactly the
other way around,\" said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy fellow at the
European Council on Foreign Relations, said: That echoes familiar
transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S. President Donald
Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also highlights the
different approaches to AI regulation more broadly**[. The
EU]{.underline}**\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself
as \"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses
**[and]{.underline}** keeping citizens\' data safe. The
**[U.S]{.underline}**., which tends to be light on regulation and keen
on defense**[, sees things differently]{.underline}**. **[There are also
divergences over what technologies the alliance ought to develop,
including lethal autonomous weapons systems]{.underline}** --- often
dubbed "killer robots" --- programmed to identify and destroy targets
without human control. Powerful NATO members including **[France, the
U.K., and the U.S. have developed these technologies and oppose a treaty
on these weapons, while others like Belgium and Germany have expressed
serious concerns about the technology]{.underline}**. These weapons
systems have also faced fierce public opposition from civil society and
human rights groups, including from United Nations Secretary-General
António Guterres, who in 2018 called for a ban. Geoană said the alliance
has "retained autonomous weapon systems as part of the interests of
NATO." The group hopes that its upcoming recommendations will allow the
ethical use of the technology without "stifling innovation."

#### Many countries in NATO already support LAWS regulations or ban

Jamie **Dettmer**, 6-7-20**21**, \"Possible First Use of AI-Armed Drones
Triggers Alarm Bells ,\" VOA,
<https://www.voanews.com/a/africa_possible-first-use-ai-armed-drones-triggers-alarm-bells/6206728.html>
(MDUFF/MSDI, Acc: 6-28-2022)

A report by a United Nations panel of experts issued last week that
concluded **[an advanced drone deployed in Libya "hunted down and
remotely engaged" soldiers]{.underline}** fighting for Libyan general
Khalifa Haftar **[has prompted a frenetic debate among Western security
officials and analysts. Governments at the United Nations have been
debating for months whether a global pact should be agreed on the use of
armed drones, autonomous and otherwise, and what restrictions should be
placed on them]{.underline}**. The U.N.'s Libya report is adding urgency
to the debate. Drone advances have "a lot of implications regionally and
globally," says Ziya Meral of the Britain's Royal United Services
Institute, a defense think tank. **["It is time to assess where things
are with]{.underline}** Turkish drones and **[advanced warfare
technology]{.underline}** and what this means for the region **[and what
it means for NATO]{.underline}**," he said at a RUSI-hosted event in
London. According to the U.N. report, Turkish-made Kargu-2 lethal
autonomous aircraft launched so-called swarm attacks, likely on behalf
of Libya's Government of National Accord, against the warlord Haftar's
militias in March last year, marking the first time AI-equipped drones
accomplished a successful attack. Remnants of a Kargu-2 were recovered
later. **[The use of autonomous drones that do not require human
operators]{.underline}** to guide them remotely once they have been
programmed **[is opposed by many human rights
organizations]{.underline}**. There were rumors that Turkish-supplied AI
drones, alongside remote-guided ones, were used last year by Azerbaijani
forces in their clashes with Armenia in the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding territories.

#### LAWS have been used in active combat situations

Joe **Hernandez**, 6-1-20**21**, \"A Military Drone With A Mind Of Its
Own Was Used In Combat, U.N. Says,\" NPR.org,
<https://www.npr.org/2021/06/01/1002196245/a-u-n-report-suggests-libya-saw-the-first-battlefield-killing-by-an-autonomous-d>
(MDUFF/MSDI, Acc: 6-28-2022)

**[Military-grade autonomous drones can fly themselves to a specific
location, pick their own targets and kill without the assistance of a
remote human operator]{.underline}**. Such weapons are known to be in
development, but until recently there were no reported cases of
autonomous drones killing fighters on the battlefield. Now, a United
Nations report about a March 2020 skirmish in the military conflict in
Libya says **[such a drone, known as]{.underline}** a lethal autonomous
weapons system --- or **[LAWS]{.underline}** --- has **[made its wartime
debut]{.underline}**. But the report does not say explicitly that the
LAWS killed anyone. \"If anyone was killed in an autonomous attack, it
would likely represent an historic first known case of artificial
intelligence-based autonomous weapons being used to kill,\" Zachary
Kallenborn [wrote](https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/was-a-flying-killer-robot-used-in-libya-quite-possibly/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=SocialMedia&utm_campaign=TwitterPost05202021&utm_content=DisruptiveTechnology_WasAFlyingKillerRobotUsedInLibya%3F_05202021) in *Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists*. The assault came during fighting between the
U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord and forces aligned with
Gen. Khalifa Haftar, according to
the [report](https://undocs.org/S/2021/229) by the U.N. Panel of Experts
on Libya. \"Logistics convoys and retreating \[Haftar-affiliated
**[forces\] were]{.underline}** subsequently **[hunted down
and]{.underline}** remotely **[engaged by the unmanned]{.underline}**
combat aerial vehicles or the **[lethal autonomous weapons
systems]{.underline}** such as the STM *Kargu*-2 \... and other
loitering munitions,\" the panel wrote.

#### NATO lacks a unified response to LAWS, regulation or ban is needed to reconcile differing view between member nations

Brian **Michelson**, 2-23-20**21**, \"Why NATO Needs Lethal Autonomous
Weapon Standards,\" CEPA,
<https://cepa.org/why-nato-needs-lethal-autonomous-weapon-standards/>
(MDUFF/MSDI, Acc:6-28-2022)

While there is no agreed-upon international definition of lethal
autonomous weapons systems, the U.S. Department of Defense [defines
them](about:blank) as "weapon system\[s\] that, once activated, can
select and engage targets without further intervention by a human
operator." While these are not Schwarzenegger-style Terminators and
still have a degree of human control over them, **[the technology
enabling these systems is maturing rapidly, and military necessity will
increasingly demand that these systems gain broader parameters of
autonomous action]{.underline}**. Yet despite the complexity of these
systems and the inevitability of their proliferation, **[NATO does not
currently have a [common standard](about:blank) for their use or
development]{.underline}**. In fact, **[some NATO countries even
have [opposing views](about:blank) of how to handle them]{.underline}**.
NATO standards are designed to ensure compatibility among weapon
systems, communication architecture, and a host of other warfighting
systems. The 7.62mm small arms round is a good example of this. But what
is the 7.62mm equivalent standard for the development and employment of
autonomous weapon systems? **[This opens a host of related
questions]{.underline}** regarding the employment of these systems:
**[What Identification -- Friend -- Foe (IFF) capability should ground
and air units require to prevent fratricide? What degree of certainty
does a lethal autonomous weapon system require before final
engagement?]{.underline}** What level of collateral damage is
acceptable? What degree of compatibility between systems is required?
Should all these parameters (and others) be adjustable, and if so, at
what command level? The attendant ethics also need to be addressed.
NATO's experience in Afghanistan was a case study in the challenges of
coalition warfare. Differing risk tolerances, legal requirements,
ethical views, domestic political concerns, and at times simply combat
capability, all combined into to complex policy cocktail that impeded
the effectiveness of combat operations. While modern militaries have
accountability, legal, and ethical systems incorporated into their
command structures, they are not uniform and leaders in differing
militaries have varying degrees of authority. The key questions hinge on
two issues: Who gets to decide to employ an autonomous weapon, and who
is responsible should things go wrong? The Kunduz hospital strike in
October of 2015 was driven primarily by human error. Responsibility was
fixed on the chain of command and 16 leaders
were [disciplined](about:blank). Who will be responsible if a member
nation conducts a NATO-authorized strike and it goes terribly wrong? If
this framework is not thoroughly established ahead of time, not only is
it likely that commanders may hesitate to use this capability, the
risk-aversion inherent in bureaucracies may limit the development of
autonomous weapons that will be needed in future conflicts. **[In the
emerging field of lethal autonomous weapons, establishing a common NATO
standard for]{.underline}** the **[development and use]{.underline}** of
autonomous weapons will help address the gap in capabilities among NATO
member nations. By establishing these standards, nations **[can ensure
that]{.underline}** their defense expenditures on autonomous weapons
**[will create systems that are]{.underline}** interoperable, **[able to
contribute to NATO's capability, and can be employed within defensible
ethical guidelines.]{.underline}**

### Piecemeal

#### Plan cannot unify NATO on tech -- not coordinated to overcome taxes & 6G -- plan's piecemeal NATO-only approach fails

Acc:7-3-2022)

Start with a Transatlantic Technology Forum

[[To emerge from the toxic spiral allies have created
around]{.underline}]{.mark} hardware issues like
[[5G]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[regulation
of U.S. tech giants]{.underline}]{.mark} like Google, Facebook and
Apples platforms. Those issues are now complicated by the newer problem
by the spread Chinese and other apps into our phones and our lives. To
deal with these networked challenges [[we need a
**network**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We would urge a single Forum: [[A
broader, **coordinated** structure designed to marshal the plethora of
issues]{.underline}]{.mark} in transatlantic technology policy,
[[instead of]{.underline}]{.mark} the usual [[**piecemeal**
conversations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There are many ways to design [[such a Forum]{.underline}]{.mark}---but
it [[must be an **action** group]{.underline}]{.mark}, not a set of
bureaucratic study groups. [[We favor]{.underline}]{.mark} the
recommendation of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Bipartisan [[Cyber
Solarium]{.underline}]{.mark} group that the White House needs a senior
cyber coordinator, who may also be a Deputy National Security Advisor
(with appropriate staff and structure); if the White House is not at the
center of this discussion, the U.S. will not have authority to speak
within the Forum. Europeans, for their part, would need to stand up
their own coordination mechanism between the EU Commission and member
state governments, perhaps with an EU Tech Envoy who holds real
authority and a NATO Cyber and Tech Envoy to consider the security
implications of each move. Taken together, these executive roles should
serve to oversee the whole range of inter-linked issues.

[[Specialized sub-working groups, such as the]{.underline}]{.mark}
proposed [[EU--US Tech and Trade Council should address digital
**taxation** and **platform** regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} in
particular. [[Other key issues include]{.underline}]{.mark} digital
supply [[chain security]{.underline}]{.mark}; joint [[industrial
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}; digital currency and
[[blockchain]{.underline}]{.mark} strategies; anticipatory [[joint
standard-setting]{.underline}]{.mark} to avoid being pre-empted by
Russian and Chinese measures; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[innovative
ways to combat]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[weakening of the fabric of our
democracies]{.underline}]{.mark} by tech-driven interference. To address
these issues, [[the Forum would need to deliberately cut **across**
NATO, the EU, and **many** different departments of the U.S.
government]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[it must **also** include the
private sector, R&D institutions, infrastructure operators and civil
society]{.underline}]{.mark}. A NATO--EU Statecraft Initiative on Cyber
should support this Forum, expanding on the NATO2030 plans announced in
late November 2020. In coordination, a standing-group convened by the
Forum would drive the transatlantic norm-setting process where Russia
and China have recently dominated, such as in the UN Group of
Governmental Experts (UN--GGE) with like-minded democracies as part of a
"Tech10" with the U.S. and European countries at the core.

To launch this new type of strategic cooperation in good faith, however,
w[[e will first need a **truce** on a number of issues currently causing
**acrimony** in the transatlantic tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[relationship, including]{.underline}]{.mark} on planned [[digital
taxes]{.underline}]{.mark} by individual member states. The time it will
take for the Commission's Digital Services Act and the Digital Compass
to be addressed by the European Parliament and EU Member States should
also be used to broaden and elevate transatlantic cooperation through
the Transatlantic Technology Forum. We suggest:

Enhance joint industrial policy to develop viable Western technology
competitors. It's not enough to try to insulate the West by cutting off
Chinese access to U.S. and European markets. U.S. and European
governments, in cooperation with major technology companies, must
develop joint industrial policies and ethical standards to create viable
Western competitors in 5G and other emerging technologies. These may
include embracing open architectures that would essentially allow the
West to develop a variety of different kinds of systems that would run
on common, inexpensive hardware. We must recognize that we cannot beat
Chinese products without similarly capable, and similarly priced,
products of our own.

Retaining the "U.S. market reserve" for European providers Ericsson and
Nokia, perhaps even joining forces with [[a U.S.--based
chip-maker]{.underline}]{.mark} could set a real counterpoint to Chinese
advances. This will require recognition that 5G is not just another
iteration of existing services; it is a rewiring of the Internet.
Recognizing this fact, Congress should extend R&D funding into 5G
software standards to transatlantic partners, recognizing that this is
as essential to weaving together common defenses as the [[Joint Strike
Fighter]{.underline}]{.mark} is to weaving together NATO allies. The
West---transatlantic allies plus, eventually other technologically
advanced democracies---must develop [[a shared funding pipeline for
5G/6G and]{.underline}]{.mark} an emerging tech joint research platform
(funded in part by joint government initiatives, but not government
administered). The EU 5G toolbox and risk assessment mechanisms along
the value/supply chain could be enhanced with U.S. and European
intelligence assessments. Applying jointly agreed regulatory pressure to
domestic technology distributors on each side could force the adoption
of security standards throughout supply chains. Building "[[Clean
networks]{.underline}]{.mark}," a Trump era initiative worth building
on, free of Chinese technology, could even be considered part of the 2%
GDP goal in NATO.

As detailed elsewhere in this report, joint priorities to curtail
Chinese overreach should be immediate priorities. These could include
the pursuit of a transatlantic export control regime and expanded
investment screening standards. Clearly, there must be improved
commercial intelligence exchange to push back against Chinese

### Tensions disrupt tech coop

#### Plan isn't interdisciplinary cannot drive politics, but politics can disrupt implementation

With respect for the need to be strategic, this potential barrier
reflects the need for effective science diplomacy to reach outside of
science. [[Rarely]{.underline}]{.mark}, if ever, [[does science and
technology itself **drive** foreign policy; the
potential]{.underline}]{.mark} national security, economic, or other
national- and international-level [[consequences of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the application of science and [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology to
human endeavors [[is where science intersects with
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} predominantly. Science and technology can be
causal, intervening, or determinant factors. The ability to recognize,
communicate, and identify nodes for intervention, change, or influence
are strategic requirements for effective science diplomacy.

[[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} international [[legal and regulatory
approaches to]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies and to emerging
technologies---robotics, [[biotechnologies]{.underline}]{.mark},
synthetic genomics, gain of function research, nanotechnology, cognitive
neurosciences, hypersonics, [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[are still
driven by 20th-Century]{.underline}]{.mark} (or earlier) [[conceptions
and institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Past methods for other
technologies that do not take into account the international nature of
the science and the industry are not adequate. [[Any international
regime]{.underline}]{.mark} or approach [[must be **interdisciplinary**
in focus, cognizant of the **multi**-polar post-Cold War world]{.mark},
and]{.underline} appreciate the role of [[**private**
funders]{.underline}]{.mark}, commercial development, [[**and**
transnational corporations]{.underline}]{.mark}. To be clear, there's a
lot of good in the arms control and nonproliferation existing
institutions. Rather, [[these challenges are primarily **political**
rather than technical]{.underline}]{.mark}. Being able to navigate and
affect policy at the interface of science and international affairs is
where we have immense value.

[[The tension between adoption and governance of
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[must be]{.underline}]{.mark}
considered as [[**part** of the balance of power]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The utility of treaties may be better viewed as more than only a
guarantee against using a weapon. Weapons treaties were never an
ironclad guarantee that weapons would not be used. Treaties provide
stability, reduce uncertainty; enable dialogue, and are confidence
building measures. The utility of weapon prohibition treaties as
balancing should not be ignored, not because of an idealized imagination
that prohibition effectively and permanently limits proliferation or use
of a technology but because the act of meeting, networking, building
relationships, and negotiating provides a forum for interacting and
addressing underlying issues. From this standpoint, governance
approaches should be integral to an integrated military strategy for
future capabilities development, not the afterthought that attempts to
put the metaphorical genie back in the bottle.

## External Issues Gut NATO Coop

### NATO Distrusts USA

#### NATO is brain dead -- tensions preclude political cooperation

\"Difficult for NATO to reach consensus,\" No Publication (RyleeR/MSDI,
Acc:7-4-2022)

As the European countries are seeking more independence in diplomacy and
security issues, the [[US\' **leadership** in the organization and its
ability to balance the interests of relevant parties in it is
**weakening**. No wonder]{.underline}]{.mark} French President Emmanuel
[[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} once [[said that NATO is
\"**brain-dead**\".]{.underline}]{.mark}

Originally, the subject of this video conference was neither the Eastern
Mediterranean nor the relationship between Turkey and the United States.

According to the original agenda, the theme of the meeting was the
\"NATO 2030\" reform proposals.

The foreign ministers of the [[NATO member states discussed 138 reform
recommendations]{.underline}]{.mark} during the meeting, which will be
submitted for discussion and approval of the state heads, including the
determination that Russia will remain NATO\'s biggest opponent over the
next 10 years; that China is not an opponent of NATO and NATO needs to
engage with China on issues such as arms control and climate change.

[[Although the organization vows to make its decision-making more
democratic and make itself]{.underline}]{.mark} not only a military
alliance but also [[a **political** union by 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}
through carrying out the reform, the [[open wrangling between Turkey and
the US indicates no reform will be easy, and it has a long way to
go]{.underline}]{.mark} before realizing that vision.

#### US allies in Europe distrust the American rhetoric and commitment to the continent

(NBOYLE/MSDI, Acc: 7-4-2022)

[[A series of events]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent weeks has [[created
a widespread narrative that the U.S. is an unreliable
ally]{.underline}]{.mark} and a weak partner. First, the U.S. government
shutdown forced President Barack Obama [to cancel his
trip](https://thediplomat.com/the-editor/2013/10/04/obama-cancels-rest-of-asia-trip/)
to a couple of Asia summits. Then, new Edward Snowden leaks revealed
that the National Security Agency has been spying on up to 35 world
leaders, [including top U.S.
allies](https://thediplomat.com/the-naval-diplomat/2013/10/28/us-german-relations-the-view-from-berlin/)
like German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both events take place against a
backdrop of concerns about U.S. credibility from top Middle East allies,
most notably Israel and Saudi Arabia. Both countries are fearful that
Washington [will cut a deal with
Iran](http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/iran-the-case-rapprochement-9139)
over its nuclear program, and have taken exception to the [Obama
administration backing
down](https://thediplomat.com/2013/10/07/syria-and-the-capping-of-executive-war-powers/)
on its various threats against the Assad regime in Syria. Taken
together, the general sentiment was summarized succinctly by former Vice
President Dick Cheney, when [he observed
that](http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/10/27/cheney-mid-east-allies-no-longer-trust-the-us-enemies-dont-fear-us/)
[["our friends no longer count on us, no longer trust
us]{.mark}]{.underline} and our adversaries don't fear us." Current
circumstances provide a good test case into how nations calculate other
countries' credibility in general, and how the [[U.S. maintains and
loses credibility]{.underline}]{.mark} with its allies in particular.
U.S. foreign policy has often been formulated on the belief that nations
will calculate U.S. credibility based almost entirely on its past
actions. Indeed, huge strategic blunders like Vietnam were predicated on
the arguments that the U.S. couldn't withdraw from the fiasco without
greatly concerning its other allies around the world. America's current
credibility crisis does not support this notion of credibility. Indeed,
America's post-WWII record of supporting allies in these regions is
remarkable. In the Middle East, the U.S. has unflinchingly backed Israel
since at least the late 1960s. Notably, when Israel faced an existential
threat during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the U.S. quickly organized an
arms resupply to Tel Aviv that helped empower the Israeli Defense Forces
to defeat their adversaries. It also immediately approved credits to
ensure Israel could pay for the weapons. It did so despite knowing full
well that the Gulf States were likely to retaliate with their oil
reserves. Despite the immense costs it paid for supporting Israel in
1973, America's commitment to allies in the region has endured. Indeed,
less than two decades later when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and
seemed poise to continue on to Riyadh, the U.S. organized a rapid
response in the form of Desert Shield. It later ejected Saddam Hussein
from Kuwait and restored the royal family there. U.S. support for
Western Europe in general, and Germany in particular, has been equally
remarkable. Following WWII, the U.S. quickly went to work helping to
repair the continent's ravished economies. It also organized
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} to protect Western Europe from the seemingly
imminent Soviet military threat. Although it has continuously prevailed
on Europe to shoulder a larger burden in providing for its self-defense,
its pleas have been rebuffed each and every time. [[The
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} nonetheless [[continues to underwrite the
continent's security nearly a quarter century after the Soviet threat
disappeared.]{.mark}]{.underline} The U.S. has expended considerable
resources on Germany in particular. The Berlin Crises of the early Cold
War were among the closest the U.S. and the Soviet Union ever came to
war during their decades-long rivalry. After the Warsaw Pact collapsed,
the U.S. played an integral role in helping West Germany smoothly absorb
East Germany. The U.S. has an equally strong record in Asia,
particularly when it comes to protecting countries that face a threat
from China or its allies. Despite declaring South Korea outside of
America's security umbrella shortly before North Korea's invasion,
Washington led a UN-effort to repel Pyongyang's attack on South Korea
and restore the latter's sovereignty. Similarly, despite long ago
reaching a rapprochement with the People's Republic of China, the U.S.
has continued to protect Taiwan's territorial integrity. It has done so
at great cost to its relationship with Beijing, including almost coming
to blows with China in the mid 1990s. Thus, [[the current impression
in]{.underline}]{.mark} Asia, [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
Middle East [[that the U.S. is not a reliable ally]{.underline}]{.mark}
cannot be based on a historical assessment of its reliability. Another
theory on how nations calculate credibility comes from Daryl Press. In
his book, [Calculating Credibility: How Leaders Assess Military
Threats](https://www.amazon.com/Calculating-Credibility-Leaders-Military-Security/dp/0801474159),
Press argues that states calculate the credibility of military threats
made against them based on how much the other state has at stake in the
dispute, as well as its capabilities to make good on its threat. If the
state making the threat has a lot at stake in a dispute, and it has the
necessary military capabilities to carry out the threat it has made,
then the target state will view the threat as credible. If it doesn't
have much at stake in the crisis and/or if it lacks the ability to carry
out its threat at an acceptable cost, then the threat will not be seen
as credible. Press' theory better explains America's current credibility
crisis, especially in the Middle East and Asia. On the one hand,
regional allies in the Middle East and Asia view America's military
power as in relative decline. In the Middle East, the U.S. is quite
openly trying to eschew large-scale military commitments. U.S. allies
are therefore concerned that the U.S. will ultimately accept an Assad
victory in Syria and cut a nuclear deal with Iran rather than make a
military commitment large enough to forcibly prevent either of these
outcomes. In the case of Iran, Tel Aviv and Riyadh also worry the U.S.
will reach a rapprochement with Iran in order to reduce the need for a
robust U.S. military presence in the region. In East Asia, the concern
is that [[the U.S. is in decline relative to]{.underline}]{.mark} China,
or at least is too unstable at home or engaged in the Middle East to
make a reliable, long-term commitment to the region. Although the U.S.
has never failed to protect an ally from an aggressor in the past, as
China rises relative to the U.S., deterring or defending against Chinese
aggression will require an ever-greater share of U.S. resources. Leaders
in Asian states wonder if the U.S. is stable or committed enough to make
this [[investment.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Enjoying this article? Click

Asian allies highlights an inherent difficulty for U.S. credibility.
Namely, as a regional hegemon, U.S. allies are inevitably more dependent
on Washington than Washington is on them. Furthermore, regional states
always have more at stake in regional developments than the U.S. does.
To be sure, it is in the U.S. national interest to prevent Iran from
acquiring a nuclear weapon or China from dominating the Western Pacific.
However, an Iranian nuclear bomb is by nature a much greater direct
threat to Saudi Arabia and Israel than it is to the U.S. The same is
true in Asia with China's rise. Although the U.S. has a strong interest
in preventing China from becoming a regional hegemon, it is a much more
indirect than the interest U.S. regional allies have. Whereas China's
regional hegemony would mean the subjugation of its neighbors and their
loss of sovereignty, for the U.S. it would only increase the potential
for China to cause problems in other regions of the globe, including the
Western Hemisphere. If history is any guide, and I believe it is, then
this indirect threat is enough to keep the U.S. strongly engaged in the
Western Pacific. Still, U.S. allies in the region have everything at
stake in this game, and they therefore must always fear that the U.S.
will decide to retreat behind the enormous protective barrier that is
the Pacific Ocean. [[The U.S. can take various steps to lessen ally
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} about this potential, [[but it cannot
eliminate them]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely. And thus, [[the U.S. can
never be entirely credible in the eyes of its
allies.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### NATO was left fragmented in Trumps wake; distrust of the US only continues to grow

**Walt, 18** (Stephen Walt, a columnist at Foreign policy and the Robert
and Renee Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard
university, "NATO Isn't What You Think It Is," July 26, 2018,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/26/nato-isnt-what-you-think-it-is/>)
(NBOYLE/MSDI, Acc: 7-4-2022)

There's no question that [[Trump's handling of NATO has been deeply
disruptive, to no good purpose]{.underline}]{.mark}. After all, if you
want to get tough with China on trade and do more to constrain Iran's
activities in the Middle East, [[a smart strategist would get Europe on
your side]{.underline}]{.mark} and work constructively with them toward
these ends. [[Trump has done precisely the opposite: tearing up the
nuclear deal]{.underline}]{.mark} with Iran, [[starting trade wars with
everyone]{.underline}]{.mark} he can think of, [[insulting European
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}, and driving his own image (and that of the
United States) down to [levels
unseen](https://news.gallup.com/poll/225761/world-approval-leadership-drops-new-low.aspx)
in years. That might suit some of America's adversaries, but it is hard
to see how it advances any of the country's core interests or even
Trump's own stated goals. Even so, [[NATO]{.underline}']{.mark}s present
[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} predate Trump and [[are largely the
result of]{.underline}]{.mark} long-term structural forces. In the
absence of a common, clear, and present danger, sustaining an elaborate
multinational alliance was always going to be difficult, and it is in
some ways a testimony to past diplomatic artistry that NATO has kept
going as long as it has and despite the failures in Afghanistan and
Libya and the divisions that erupted over the war in Iraq. Even if
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} had stuck with the status quo, reaffirmed
the U.S. commitment, and played nicely with Europe's leaders, it would
not have reversed [[the]{.mark}]{.underline} gradual [[erosion of the
trans-Atlantic partnership.]{.underline}]{.mark} A better course would
have been to start a gradual, constructive, and if possible amiable
decrease of the U.S. security role in Europe, making it clear to U.S.
allies that Washington no longer believed it needed to maintain a
security presence there and that it planned to be either completely or
nearly out in five to 10 years. [[The United States might conceivably
remain a formal member of NATO, but it]{.underline}]{.mark} would no
longer station forces there, no longer insist that the supreme allied
commander in Europe be a U.S. officer, and [[no longer expect the
Europeans to fall obediently into line]{.underline}]{.mark} whenever
Washington barked orders. Trade, investment, and tourism would continue,
and U.S. arms manufacturers would be free to sell to European buyers if
these states decided to bolster their defenses. Meanwhile, the United
States would be free to focus on other problems. Contrary to what you
might think, I'm not anti-European, let alone anti-NATO. The alliance
was a bold achievement for its time and one that served both the United
States and Europe well in the past. But as I
[wrote](https://nationalinterest.org/article/the-ties-that-fray-why-europe-and-america-are-drifting-apart-900)
back in 1998: "\[N\]othing is permanent in international affairs, and
[[NATO's past achievements should not blind us to its growing
fragility.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead of mindlessly extending
guarantees to every potential trouble spot, and instead of basing our
foreign policy on a presumption of permanent partnership, it is time for
Europe and the United States to begin a slow and gradual process of
disengagement. This is going to happen anyway, and wise statecraft
anticipates and exploits the tides of history rather than engaging in a
fruitless struggle to hold them back." It was true back then and is even
truer today.

#### Key NATO allies in Europe's trust of the US is depleting fast

**De Luce and Bradley, 20** (Dan De Luce, reporter for the NBC News
Investigative Unit, and Matt Bradley, Foreign Correspondent for NBC
News, "After Trump, foreign allies wonder whether they can trust
America, say former officials," November 15, 2020,

(NBOYLE/MSDI, Acc: 7-4-2022)

[[America\'s partners around]{.underline}]{.mark} the world are mostly
relieved that the end of [Donald
Trump](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/there-will-be-smooth-transition-second-trump-administration-claims-pompeo-n1247309)\'s
chaotic presidency is near, but they harbor lingering doubts about
Washington\'s reliability and are wary of the country\'s polarized
politics even under new leadership, former foreign and U.S. diplomats
say. \"There\'s a feeling that if it can happen once, it can happen
again,\" said James Bindenagel, a retired career U.S. diplomat who is a
senior professor at Bonn University in Germany. Although governments in
[[Europe\[s\]]{.underline}]{.mark} and Asia in particular are reassured
by [President-elect Joe
Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/would-biden-get-tough-china-n1239203)\'s
experience on the world stage and his vow to shore up U.S. alliances,
their [[confidence in America\'s ability to deliver on its commitments
has been deeply shaken]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Trump\'s departure
won\'t automatically restore their faith, former diplomats said.
[[Trump\'s imposition of tariffs and his talk of abandoning the NATO
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}, the foundation of trans-Atlantic ties,
[[stunned Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark}. In talking to German
officials, Bindenagel said the question he hears again and again is:
\"Can we trust the Americans?\" As a result, Biden will have to do more
than merely voice support for NATO and trans-Atlantic cooperation,
Bindenagel said. \"The question becomes: [[Can we re-establish trust?
You can\'t do that overnight, and you can\'t do it with a
declaration.]{.underline}]{.mark} You have to prove it,\" he said.
Bindenagel said one way to begin to restore trust with European allies
would be for Biden to reverse Trump\'s decision this year to withdraw
10,000 U.S. troops from Germany, a move that blindsided Berlin. Biden\'s
team has said he will review the decision. [[Doubts about America\'s
staying power predate Trump. Foreign ministries now see protectionist,
populist currents as permanent features of the U.S. political landscape,
with Americans increasingly questioning alliance arrangements, troop
commitments and the benefits of global trade]{.underline}]{.mark}.
According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, [46 percent of Americans
said](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/12/17/6-views-of-foreign-policy/)
\"we should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate more
on problems here at home.\" When Trump lost the presidential election,
\"you could hear the biggest sigh of relief in human history,\" said
[Kishore
Mahbubani](http://www.nus.edu.sg/thought-leadership/-in-category/thoughtleaders/m/prof-kishore-mahbubani),
Singapore\'s former ambassador to the United Nations and dean of the Lee
Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of
Singapore. But governments in Asia know that it\'s not possible to turn
the clock back and that a deeply divided America can\'t guarantee that a
deal reached today will still hold in four years when another president
might take over, Mahbubani said. \"That\'s the problem. That\'s why
people will hedge their bets,\" he said. \"There\'s a very high
possibility that he \[Trump\] will get in again.\" Mahbubani also said
American\'s struggle to contain the coronavirus has dented the
country\'s image, making it look inept and incapable of managing its
problems. Trump\'s refusal to concede defeat has also reinforced doubts
about America\'s political health. Mindful of China\'s growing power,
Southeast Asian countries would like Washington to rejoin the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, the regional trade pact that was brokered by
President Barack Obama and was promptly dumped by Trump in 2017. But
they recognize that\'s unlikely given opposition to the trade deal in
the U.S. on both the left and the right, Mahbubani said. Margot
Wallström, Sweden\'s former foreign minister, said Biden will be widely
welcomed in foreign capitals as a familiar figure who will work in
cooperation with other countries on climate and other common threats.
\"We can relax a bit in Europe and the rest of the world, because this
is a person we can talk to. And everything starts with that in diplomacy
and in the multilateral context,\" said Wallström, who was Sweden\'s top
diplomat from 2014 to 2019.

### Russia Divides NATO

### Sweden/Finland

#### Sweden and Finland's power disrupts current balances within NATO -- this damages alliance consensus and prevents the plan's passage

Parliamentary Assembly from 2008 to 2011 and the director of the Defence
and Security Committee at the same institution from 2003 to 2007. He is

of Florida) (NEIGH/MSDI, Acc:7-4-2022)

[Clearly [Sweden and Finland]{.mark} have decided that it is time to
[rock the boat]{.mark}. The fact that [two non-aligned state]{.mark}s in
close proximity to Russia want to join NATO now [has strategic
implications]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} --- contrary to what most argue ---
enlarging the alliance to bring in these two [states will change it much
more than previous enlargements did]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Previous NATO
enlargements](https://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2001/s010613g.htm) were
pitched as part of integrating the Central and Eastern European states
into Western institutions, particularly the European Union, more than
explicit protection against Russia. [[Sweden and Finland]{.mark},
however, [are joining NATO solely for the American security commitment
in the face of Russian aggression]{.mark}. This is [likely to exacerbate
tensions in the alliance]{.mark} between those members focused on
building European strategic autonomy, particularly France, and those
more concerned with maintaining a strong transatlantic security
relationship heavily dependent on American military power[. If Sweden
and Finland were confident]{.mark} [in the]{.mark} [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion's ability to achieve meaningful strategic autonomy backed
by military power, [there would be no need to join
NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline} Further, Sweden and Finland bring more
financial and military assets to the table than the states in previous
rounds of enlargement and will use that to shape NATO in their interests
as much as possible. This is likely to lead to a greater NATO air and
naval presence in the Baltic, as well as more of a NATO focus on the
Arctic. On both points, Sweden and Finland will sit closer to the
British position, which has particular political significance in the
post-Brexit environment. Not All NATO Enlargements Are the Same Sweden
and Finland are joining now because of their heightened [sense of
vulnerability](https://time.com/6169708/finland-sweden-nato-expansion/)
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. What is not as obvious,
perhaps, is that fear of Russian military action was not the main factor
that drove many Central and Eastern European states to apply for NATO
membership in the previous rounds of enlargement. [NATO has
enlarged](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49212.htm) since
the end of the Cold War at the request of aspirant states. In 1999,
Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia were brought into NATO. In 2004 the
alliance formally approved the entry of countries that were previously
part of the Soviet Union (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), as well as
Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Albania and Croatia joined in
2009, and Montenegro and North Macedonia followed in 2017 and 2020. In
all of these cases, accession was preceded by a lengthy process to bring
each aspirant member up to certain standards. The question was not just
military compatibility and capability, but also the strength and depth
of democratic institutions. Each aspirant member went through a lengthy
[Membership Action
Plan](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_37356.htm) process, in
which progress was continually assessed in areas such as building an
independent judiciary, establishing transparent election processes, and
constructing a market-based economy. Much of this does not relate
directly to the needs of a military alliance, but that only underscores
that NATO is a political-military alliance. Many of the demands of the
accession process dovetailed closely with the reforms undertaken by each
of these countries in their quest for E.U. membership, which was
precisely the point for most of these states. In the 2000s, E.U.
membership was seen by many of these countries as the more significant
prize and fulfilling the criteria for NATO membership was a means toward
that end. Meeting the milestones set down in the Membership Action Plan
was a way to establish progress toward completing the European Union's
[acquis
communitaire](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/acquis-communautaire),
a much more voluminous package of reforms that must be voted into law by
each applicant to the European Union. NATO membership was seen as a
significant step forward on the path to E.U. membership, and the two
were often discussed as part of a package leading to "[Euro-Atlantic
integration](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/07/27/the-flip-side-of-euro-atlantic-integration/)."
Security from Russian actions and territorial integrity were clearly
priorities for the Baltic states, but most of the countries that have
joined NATO over the past 20 years do not share a border with Russia and
were [more concerned about their
integration](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB959244482836758541) into the
European Union than any threat that Russia posed to them. It is worth
remembering that when the "big bang" enlargement of NATO occurred in
2004, NATO and Russia had recently upgraded the relationship to form the
[NATO-Russia
Council](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50091.htm), Russia
had a [full diplomatic mission at NATO
headquarters](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_50090.htm),
and President Vladimir Putin was still widely viewed [as a
reformer](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/apr/13/20040413-110503-4434r/).
In short, most of the states that joined NATO between 1999 and 2020
lacked the financial and military resources to be significant
contributors to the alliance's military capabilities, and they were more
concerned about integration into a broadly conceived West than their
security from Russia military action. They had limited capability and
incentive to use their political capital to shift the alliance in any
significant manner --- just being a member of the club fulfilled most of
their goals. [[Finland and Sweden have little in common with]{.mark} the
states that have joined [NATO]{.mark} since the end of the Cold War.
They are joining now solely to get a security guarantee backed by
American military power. [They are not new democracies seeking
incorporation]{.mark} into European structures --- [rather they are
highly developed]{.mark} market [economies]{.mark} and longstanding
members of the European Union.]{.underline} Their militaries and defense
industrial bases are [superior to those of many NATO
members](https://www.wdmma.org/ranking.php). As non-aligned states, they
maintained their military capability after the end of the Cold War to a
[degree that most other European states did
not](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/for-finland-the-cold-war-never-ended-thats-why-its-ready-for-nato/).
[[Those factors will affect their direct and indirect contributions to
NATO and give them far more influence than the states that joined in
previous enlargements.]{.mark} They bring significant financial and
military resources to the table and likely will use that as leverage in
NATO policy discussions.]{.underline} Finland's and Sweden's Interests
and Influence [NATO is
funded](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm) by direct
financial contributions by the members and, far more importantly, by
indirect contributions in terms of military personnel and equipment
tasked by national authorities for NATO operations. As for [NATO's
common
budgets](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2021/12/pdf/211216-CB_2022-ExecSum.pdf)
(which are [distinct from national defense
budgets](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm)), Finland
and Sweden are likely to pay approximately 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent
respectively, based on the formula that divides the costs among the
members based on GDP. That may not be much compared to the U.S. share
(16 percent), but it puts Sweden and Finland in the same category as
Denmark. The real influence of Finland and Sweden, however, will come
from their indirect contributions. Finland and Sweden are quite distinct
in some ways (Finland, for example, [still maintains a
conscription-based
military](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/for-finland-the-cold-war-never-ended-thats-why-its-ready-for-nato/)),
but both are better prepared than most NATO members to defend their
territory as well as to deploy forces as part of missions out of the
region. In fact, both were significant contributors to NATO missions
prior to applying for membership, [particularly in the
Balkans](https://www.foi.se/report-summary?reportNo=FOI-R--5060--SE). In
sum, they are not likely to remain in the background in North Atlantic
Council meetings, where the ambassadors from each member state meet to
discuss NATO policy. NATO is an alliance of theoretically equal states
operating by consensus, but those states with the capability to sustain
significant forces as part of NATO missions have a weight in the room
that those who cannot do so simply lack. How might this change NATO?
First, there is likely to be a push for much more NATO focus on [the
Baltic
region](https://www.foi.se/en/foi/news-and-pressroom/news/2019-12-03-expect-russia-to-continue-throwing-its-military-weight-around-not-least-in-europe.html?openExpanderWith=military%2Ccapability%2Cpage).
This is not new, and NATO has devoted particular attention to the region
through ground troop deployments and exercises in [Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/02/nato-baltic-states-sea-russia-military-defense/).
However, the alliance's activities in this region are likely to become
much more focused on maritime and aerial operations. While the small
Baltic states rely on other NATO members for their air defense, Sweden
and Finland have substantial and sophisticated air forces. Both
countries are widely viewed as [punching well above their
weight](https://www.wdmma.org/ranking.php) in terms of their ability to
sustain an air campaign. With the addition of Sweden and Finland, the
Baltic Sea effectively becomes a NATO lake. As such, the alliance's
military activities in and around the Baltic Sea will likely become
deeply integrated with the territories and armed forces of Sweden and
Finland, to include basing. Sweden and Finland will also likely drive
[more attention to the Arctic
region](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/small-non-aligned-sweden-strategic-posture-arctic-part-i/)
as a zone of competition with Russia. NATO has a longstanding interest
in the "high North," but competing concerns have generally relegated
this to the back shelf in terms of NATO priorities. Yet, a wide range of
military and non-military concerns revolve around the Arctic for all the
countries involved, and it will not escape Sweden and Finland's notice
that, with their accession, every country on the Arctic Council will
also be a NATO member except Russia. The Arctic will likely become much
more of a central issue for NATO, and this may exacerbate some tensions
in the alliance. France, for example, is generally a proponent of a more
Mediterranean focus for the alliance. NATO is obviously capable of doing
both, but the balance shifts toward a northerly geographic focus with
the addition of two more Arctic states. Sweden and Finland's geographic
interests will align more closely with those of the United Kingdom than
those of France. In the post-Brexit environment, this will likely
heighten tensions in the alliance between those who favor a strong
transatlantic relationship and those who seek to raise the prominence of
the European Union as a security actor under the rubric of
"[strategic](https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/washington-should-help-europe-achieve-strategic-autonomy-not-fight-it/)
[autonomy](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/europes-defense-debate-is-all-about-america/)."
France is a longstanding leader on this issue and President Emmanuel
Macron has recently used France's term as the rotating president of the
Council of the European Union to push for [strategic
autonomy](https://diplomatist.com/2022/01/18/the-idea-of-strategic-autonomy-as-pushed-by-emmanuel-macron-key-to-eus-strategic-performance/).
By applying for NATO membership now, Sweden and Finland are signaling
where they stand in that debate. Once again, their motivation for
joining NATO now is to pull themselves into a formal security
relationship with the United States. Keep in mind that both are E.U.
members and that the European Union has a mutual defense clause as part
of the [Lisbon
Treaty](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/5/the-treaty-of-lisbon).
If ensuring Sweden and Finland's security were seen in Helsinki and
Stockholm as a goal that could be met through the European Union and
greater European security autonomy, there would be no need to join NATO.
Both clearly want to be part of a security arrangement backed by
American power. As a recent [report from the Swedish Defence
Institute](https://www.foi.se/report-summary?reportNo=FOI-R--5013--SE)
makes clear, Sweden sees the United States as the only power capable of
guaranteeing European security, not the European Union or its members
based on their collective military capability. This is clearly at odds
with France's drive for greater European security autonomy. Every NATO
enlargement changes the alliance, but adding Sweden and Finland will be
more transformative than previous rounds. Sweden and Finland bring
significant capabilities and resources to the table that will be a
welcome addition to the alliance. But [[these capabilities]{.mark} give
them influence that can be expected to [further shift NATO's
focus]{.mark} to the Baltic and Arctic regions]{.underline}. At the same
time, Sweden and Finland's accession may heighten longstanding tensions
in the alliance, particularly with France. [[It will require a deft
diplomatic hand to balance priorities and maintain alliance
solidarity]{.mark} in what promises to be a challenging period in the
transatlantic relationship and European security.]{.underline}

When [NATO alliance
members](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/biden-announce-extension-us-troop-presence-poland-rcna35587?utm_source=sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dfn-ebb)
meet in Madrid this week, one of the featured agenda items is Finland
and Sweden's request to officially join the alliance. The NATO
leadership has welcomed their ascension, with Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg saying the two countries' "membership in NATO would increase
our shared security." Though [member state
Turkey](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/turkey-lifts-objections-finland-sweden-joining-nato-rcna35772)
originally signaled it objected to the idea, it lifted its opposition
after a breakthrough on Tuesday that clears the way for the Nordic
states. [While enlarging NATO might seem like a wise thing to do in
light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [it doesn't take much sober
analysis to conclude]{.mark} that adding yet [more NATO members is
likely to have the opposite effect of what the secretary general
hopes]{.mark}. Instead of lowering the chances of war, [the membership
of Finland and Sweden would increase the risk of future conflict for the
entire alliance]{.mark}; adding [two more triggers for Article 5]{.mark}
--- the provision in the NATO charter that stipulates that an attack on
one is an attack on all --- would [add to the risk of war for the entire
alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline} That would be an unwise course in any
case, but [it's particularly ill-advised given that [it would make
Finland and Sweden more vulnerable]{.mark}, as well. Russia poses no
realistic threat to Sweden or Finland. Since World War II, Russia hasn't
exhibited the slightest interest in territorial acquisition in either
country, and in fact, [Finland and Russia were on friendly
terms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/brief-history-finlands-swedens-strained-ties-with-russia-2022-05-12/)
during the Cold War.]{.underline} In contrast, Russia was consistently
and emphatically clear [for 15
years](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/03/putins-blood-war-in-ukraine-was-15-years-in-the-making/)
that it regarded any NATO expansion along its border in either Ukraine
or Georgia as an existential threat that it would use force to prevent
--- and in fact has done so twice ([Georgia
2008](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/warontherocks.com/2018/08/the-august-war-ten-years-on-a-retrospective-on-the-russo-georgian-war/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!qPDKk56pTlhK6eYU59NxmP4WzOR57526A_vM-RvX7rWezdUZaGhVPfOjyqc7mbG_1Ck7owun76jrCB3Sqm4QO0UpSY8PcIs_LAE$)
and [Ukraine

Thus Georgia and Ukraine had reason to fear a Russian attack. Finland
and Sweden don't. Extending NATO membership to these two countries
wouldn't only burden the U.S., which would be expected to go to war on
behalf of these two Nordic states if they are attacked. It would saddle
Helsinki and Stockholm with troubles, as well. Up to now, if a war ever
broke out between NATO and Russia, both Finland and Sweden would have
been protected by their neutral status. If membership were extended to
both, that protection would be gone. [[If the two became NATO members
and the alliance went to war with Russia]{.mark} in the future, [both
countries]{.mark} [would be]{.mark} thrust almost [immediately into an
armed conflict whether they wanted to be or no]{.mark}t --- and even if
their national interests weren't otherwise threatened. Given their
status as NATO members, [the Kremlin would almost certainly attack
airfields and ports in both countr]{.mark}ies to prevent other allies
from using their facilities to stage attacks against Russia. But there
is an even more fundamental reason to oppose expanding the alliance at
present: It isn't needed. Russia has exposed itself as being [shockingly
weak](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.eurasiareview.com/24022022-russian-weakness-and-the-russian-threat-to-the-west-oped/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!qPDKk56pTlhK6eYU59NxmP4WzOR57526A_vM-RvX7rWezdUZaGhVPfOjyqc7mbG_1Ck7owun76jrCB3Sqm4QO0UpSY8PZ3foZN8$)
in conventional military power, and it is now clear, beyond any
question, that Russian ground forces don't even possess the capacity to
invade the NATO alliance.]{.underline} It isn't entirely clear that
Moscow will be able to capture the entirety of [the Donbas
region](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/05/why-russia-has-failed-to-win-the-battle-for-donbas/),
in the single country of Ukraine, directly on its border. Russia is
constrained in its ability to project power beyond its country by
[systemic
flaws](https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/)
in its logistics system. It is very difficult to get supplies beyond
more than 180 miles away and virtually impossible beyond that without
dedicated rail links. It is understandable that people who live near
Russia would be afraid that one day Russia might invade them as it
invaded Ukraine, and that, no doubt, led Sweden and Finland to make a
sudden U-turn on their long-held preferences for neutrality. But an
unemotional evaluation of their neighborhood shows their fears are
misplaced. Sweden and Finland are at no clearer risk of an attack from
Moscow than they have been for the past 70 years. Though the U.S. has
also recently shown itself [eager to expand the alliance to these
countries](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-meets-heads-finland-sweden-show-support-nato-membership-rcna29621),
the accession of Sweden and, especially, Finland could hardly be said to
further the American national interest. [[Finland shares a roughly
800-mile border with Russia]{.mark} that [NATO would be committed to
defend]{.mark}, and this defense --- or the stationing of NATO military
infrastructure in Finland --- would risk antagonizing Russia. Washington
should at least be clear that if Finland becomes a NATO member, it
expects that the Europeans would be tasked with defending Finland's

### Ukraine Policy

#### Biden confirms NATO tension over Ukraine

Patrick **Wintour** 1/20/20**22**, diplomatic editor for The Guardian,
"Biden lays bare Nato divide over Russia aggression against Ukraine",
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/biden-lays-bare-nato-divisions-over-russia-aggression-in-ukraine,
(MDOCK/MSDI, Acc:7-4-2022)

Joe [[Biden confirmed]{.underline}]{.mark} at his press conference on
Wednesday what has been apparent for weeks -- [[Nato remains divided
over how to respond to Russian aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. His admission of a split was overshadowed
by his passing remark that a minor incursion would be treated
differently to a full-scale invasion. The White House afterwards
clarified that a minor incursion meant cyber-attacks, as opposed to a
movement of Russian troops into Ukraine sovereign territory. None of
this is academic since Biden said he thought Vladimir Putin would risk
an invasion, however much Nato tried to change the Russian president's
calculus with threats. [[The greatest tension]{.underline}]{.mark} over
the correct response [[is between the US and
Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}, hence the visit of the US secretary of
state, Antony Blinken, to Berlin on Thursday before a meeting with
Russian officials in Geneva. Some of the differences are manageable.
Neither of the two main sides of the German coalition are willing to
sell arms to Ukraine, saying [[it is longstanding German
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, based on its war experience, [[not to send
weapons into a conflict zone]{.underline}]{.mark}. The current
vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, caused a storm last year when he
suggested, against that policy, that the Greens might provide defensive
arms, but he beat a fast retreat. [[By contrast the US, the UK and
Turkey do supply arms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Critics point out that the
underlying morality guiding Germany's approach to arms exports is
opaque. According to government figures released on Monday, sales to
Egypt boosted Germany's arms exports to record levels in 2021.
Preliminary figures from the Economic Affairs and Climate Action
Ministry showed Germany exported arms worth €9.35bn (£7.79bn/\$10.65bn)
last year -- 61% up on 2020. This leaves open the question of why it is
acceptable to sell arms to a repressive regime, such as Egypt, but not
to a country seeking to avoid repression, such as Ukraine. On the issue
of energy dependency, the tensions are deeper. A compromise reached last
summer between the US and Angela Merkel, reaffirmed this week by her
successor as chancellor, Olaf Scholz, implies that the Nord Stream 2
pipeline built to carry gas from Russia to Germany will be affected if
an invasion happens. In the absence of an invasion, the Greens and the
Social Democrats (SPD) have for now parked their differences by waiting
to see if the pipeline receives regulatory approval in Germany and the
EU. The SPD want it to go ahead and the Greens do not, but the German
approach -- not just in the SDP, the home of detente -- may be shifting.
A letter from more than 73 eastern Europe security experts in Die Zeit
urged Germany to end its three-decade policy of standing by in the face
of Russian aggression. Solely in deference to Germany, Biden has worked
hard with Democratic senators to prevent them backing sanctions now, but
the issue is still live in US politics, and patience with Germany among
Republicans is thin. Separately there has been a dispute about whether
Russia can be detached from SWIFT, the international payments system.
Some of this is a technical dispute about the legality and effectiveness
of the action, and voices do not all go one way. Katarina Barley, a
vice-president of the European parliament and member of Germany's Social
Democrats, for instance, is a supporter. But the fact that the EU does
not want to meet formally to discuss sanctions in advance suggests it
wants to avoid a row. The risks of fracture stretch beyond individual
punishments to the wider principle of the extent to which the EU should
be running an independent Russia policy. The Americans have undoubtedly
made strenuous efforts to involve European capitals. But on Wednesday
the French president, Emmanuel [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[once
again raised the principle of]{.underline}]{.mark} not just an
independent EU security policy, but [[**explicitly** an independent
European policy towards Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} -- something he has
proposed before, to little effect in Moscow. [[His proposal
**blindsided** the European commission and led to frantic reassuring
calls]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Americans. This is a familiar French
refrain, but [[if the US finds it dispiriting, it should review the
wisdom of]{.underline}]{.mark} going behind France's back to sign the
[[Aukus]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear submarine deal to confront China in
September, [[leaving France humiliated]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
diplomacy, loyalty has to be earned, not just demanded.

#### Ukraine splits path of NATO

diplomatic correspondent in Europe for The New York Times and diplomatic
correspondent in the Washington bureau, NATO Nations See Differing Paths
as Ukraine War Enters Uncertain Stage,https://www.nytimes.com/2
022/04/06/world/europe/nato-ukraine-russia.html, (MDOCK/MSDI,
Acc:7-4-2022)

Faced with the prospect that the war in Ukraine will be long and
grinding, [[NATO countries are divided on how best to manage the next
stage of the conflict and the uncertain period that promises to
follow]{.underline}]{.mark}. Central European members like [[Poland and
the Baltic states want a total break with Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}
and an effort [[to bring Russia to its knees]{.underline}]{.mark}, two
senior Western officials said. They worry that anything that Russia can
present as a victory will do serious damage to European security. But
[[other nations believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Russia cannot be
easily subdued and that the war's outcome is likely to be
messy]{.underline}]{.mark} --- more exhausting cease-fire than
resounding victory. Countries like [[France, Germany and Turkey want to
keep contacts with]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's president, Vladimir V.
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, regardless of the allegations of war
crimes committed by his troops, the officials said. NATO foreign
ministers, meeting this week to discuss how to help Ukraine prosecute
the war, do agree on one major point: The war is far from over and ---
as badly as Russia's forces have performed and despite their retreat
from areas around Kyiv, the capital --- they are making slow and brutal
progress in Ukraine's east. "Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in
Ukraine," Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary general, said this week.
"We now see a significant movement of troops away from Kyiv, to regroup,
rearm and resupply. And they shift their focus to the east." That will
take several weeks, officials believe, as Russian troops move back into
Belarus to be resupplied and reorganized, and then must make their way
with their equipment through Russia toward eastern Ukraine. Image The

from the village had been buried in a mass grave in a forest in

York Times "In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in the
eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to
create a land bridge to occupied Crimea," Mr. Stoltenberg said. "This is
a crucial phase of the war." In response to the scenes of corpses in
Bucha, the United States and the European Union are preparing more
sanctions against Russia, but without much expectation that they will
hasten the end of the war. But at the NATO meetings, the talk will be of
weapons and matériel, not sanctions. There is a general agreement that
Russia is no longer a strategic partner of the alliance, that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is no longer bound by the troop limits of
the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, and that its military posture must be
sharply enhanced to deter a confrontational Russia, so long as Mr. Putin
and his allies retain power there.

[[As the war in Eastern Europe continues to

([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[countries are divided into two camps on
the issue of relations with Russia. While Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and
Estonia push for a complete split with Russia, Germany, France, and
Turkey intend to keep in touch with Russian officials regardless
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the situation in [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}
and the alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops, The New York
Times reported quoting Western officials.

The NATO foreign ministers\' meeting this week, to discuss ways to
assist Ukraine in prosecuting Russia, agreed on one main point - the war
is far from over - and despite their withdrawal from areas around Kyiv,
Russian troops are making gradual progress in Ukraine\'s east, the
report added. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Moscow
has no intention of abandoning its ambitions in Ukraine. He also stated
that there is currently a large movement of Russian troops away from
Kyiv to reorganise, rearm, and resupply and they are shifting their
focus to the eastern region. \"We expect a renewed Russian drive in
eastern and southern Ukraine in the coming weeks, with the goal of
capturing the entire Donbass and establishing a land bridge to occupied
Crimea. This is a crucial phase of the conflict,\" the NATO chief added.
Ukraine shares draft security guarantee with NATO & non-NATO nations
amid war with RussiaAs per The New York Times report, NATO is committed
to providing all kinds of help to Ukraine and around two-thirds of the
alliance\'s members have already provided lethal weaponry, including the
Czech Republic\'s supply of Soviet-era tanks and armoured personnel
carriers. The Czech Republic became the first NATO member to send tanks
and Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV) to Ukraine. According to reports,
this was the first such shipment of heavy weapons to the besieged
ex-Soviet country since the Russian invasion began on February 24. 91%
of Ukrainians want to join EU as support for NATO membership continues
to declineMeanwhile, European Union diplomats failed to approve a new
sanctions package against Russia which was proposed by the European
Commission on Wednesday, April 6. [[Reportedly, the sanctions package
could not get approval owing to disagreements]{.underline}]{.mark} over
the coal embargo. However, the bloc has withdrawn Russia\'s
\"most-favoured-nation\" trade status, which allows EU countries to
impose punitive levies on Russian trade and commerce.

impacting NATO. [[Turkey's purchase of the Russian
S-400]{.underline}]{.mark} system [[against the wishes
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States and its
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies, its
[[unilateral]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[interventions into
Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} against Kurdish forces, its frequent military
interventions into northern [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} (its most recent
air and ground operation was in mid-June), its [[violations of
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} (and likely Venezuela)
[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, its continued [[probing of Greek
airspace, and]{.underline}]{.mark} its recent [[veto
over]{.underline}]{.mark} important NATO plans for the [[defense of
NATO's eastern flank]{.underline}]{.mark} (which was suddenly lifted
days after the naval incident) leads one to
[[conclude]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Turkey is]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[pursuing]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[**national**
interests **over** NATO's collective defense]{.underline}]{.mark}
interests. [[The decision by]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States and
other [[F-35]{.underline}]{.mark} program [[partners to remove
Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark} from the program (although it continues to
contribute to the supply chain) [[will diminish
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} defenses in general as well as its
[[readiness, interoperability, and effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark} of
NATO's air defense capabilities. Likewise, the announcement of
[[France's withdrawal]{.underline}]{.mark} of its forces from NATO's
Operation Sea Guardian following the naval incident with Turkey
[[reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} much-needed [[naval

[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} both the European Union and
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} to jointly enforce the UN arms embargo in

#### Turkey is eroding NATO cohesion and security and disagreements inevitable

(ESIEVER/MSDI, Acc: 7-4-2022)

Yes, it is. In Afrin, Turkish forces have launched a ground offensive
against U.S.-backed Syrian-Kurdish militia. In other words, [[Turkey is
indirectly attacking]{.underline}]{.mark} its main
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} ally. It is doing so with Russian support,
as Moscow controls the skies in the area---the last act in the
rapprochement between the two countries since the 2015 crisis. [[Western
powers have timidly pleaded with Ankara to show
restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}. At an emergency meeting of the UN
Security Council called by France, ambassadors met behind closed doors.
[[They did not publicly condemn Turkey for its actions. Nor there has
been enough condemnation by Western allies of the repeated human rights
violations]{.underline}]{.mark} by Turkey over the last few
years.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has essentially been given
the all-clear to do what he wants, knowing that Ankara's NATO allies
(not to mention the EU) will look the other way. [[The problem with such
irresponsible behavior is that it is not only damaging NATO, it is
undermining the whole Western community]{.underline}]{.mark}---and its
values system. The respect of fundamental rights is what the West has
used to justify the last two decades of wars;[[the damage is soon going
to be irreparable. Turkey is causing an increasing amount of damage to
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ankara has reason for concern about U.S.
support for the Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, given the YPG's link to
the PKK terrorist group inside Turkey; but allied security will not
benefit from Turkey attacking one of the only forces in Syria that can
consistently fight and win against the so-called Islamic State. Only
Bashar al Assad and IS would gain from the defeat of the YPG. And if
Turkey's action in Syria is at least explicable, what was Erdoğan
thinking when he decided to buy a long-range air defense system from
Russia rather than from a NATO ally? The alliance will end up with a
significant gap in coverage on its south-eastern flank. But Turkey's
drift away from democracy and the rule of law damages the alliance more
fundamentally than any individual action. After more than a decade of
rating Turkey as "partly free," Freedom House downgraded the country to
"not free" this year. During the Cold War, NATO held its nose and
tolerated authoritarian regimes in allied countries (including Turkey).
[[These days, shared democratic values glue NATO together. Turkey's
behavior puts that unity at risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. Turkey's recent
brinkmanship policies have definitely damaged the cohesion of NATO and
the current Afrin incursion has the potential to widen the gap. However
unwise Turkey's latest move might be, it does not come as a surprise. It
is not enough that the United States recognized Turkey's legitimate
security concerns along the northern Syrian border only after the Afrin
offensive. Make no mistake: there are many things that Turkey is to
blame for---including, in large part, for not peacefully resolving the
Kurdish question. A solution might have allowed Turkey to agree to some
sort of face-saving agreement with the Kurdish YPG in Syria. But if
there is one thing that Washington and Ankara have in common, it's a
miscalculated Syria policy---and the current situation is the direct
outcome of that. Both the United States and Turkey now face a larger
question: are their long-term goals in Syria attainable? For the Turks,
the incursion not only creates security risks at home (PKK terror
attacks in major Turkish cities had stopped since 2016, but may very
well return); it also risks serving Moscow's agenda to drive a wedge
into NATO. President Erdoğan's agenda may be fuelled by strong survival
instincts and paranoia, but even outside his circles suspicion against
NATO runs deep. It does not take much to make the case for alternative
alliances. [[Turkey has reached a point where the government might be
willing to risk damaging NATO for what it sees as preserving Turkey's
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if this may come at a high
price.[[Any NATO member that purposefully diminishes its democratic
principles and institutions damages the alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Every NATO member is a signatory to the alliance's founding document,
the 1949 Washington Treaty, and its preamble states that all members are
"... determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and
civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law." Although we associate NATO
solely with its military operations, NATO is a political-military
alliance with democratic principles at its core. [[Turkey has so greatly
diminished its democracy over the past several
years]{.mark}]{.underline} that an independent U.S. organization,
Freedom House, has recently declared the country "not free."
Unfortunately, Turkey is not a NATO outlier in this regard but is part
of a growing trend. Poland, Hungary, and Romania are also actively
diminishing judicial independence, institutional transparency, and the
ability to express political opposition; the very essence of democracy.
These countries also damage the credibility of this crucial political
alliance.

But as a critical NATO member, [[Turkey's military interventions in the
Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}---whether it is the shooting down of a
Russian military aircraft or repeated unilateral military interventions
in Iraq and Syria---[[increasingly place]{.underline}]{.mark} Turkey's
national security at risk, which places [[NATO at risk of becoming
involved in the broader regional conflict. Thus, Turkey inflicts ongoing
damage to NATO politically and militarily]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Mediterranean,\" Center for Strategic and International Studies
(ermo/sms, Acc:7-4-2022)

Turkey's Blue Homeland Ambitions

[[Turkey's Blue Homeland Doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark} has its origins
in a plan drawn up by Turkish admiral Cem Gurdeniz in 2006. It
[[sets]{.underline}]{.mark} out [[an ambitious goal
to]{.underline}]{.mark} underline and [[expand]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[through assertive diplomacy and military]{.underline}]{.mark} means,
[[Turkey's influence in the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black
Seas]{.underline}]{.mark} while [[enabling access to
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} and other economic resources. President
Erdogan adopted it in 2015 as an integral part of a national strategy of
"forward defense" in the context of his sustained drive to assert
Turkish independence in all aspects of foreign policy to include
influence in its surrounding regions.

Manifestations of the doctrine were on full display during the February
2019 Mavi Vatan (Blue Homeland) exercise, which was the largest combat
exercise since the establishment of the Turkish Navy and was conducted
simultaneously in the Aegean, Black, and Eastern Mediterranean Seas. The
Turkish government-controlled media described [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
exercise as a "[[war rehearsal]{.underline}]{.mark}." Another example
has been Turkey's assertive energy claims around the disputed Cyprus
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In February 2018, Turkey [[sent naval
vessels to stop an Italian drilling vessel]{.underline}]{.mark} on its
way to drill for gas off Cyprus' coast. [[Then]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the spring of 2019, Ankara sent ships [[into Cypriot
waters]{.underline}]{.mark}, escorted by the Turkish navy, to conduct
its own drilling activities. [[European Union member states unanimously
denounced those "illegal actions]{.underline}]{.mark}," expressed their
support for Cyprus by restricting EU pre-accession aid to Turkey, and
suspended negotiations of an air transport agreement. Israel also
encountered Turkey's naval activism when its oceanographic ship, Bat
Galim, operating in Cypriot waters in cooperation with Nicosia, was
forced out by Turkish warships. Regional tensions reached a new high in
November 2019 when [[Turkey signed an agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}
with Libya's Government of National Accord. The agreement defines a
maritime border between the two countries in the Mediterranean Sea and
permits Turkey [[to defend Libya's maritime
interests]{.underline}]{.mark} (which extend to six nautical miles from
Crete) as well as allowing for joint extraction of energy resources in
the Mediterranean.

To date, Turkey has met little resistance from either the European
Union, NATO, or the United States in response to its actions, with the
exception of harsh words and limited sanctions. Some EU parliamentarians
have denounced Ankara's "gunboat diplomacy," and EU high representative
Borrell released a declaration stating that EU countries are "growing
increasingly concerned about the recent escalations from Turkey." EU
foreign affairs ministers convened on July 13, asking Ankara to provide
"clarifications" on its actions in the Eastern Mediterranean, Libya, and
Syria and asking High Representative Borrell to provide options to
reinforce the sanctions imposed on Turkey for its gas and oil drilling
activities in Cyprus' EEZ. Secretary of State Pompeo has called Turkey's
illegal drilling in Cypriot waters "unacceptable," yet this is unlikely
to be followed by concrete action given that the Trump administration
has not yet imposed legally mandated sanctions on Turkey for its
purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system.

[[This lack of a]{.underline}]{.mark} holistic and [[united
transatlantic response]{.underline}]{.mark} to Turkey's naval actions
has embol[[dened Ankara to take further actions]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly at a time when [[Erdogan seeks to project independent
power]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad [[and heighten nationalistic
sentiment]{.underline}]{.mark} at home to distract the Turkish
population from great economic difficulties. The restoration of Hagia
Sophia as a mosque is a powerful example of this policy in action
coupled with its military interventions in Libya and Syria. Absent
international resolution of the Cypriot and Libyan disputes (which are
on the cusp of bringing in other powers, such as Egypt and Israel),
President Erdogan has (rightly) concluded that Turkey has more to gain
by its unilateral use of hard power and reaching its own diplomatic
agreements that suits its needs rather than through broader diplomatic
engagement and dialogue.

[[Since an extraordinary naval standoff]{.underline}]{.mark} occurred
[[between French and Turkish warships]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
Eastern Mediterranean in early June, [[Paris and Ankara have been
trading]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[sharp verbal
blows]{.underline}]{.mark} over their respective actions in implementing
the UN arms embargo on Libya. [[While this may appear to be just
another]{.underline}]{.mark} moment of [[friction between NATO
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly with Turkey, [[it is
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This incident represents a more
deep-seated **strategic dilemma** for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as well
as an increasingly stark divide between the European Union and Turkey.

This strategic dilemma is [[rooted in Turkey's new regional foreign and
security policy, based]{.underline}]{.mark} in part [[on its "Blue
Homeland" doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark}. The implementation of this
doctrine has caused a series of serious incidents that have been
observed by Turkey's allies but fleetingly, if rarely, addressed.
Encountering little resistance, Turkey believes its actions to be
largely accepted (as some are, such as limiting Russian influence). But
[[the totality of Turkey's policies and actions have now reached a point
of dangerous escalation, which could substantially challenge the
coherence of NATO's collective defense posture]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the Mediterranean and weaken its political cohesion. [[Turkey's
actions]{.underline}]{.mark} threaten to [[hinder]{.underline}]{.mark}
vital [[NATO-EU cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region as well.

To avoid this, allies should approach the growing instability in the
Mediterranean through an integrative policy that seeks to deescalate
tensions and define, with Ankara, common interests by identifying some
agreed principles to guide regional behavior. If Turkey is unwilling to
join such an initiative, greater transatlantic tensions lie ahead.

"The Transatlantic Alliance still needs NATO. The US' allies are its

world, we cannot go it alone.

[[However, keeping the]{.underline}]{.mark} London [[summit on the rails

President Trump could fixate on defence spending and disrupt procedures

"[[Militarily, NATO is stronger]{.underline}]{.mark} than at any time

Second, these tensions reveal troubling divergences between Turkey and
the European Union. [[From the EU perspective, Ankara's aggressive
pursuit of energy]{.underline}]{.mark} interests, [[disregard
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rule of law]{.underline}]{.mark} within
Turkey (which should concern NATO as well), [[and use of migrants
to]{.underline}]{.mark} pressure the European Union and
[[destabilize]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}an
neighborhood [[are at odds]{.underline}]{.mark} with EU values and
interests. In the case of Cyprus, the European Union cannot be an
unbiased actor. It supports its member state Cyprus and its ability to
advance its economic interests within its EEZ according to international
law, as the European Union would with any country elsewhere in the
world. And while Turkey is free to pursue its national interests at the
expense of collective European interests, [[its actions move it **away**
from a more constructive **partnership**]{.underline}]{.mark} or
strengthened economic ties with the European Union.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} a more problematic EU-Turkey relationship
[[further complicates conflict resolution]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts

In 2014, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and seizure of Crimea,
NATO leaders met in Wales for a critical summit. Since the end of the
Cold War, and especially following 9/11, the alliance had shifted its
focus from its traditional mission of defending Europe to operations
abroad. Meanwhile, NATO members significantly reduced defense spending,
downsized their forces, and underinvested in modernizing their forces
following the Cold War. However, Russian aggression against Ukraine
shook the alliance**[; NATO leaders]{.underline}** agreed in Wales that
defending Europe would be a top priority and **[committed to spending at
least 2 percent of g]{.underline}**ross **[d]{.underline}**omestic
**[p]{.underline}**roduct **[on defense by
2024]{.underline}**.^1^ **[This pledge]{.underline}** **[was seen as a
massive step]{.underline}** forward for the alliance, as it **[would
serve to address a growing gap in its capabilities.]{.underline}** Since
the summit, some progress has been made in strengthening the alliance.
NATO members have increased defense spending, deployed forces in Central
and Eastern Europe, and begun investing in needed capabilities. **[In
2019, almost all NATO allies increased their defense spending, with nine
countries hitting the 2 percent goal.]{.underline}**^2^ Most allies have
put plans in place to substantially increase defense spending by
2024.^3^ The alliance is stronger and better prepared to deter Russia
than it was six years ago, despite the divisive approach of President
Donald Trump, **[but significant gaps remain]{.underline}**. **[Marginal
spending increases]{.underline}** by various NATO members
**[were]{.underline}** inherently **[fragmented and]{.underline}** often
**[yielded few new major capabilities or failed to address some of
NATO's serious shortfalls.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, **[many member
states still have yet to adequately invest in their forces, leading to
very low states of readiness and operational strain. Lack of
progress]{.underline} toward the 2 percent** benchmark **[has also
caused]{.underline}** major **[diplomatic tension within the alliance
between the countries meeting their commitments and those that are
not.]{.underline}**^4^ Now, with the COVID-19 crisis hammering the
balance sheets of all NATO members, the prospect for European defense
spending looks bleak.^5^ **[It seems unlikely that there will be
significant new investment to address some of NATO's critical capability
gaps]{.underline}**. Indeed, the European Union---which had planned to
increase funding to upgrade the dual-use infrastructure critical to
moving NATO forces---has reduced its planned allocations in its recent
budget.^6^ NATO members seeking to keep their economies alive are
unlikely to prioritize defense. This is a serious problem for the
alliance, and **[NATO needs to think more creatively about how to
support continued alliance]{.underline}** investment in the wake of the
massive economic contraction caused by COVID-19. **[Simply demanding
that countries spend more on defense, which was not very effective
prepandemic, will certainly not work now]{.underline}**. What has become
apparent is that **[NATO's default focus on individual nation-state
spending commitments was doing little to address alliancewide
issues]{.underline}**. Collectively, European NATO **[members spend as
much on defense as Russia, yet the disaggregated and loosely coordinated
spending by individual states means that the alliance's combat strength
is well short of what it could be and has left critical gaps in its
capabilities.]{.underline}**

#### NATO's spending goals don't translate to defensive capabilities

As the Secretary General's Annual Report for 2018 makes clear, NATO has
many productive initiatives underway that focus on its real security
needs, and that will help deter Russia and deal with the key issues in
its military readiness and force planning. In fact, some 90% of the
Secretary General's report focuses on such issues. At the same time,
NATO does not issue any net assessments of the balance between NATO and
Russia and its capability to deter and fight. It does not openly address
any of the many national problems and issues in current force structure
nation-by-nation strength and readiness, and it has no coherent force
and modernization plans for the future. Setting the Wrong Goals and
Claiming Pointless Progress Instead, **[far too much of
NATO's]{.underline}** public profile is **[focused on goals that are not
only meaningless, but actively counterproductive]{.underline}**.
**[These goals]{.underline}** set percentage of GDP and total defense
spending levels that **[focus on arbitrary levels of spending with no
ties to military needs or effectiveness]{.underline}**. As the Secretary
General's report notes (p. 34), At the 2014 Summit in Wales, NATO
leaders endorsed a Defense Investment Pledge. The pledge called for all
Allies that did not already meet the NATO-agreed guideline of spending
2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defense to stop cuts to defense
budgets, gradually increase spending, and aim to move towards spending
2% of GDP on defense within a decade. Allies also agreed, in that same
time-frame, to move towards spending at least 20% of annual defense
expenditure on major new equipment, including related research and
development. What passes for progress reporting is progress in meeting
the percentage objectives regardless of whether this is the right
priority for a given country or if it will strengthen the Alliance. The
Secretary General's annual report summarizes such progress as follows:
At the Brussels Summit in July, NATO leaders agreed there is a new sense
of urgency to invest 2% of GDP on defense and to have credible national
plans on how to meet this goal. NATO Allies will continue to invest in
developing, acquiring and maintaining the capabilities the Alliance
needs to defend its nearly one billion citizens. The Alliance attaches
great importance to ongoing efforts to ensure fair burden-sharing in all
three elements of the Defense Investment Pledge: defense expenditure;
investments in capabilities; and contributions to NATO's operations,
missions and activities. **[In 2018, the United States accounted for
half of the Allies\' combined GDP and almost 70% of combined defense
expenditures]{.underline}**. At the same time, European Allies and
Canada are continuing to spend more on defense. In 2018, seven Allies
reached the 2% defense spending guideline, up from three in 2014. In
real terms, defense spending among European Allies and Canada increased
by almost 4% from 2017 to 2018. Furthermore, in the period from 2016 to
2018, they have contributed an additional cumulative spending of over
USD 41 billion. Allies also made progress on the commitment to invest
20% or more of defense expenditure in major new capabilities. In 2018,
25 Allies spent more in real terms on major equipment than they did in
2017. The number of Allies meeting the NATO agreed 20% guideline rose to
16 in 2018. As Figure One shows, **[these goals focus the alliance on
the wrong objectives in ways that encourage pointless burdening sharing
debates over the wrong objectives, and divide it in ways that serve no
functional purpose.]{.underline}** Ignoring the Threat and Russia's
Level of Spending The NATO percentage goals **[also
ignore]{.underline}** a key underlying reality in the relative level of
effort by NATO and **[Russia]{.underline}**: Its **[one major potential
threat]{.underline}**. This is to some extent the natural result of the
lack of any public or transparent effort to tie NATO military efforts to
some net assessment of the extent to which Russia is a threat, show
NATO's relative capability by key sub-region and mission, and assesses
how well each member is doing in reinforcing NATO's deterrent and
defense capabilities. As Figures Two and Three show, however, **[setting
such percentage goals]{.underline}** ignores a more fundamental reality.
It **[assumes that NATO's weaknesses are dominated by its level of
spending and not by its lack of cohesive, coordinated effort to use its
resources effectively.]{.underline}** If one uses the Secretary
General's report for NATO data, and the IISS Military Balance for
Russian expenditures -- spending data which U.S. experts agree are
roughly the same as U.S. intelligence estimates -- these two Figures
show that one gets the following results:

Currently**[, only the United States, Greece, Great Britain, Estonia and
Poland have spent an average of 2 percent of GDP]{.underline}** on their
own defenses. The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates by
far **[spends the most]{.underline}**, with the average being 3.61
percent of GDP. The **[other countries spend around 1.5 percent or
less]{.underline}**, with Luxembourg coming in last at merely 0.44
percent of GDP. Iceland spends nothing on defense, but has no armed
forces. Why do **[some NATO countries spend less of a percentage of GDP
on defense than others]{.underline}**? In short, **[they can't afford
it]{.underline}**. Michael Corgan, an associate professor of
international relations at Boston University's Frederick S. Pardee
School of Global Studies, argues that health and retirement benefits
promised to Europe's aging population, combined with high taxes, would
make it very difficult for such countries to spend much more on defense
without enacting policies that would be difficult for their citizens to
swallow. "Virtually no democratically elected government could survive
either situation," Corgan told NBC News. The U.S., on the other hand,
already spends a lot more on defense. [Clinton: \'I\'m proud to stand by

Heather Conley, the senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia and the
Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that
**[increased U.S. defense spending over the past decade has greatly
increased that spending gap]{.underline}**, while noting that the
**[U.S. military has become increasingly focused on the Middle East and
Asia, and less so in Europe]{.underline}**. With Russia taking
provocative actions in the region, such as in Crimea, however, many
European countries are now facing the consequences.

[[NATO has always struggled to articulate and deploy forces to protect

little strategic attention to the Mediterranean over the last few years
[[while]{.underline}]{.mark} powers such as
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} have consistently
[[reinforced]{.underline}]{.mark} their military presence. With a
dramatic increase in conflict as well as migration challenges,
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the European Union [[need

unified]{.underline}]{.mark} presence in the Mediterranean [[**despite**
disagreements with Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}. The European Union
relies on NATO intelligence and other support to execute many of its
missions, so [[a diminished NATO also diminishes the European
Union]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Absent more focus on the Mediterranean, [[Ankara and Southern European

### Tensions Amplify Solvency

#### These tensions AMPLIFY solvency instead of reducing it

Daniel S. **Hamilton**, 5-30-20**22**, , Johns Hopkins University School
of Advanced International Studies
https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/10309905/h-diplo-roundtable-xxiii-39-hanhimaki%C2%A0-pax-transatlantica%C2%A0,
\"H-Diplo Roundtable XXIII-39 on Hanhimaki. Pax Transatlantica: America
and Europe in the Post-Cold War Era,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:7-4-2022)

In this clear and compelling volume, Jussi [[Hanhimäki takes on the
"paradox"]{.underline}]{.mark} he sees [[at the heart of the
transatlantic relationship: a "great success story that is **always** at
the brink of catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}" (7). Hanhimäki goes
beyond doom-and-gloom headlines by placing recent transatlantic disputes
within the [[**deeply embedded** political, economic, and security
ties]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[hold the transatlantic community
together **even in times of crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Hanhimäki does not dismiss very real differences that have often shaped
US-European relations. He shows, however, that [[such tensions have
**never** led to a transatlantic crack-up]{.underline}]{.mark}, in part
[[because they remind policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and opinion
leaders [[of the tremendous **stakes** each side of the North Atlantic
has developed]{.underline}]{.mark} in a densely interwoven alliance of
prosperous democracies. "If anything," he concludes, [[such
disagreements are "the **creative** lifeblood]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the transatlantic relationship" (21).

Hanhimäki was motivated to write this book in part as a counterpoint to
Robert Kagan's celebrated analysis that "Americans are from Mars and
Europe is from Venus." Writing at the time of considerable transatlantic
debate over George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq, Kagan hit a nerve
by concluding that when it came to deciding national priorities and
defining foreign and defense policies, the United States and Europe had
"parted ways.\'\'\[1\]

Hanhimäki's volume is essentially a Kagan-style book that argues the
opposite premise. Like Kagan, Hanhimäki does not attempt a detailed
empirical study, something he has done in other works.\[2\] Instead, he
looks at transatlantic patterns of interaction within the security space
of NATO, the economic space of trade and investment flows, and the
internal politics of the transatlantic political space. These three
intertwined spaces form the foundation of what he refers to as Pax
Transatlantica.

**[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** a sense of [[continuing
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, he shows how [[the transatlantic security
space has expanded]{.underline}]{.mark} and the transatlantic economic
space has become more deeply interconnected. He compares domestic
political dynamics of each side of the Atlantic and finds many similar
trends. His conclusion: [[the United States and Europe are **far from**
'parting ways']{.underline}]{.mark}; in fact, [[the structural
interdependencies]{.underline}]{.mark} that bind the two sides of the
North Atlantic together [[have become **more**]{.underline}]{.mark}, not
less, [[important]{.underline}]{.mark} over past decades.

Hanhimäki first recounts the ups and downs of the transatlantic
rollercoaster by taking issue with the notion that the Cold War had been
a golden age of transatlantic cooperation. The notion of a
'transatlantic community' may have been born during the Cold War, but
more often than not it was a community of strife, punctuated by such
[[major internal]{.mark} conflicts]{.underline} as France's decision to
exit NATO's unified military command, disputes over burden-sharing,
nuclear deterrence, out-of-area engagements, national subsidies and
trade rules. Far from threatening the transatlantic alliance, Hanhimäki
argues that these [[disputes were sources of **vibrancy and
dynamism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The United States and Europe
"thrived" on]{.underline}]{.mark} competition and
[[disagreement]{.underline}]{.mark}, he argues: "Indeed, [[the **key**
to the success]{.underline}]{.mark} of the West in the Cold War [[was
its ability to remain united while being perpetually
**divided**]{.underline}]{.mark}" (33-34).

Though Hanhimäki's work is intentionally focused on the sphere within
the north and west, [[one has to question the identity of the shared
values]{.underline}]{.mark}. After all, with NATO out of area
operations, one needs to further consider the basis of the liberal
values. The extent to which these values drove decisions and methods in
Iraq and Afghanistan needs further consideration. Though not a part of
Hanhimäki's argument, one might consider the centrality of these values
in the wars in Vietnam and in the earlier period of European
colonialism. [[During the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the
transitions from colonialism to decolonisation, [[there was much for the
western powers to disagree upon]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also a lot to
question the basis of 'liberalism' in their international interactions.
[[This was also]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[the very period in
which NATO was formed and grew]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[30\] In his From
Plato to NATO, David Gress emphasises the cracks rather than the paint
which covered the disagreements. But even in the "grand narrative" the
emphasis on liberal, pluralist democracy and an uncertain commitment to
the market economy, "... suffered from the weakness of liberalism: the
illusion of newness, economic reductionism, and an inability to choose
between the negative and positive ideas of liberty -- the idea that saw
liberty and freedom from coercion versus the idea of liberty as
self-realization." \[31\] Some of the dominant European powers could not
look too far into their pasts to maintain any sense of a prevalent
liberalism; in that sense, but only at the level of meta-narrative, the
United States with its formal ideologies offered a new conceptual
identity, centred on the narrowly defined purpose of NATO.\[32\]
Moreover, the Cold War West, from which NATO emerged, "... could not
contain any substantive definitions of liberty or democracy for no such
substantive definitions could command general agreement." These values
were read in different ways, even within the same conceptual West. Gress
concludes, "to enroll such contradictory ideas in a common front
required that the distinctions be ignored or elided."\[33\] Hanhimäki
emphasises that the [[robust disagreements]{.underline}]{.mark} that are
present [[add strength to the vitality of the West and
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Is there a conflict between the Alliance\'s original and enduring
purpose of collective defence and its post-Cold War crisis management
functions? This is an ill-framed debate, because the home base must be
secure in order to support expeditionary power projection. [[The
**allies** have]{.underline}]{.mark}, moreover, [[moved **away** from a
static, reactive, and territorial concept of collective defence
**towards**]{.underline}]{.mark} a more 'proactive' and 'anticipatory'
approach. Some experts have even referred to a 'deterritorialization' of
collective defence. Other issues also illustrate the changing dimensions
of collective defence---[[missile defence, cyber warfare, space
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}, the risk of [[state-sponsored
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} involving [[weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}, political--military dynamics in the
[[Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
[[Asia--Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark} region, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
the risk of [[a non-Article 5 operation]{.underline}]{.mark} becoming a
collective defence contingency. [[**Despite disagreements** on how to
pursue shared goals, the allies may yet demonstrate that they have the
**vision and political will** to meet the new
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}. The question of the Alliance\'s 'level

purposes [[and burden-sharing to achieve them]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Northern Europe

Northern Europe holds great geostrategic importance to the transatlantic
community as trade routes, emerging competition in the Arctic, and
sustained Russian pressure make the region a key security concern for
competing powers. [[Northern European]{.underline}]{.mark} states are
active members of the transatlantic community, and they [[face
**similar** concerns with their allies and partners: climate change,

\"How NATO Can Avoid a Strategic Decoupling in the Eastern
Mediterranean,\" Center for Strategic and International Studies
(ermo/sms, Acc:7-4-2022)

Eastern Mediterranean Principles

The preamble of NATO's Charter states that its members pledge to
"promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area." [[All
NATO allies, including Turkey, need to promote stability in the Eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}]{.mark}. A first step would be to create an
agreed set of principles to include: (1) ensure that all regional
partners reap the benefits of energy exploration in the region, with a
path toward equitable sharing of energy revenues acting as a
confidence-building measure toward restarting the Cyprus peace process;
(2) contain Russian influence and presence in the region; (3) ensure
NATO's freedom of action from the Black Sea through to the
Mediterranean; (4) work toward regional stability in the Middle East and
North Africa region, including counterterrorism efforts; (5) uphold
international legal norms and UN resolutions, such as the UN arms
embargo on Libya and efforts to reach a cease-fire, as well as
countries' territorial or maritime integrity (regardless of existing
disputes); and (6) redouble efforts to avoid future maritime incidents
in the Eastern Mediterranean between NATO allies by establishing new
procedures.

[[Stronger U.S. political and security involvement]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the region [[will help **strengthen** NATO's resolve in the
East]{.underline}]{.mark}ern [[Med]{.underline}]{.mark}iterranean, [[be
a bulwark against Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s growing military
presence, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} better [[balance tensions between
France and Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}. The European Union (and France
in particular) will need to identify pragmatic ways to engage with
Turkey on a range of issues and not simply denounce its actions. As
Turkey's economic situation deteriorates, greater economic
opportunities, such as expanding the EU bilateral trade relationship
with Turkey or increasing U.S. foreign direct investment, might
encourage Ankara to participate in the development of a regional
framework of principles. Unfortunately, these relationships have grown
very fragile as tensions have risen, and [[Turkey's unilateral actions
have]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly
[[destabilized]{.underline}]{.mark} the region. Hopefully,
[[**refocusing** on]{.underline}]{.mark} a set of [[agreed
principles]{.underline}]{.mark} and incentivizing progress [[can
**restore** NATO unity and]{.underline}]{.mark} restore
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark} on protecting its southern flank.

Coordinate Data Management, Privacy and Digital Taxation

With a Biden-Harris administration generally in favor of greater data
protection, and with its interest in examining tech platform regulation
(though with a different focus than the EU side) at home, [[there is an
**opening** for coordinated consultation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Expanding
the EU 'code of conduct' to a transatlantic effort is an initial idea.
Aligning antitrust efforts more effectively and reframing "digital
sovereignty" as 'open to America' will be necessary to advance
transatlantic consensus. GAIA-X, the "by Europeans-for Europeans"
cloud-based data storage and management initiative, and the Digital
Services Act must allow for transatlantic coordination. Microsoft
recently joining GAIA-X sends the right signal that the panoply of data
issues is a joint transatlantic concern---but more importantly, it
underlines that these solutions have to be built on the basis of
leading-edge, effective technology.

The EU--U.S. Privacy Shield agreement will need urgent renegotiation.
[[The US, UK and EU should be **core** partners]{.underline}]{.mark} in
building a data space [[that allow]{.underline}]{.mark}s
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} intelligence collection and [[managed, open
data]{.underline}]{.mark} flows [[while balancing privacy
and]{.underline}]{.mark} fundamental [[rights]{.underline}]{.mark}
concerns adequately. The Privacy Shield attempted---however
insufficiently---to remedy the shortcomings of the earlier Safe Harbor
Agreement, which was invalidated by the European Court of Justice (ECJ)
because of perceived National Security Agency (NSA) overreach in
collection and usage of foreign data. Still, even with the fixes
introduced into the Privacy Shield, weaknesses remained around questions
of independent and authoritative redress for Europeans and legal issues
around standard contractual clauses designed to regulate data transfers
to the U.S. The ECJ voided the Privacy Shield in July 2020, leaving
thousands of U.S. and EU companies uncertain how to proceed.

For as much as Americans may have overreached on data intelligence in
the early years of these agreements, [[intelligence cooperation based on
signals and digital]{.underline}]{.mark} financial transaction
[[tracing]{.underline}]{.mark} (all based on data) are predominantly
requested by Europeans---and [[have measurably reduced terrorism in
Europe. Transatlantic]{.underline}]{.mark} intelligence and
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark} agencies [[will have to
balance]{.underline}]{.mark} the demands of [[security and
privacy]{.underline}]{.mark} in a more equal partnership, [[creatively
rethinking]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}
security regime that both America and its allies need [[to
confront]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[new threats]{.underline}]{.mark} in
a multipolar world.

[[On AI, the US and EU must sweep away the concept of
competition]{.underline}]{.mark} within the alliance [[and develop
**common goals**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and ethics standards --- for
the use of autonomous technology. The EU's current plans on AI could tip
into protectionism, and at worst significantly hamper the kind of R&D
necessary to keep pace with progress in the US and China. [[Expanding
the Trump era US-UK AI agreement **quickly** to include EU member states
would **clear the way** toward a Transatlantic AI
Agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}, as suggested by the EU Commission in
December 2020.

[[Stop ceding the cyber realm to Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}

Russia has successfully reframed the Council of Europe's Budapest
Convention on Cybercrime to its advantage. China has asserted its
leadership in UN specialized groups, to set standards in cyber or
adjacent areas. [[They are]{.underline}]{.mark} already
[[using]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[seeming]{.underline}]{.mark}ly
[[bureaucratic victories to **establish** rules that make it easier to
exploit]{.underline}]{.mark} the internet. [[Increased transatlantic
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} in multilateral and international bodies
[[is **essential** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[preservation of liberal
values]{.underline}]{.mark} in the institutional system. This applies
equally to standard-setting in the ICT area, where China has made fast
inroads. China has already appointed the heads of the International
Telecommunications Union, the International Standards Organization and
the International Electrotechnical Commissions. [[The transatlantic
alliance needs to be putting forward strong, common
positions]{.underline}]{.mark} at these bodies where possible, [[and
push back against blatant efforts by the Chinese to control
these]{.underline}]{.mark} bodies. Members of the transatlantic alliance
should ensure they have implemented the UN Group of Governmental Expert
(UN GGE) norms at home and continue to expand investments in a robust
international cyber-security architecture, through [[real-world
capacity-building exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} with like-minded
democracies, to [[help allies identify gaps in their cyber armor. Better
tracing and attribution capacities should make joint sanctions regimes
against cyber attacks increasingly possible]{.underline}]{.mark}:
Expanding the summer 2020 EU cyber sanctions transatlantically could be
a way forward.

Potential **[problems may arise if]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
Air Force or other **[DoD]{.underline}** components **[begin utilizing
more fully autonomous machines]{.underline}**, especially **[in lethal
operations]{.underline}**. Despite noting the importance of continued
human-system interaction, the Office of the Chief Scientist predicted
that \"as the capabilities of autonomy increase, (including the ability
to handle a broader range of situations and uncertainty) it is
anticipated that the need for human intervention will decline.\" 26Just
four years after releasing Autonomous Horizons, the Office of the Chief
Scientist **[already]{.underline}** appears to have **[envisioned
expanding the roles of autonomous systems even further]{.underline}** as
detailed in The Way Forward, suggesting that autonomous systems \"should
be able to take on a subordinate, peer, or supervisory roleand change
that role with humans or other \[autonomous systems\] within the
organization, \[\*213\] as the task or environment demands.\" 27Given
the progress that has been made in autonomous machines and the need to
remain ahead of our rivals, it is foreseeable that **[in the next thirty
years warfighting machines will be designed to require fewer human
inputs]{.underline}** given the complex and evolving nature of today\'s
battlefields. 28 As the prospect of fully autonomous machines becomes
more of a technological possibility, the DoD should anticipate
opposition from the international community. Special efforts should be
made to ensure that autonomous systems conform with international
customs and practices. As discussed further in subsection II.C, **[the
U.S. is likely to be a global trendsetter with its approach to using
autonomous systems in military operations]{.underline}**. As such, its
practices should set the expectation that international law should be
respected when autonomous systems are utilized on the battlefield**[,
which may require keeping their autonomous capabilities in check and
ultimately limiting the developmental]{.underline}** ceiling **[of the

Yet as the crisis evolves, **[decisions]{.underline}** about how to
support Ukraine **[will become more difficult, and there's a limit to
how unified NATO can be]{.underline}**. While the West might agree on
introducing tough new economic sanctions and reinforcing the Alliance's
eastern flank, boosting Kyiv's military capacity---by supporting an
insurgency, for instance, or [sending anti-tank
weapons](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine/)---will
be impossible to achieve by consensus and is much more likely to come
from individual members than under NATO auspices. This shouldn't be
surprising. Consider Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its
ongoing support for separatists in Ukraine's Donbas region: NATO actions
in support of Kyiv have been more political than operational, leaving it
to individual allies to provide munitions, equipment, and training to
Ukrainian forces. And despite a recurrent pledge that Ukraine would one
day be welcome to join the Alliance, as well as the sympathy expressed
by allies for Ukraine's plight, there's been precious little progress on
this front. NATO is primarily concerned about defending its members from
Russian aggression---which it is also wary of provoking by supporting
the Ukrainian military. **[Yet]{.underline}** despite its lack of
meaningful military support for Ukraine, the crisis has been the
animating issue on the Alliance's agenda since 2014. **[Russia's attacks

with an eye toward beefing up the Alliance's northern and eastern flanks
and deterring Russia in both the conventional and sub-threshold realms.
As an institution established to safeguard Europe, it has successfully
geared itself to deter the type of destabilizing Russian belligerence
currently on display. **[Critics]{.underline}** of the alliance (and
even some supporters) **[[have interpreted NATO's
unwillingness](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/474047-the-problems-plaguing-nato) to
militarily support Ukraine]{.underline}**---especially during the most
significant challenge to the European security order since the Cold
War---**[as an indicator of its]{.underline}** declining relevance,
timidity, or its **[divisions. But that overstates the importance of
political consensus to NATO's value and understates its role as an
effective and flexible defensive alliance.]{.underline}** This is a role
with potentially critical benefits for Ukraine. First, it sets too high
a bar for an alliance of thirty members with aligned, but distinct,
priorities. **[Unanimity on every issue is impossible]{.underline}**,
let alone one as complex as military support to Ukraine. **[Debate and
disagreement, as it should be for any democratic institution, are
built-in features of NATO---not bugs]{.underline}**. In reality, it's
astounding how **[often NATO does reach consensus about [issues big and
small](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_185000.htm)]{.underline}**,
creating an unrealistic expectation that it always will. **[The opposite
of consensus is not failure]{.underline}**. Suggesting otherwise turns
any debate that doesn't end harmoniously into an indictment of NATO,
playing straight into Russian propaganda. Second, **[a belief that
NATO's value is tied primarily to achieving consensus on every issue
misses the more]{.underline}** mundane (and **[important]{.underline}**)
**[ways it supports its allies]{.underline}** and partners.
Its [affinity for
process](https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/praise-natos-dysfunctional-bureaucratic-tedium/)---particularly
its ability to build a common situational understanding among its
members---is an invaluable tool. **[Habits of consultation and
information sharing]{.underline}**, buttressed by deep cooperation on
operations, intelligence sharing, **[defense planning, and
interoperability, create the foundation upon which any consensus is to
be built]{.underline}**. **[Even in the absence of that agreement, the
ability to collectively define threats and jointly train to confront
them is immensely valuable in its own right.]{.underline}** Third, these
habits of cooperation give NATO members the flexibility to act outside
of the Alliance's frameworks. **[While NATO does much by
consensus]{.underline}**---such as its [missions in the Baltic
states](https://lc.nato.int/operations/enhanced-forward-presence-efp)---**[the

separate coalitions for action]{.underline}**. This happened recently
with [ample
success](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/part-3-future-anti-isis-coalition) in
taking on the Islamic State. **[Such flexibility should be a point in
NATO's favor, not evidence of its ineptitude]{.underline}**. In the case
of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find more attractive
alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression outside of the
auspices of the Alliance. Up to and including its recent dialogue with
Russia, it has taken a host of consensus actions to support
Ukraine---from [condemning Kremlin
aggression](https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/praise-natos-dysfunctional-bureaucratic-tedium/) and [standing
up for
Kyiv](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_190292.htm) politically
to [reaffirming its open-door
policy](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_190666.htm) with an
expectation that Ukraine will eventually become a member. It might
even [share intelligence and develop training and advisory
programs](https://www.ft.com/content/1336c9be-f1c9-4545-9f85-3b07fcb746d6) for
the Ukrainian military. And while it won't find a consensus to fight, it
could provide the foundation for certain allies to support Ukrainian
forces in ways consistent with their national priorities outside of
NATO. In that case, NATO's enabling value to its members in complicating
Putin's cost-benefit assessment should be applauded. **[Last week's
NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working in lockstep
and finding political consensus]{.underline}** in responding to
preposterous Russian demands. NATO should always strive for this degree
of consensus. **[But if]{.underline}** and when this crisis intensifies,
and Putin advances further into Ukraine, expectations for NATO
assistance will be raised, decisions about how to respond will become
more difficult, and **[consensus will be more
elusive]{.underline}**. Despite the rhetoric we might hear in response,
**[this is not evidence of NATO's ineffectiveness---but rather a
reflection of how democratic institutions function]{.underline}**. And
even absent consensus, NATO can still contribute invaluably to Ukraine's
sovereignty.

Chemical Proliferation

The Chemical Weapons Convention identifies three main classes, called
Schedules, of controlled substances.90 Schedule 1 substances have no
peaceful use outside chemical weapons while Schedules 2 and 3 substances
have small-scale and large-scale uses, respectively, outside chemical
weapons. The main substances discussed in this section are sulfur
mustard ("mustard gas") and nerve agents, as well as their precursors.
[[Chemical weapons are traditionally difficult to
produce]{.underline}]{.mark} due to highly toxic and corrosive
chemicals, and their sophistication can vary as evidence of production
by the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Iraq.

Sulfur mustard production requires large amounts to be militarily
effective. Even if produced in a small quantity, it is difficult to
store and transport. It also possesses a relatively low casualty rate,
and medical care has developed to ensure increased recovery rates. Its
production historically involves ethylene oxide and hydrogen sulfide,91
both of which are gases at room temperature and therefore difficult to
fathom production with AM. The intermediary product between these two
chemicals and sulfur mustard is thiodiglycol, which is a common liquid
solvent used in ballpoint pen ink and other plastics. It is of interest
to private corporations, including Hewlett Packard, who cited it as a
functional material in its patent for 3D printing technology in 2017.92
This patent does not indicate a threat of thiodiglycol production, but
it signals interest of using it by private corporations. Without its
direct application, exploration of similar chemicals with 3D printing
could generate publicly or commercially available knowledge with
utilizing it. Therefore, thiodiglycol is a medium risk in the long term,
indicated in Table 2. Thiodiglycol requires hydrogen sulfide to produce
the sulfur mustard, therefore proliferators need additional
anti-corrosive equipment not aided with the use of 3D printing.

The tabun nerve agent poses a similar challenge as the required hydrogen
cyanide reagent is necessary.93 Sarin and soman, other nerve agents,
require hydrochloric acid or hydrogen fluoride, both highly corrosive.
3D-printed containers would not withstand storage or transport of these
materials. The AM community would need to experiment more with corrosive
reactions on mostly metal materials to ensure advantages over steel
pipes and containers. Therefore, materials associated with nerve agent
production pose a minimal threat. Table 2 shows the relatively small
threat that chemical weapons alone pose.

It's been well-recognized that [[moderately advanced chemical and
pharmaceutical industries can enable chemical weapons
production]{.underline}]{.mark}.94,95 Successful acquisition would
require conversion of a standard plant to one that could produce
chemical weapons. It is therefore possible that AM could be used to
create [[equipment **originally intended** for a chemical plant that is
eventually **converted** to a chemical weapons
facility]{.underline}]{.mark}. An article has proposed effects of
current AM technology on the chemical industry to include surgical
preparation and drug delivery devices,96 although both are only
projected and have not been demonstrated outside of an experimental
setting. Many 3D printing applications for chemical application cross
into the biomedical and biotechnology arena.
