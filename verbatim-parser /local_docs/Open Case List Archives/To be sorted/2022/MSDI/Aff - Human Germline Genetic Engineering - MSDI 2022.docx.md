Germline gene-editing refers to genetic changes in every cell, that will
be passed on to future generations. This is different to somatic (body)
cell gene-editing, whereby only existing cells are targeted and the
changes made are not passed on to future offspring.

#### 1 Mosaicism & Autonomy

[[The ethical concerns would probably be best understood under
bioethical standards.]{.underline}]{.mark} Central to the practice of
medicine and biological sciences are "The Four Principles of Bioethics,
75 " also known as the four-principles approach. 76 This approach was
developed by two American philosophers, Tom Beauchamp77 and James
Childress. 78 [[This approach has long held that at the root of
biomedical ethics are the following four principles: respect for
autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These principles will lay the fundamental groundwork for each
foreseeable potential human rights violation I state below. [[Personal
autonomy means the right to make his or her own
choice]{.underline}]{.mark}79. This principle will be violated [[if
germline editing is allowed]{.underline}]{.mark}, mainly [[because it
affects future generations]{.underline}]{.mark} as discussed above,
given their obvious lack of consent as to inherited modified genes.
[[The creation of a heritable modified genes has unpredictable
implications on humankind and evolution80]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a
2018 commentary article authored by professors and research scholars
noted there may be unintended consequences to editing out harmful
mutations in humans: Here we simply emphasize to express that it may
have effect modification of mutations in germ cell will ultimately
eliminate that mutation in the next generation, which will deter the
on-going human evolution. Mutations are an essential part of evolution,
whose pros and cons cannot be judged instantly. The mutations, which
seem deleterious today, may have inclusive fitness tomorrow. Mutations,
which seem harmful today, may be the nature's preparation for tomorrow.
The somatic cell modifications in humans whereas provide answer to many
ailments, the germ line changes until outcomes of such modifications are
uncontrolled would continue to raise ethical concerns. Thus, the
researchers need to be doubly cautious and some stringent regulations
should be framed regarding the various aspects of germ line gene
modifications and any potential conflict with nature for future
outcome.81 Moreover, [[the elimination of a gene or modification of a
gene could affect the genetic diversity of the human
population]{.underline}]{.mark}82. The United Nations has defined
genetic diversity as, "\[t\]he variation in the amount of genetic
information within and among individuals of a population, a species, an
assemblage, or a community." 83 Genetic diversity is our inherited
toolkit, and the more varied the genes are in our toolkit as a
population, the higher our survivability will and continue to be.
"[[Genetic diversity has a direct relation to the fitness and
survivability of various species and populations;]{.underline}]{.mark}
as genetic diversity decreases within a population, so does the fitness
and survivability of that population." 84 Notably, we do not understand
the far-reaching potential of a gene, whether it is consider a harmful
mutation today or not, it may serve a purpose tomorrow. Employing such a
germline edit that would be inherited by future generations without
their consent. The lack of medical consent of future generations is a
contravention of human rights as it breaches their physical integrity,
their ability to make choices as to their own bodies. Foreseeable issues
as to consent have been posed by several scientists. Per legal standards
and clinical ethics, it's long been established that parents are the
best and most appropriate decisionmakers over their children until they
have reach adulthood. But this presumption is not perfect as individuals
who have disagreed with the medical decisions of their parents is
well-documented. For example, "wrongful life" suits85 or individuals who
have disagreed with their parent's surgical decisions about sexual
assignment or craniofacial disorders."86 There are also groups of people
who resist the idea of having their medical status defined as a
"disability," and published cases of patients who are documented as
stating they would not want to correct their medical condition if given
the choice.87 The two principles, beneficence and non-maleficence,
derives from the well-known Hippocratic Oath, "to help and do no harm.
88" This age-old oath was established in the 4th century BCE by
Hippocrates, a physician-philosopher. As with any new scientific
discovery, the true long-term effects of CRISPR cannot be realistically
gasped. [[Currently, the known possible negative effects of genetic
engineering are off-target mutagenesis]{.mark}]{.underline} 89,90 [[and
mosaicism]{.underline}]{.mark}9192,93 . Applying a benefit-burden
analysis, [[we must rely on alternative safer methods, such as,
preimplantation genetic diagnosis, until we can reasonably and reliably
predict the true effects of CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}. Lastly justice,
is a concept concerning fairness and equality. The more pragmatic
concern involves a lack of accessibility, where "therapies," may be
developed using this technology, but may only be accessible to the
wealthy would add to the already great wedge between socioeconomic
classes.

#### 2 The gene drive

WESLEY W. **CHEN** June 30 **2019** HUMAN GERMLINE GENE EDITING:
ENGINEERING AN UNSTOPPABLE TRAIN
https://mylaw2.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/28-2-Chen.pdf

One practical application of gene editing in eugenics is the idea of the
gene drive.119 [[The gene drive is a genetic phenomenon whereby certain
genes with "'selfish' genetic elements]{.underline}]{.mark}"---which
provide hereditary advantages--- increase the inheritance of the gene in
subsequent generations within a population.120 [[The idea is that by
using gene drives]{.underline}]{.mark} for advantageous characteristics,
[[scientists can]{.underline}]{.mark} utilize a longitudinal system to
[[address "major biological problems related to public and environmental
health."]{.mark}]{.underline} 121 [[In practice, a gene drive involves
engineering specific genetic traits in a few individuals and propagating
the traits throughout the local population through generations of
reproduction]{.underline}]{.mark}.122 Due to difficulties surrounding
engineering an effective gene drive system, gene drives have only been
used in a handful of organisms, including yeast,123 fruitflies,124 and
mosquitoes.125 With the evolution of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, however,
development of gene drives are becoming increasingly viable. For
example, historically it has been extremely difficult to create
transgenes in mosquitoes that would be passed on to subsequent
generations.126 But in November 2015, scientists reported that they had
successfully engineered a gene drive in mosquitoes using CRISPR-Cas9,
which resulted in inheritance of the mutant gene in 99% of all
offspring.127 CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been subsequently used to
engineer other mosquito gene drives to combat the spread of malaria.128
While the idea of using gene drives to eliminate malaria in wild
mosquito populations seems promising, the application of gene drives in
humans is not so straightforward. [[One of the gene drive's greatest
advantages is also one of its greatest weaknesses---its power to change
an entire ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark}.129 Theoretically, once a
dominant gene drive has been introduced to favorably bias its
inheritance, it will inevitably spread throughout the population unless
an accessible off switch is programmed into the gene drive. In
mosquitoes, an organism much simpler and more laboratory-tested than
humans, such a dramatic genetic change would still have unforeseeable
impacts on the ecosystem and the mosquito's long-term survival in the
wild. This illustrates both the causal uncertainties and the
moral-conceptual "is this a benefit or risk" uncertainties in this
field. Even the causal uncertainties aren't purely empirical but have
value components (as in proximate cause). In humans, these issues are
further complicated in that it would be impossible to test the effects
of gene drives on human adults in a laboratory setting. In a perfect
scenario, a gene drive without any adverse or off-target effects could
be introduced into the human population to battle disease and
ubiquitously enhance the human race. Even in such cases, however, would
it really be a good idea to drive the same genetic characteristic
throughout society? [[One of nature's best survival tools is genetic
diversity.]{.underline}]{.mark}130 An advantageous trait one day may be
a weakness another day when there are new diseases or different
environments. The tug-and-pull between whether a genetic modification is
helpful in the short-term or detrimental in the unforeseeable future
highlights the blurred "line between diversity and disability."

#### 3 Human dignity

Scott J. **Schweikart**, Global Regulation of Germline Genome Editing:
Ethical Considerations and Application of International Human Rights
Law, 43 Loy. L.A. Int\'l & Comp. L. Rev. 279 (**2021**). Available at:
https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/ilr/vol43/iss3/6

The larger question thus becomes: what constitutes "human dignity?" One
answer is that [[human dignity is "respect derived automatically from
one's status as a human being]{.underline}]{.mark}."75 Therefore, some
scholars argue that [[alterations to the genome for "enhancement"
purposes is a type of transhumanism that violates human
dignity]{.underline}]{.mark}.76 Indeed, this line of thinking supports
the declaration as an ethical tool that can be used to protect against
violations of "human dignity" conducted via genetic alterations meant to
enhance a human being.77 As some scholars argue[[, violations of human
dignity via enhancement genome editing calls into question the
personhood status of individuals with an altered
genome]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus [[yielding profound implications on
the rights and status of such individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}.78 This
is particularly acute under a theory of "personhood" that emphasizes
biology and genetics as determinative. [[Such a worldview that
"implicitly assumes that the totality of human DNA is the source of a
human essence" will invariably harm "the biological legacy" of children
with germline modifications and risk "their entitlement to human rights
and legal protections]{.underline}]{.mark}."79 In other words, [[human
rights protections may be in doubt because germline modified individuals
could potentially be deemed as possessing a trans-altered personhood
status, thus removing them from the normative
status]{.underline}]{.mark} entitled to such protections.

editing imperils universal human rights ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED: February

https://www.openglobalrights.org/reproductive-gene-editing-imperils-universal-human-rights/

[[What do recent advances in molecular genetics have to do with human
rights? Quite a lot]{.underline}]{.mark}, it turns out. And key human
rights documents have recognized this for some time. Over the past few
years, new "gene editing" tools that are cheaper, easier to use, and
more accurate than previous ways to change living organisms' DNA have
rapidly spread to labs around the world. Scenarios that previously
seemed far-fetched or far off now confront us, including the prospect of
directly controlling the genes and traits that are passed down to future
children and generations. Since 2015, a half dozen research teams, in
China, the UK, and the United States, have separately reported efforts
to modify specific genes in human embryos. These developments have
brought us to a critical juncture[[: human reproductive gene editing now
poses a threat to the human rights of future
generations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Gene editing for human reproduction
carries huge social risks. [[It has the potential to threaten the health
and autonomy of future generations, to exacerbate existing social
disparities, and to lay the basis for a new market-based eugenics that
would fuel discrimination and conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. A
[debate](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/04/human-gene-editing-is-a-social-and-political-matter-not-just-a-scientific-one)
about whether to risk these outcomes is now raging, though mostly in the
publications and meetings of scientific and professional organizations,
far away from public view and civil society attention[[. It is essential
that human rights advocates make their voices heard in this
debate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Imagine a world where wealthy parents could
purchase genetic enhancements to give their children real or alleged
advantages, where children's futures were thought to be determined by
their genes, and where babies were labeled at birth as "good" or "bad"
based on their DNA. What would be the implications for human rights, and
for the right of children to decide their own futures? Gene editing for
human reproduction, also known as human inheritable or germline
modification, involves making changes to the DNA of human sperm, eggs,
or embryos. It is distinct from efforts [to use gene editing as a
medical
treatment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-unhampered-by-rules-races-ahead-in-gene-editing-trials-1516562360),
which target the somatic or non-reproductive cells of existing patients.
While somatic gene editing, or "gene therapy," aims to treat or cure
disease in living people, reproductive gene editing is not a medical
treatment. It would create a new person with a pre-determined genetic
make-up that would be inherited by all of their descendants. Gene
therapy, if it can be made safe, effective, and broadly affordable, will
be a welcome addition to modern medicine. [[Germline gene
editing]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, [[doesn't treat anyone. It
creates future children, and deprives them and future generations of the
choice to consent to modifications made to their
DNA.]{.underline}]{.mark} And if the goal is to avoid the transmission
of inheritable disease, it is unnecessary. Where there is risk of
passing on a serious genetic mutation, an existing embryo screening
technique (pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or PGD), can in almost all
cases eliminate the unwanted gene variant from the family's lineage. To
be sure, embryo screening for PGD raises challenging ethical questions
about what conditions are considered "unworthy of life." But it is far
safer and less socially and ethically fraught than manipulating the
human germline. Around twenty years ago, an earlier wave of concern
about human germline modification swept through scientific and policy
circles, and popular culture. The 1997 dystopian film
[GATTACA](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/) depicted a brutal
society that privileged the genetically enhanced over the unenhanced.
Similarly, Princeton University molecular biologist Lee Silver made news
with his vision of a genetically stratified society,
[predicting](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/523362)
that "the already wide gap between wealthy and poor nations could widen
further and further with each generation until all common heritage is
gone." During the same period, concerns about safety, human rights, and
the potential for a high-tech, market-based eugenics prompted more than
40 countries---including nearly every nation with a significant biotech
sector---to prohibit the modification of genes passed down to subsequent
generations. Several important international human rights instruments
also concluded that human germline modification would violate human
dignity, a concept at the core of human rights. One of these, the
Council of Europe's 1997 European [Convention on Human Rights and
Biomedicine](https://rm.coe.int/168007cf98) (also known as the Oviedo
Convention), is a binding international treaty. Its Article 13
explicitly prohibits interventions "seeking to introduce any
modification in the genome of any descendants." Another, UNESCO's 1997
[Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human
Rights](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/bioethics/human-genome-and-human-rights/),
asserts that "the human genome underlies the fundamental unity of all
members of the human family, as well as the recognition of their
inherent dignity and diversity," concluding in Article 24 that
"germ-line interventions" could be "contrary to human dignity." In fact,
[[an important
[motivation](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001144/114488E.pdf)
for the [Universal Declaration of Human
Rights](http://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf) was
an abhorrence of the eugenic abuses perpetrated by]{.underline}]{.mark}
Nazis during [[World War II. The same logic provides the foundation for
the consumer-based eugenics that would result if germline modification
were allowed]{.underline}]{.mark}, where people's life chances would be
limited if their unmodified genes were considered from birth to be
inferior.

#### Subpoint B: Framing

#### Frame the debate using the precautionary principle -- vote so the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of an authentically humane life on Earth. We have an obligation to not risk the future of humanity. 

Francois **Ewald,** Director of Reasarch and Strategy, Federation
Francaise des Societes d\'Assurances., **2000** "Risk in contemporary
society", Connecticut Insurance Law Journal, 6 Conn. Ins. L.J. 47,
1999/2000, Hein Online

The [[powers]{.mark}]{.underline} of modern man
[[confer]{.underline}]{.mark} upon him an [[infinite
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}. His nature is revealed in fear, a
feeling that makes man aware of the power of his new capacities. On one
hand temporality, within which is situated his action, dilates to
encompass the whole history of humanity, past and future, but [[it must
be acknowledged that]{.underline}]{.mark} his [[powers are such that
they threaten the existence of life itself]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Contemporary man is becoming aware of himself in the feeling of anguish
before the possibilities of annihilation that he bears in himself: for
the first time, he is discovering in himself the power to commit suicide
as a species. Faced with this possibility, and in order to \[\*71\]
overcome his anguish, modern man is on a quest to find the rules of a
morality that will limit his powers: [the ethics of
responsibility]{.underline}. His [[enormous power needs
holding]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The ethics of responsibility contain the
risk and uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} to the extent that modern man
must take account in his actions, [[both their long term consequences
and their possibility of sweeping along with them]{.underline}]{.mark},
at least in certain cases, [[the worst, the
catastrophe.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead of the categorical Kantian
imperative, there should be substituted an imperative adapted to the new
type of human action: [[\"Act so that the effects of your action are
compatible with the permanence of an authentically humane life on
earth.\" 35 For while we have the right to risk our own lives, we do not
have the right to risk that of humanity. This imperative is the basis of
the precautionary principle: it invites us to measure each of our
actions against the principle of the worst
scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}. Morality becomes a sort of negative
morality: it is not so much turned towards the positive quest for the
best as towards the avoidance of the worst. The uncertainty of long term
prognostics confers the nature of a wager on human action, which leads
to questions such as: do I have the right to endanger the interests of
others in my wager?

#### Future generations should be your urgent ethical priority---flip the script on the negative's flawed decision calculus

Elizabeth **Olson**, professor in the Department of Geography at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**, August 2015** "Geography
and ethics I: Waiting and urgency", Progress in Human Geography 2015,
Vol. 39(4)

[[Waiting and urgency are]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to be
[[familiar]{.underline}]{.mark} experiences for the readers of this
journal. We wait for green lights, phone calls, food, and test results.
We teach our children socially appropriate ways to wait their turn.
Daily we face urgent deadlines, urgent paperwork and urgent calls for
our attention. Waiting and urgency can therefore feel banal and
ubiquitous, and hardly of great ethical or moral consequence.
[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} in the context of late liberalism and
capitalism in crisis, geographers are drawing our attention to the ways
that [[space and waiting come together to produce and
maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[abusive and harmful
arrangements of power and inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Lines, lists,
rooms and rosters dictate an order of being received, and in doing so
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} may also [[influence the dignity and safety
of those who are required to wait]{.underline}]{.mark} for jobs,
housing, asylum or security from intimate terrorism. Potentially
[[unruly bodies are managed]{.mark}]{.underline} through increasingly
sophisticated technologies that make some people wait longer, and in
worse conditions, than others. How a person waits can also produce
judgments about both her culture and her character. As it organizes the
routines of our daily lives, waiting can serve -- rightly or wrongly --
as a measure of lawfulness or civility, and potentially as a
justification for the removal or denial of rights. A worthy citizen
waits appropriately or faces consequences. Martin Luther King wrote
about this ethical dimension of waiting in relation to civil rights and
the US military involvement in Vietnam, clarifying that a demand to wait
can be immoral and therefore requires an apposite counterforce, what he
called 'the fierce urgency of now'
(\[ [31](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib31)\]

I begin with a necessarily selective introduction to urgency and its
role in moral reasoning and ethics before turning to the somewhat
unlikely bedfellows of toileting and emergency, and conclude by drawing
urgency back into dialogue with waiting.

Miriam-Webster defines 'urgent' as calling for immediate attention. When
the word is turned from an adjective into a noun -- urgency -- its
relationship with power is more evident: 'Insistence; a force or impulse
that impels or constrains'.2
\[ [2](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib2)\]
Urgency is thus temporal, pushing for resolution in the immediate
present or very near future, and it is also authoritative, demanding
attention, compelling action or preventing us from acting. From this
definition alone, [[urgency would appear to fill an important role in
moral reasoning by distinguishing those things that cannot
wait]{.underline}]{.mark} and must or must not happen, depending upon
the force implied in any given demand. Utilitarian approaches like the
practical ethics of
\[ [74](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib74)\]
presume scarce resources (money, attention, ingenuity, respect,
relationships) to be allocated according to various considerations,
including but not limited to the urgency of the claim. In the
mathematical representations of epistemic utility arguments, urgency can
even be 'scored' according to the possibility of its accuracy
(\[ [34](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib34)\]
). From this utilitarian perspective, urgency is one consideration in
moral reasoning, but it is not ethical in its own right, nor is it a
virtue that might form a basis for ethics, as might be done with
hospitality (e.g.
\[ [9](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib9)\]
).

If the relationship between urgency and ethics was limited to a
utilitarian ranking in moral reasoning, my analysis could turn to the
challenging (and probably very interesting) task of surveying how
geographers implicitly evoke a sense of urgency for the purpose of
asserting hierarchies of concern. However, other trajectories within
moral philosophy problematize the role of urgency as one amongst many
variables that might factor in our moral reasoning. [[Scanlon and Wren
incorporated urgency into non-utilitarian ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the 1970s, and their different approaches underscore some early
alternatives within philosophy.3

pushes this further, such that urgency signals the 'overriding ought
that is directed toward the ultimately serious end of interagential
harmony'
(\[ [67](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib67)\]
: 90). Accordingly, urgency identifies the ultimate moral choice, that
which constrains and compels agency itself. In contrast to approaches
that treat urgency as one of a suite of considerations in ethical
reasoning, here urgency delimits human agency, such that by the time we
choose to undertake any particular action on moral grounds, we assume it
to be the only choice we have.

Though different in intent and project, both Scanlon and Wren suggest
urgency is constitutive of ethics, precipitating the normative impulse
from which justice or alleviation from suffering might emerge. Put
another way, urgency is not just a variable, but actually produces the
conditions for morality. Derrida illustrates this characteristic as a
discursive and historical turn in his reflections on justice, writing
that 'justice, however unrepresentable it may be, does not wait. It is
that which must not wait'
(\[ [20](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib20)\]
: 967). He continues: a just decision is always required immediately,
'right away.' It cannot furnish itself with infinite information and the
unlimited knowledge of conditions, rules or hypothetical imperatives
that could justify it. And even if it did have all that at its disposal,
even if it did give itself the time, all the time and all the necessary
facts about the matter, the moment of decision, as such, always remains
a finite moment of urgency and precipitation. (Derrida, 1990: 967,
emphasis in original)

Despite this discursive relationship, Derrida does not reject a
'classical emancipatory idea' of justice
(\[ [20](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib20)\]
: 971), listing HIV-Aids, homelessness, and the death penalty as
illustrations. These are urgencies that cannot wait, because justice is
both anti-historical, interrupting that which came before, and a
discursive construction that produces something -- an idea, an action, a
policy, a prisoner -- from which the very ethics of justice emerges.

Divergent in their theoretical influences and aims, these theorizations
of the ethical work of urgency point to its power and to its role in the
construction of what we come to think of as ethical, moral, or just.
Urgency can demand the curtailing of human agency and the disruption of
history. However, the spatiality of urgency is only vaguely referenced
in these works, at best inferred through references to the individual or
collectivity, or through the acknowledgement that the urgency of justice
emerges materially in places, bodies, and circumstances. In the next
section, I therefore turn to geographical research on two interrelated
extremes of scale, the body and the large-scale global event, in order
to highlight a bias in the application of a thickly ethical concept of
urgency in our time.

[III The body and the
emergency](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#toc)

Though the body is often presumed to be the most basic unit where
urgency might be detected, only some dictionaries link urgency and the
body through a 'medical' reference to the compelling need to defecate or
urinate.5
\[ [5](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib5)\]
Focusing on the different meanings of urgency runs the risk of obscuring
language categories, but pushing together the two definitions -- urgency
as the need to defecate and urinate, and urgency as overwhelming force
-- is useful here, because my aim is to illustrate that the [[ethical
work of urgency has been hijacked]{.underline}]{.mark} by an
hierarchical organization of scales of moral deliberation. Specifically,
our research suggests that the urgent body is cast as subjective and
impulsive, while larger scales, such as the region, state or society,
emerge as the scale of a rational ethics. While these are not new
arguments about states
(\[ [55](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib55)\]
) and their institutions
(\[ [22](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib22)\]
), geographic insights into toileting and securitizations suggest that
technocratic practices both require and perpetuate an ethical
distinction between the body and the large-scale future event, with the
latter emerging as the only legitimate site of urgent claims and thus
the dominant subject of moral reasoning.

In research related to contemporary global toileting, the defecating
body's status as a legitimate ethical concern is more likely to be
acknowledged when threatening the sanitation aims of cities and states.
This is perhaps most evident in large metropolitan areas where uneven
access to toilets amplifies social inequalities and human suffering
(\[ [37](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib37)\]

examination of waste management in India and other countries in the
Global South reveals that taboos around feces often justify inequality
in two ways; first, by creating conditions of precarity through taboos
in discussing personal sanitation and toilet practices, and second, by
justifying social exclusion on the basis of inferior sanitation
practices. The lack of access to sanitation infrastructure can also
provide reasons for excluding informally settled populations from
ambitiously modernizing cities. In cities like Kampala, Uganda,
planners, development workers, and community organizers frame those who
cannot use modern toilet facilities as threatening
(\[ [62](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib62)\]

) describes a group of female migrants selling goods outside of a large,
upscale mall in Kampala, and their strategies for balancing the lack of
access to a toilet with the danger and humiliation of going in the area
behind their street-side location. Their desperate pain, induced by
waiting hours until they can finally return to a more private location,
contrasts with complaints of city planners and NGO workers who point to
moral lethargy in the informal settlements that puts the city at risk.
The poor, illegal, marginalized body is not a reasonable scale of
urgency, nor is it the product of a thoughtful weighing of
circumstances; in the face of a morally rational prioritization of a
future Kampala, these bodily urgencies literally have no place in the
modern city.

Though toileting might be thought of as a special case of bodily
urgency, geographic research suggests that the body is increasingly set
at odds with larger scale ethical concerns, especially large-scale
future events of forecasted suffering. Emergency planning is a
particularly good example in which the large-scale threats of future
suffering can distort moral reasoning.

If the important ethical work of urgency has been to identify that which
must not wait, then the capture of the power and persuasiveness of
urgency by large-scale future emergencies has consequences for the kinds
of normative arguments we can raise on behalf of urgent bodies. How,
then, might waiting compare as a normative description and critique in
our own urgent time? Waiting can be categorized according to its purpose
or outcome (see

importance. As

and places into those which matter and those which do not'. The
segregation of waiting might produce effects that counteract suffering,
however, and

: 957) explains that though the 'politics of waiting' can be repressive,
it can also engender creative political engagement. In his research with
educated unemployed Jat youth who spend days and years waiting for
desired employment, Jeffery finds that 'the temporal suffering and sense
of ambivalence experienced by young men can generate cultural and
political experiments that, in turn, have marked social and spatial
effects'
(\[ [29](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib29)\]
: 186). Though this is not the same as claiming normative neutrality for
waiting, it does suggest that waiting is more ethically ambivalent and
open than urgency.

In other contexts, however, our descriptions of waiting indicate a
strong condemnation of its effects upon the subjects of study. Waiting
can demobilize radical reform, depoliticizing 'the insurrectionary
possibilities of the present by delaying the revolutionary imperative to
a future moment that is forever drifting towards infinity'
(\[ [75](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib75)\]

analysis of the self-destructive activities of disrespected
working-class youth in Istanbul suggests that this sense of infinite
waiting can lead not only to depoliticization, but also to a disbelief
in the possibility of a future self of any value. Waiting, like urgency,
can undermine the possibility of self-care two-fold, first by making
people wait for essential needs, and again by reinforcing that waiting
is '\[s\]omething to be ashamed of because it may be noted or taken as
evidence of indolence or low status, seen as a symptom of rejection or a
signal to exclude'

but the subjective effect of waiting that secures domination, as
citizens and non-citizens find themselves 'waiting hopefully and then
frustratedly for others to make decisions, and in effect surrendering to
the authority of others'
(\[ [6](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib6)\]

Waiting can therefore function as a potentially important spatial
technology of the elite and powerful, mobilized not only for the purpose
of governing individuals, but also to retain claims over moral urgency.
But there is growing resistance to the capture of claims of urgency by
the elite, and it is important to note that even in cases where the
material conditions of containment are currently impenetrable, arguments
based on human value are at the forefront of reclaiming urgency for the
body. In detention centers, clandestine prisons, state borders and
refugee camps, geographers point to ongoing struggles against the
ethical impossibility of bodily urgency and a rejection of states of
waiting (see

account of desperate female detainees stripping off their clothes to
expose their humanness and suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration
Removal Centre in the UK suggests that demands for recognition are not
just about politics, but also about the acknowledgement of humanness and
the irrevocable possibility of being that which cannot wait. The
continued existence of places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions
in the USA nonetheless points to the challenge of exposing the urgent
body as a moral priority when it is so easily hidden from view, and also
reminds us that our research can help to explain the relationships
between normative dimensions and the political and social conditions of
struggle.

In closing, geographic depictions of waiting do seem to evocatively
describe otherwise obscured suffering (e.g.
\[ [13](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib13)\]
), but it is striking how rarely these descriptions also use the
language of urgency. Given the discussion above, what might be
accomplished -- and risked -- by incorporating urgency more overtly and
deliberately into our discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned
bodies? Urgency can clarify the implicit but understated ethical
consequences and normativity associated with waiting, and encourage
explicit discussion about harmful suffering. Waiting can be productive
or unproductive for radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires
response. Geographers could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical
work of urgency in ways that leave it open for critique, clarifying
common spatial misunderstandings and representations. There is good
reason to be thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards
inhumanity can itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human,
dividing up 'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those
whose lives and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives
at all'
(\[ [14](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib14)\]

materially and discursively, it is just as easily cast as impulsive,
disgusting, animalistic (see also

violence

). Insisting that a suffering body, now, is that which cannot wait, has
the ethical effect of drawing it into consideration alongside the
political, public and exceptional scope of large-scale futures. It may
help us insist on the body, both as a single unit and a plurality, as a
legitimate scale of normative priority and social care.

In this report, I have explored old and new reflections on the ethical
work of urgency and waiting. Geographic research suggests a contemporary
popular bias towards the urgency of large-scale futures,
institutionalized in ways that further obscure and discredit the
urgencies of the body. This bias also justifies the production of new
waiting places in our material landscape, places like the detention
center and the waiting room. In some cases, waiting is normatively
neutral, even providing opportunities for alternative politics. In
others, [[the technologies of waiting]{.underline}]{.mark} [[serve to
manage]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[problematic bodies, leading

[[extermination]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.

). One of my aims has been to suggest that moral reasoning is important
both because it exposes normative biases against subjugated people, and
because it potentially provides routes toward struggle where claims to
urgency seem to foreclose the possibilities of alleviation of suffering.
[[Saving the world still should require a debate about whose world is
being saved, when, and at what cost]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and this
requires a debate about what really cannot wait. My next report will
extend some of these concerns by reviewing how feelings of urgency, as
well as hope, fear, and other emotions, have played a role in geography
and ethical reasoning.

I conclude, however, by pulling together past and present. In 1972,
Gilbert White asked why geographers were not engaging 'the truly urgent
questions'
(\[ [66](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib66)\]
: 101) such as racial repression, decaying cities, economic inequality,
and global environmental destruction. His question highlights just how
much the discipline has changed, but it is also unnerving in its echoes
of our contemporary problems. Since White's writing, our moral reasoning
has been stretched to consider the future body and the more-than-human,
alongside the presently urgent body -- topics and concerns that I have
not taken up in this review but which will provide their own new
possibilities for urgent concerns. My own hope presently is drawn from
an acknowledgement that the temporal characteristics of contemporary
capitalism can be interrupted in creative ways
(\[ [57](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=4b9b8886-9688-4569-909e-9570aa500c00%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNzbyZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#bib57)\]
), with the possibility of squaring the urgent body with our large-scale
future concerns. Temporal alternatives already exist in ongoing and
emerging revolutions and the disruption of claims of cycles and circular
political processes (e.g.

a truly fierce urgency for now.

Early this month, scientists announced that they had edited genes in a
human embryo to remove a disease-causing mutation. The work was
astounding and the answer to prayers of many parents. Who wouldn\'t want
a chance to prevent what would now be needless suffering by their
children? But that wouldn\'t be the end of it. Many parents would want
to ensure their children had the best of advantages through genetic
improvement. Those with means could obtain them. [[With the ability
comes ethical questions beyond the ultimate safety of such
techniques]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Expense of procedures will produce
scarcity and aggravate income inequality]{.underline}]{.mark} that
already continues to grow. [[Such improvements would certainly include
physical characteristics because they can affect
success]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[For example, taller people tend to be
more financially successful in life, with one study showing that over a
30-year career, a six-foot tall person would make \$166,000 more than
someone five-foot five-inches]{.underline}]{.mark}. Almost all Fortune
500 CEOs are at least six-foot two-inches tall, even though that is true
of only 3.9% of the population. [[Studies have shown that physical
beauty translates into higher earnings]{.underline}]{.mark} than people
who are less attractive by cultural norms. The gap is as large as those
due to gender or racial factors. People wrongly assume that physical
attractiveness has a strong correlation with competence and ability.
Intelligence could also become an engineered trait in time. Intelligence
is more than genetics, but what you inherit is an enormous part of what
you can eventually develop. So, you could, in theory, make it easier for
kids to whip through school, standardized tests, and the other hurdles
that surround academic achievement. However, intelligence may not
strongly correlate with lifetime income. (The question brings to mind an
old Dilbert comic in which Dilbert asks a genius co-worker why he is
also at the backward corporate employer. The genius questions whether
intelligence is a Darwinian survival trait.) Genetic engineering of
humans will happen as certainly as the atomic bomb would be developed
once physics proved that such a device was possible in theory. Parents
who can afford to already run children through enrichment programs and
get them tutoring in how to take important standardized tests. What
separates such kids from the majority is that their parents can afford
these paths to a higher percentage of achievement. Genetic engineering
will be no different, particularly in who benefits from it. Undoubtedly
someone will make the claim that the technology will free everyone. That
will not happen anymore than early automation and the replacement of
human workers led to more leisure time to learn and be creative[[.
Families far from the upper cast are unlikely to have the funds to
indulge]{.underline}]{.mark} in such treatments. It will be the
wealthiest who do, just as they already do. And be sure that some
scientists and technicians who could perform such services will do so
when enough money is offered. The result could become a Huxley-like
dystopia with a class structure even more rigid than today. In Brave New
World, is was the intentional reduction in mental and physical abilities
that created the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon categories of
humans. [[We already countenance wide disparities]{.underline}]{.mark}
in educational and cultural resources [[based on income, which makes it
more difficult for people to move out of a lower economic background.
Manipulating the innat]{.underline}]{.mark}e abilities of those with the
most would additionally extend the differentiation and the advantage.

#### Inequality causes warming and turns every other impact 

Luke **Kemp 2019**, Researcher based at the Centre for the Study of
Existential Risk (CSER) at the University of Cambridge, "Are we on the
road to civilization collapse?" 02/19/19,
http://www.st-stanislaus-gy.com/Academics/Topics/CollapseOfCivilization.pdf

Our deep past is marked by recurring failure. As part of my research at
the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of
Cambridge, I am attempting to find out why collapse occurs through a
historical autopsy. What can the rise and fall of historic civilisations
tell us about our own? What are the forces that precipitate or delay a
collapse? And do we see similar patterns today? The first way to look at
past civilisations is to compare their longevity. This can be difficult,
because there is no strict definition of civilisation, nor an
overarching database of their births and deaths. In the graphic below, I
have compared the lifespan of various civilisations, which I define as a
society with agriculture, multiple cities, military dominance in its
geographical region and a continuous political structure. Given this
definition, all empires are civilisations, but not all civilisations are
empires. The data is drawn from two studies on the growth and decline of
empires (for 3000-600BC and 600BC-600), and an informal, crowdsourced
survey of ancient civilisations (which I have amended). [[Collapse can
be defined as a rapid and enduring loss of
population]{.underline}]{.mark}, identity and socioeconomic complexity.
Public services crumble and disorder ensues as government loses control
of its monopoly on violence. Virtually all past civilisations have faced
this fate. Some recovered or transformed, such as the Chinese and
Egyptian. Other collapses were permanent, as was the case of Easter
Island. Sometimes the cities at the epicentre of collapse are revived,
as was the case with Rome. In other cases, such as the Mayan ruins, they
are left abandoned as a mausoleum for future tourists. What can this
tell us about the future of global modern civilisation? Are the lessons
of agrarian empires applicable to our post-18th Century period of
industrial capitalism? I would argue that they are. Societies of the
past and present are just complex systems composed of people and
technology. The theory of "normal accidents" suggests that complex
technological systems regularly give way to failure. So collapse may be
a normal phenomenon for civilisations, regardless of their size and
stage. We may be more technologically advanced now. But this gives
little ground to believe that we are immune to the threats that undid
our ancestors. [[Our newfound technological abilities even bring new,
unprecedented challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} to the mix. And while our
scale may now be global, collapse appears to happen to both sprawling
empires and fledgling kingdoms alike. There is no reason to believe that
greater size is armour against societal dissolution. Our
tightly-coupled, globalised economic system is, if anything, [[more
likely to make crisis spread.]{.underline}]{.mark} If the fate of
previous civilisations can be a roadmap to our future, what does it say?
One method is to examine the trends that preceded historic collapses and
see how they are unfolding today. While there is no single accepted
theory for why collapses happen, historians, anthropologists and others
have proposed various explanations, [[including: CLIMATIC
CHANGE]{.underline}]{.mark}: When climatic stability changes, the
results can be disastrous, resulting in crop failure, starvation and
desertification. The collapse of the Anasazi, the Tiwanaku civilisation,
the Akkadians, the Mayan, the Roman Empire, and many others have all
coincided with abrupt climatic changes, usually droughts[[.
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION:]{.underline}]{.mark} Collapse can occur when
societies overshoot the carrying capacity of their environment. This
ecological collapse theory, which has been the subject of bestselling
books, points to excessive deforestation, water pollution, soil
degradation and the loss of biodiversity as precipitating causes.
INEQUALITY AND OLIGARCHY: [[Wealth and political inequality can be
central drivers of social disintegration]{.underline}]{.mark}, as can
oligarchy and centralisation of power among leaders. This not only
causes social distress, but handicaps a society's ability to respond to
ecological, social and economic problems. The field of cliodynamics
models how factors such as equality and demography correlate with
political violence. Statistical analysis of previous societies suggests
that this happens in cycles. As population increases, the supply of
labour outstrips demand, workers become cheap and society becomes
top-heavy. This inequality undermines collective solidarity and
political turbulence follows. COMPLEXITY: Collapse expert and historian
Joseph Tainter has proposed that societies eventually collapse under the
weight of their own accumulated complexity and bureaucracy. Societies
are problem-solving collectives that grow in complexity in order to
overcome new issues. However, the returns from complexity eventually
reach a point of diminishing returns. After this point, collapse will
eventually ensue. Another measure of increasing complexity is called
Energy Return on Investment (EROI). This refers to the ratio between the
amount of energy produced by a resource relative to the energy needed to
obtain it. Like complexity, EROI appears to have a point of diminishing
returns. In his book The Upside of Down, the political scientist Thomas
Homer-Dixon observed that environmental degradation throughout the Roman
Empire led to falling EROI from their staple energy source: crops of
wheat and alfalfa. The empire fell alongside their EROI. Tainter also
blames it as a chief culprit of collapse, including for the Mayan.
EXTERNAL SHOCKS: In other words, the "four horsemen": [[war, natural
disasters, famine and plagues]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Aztec Empire,
for example, was brought to an end by Spanish invaders. Most early
agrarian states were fleeting due to deadly epidemics. The concentration
of humans and cattle in walled settlements with poor hygiene made
disease outbreaks unavoidable and catastrophic. Sometimes disasters
combined, as was the case with the Spanish introducing salmonella to the
Americas. RANDOMNESS/BAD LUCK: Statistical analysis on empiressuggests
that collapse is random and independent of age. Evolutionary biologist
and data scientist Indre Zliobaite and her colleagues have observed a
similar pattern in the evolutionary record of species. A common
explanation of this apparent randomness is the "Red Queen Effect": if
species are constantly fighting for survival in a changing environment
with numerous competitors, extinction is a consistent possibility.
Despite the abundance of books and articles, we don't have a conclusive
explanation as to why civilisations collapse. What we do know is this:
the factors highlighted above can all contribute. Collapse is a tipping
point phenomena, when compounding stressors overrun societal coping
capacity. We can examine these indicators of danger to see if our chance
of collapse is falling or rising. Here are four of those possible
metrics, measured over the past few decades: Temperature is a clear
metric for climate change, GDP is a proxy for complexity and the
ecological footprint is an indicator for environmental degradation. Each
of these has been trending steeply upwards. Inequality is more difficult
to calculate. The typical measurement of the Gini Index suggests that
inequality has decreased slightly globally (although it is increasing
within countries). However, the Gini Index can be misleading as it only
measures relative changes in income. In other words, if two individuals
earning \$1 and \$100,000 both doubled their income, the Gini would show
no change. But the gap between the two would have jumped from \$99,999
to \$198,000. Because of this, I have also depicted the income share of
the global top 1%. The 1% have increased in their share of global income
from approximately 16% in 1980 to over 20% today. Importantly, wealth
inequality is even worse. The share of global wealth from the 1% has
swelled from 25-30% in the 1980s to approximately 40% in 2016. The
reality is likely to be starker as these numbers do not capture wealth
and income siphoned into overseas tax havens. Studies suggest that the
EROI for fossil fuels has been steadily decreasing over time as the
easiest to reach and richest reserves are depleted. Unfortunately, most
renewable replacements, such as solar, have a markedly lower EROI,
largely due to their energy density and the rare earth metals and
manufacturing required to produce them. This has led much of the
literature to discuss the possibility of an "energy cliff" as EROI
declines to a point where current societal levels of affluence can no
longer be maintained. The energy cliff need not be terminal if renewable
technologies continue to improve and energy efficiency measures are
speedily implemented. Measures of resilience The somewhat reassuring
news is that collapse metrics are not the entire picture. Societal
resilience may be able to delay or prevent collapse. For example,
globally "economic diversity" -- a measurement of the diversity and
sophistication of country exports -- is greater today than it was in the
1960s and 1970s, as measured by the Economic Complexity Index (ECI).
Nations are, on average, less reliant on single types of exports than
they once were. For example, a nation that had diversified beyond only
exporting agricultural products would be more likely to weather
ecological degradation or the loss of trading partners. The ECI also
measures the knowledge-intensity of exports. More skilled populations
may have a greater capacity to respond to crises as they arise.
Similarly, innovation -- as measured by per capita patent applications--
is also rising. In theory, a civilisation might be less vulnerable to
collapse if new technologies can mitigate against pressures such as
climate change. It's also possible that "collapse" can happen without
violent catastrophe. As Rachel Nuwer wrote on BBC Future in 2017, "in
some cases, civilisations simply fade out of existence -- becoming the
stuff of history not with a bang but a whimper". Still, when we look at
all these collapse and resilience indicators as a whole, the message is
clear that we should not be complacent. There are some reasons to be
optimistic, thanks to our ability to innovate and diversify away from
disaster. Yet the world is worsening in areas that have contributed to
the collapse of previous societies. The climate is changing, the gap
between the rich and poor is widening, the world is becoming
increasingly complex, and our demands on the environment are
outstripping planetary carrying capacity. The rungless ladder That\'s
not all. Worryingly, the world is now deeply interconnected and
interdependent. In the past, collapse was confined to regions -- it was
a temporary setback, and people often could easily return to agrarian or
hunter-gatherer lifestyles. For many, it was even a welcome reprieve
from the oppression of early states. Moreover, the weapons available
during social disorder were rudimentary: swords, arrows and occasionally
guns. Today, societal collapse is a more treacherous prospect. [The
[weapons available to a state, and]{.mark} sometimes even [groups,
during]{.mark} a [breakdown]{.mark} now [range from biological]{.mark}
agents [to nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. New instruments of
violence, such as lethal autonomous weapons, may be available in the
near future. People are increasingly specialised and disconnected from
the production of food and basic goods. And a changing climate may
irreparably damage our ability to return to simple farming practices.
Think of civilisation as a poorly-built ladder. As you climb, each step
that you used falls away. A fall from a height of just a few rungs is
fine. Yet the higher you climb, the larger the fall. Eventually, once
you reach a sufficient height, any drop from the ladder is fatal. With
the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we may have already reached this
point of civilisational "terminal velocity". [Any
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline} -- any fall from the ladder -- [[risks
being permanent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nuclear war in itself could result
in an existential risk: either [[the extinction of our
species]{.underline}]{.mark}, or a permanent catapult back to the Stone
Age. While we are becoming more economically powerful and resilient, our
technological capabilities also present unprecedented threats that no
civilisation has had to contend with. For example, the climatic changes
we face are of a different nature to what undid the Maya or Anazasi.
They are global, human-driven, quicker, and more severe.

#### Tackling inequality is key to global cooperation

Charles **Kupchan and** Peter **Trubowitz 2021** -- Georgetown
University international affairs professor and professor at London
School of Economics "The Home Front: Why an Internationalist Foreign
Policy Needs a Stronger Domestic Foundation," Foreign Affairs, May/June
2021

The Home Front: Why an Internationalist Foreign Policy Needs a Stronger
Domestic Foundation U.S. President Joe Biden has declared that under his
leadership, "America is back" and once again "ready to lead the world."
[[Biden wants to return the country to its traditional role of
catalyzing international cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} and staunchly
defending liberal values abroad. His challenge, however, is primarily
one of politics, not policy. Despite Biden's victory in last year's
presidential election, his internationalist vision faces a deeply
skeptical American public. The political foundations of U.S.
internationalism have collapsed. The domestic consensus that long
supported U.S. engagement abroad has come apart in the face of mounting
partisan discord and a deepening rift between urban and rural Americans.
An inward turn has accompanied these growing divides. President Donald
Trump's unilateralism, neo-isolationism, protectionism, and nativism
were anathema to most of the U.S. foreign policy establishment. But
Trump's approach to statecraft tapped into public misgivings about
American overreach, contributing to his victory in 2016 and helping him
win the backing of 74 million voters in 2020. An "America first"
approach to the world sells well when many Americans experience economic
insecurity and feel that they have been on the losing end of
globalization. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center revealed that
roughly half the U.S. public believes that the country should pay less
attention to problems overseas and concentrate more on fixing problems
at home. [[Redressing the hardships facing]{.underline}]{.mark} many
[[working Americans is essential to inoculating the country against
"America first"]{.underline}]{.mark} and Trump's illiberal politics of
grievance. That task begins with economic renewal. Restoring popular
support for the country's internationalist calling will entail sustained
investment in pandemic recovery, health care, infrastructure, green
technology and jobs, and other domestic programs. Those steps will
require structural political reforms to ease gridlock and ensure that
U.S. foreign policy serves the interests of working Americans. [[What
Biden needs is an "inside out" approach that will link imperatives at
home to objectives abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Much will depend on
his willingness and ability to take bold action to rebuild broad popular
support for internationalism]{.underline}]{.mark} from the ground up.
Success would significantly reduce the chances that the president who
follows Biden, even if he or she is a Republican, would return to
Trump's self-defeating foreign policy. Such [[future-proofing is
critical to restoring international confidence in the United
States.]{.underline}]{.mark} In light of the dysfunction and
polarization plaguing U.S. politics, leaders and people around the world
are justifiably questioning whether Biden represents a new normal or
just a fleeting reprieve from "America first."

#### Economic inequality spurs political gridlock- manifests every extinction scenario

How We Can Overcome Them, Switzerland: Springer International, 2017, p.

The argument that income [[inequality leads to legislative stalemate and
government indecision]{.underline}]{.mark} was advanced by Mian and
colleagues in a study of the political outcomes of the 2008--2009 Global
Economic Recession (Mian et al. 2012 ), stating "...politically
[[countries become more polarized and
fractionalized]{.underline}]{.mark} following financial crises. This
results in legislative stalemate, making it less likely that crises lead
to meaningful macroeconomic reforms." It also affects intergenerational
cohesion, explains Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz: "These
three realities -- [[social injustice on an unprecedented scale, massive
inequities, and a loss of trust in elites]{.underline}]{.mark} -- define
our political moment, and rightly so.... But we won't be able to fix the
problem if we don't recognize it. Our young do. They perceive the
absence of intergenerational justice, and they are right to be angry"
(Stiglitz 2016). From the perspective of the survival of civilization
and the human species, financial inequality does not represent a direct
threat---indeed most societies have long managed with varying degrees of
income disparity. Where it is of concern to a human race, whose numbers
and demands have already exceeded the finite boundaries of its shared
planet, is in [[the capacity of inequality to wreck social cohesion
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[hence, to undermine the prospects for a
collaborative effort by the whole of humanity to tackle the multiple
existential threats we face]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rich-against-poor is a
good way to divert the argument and so de-rail climate action,
disarmament, [[planetary clean-up or food security, for
instance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Disunity spells electoral loss in
politics, rifts between commanders and their troops breed military
defeat, lack of team spirit yields failure in sport, disharmony means a
poor orchestra or business performance, family disagreements often lead
to dysfunction and violence. These lessons are well-known and attested,
from every walk of life. Yet humans persistently overlook the cost of
socioeconomic disunity and grievances when it comes to dealing with our
common perils as a species. [[For civilisation and our species to
survive]{.underline}]{.mark} and prosper sustainably in the long run,
common understandings and [[co-operation are
essential]{.underline}]{.mark}, across all the gulfs that divide
us---political, ethnic, religious and economic. [[A sustainable world,
and a viable human species, will not be possible
unless]{.underline}]{.mark} the poverty and [[inequity gaps can be
reduced]{.underline}]{.mark}, if not closed. This is not a matter of
politics or ideology, as many may argue: it is the same lesson in
collective wisdom and collaboration which those earliest humans first
learned on the African savannah a million and a half years ago: together
we stand, divided we fall. It is purely an issue of co-existence and
co-survival. Neither rich nor poor are advantaged by a state of
civilisation in collapse. An unsustainable world will kill the affluent
as surely as the deprived.

[[This prospect should make recent attempts to back-pedal on the

advocates. For example, a 2017
[report](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24623/human-genome-editing-science-ethics-and-governance)
by a committee of the US National Academies of Sciences and Medicine
recommended that gene editing for human reproduction be permitted in
certain circumstances, leaving open the possibility of expanding those
circumstances in the future. But [[in the real world of commercial
pressures and regulatory inadequacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, such [[limits
would simply not hold. If the door to the use of human germline
modification is cracked open, it will be impossible to limit its spread
and applications]{.underline}]{.mark}. At this critical juncture, [[it's
important to remind ourselves why key human rights documents
specifically prohibited these practices]{.underline}]{.mark}, long
before they were technically feasible. [[The medical justifications for
human germline modification fall short, and the temptation to "enhance"

that road, our scientific achievements would all too likely become not

#### We don't even know how to safely edit human germlines, so we shouldn't do it

ENGINEERING AN UNSTOPPABLE TRAIN
https://mylaw2.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/28-2-Chen.pdf

Regardless of the potential impact of gene editing on diversity or
inequality, [[society is not yet equipped with the technology to safely
edit human germlines.]{.underline}]{.mark} Since 2003 and the completion
of Human Genome Project, we have fully mapped the DNA of human
beings.132 However, the [[knowledge of a human's nucleotide sequence is
a far cry from knowing how genes interact within one another and affect
the human physiology]{.underline}]{.mark}. If germline gene modification
is likely to have significant medical benefits, is it nevertheless
justified if there are still unknown chances that it could have other
unintended, adverse consequences as well? Perhaps with some fatal
diseases, such as Huntington's Disease, where a single point mutation
causes all [[symptoms, the benefits of the potential cure may outweigh
the safety risks of germline gene editing.]{.underline}]{.mark} In fact,
just this year, the U.S. National Academy of Science and the National
Academy of Medicine released a report suggesting that such gene editing
clinical trials "'might be permitted, but only following much more
research' on the risks and benefits, and 'only for compelling reasons
and under strict oversight.'" 133 Although clinical germline gene
editing may be technologically possible in the near future, the state of
current gene editing technology does not yet justify the start of
clinical applications. The potential benefits of germline gene editing
notwithstanding, [[society has a responsibility to consider the best
interests of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[potential human
life]{.underline}]{.mark} if gene editing still poses significant
adverse risks. [[Currently, there are still too many issues with
off-target gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark} (undesired typos in gene
editing) [[and too many questions regarding what unforeseen consequences
gene editing may have on future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}.134
Gene editing technology and our understanding of genetics will develop
in time, but until we can definitively engineer an embryo without
significant detrimental effects, there will remain significant questions
surrounding medical applications of germline gene editing. Therefore, it
is imperative that we support basic science research in human embryos if
clinical gene editing treatments are ever to see the light of day.

adoption]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, use of IVF followed by
genetic screening of the embryos to ensure that only unaffected ones are
transferred to the person's uterus, guarantees that a couple will not
have children with the genetic disease. The real problem is that most
children with severe genetic diseases are born to couples who did not
know they were at risk. [[Routine access to preconception genetic
screening could allow most at-risk couples to make use of current
options, should they wish to do so]{.underline}]{.mark}. Better access
to newborn screening is also needed, to ensure that babies with a
genetic disease can immediately receive any available therapy.

#### Scientists and experts agree on the need for a ban on human germline gene editing. The plan provides a governing framework that will drive dialogue on the issue and be the step to achieving global consensus.

For a combination of all of these reasons, [[experts across fields with
knowledge on the subject of gene editing, and particularly germline
editing, are calling for caution]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
aforementioned [[CRISPR pioneer Feng Zhang]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, in supporting a moratorium, [[noted
that before beginning experimentation, society needs to decide if human
germline editing is even a good that should be
pursued.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[If that is decided]{.underline}]{.mark},
he said, "[[we need to have guidelines first]{.underline}]{.mark} so
that the people who do this work can proceed in a responsible way, with
the right oversight and quality controls."71 In reaction to Dr. He's
revelation at the 2018 summit, David Baltimore, chair of the Summit
Organizing Committee, called the fact of the experiment "a failure of
self-regulation by the scientific community."72 Furthermore, [[following
both the 2015 and 2018 summits]{.underline}]{.mark}, groups of
[[scientists and experts put out calls for a
moratorium]{.mark}]{.underline} on clinical applications of human
germline editing until a "broad societal consensus" could be reached and
an international governance framework established.73 While this
consensus has not been reached and may in fact be far away,74 presumably
[[there should be a governance framework ready to govern
applications]{.underline}]{.mark} prior to this consensus to ensure that
society and science proceed with caution, wisdom, and oversight.
Furthermore, [[the development of principles and potential regulatory
regimes may in fact help different arms of society come together in
dialogue about the issue;]{.underline}]{.mark} in other words,
[[resolving governance issues on the topic may be an important step in

### autonomy & mosaicism

#### Its unethical because it risks mosaicism and off target effects

for Human Germline Gene Editing 95 Notre Dame Law Review 1369
https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4899&context=ndlr

Legal professor and bioethicist Katherine Drabiak describes the rhetoric
around gene editing "intentionally misleading," stating that the current
state of technology is not as efficient as it is believed to be in terms
of its potential benefits, and that, in fact, there is significant risk
involved.47 [[The medical risks associated with germline gene editing
include mosaicism]{.underline}]{.mark}, meaning some genes contain the
intended modification and others do not. [[This can lead to serious
health risks]{.underline}]{.mark} in later stages of development48 [[and
other off target effects]{.underline}]{.mark}. Off-target effects "refer
to a range of unintended outcomes" that can have serious health impacts
on the child, including advanced aging or the development of tumors.49
Problematically, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), a process used
to test the health of an embryo prior to implantation for pregnancy,50
often fails to accurately assess the effects of gene editing on an
embryo[[. The inability to use PGD to test the health of an edited
embryo would make it difficult to ascertain the germline editing
procedure's effectiveness prior to the embryo's
implantation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, PGD cannot be used as
a safeguard to indicate whether the editing has worked correctly prior
to implantation.51 PGD can, however, be used to assess whether a
defective gene is present in an unedited embryo, which is why Drabiak
points to this as a better alternative to germline editing.52 Finally,
[[there are a range of unpredictable effects that may emerge at any
point in the future person's life as a result of tampering with their
initial germline cells]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drabiak notes that
[[current research touting effectiveness incorrectly presumes that,
following a gene editing procedure, "embryo survival equates to
health]{.underline}]{.mark}."53 In other words, a test subject embryo's
surviving the trial is not necessarily an indication of how the fetus
will fare in the next nine months, or the years and decades following
its birth. Some scholars believe that "germline modification will never
be safe . . . because interactions between genes are highly integrated,
designed to achieve stability and balance, and manipulation of one
location risks disrupting the biological equilibrium."54 Of course, this
poses a serious obstacle to any research: with [[the current expert
consensus on a moratorium]{.underline}]{.mark} on any applications that
would result in a pregnancy,55 it [[is not possible to observe effects
of germline editing on later stages of development of a
child.]{.underline}]{.mark} Drabiak proposes that [[these risks are
severe enough that they easily outweigh any benefits that germline gene
editing could ever theoretically provide]{.underline}]{.mark}.56

[[Editing genes in human embryos]{.underline}]{.mark} could one day
prevent some serious genetic disorders from being passed down from
parents to their children --- but, for now, the technique [[is too risky
to be used in embryos destined for implantation]{.mark}, according to a
high-profile international commission.]{.underline} And even when the
technology is mature, its use should initially be permitted in only a
narrow set of circumstances, the panel says. [The recommendations,
released in a report on 3 September, were produced by experts in ten
countries convened by the US National Academy of Medicine, the US
National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society. The document
joins a wealth of reports compiled in recent years that have argued
against using gene editing in the clinic]{.underline} until researchers
are able to address [safety worries, and]{.underline} the public has had
a chance to comment on [ethical and societal concerns.]{.underline} "The
technology is not presently ready for clinical application," says
Richard Lifton, president of the Rockefeller University in New York City
and co-chair of the commission. [The report]{.underline} --- which
[reviewed the scientific and technical state of heritable gene editing,
rather than ethical questions]{.underline} --- advocates the formation
of an international committee to evaluate developments in the technology
and advise national advisory groups and regulators on its safety and
utility. The commission was formed after [Chinese biophysicist He
Jiankui shocked the world in 2018 by announcing that he had edited human
embryos that were then implanted, in an effort to make the resulting
children resistant to HIV infection. The work,]{.underline} which [was
widely condemned by scientists and yielded prison sentences for He and
two of his colleagues]{.underline}, led to the birth of two children
with edited genomes. Unwanted changes Although [[genome-editing
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} such as CRISPR--Cas9 offer a fairly
precise way to edit the genome, they [[have been shown to
generate]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[unwanted changes to genes, and can
produce a range of different outcomes even among cells in the same
embryo]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[It could be years before researchers are
able to iron out these difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark}, says Haoyi
Wang, a developmental biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Zoology in Beijing, and a commission member. In addition,
Wang says, scientists need to develop better methods for thoroughly
sequencing a human genome from single cells, so that an edited embryo
can be screened in detail for unwanted genetic changes. The report also
recommends that if, after thorough discussion with the public,
individual nations decide that they are ready to move forwards with
heritable genome editing, the practice should initially be limited to
serious genetic disorders that are caused by DNA variants in a single
gene. Even then, it should be used only when the alternatives for having
a biologically related child that is unaffected by the genetic disorder
are poor. "[[The report lays out very, very well just how rare it's
going to be that people actually need to access heritable human-genome
editing]{.underline}]{.mark}," says Jackie Leach Scully, a bioethicist
at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. For example,
in some cases people will instead be able to screen out embryos that
carry a disease-causing genetic mutation. "We understand that not many
couples would fall into these categories," says Kay Davies, a geneticist
at the University of Oxford, UK, and co-chair of the commission. "There
would be a need for international cooperation in doing these first cases
because there would be so few worldwide."

And [[CRISPR still has big safety risks]{.underline} [The most-discussed
safety risk with CRISPR is that the Cas9
enzyme]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} which is supposed to slice a
specific DNA sequence, [[will also make cuts in other parts of the
genome that could result in mutations that raise cancer
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline} Researchers are moving quickly to make CRISPR
more specific. For example, in January, one lab described a tweak to
Cas9 that dramatically reduces off-target effects. And in April in
Nature, another team showed how to make the enzyme more efficient at
swapping out single DNA bases. But [[immediate off-target cuts aren\'t
the only worry]{.mark}. Although it\'s possible to deliver CRISPR\'s
components into cells in a dish as proteins or RNA, so far researchers
can usually only get it working in tissue inside the body by using a
viral vector to deliver the DNA for Cas9 into cells. This means that
even after Cas9 has made the desired cuts, cells will keep cranking it
out]{.underline}. \"The enzyme will still hang around over 10, 20
years,\" Zhang says. [That raises the chances that [even a very specific
Cas9 will still make off-target cuts and that the body will mount an
immune response to the enzyme]{.mark}.]{.underline} This may not truly
be a problem, Zhang suggests. His team created a mouse strain that is
born with the gene for Cas9 turned on all the time, so it expresses the
enzyme in all cells for the animal\'s entire life. Even after
interbreeding these mice for about 20 generations, the mice \"seem to be
fine\" with no obvious abnormal health effects, Zhang says. All the
same, \"the most ideal case is, we want to shut off the enzyme.\" And
that may mean finding nonviral methods for getting Cas9 into cells, such
as ferrying the protein with lipids or nanoparticles---delivery methods
that biologists have long struggled to make work in living animals.
[Other long-standing obstacles to gene therapy will confront efforts
using CRISPR, too.]{.underline} Depending on the disease, [[any
gene-edited cells may eventually die and patients could have to be
treated multiple times]{.mark}. Researchers using gene transfer and
editing approaches are also both hindered by limits on how much DNA a
viral vector can carry. Right now CRISPR researchers often must use two
different viruses to get CRISPR\'s components into cells, which is less
efficient than a single vector.]{.underline}

[[Five arguments against germline genome editing
**Consent**]{.mark}]{.underline} A crucial element of any clinical
procedure is informed consent---ensuring that the patient fully
understands the risks of a treatment. [GGE is so new, complex, and
uncertain that we cannot adequately inform prospective patients of the
risks to them or future generations. This raises the deeper question of
whether we have the right to deliberately, permanently, and irrevocably
change the human genome without universal consensus.]{.underline}
[[**Uncertainty** The human genome is an extremely complex ecosystem
that we don't fully understand, so **we cannot** absolutely **predict
the impact editing a gene will have**]{.mark}**.** Sometimes multiple
genes interact to perform a function, and it's possible that a single
edit could affect many other genes. Nor can we completely guarantee the
accuracy of genome editing, so [there is **always the risk of** making
unintended changes with **unforeseen
consequences**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**Permanence** If a change is
made in a germline cell, we cannot reverse it.]{.mark} That change will
inexorably pass from parent to child through the generations and will
spread between families, communities, and countries to become part of
humankind forever.]{.underline} As the entire effects of a genetic
modification may not become apparent for years, decades, or even
generations, [[permanently altering the human genome is too big a risk
to take.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The domino of potential unethical side effects justifies a ban on germline editing.

Doesn\'t Mean We Should Do It January 03, **2020**

That argument pushes us towards a risk we shouldn't take.
"Prime-Editing" is more precise than CRISPR, but that doesn't make it
"safe" for this purpose. [[If germline gene editing goes wrong, there's
no ethically sound way to stop the resulting domino
effect]{.underline}]{.mark}. Gone wrong, [[germline gene editing has the
potential to do widespread damage]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consider the
recent
[finding](https://www.businessinsider.in/science/news/every-person-alive-today-descended-from-a-woman-who-lived-in-modern-day-botswana-about-200000-years-ago-a-new-study-finds/articleshow/71795510.cms)
that all living human beings descended from one woman who lived in the
area we now call Botswana. Scientists have referred to this common
ancestor as "Mitochondrial Eve." Take her as an example --- an extreme,
but real, example --- of the potential reach of one individual's genes.
Editing an embryo's germline genes means that you're altering the
genetic code of that person, for life --- and, if that individual has a
baby, they may pass on those altered genes to that baby. [[If Nana or
Lulu have children, they'll pass on the germline edits Dr. He made ---
both the intended and the unintended]{.underline}]{.mark}. When they
come of age, Nana and Lulu will have to have a version of the "where
babies come from?" talk that no human being has ever before experienced,
or should have to. [[The only way to prevent the future transmission of
germline edits is to prevent the person whose genes have been edited
from reproducing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nana and Lulu couldn't have
possibly consented to that as a condition of the experiment, because
they weren't alive when the experiment was performed. [[Limiting their
reproductive possibilities in that way would approach
eugenics.]{.mark}]{.underline}

surface for years.**

[[The CRISPR technique has dramatically expanded research on genome
editing. But we cannot imagine a situation in which its use in human
embryos would offer a therapeutic benefit over existing and developing
methods]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would be difficult to control exactly
how many cells are modified. Increasing the dose of nuclease used would
increase the likelihood that the mutated gene will be corrected, but
also raise the risk of cuts being made elsewhere in the genome. In an
embryo, a nuclease may not necessarily cut both copies of the target
gene, or the cell may start dividing before the corrections are
complete, resulting in a genetic mosaic. Studies using gene-editing in
animals such as
rats[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/519410a#ref-CR5),
cattle[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/519410a#ref-CR6),
sheep[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/519410a#ref-CR7) and
pigs[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/519410a#ref-CR8), indicate that
it is possible to delete or disable genes in an embryo --- a simpler
process than actually correcting DNA sequences --- in onlysome of the
cells. The current ability to perform quality controls on only a subset
of cells means that [[the precise effects of genetic modification to an
embryo may be impossible to know until after birth. Even then, potential
problems may not surface for years. Established
methods]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as standard prenatal genetic
diagnostics or in vitro fertilization (IVF) with the genetic profiling
of embryos before implantation[[, are much better options for parents
who both carry the same mutation for a disease.]{.underline}]{.mark}

September **2015** Genetically engineering humans: a step too far?
https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/opinion/genetically-engineering-humans-a-step-too-far

Some scientists have been quick to tout the potential of this new
technology as a possible "cure" for some forms of infertility and to
prevent various genetic diseases affecting future
individuals[\[1\]](https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/opinion/genetically-engineering-humans-a-step-too-far#fn_1).
These hypothetical techniques would entail editing the genome of human
embryos or of stem cells --- a practice currently outlawed in the UK ---
that might then be coaxed into developing into sperm and eggs. What
makes such hypothetical uses of genome editing especially controversial
is that the genetic modification would --- or at least could --- affect
the germline of the individuals who were brought into existence.
[[Should something go wrong, multiple generations would be at
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. What germline modification could do that
existing technologies cannot is produce embryos with particular genes
associated with desirable
traits[\[1\]](https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/opinion/genetically-engineering-humans-a-step-too-far#fn_1).
If scientists can find genes that are associated with
above-species-typical traits --- for example, higher intelligence,
longevity, concentration or memory --- CRISPR/Cas9 will allow them to
insert these genes into embryos. In theory, at least, the CRISPR/Cas9
system would allow parents to insert genes for as many desirable traits
as they liked into the genome of their child. [[Let us not be
deluded]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, that the renewed debate about
[[germline genetic engineering]{.underline}]{.mark}, prompted by

#### Germline editing violates autonomy and consent

Lbok)

Gene editing with CRISPR is used on two different cell types: somatic
and germline. Germline cells are reproductive cells that eventually form
embryos, sperm and oocytes. When targeting [[germline]{.mark} cells,
[effect]{.mark}]{.underline}s can be felt for [[multiple generations due
to their ability to pass on gene]{.mark}tic
[info]{.mark}rmation.]{.underline} Somatic cells refer to the rest of
the body cells, excluding reproductive cells. Changes in somatic cells
will not be passed down generationally. Using CRISPR to edit either type
has ethical implications. Off-target mutations in both germline and
somatic cells can result in negative health implications. Off-target
mutations refer to nonspecific and unintended genetic modifications that
can arise through the use of CRISPR. These could lead to very harmful
effects on organisms, potentially even resulting in cell death.
[[Germline editing]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[has a high risk factor
because it can alter the genome of future generations]{.mark}. If there
is some type of failure while editing the germline]{.underline},
undesirable mutations, side effects and other [[negative changes
can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be inherited]{.mark}. This is especially
risky because there is a lack of informed consent for
offspring]{.underline} of future generations. Ethical Implications
[[Informed consent is the process in which a health care provider
educates a patient about the]{.mark} risks, benefits and alternatives of
a given [procedure]{.mark}]{.underline} or intervention. [The
patient]{.underline}, then, [makes a voluntary decision]{.underline}
about whether to undergo the procedure or intervention. [[**CRISPR
violates informed consent***.*]{.mark} When it is used to edit the
germline, [the]{.mark} affected [unborn fetus cannot give consent
to]{.mark} take part in [the experiment]{.mark}al]{.underline} procedure
or manage any complications or undesirable mutations that might arise as
a result of the edited germline. Therefore CRISPR violates the
fundamental tenet of medicine of providing informed consent.

### gene drive

#### Gene drive destroys gene diversity risking subsequent generations.

Germline genome editing (also sometimes referred to as heritable genome
editing) refers "to all manipulations of germline cells," which include
primordial germ cells, gametes, zygotes and embryos.[[25 CRISPR
technology can affect the germline of subsequent generations via a tool
called a gene drive]{.underline}]{.mark}.26 [[A "gene drive actively
copies a mutation made by CRISPR on one chromosome to its partner
chromosome and thereby ensures that all offspring and subsequent
generations will inherit the edited genome]{.underline}]{.mark}."27
While discussion of gene drives often center around their use in insects
(such as mosquitos), [[they can potentially be used in humans as
well]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### human dignity

#### Jeopardizes fundamental human dignity

the Renewed Imperative to Preserve Human Freedom

A central argument made in this chapter is that [[the pervasive
technology developments that we have been witnessing over the past few
decades create new]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[threats to human
dignity]{.underline}]{.mark}, and therefore resorting to dignity is
inescapable to address the new challenges. The need to protect basic
human interests in this technological context may require the expansion
of existing rights, and maybe even the creation of new rights in order
to effectively preserve full respect for intrinsic human dignity. In
consonance with this view, Italian legal philosopher Norberto Bobbio
argues that the need for a new generation of human rights "arise\[s\]
from the danger posed to life, liberty and security by the growth in
technological progress." 30 As examples of such new rights, he mentions
those relating to new threats to privacy and to our genetic integrity.
He adds, It does not take much imagination to realize that development
of technology, the transformation of social and economic conditions,
widening knowledge and the intensification of the means of communication
will produce such changes in the organization of human life and social
relations as to engender favorable conditions for the creation of new
needs and therefore demands for freedoms and powers.31 However, human
rights alone are not always sufficient to respond to the emerging
challenges posed by technology. Sometimes[[, a direct recourse to the
foundational principle of human dignity seems necessary to stress the
utmost importance of the issues at stake]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
explains why the instruments relating to bioethics adopted since the
1990s place a much stronger emphasis on the notion of dignity than
traditional human rights instruments and even give a broader meaning to
this concept. Precisely in those years, and partly as a result of the
announcement of the Human Genome Project made in 1990, [[the notion of
human dignity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[started to be used beyond its
classical meaning]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e., the intrinsic value of
every human individual) [[to articulate disquiet about biotechnological
developments that may impact on future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}
and on humankind as a whole. [[Human germline engineering can be
regarded as intrinsically problematic as it jeopardizes basic features
of the human condition and the common understanding of what it means to
be human]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is therefore the dignity of future
generations that is at stake here.32

The above passage primarily addresses the possibility that the use of
germline editing for genetic enhancement would follow if germline
editing were to become an acceptable procedure. In terms of
acceptability, many distinguish between nontherapeutic genetic
enhancement, or gene editing to engineer particular human traits like
athleticism or intellect, and therapeutic gene editing, which addresses
debilitating or life threatening genetic diseases.61 Marcy Darnovsky,
head of the nonprofit Center for Genetics and Society, believes that
"\[[[u\]nlike curing disease, genetic enhancement would be morally
reprehensible.]{.underline}]{.mark}"62 [[The 1997 film Gattaca provides
a cliche, but ´ apt, illustration of the potential societal problems of
genetic enhancement and reflects society's fears about eugenics and
genetic interventions.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[In this dystopian
not-too-distant future, parents have the option to conceive children
through the genetic selection of the best traits of their parents, and
the "in-valids"---individuals who were conceived without genetic
intervention--- occupy a second-class position in
society]{.underline}]{.mark}.63 Despite laws against genetic
discrimination, the Gattacan society found ways to relegate inferior
employment and social positions to those individuals who were deemed
genetically infer ior.64 Even the unrealized potential of such
applications demonstrates the necessity of implementing proper
regulation before germline editing gets off the ground so that it cannot
be abused in these readily imaginable ways. These concerns are related
to a commonly invoked principle of the "slippery slope," in which
concessions made to allow "acceptable" applications risk permitting
unacceptable applications further down the road.65 [[There is also the
ethical dilemma about the unnaturalness of germline editing and
theologically based concerns that germline editing "amounts to playing
God]{.underline}]{.mark}."66 Although allegations of playing God are two
a penny in debates about breakthrough technologies, with gene drives
they do feel better-founded than usual. The ability to remove species by
fiat---in effect, to get them to remove themselves---is, like the
prospect of making new species from scratch, a power that goes beyond
the past ambit of humankind.67 While the idea of causing extinction or
making a species from scratch is referencing nonhuman applications of
germline editing, the underlying principle---objecting to the tampering
with species, including humankind--- remains the same, if not possibly
even more objectionable in substance. Even nonreligious persons have
moral reservations related to this theory of "playing God" that takes
the form of objection to the unnaturalness of the idea and how it
constitutes a perceived assault on human dignity. A Pew Research study
found that over twenty-five percent of nonreligious people opposed gene
editing of a baby, even where doing so would improve that baby's health,
for the exact same reasons as did people who identified as
religious---"because it would be meddling with nature and cross a line
that should not be crossed."68 Bioethicists have used the term the "yuck
factor" to describe the intuitive aversion people feel when confronted
with the idea of genetic engineering. "The Yuck Factor likely has its
origins in Kantian and Christian philosophies of human dignity that
permeate Western culture . . . \[and\] emphasize that human life has a
higher moral place than the rest of the natural world."69

Smith argues the [[health benefits being pursued can be achieved without
permanently altering the germlines,]{.underline}]{.mark} and he warns of
a brave new world of eugenics pursued using CRISPR technology and
germline editing. As he explains, it's not just that germline editing
could lead to unintended health consequences, or that such changes could
work their way into the human population in the long term. It's also
that [[the eugenics mindset driving much of this experimental work
threatens to undermine the foundational belief that all humans possess
inherent dignity and worth, not just those humans who are genetically
edited and enhanced.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Eugenics/discrimination

#### Its eugenics -- deliberately discriminatory and fundamentally unethical.

enhancement, and ... eugenics?\", Nature,

[In the blazingly rapid period of only a few decades, these tools have
already progressed from curiosities of somatic cell genetics in the
laboratory to early-stage clinical application in individual human
patients. [Genome editing studies have reached this clinical stage for
applications toward preventing]{.mark} and correcting genetic and even
infectious [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}, including HIV AIDS
\[[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0088-1#ref-CR1)\],
forms of leukemia
\[[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0088-1#ref-CR2)\],
mucopolysaccharidoses I
(<https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02702115>) and II
(<https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03041324>), sickle cell disease
\[[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0088-1#ref-CR3)\], and
others. Such genetic manipulation has been extended to genome editing
studies in the human embryo identified to be at risk for a potentially
dangerous or lethal disease. Proof of that concept has been provided for
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing correction in a preimplantation human embryo
of a mutation responsible for the potentially lethal disease
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
\[[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0088-1#ref-CR4)\]. With
unsettling speed[, [the door]{.underline}]{.mark} [has now clearly been
cracked even further [open for human embryonic genetic
modification]{.mark}]{.underline} by a recent announcement from China of
purported HIV prevention in a subsequent generation by genome editing
knockout of the CCR5 HIV co-receptor followed by birth of potentially
HIV-resistant human infants
\[[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0088-1#ref-CR5)\]. As
reported, the manipulation was widely regarded to be scientifically
premature, technically flawed, and ethically indefensible, but the
embryo genetic modification genie is probably already out of the bottle.
The technical and ethical hazards of such applications have been
discussed and will continue to be of major concern, even in the case of
disease prevention and treatment. From therapy to genetic enhancement
When aimed at aberrant functions causing disease, genetic manipulations
such as "traditional" gene therapy and, more recently, genome editing,
constitute legitimate therapy and are medically and ethically
justifiable. But [the [potential applications for]{.mark} genetic
[modification do not stop with prevention and treatment of]{.mark} human
[disease]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Gene-based therapies are one
thing, but [the [intentional modification of the human genome to
"improve" individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e., genetic enhancement[,
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite another and [[beset
with]{.underline}]{.mark} different sets of [[ethical]{.mark} and policy
[dilemmas]{.mark}]{.underline}. The rapidly developing tools of gene
therapy and genome editing are potentially just as pertinent to
understanding the mechanisms underlying human development and behavior,
cognitive, and intellectual traits as to the formation and function of
the human personality. It would probably require no great technical
innovation to leap from disease prevention and therapy to attempts to
modify and "enhance" human physical and intellectual traits. The
temptation to do so is and will continue to be great. [The [tools of
biotech]{.mark}nology, neuroscience, [and genetics will]{.mark}
increasingly [identify many of the mechanisms underlying]{.mark} the
development and regulation of [human traits,]{.mark} not only of
physical properties but also of cognitive, intellectual, and social
traits, [and make them tempting targets for genetic
manipulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. What will be the consequences of
modifying and genetically manipulating human functions intended to
improve on the "natural"? When will merely "natural" not be good enough?
From genetic enhancement to eugenics? [[Deliberate application of the
concept and tools of genetic enhancement of individual human beings and
of the human species flows directly into the highly troubling potential
for spill-over into programs for design and preferential reproduction of
"more desirable" and "better" kinds of human beings -- i.e.,
**eugenics**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Are we prepared to pursue, accept,
and regulate applications of genetic enhancement toward eugenic goals?
[Humanity has a very fraught relationship with the unsettling concept
and the misguided practice of eugenics]{.underline}. The late nineteenth
century and the beginning of the twentieth century witnessed the
emergence and the flourishing of the concept of eugenics---the attempt
to direct human heredity and evolution to ensure procreative advantage
to more "desirable" human beings and to discourage or limit reproduction
by the less desirables. Such programs relied on efforts to identify and
provide advantage to the "favored" and to define methods to disadvantage
the "unfavored". Inspired by concepts born at the Genetics Record Office
at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, criteria of social undesirability and
social ills came to include the undesirable and purportedly genetic
traits of poverty, criminality, mental disorders, laziness and
homosexuality, and thalassophilia (love of the sea) among others
\[[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0088-1#ref-CR6)\].
There was obviously little or no truly rigorous scientific evidence of a
genetic basis for these presumed genetic components. There were,
instead, prejudiced and fact-free presumptions of the causes of social
human ills based on imaginary pseudoscience meant to justify restricted
immigration of "undesirable" populations to the US mainly from central
Europe and Asia. Out of those misguided eugenic concepts emerged racist
immigration policies and the disastrous US Supreme Court decision in
Buck v. Bell that upheld the legality and ethical justification for
implementing involuntary sterilization programs in the United States and
other countries that were designed to prevent the birth of human beings
identified, no matter how incorrectly, to be deficient and inferior
\[[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0088-1#ref-CR6)\]. This
movement, particularly the one in the United States, was a major
incubator of even harsher social programs and, in their extreme forms,
to the genocidal programs of Nazi Germany. The eugenic landscape in the
context of modern science However, [[the poor scientific bases
for]{.mark} these [early attempts at eugenics have given way to the
proven]{.mark} scientific and manipulative [strengths of modern human
genetics that make genetic manipulation for the purposes of
t]{.mark}herapy, enhancement, and even possibly [eugenic goals
increasingly technically feasible]{.mark}]{.underline}. With time and
with scientific advances made over the ensuing many decades, the
inadequacy and the folly of such ethically and scientifically
indefensible eugenic thinking of the early twentieth century became
clear and rightly broadly rejected. Our understanding at that time of
the possible long-term multi-generational and population effects of
selective manipulations of mechanisms underlying human reproduction and
evolution was seriously deficient. Even now, the possible deleterious
long-term adverse genetic effects of non-therapeutic genetic enhancement
and even "precision" targeted genome editing are not predictable or
targeted exquisitely enough to justify their application in
non-therapeutic experimental settings. [We are justified, and possibly
even compelled, by all current codes of ethical principles governing
medical practice and biomedical research to use many of these new tools
in the name of healing. But [if we apply them for whimsical or even
well-intentioned genetic enhancement purposes, we should be aware of our
inadequate understanding of their potential for long-term and
irretrievable harm, and of the likelihood that they can lead us down the
path toward unwise eugenic goals]{.mark}]{.underline}. We should heed
the warning attributed by some to the great American baseball player and
folk philosopher Yogi Berra---"If you don't know where you're going,
you'll probably end up someplace else". At the moment, we do not know
where this path of human genetic enhancement and its potential extension
to eugenic goals leads. If we wander in that direction, we may wind up
in unexpected and societally detrimental and even disastrous places. We
should be sure to tread down that road only if and when scientific,
ethical, and public policy justifications are more evident than they are
now.

#### Its discriminatory eugenics

WESLEY W. **CHEN** June 30 **2019** HUMAN GERMLINE GENE EDITING:
ENGINEERING AN UNSTOPPABLE TRAIN
https://mylaw2.usc.edu/why/students/orgs/ilj/assets/docs/28-2-Chen.pdf

[[Eugenics is the idea of systematically applying genetic selection in
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}.107 [[Negative eugenics teaches "breeding
out" negative or unwanted characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. the
Huntington's Disease mutation); positive eugenics promotes desirable
genetic traits (e.g. inheritable resistance to Malaria).108 [[While
proponents for eugenics might argue that it would only be used as a
positive tool for fixing some of society's greatest
problems]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. inheritable disorders), [[critics of
eugenics would argue that the application of eugenics is not governed by
such a bright-line rule]{.underline}]{.mark}. The controversy
surrounding eugenics involves the ambiguity regarding what defines a
negative or positive characteristic. There are some clear candidates for
negative eugenics, such as a Tay-Sachs Disease---a fatal heritable
disorder that results in severe mental retardation and death by the age
of eight-years-old.109 But what about the genetic profile for Down
Syndrome patients? Individuals with Down Syndrome experience mental
retardation, but can live functional adult lives. Or what about the gene
for lactose intolerance? When deciding what sort of genetic conditions
deserve eugenic treatment, one must face the difficult, if not
impossible task of making value judgments on each disorder.110 Depending
on the subjective view for each person, what may be considered an
unacceptable characteristic to one individual may be acceptable to
another. Therefore[[, genetic conditions are less likely to fall neatly
into rigid categories]{.underline}]{.mark} and more likely to rest in a
spectrum ranging from clearly unacceptable disorders to controversial
attributes. As one moves along the spectrum away from unanimously
dreadful diseases, the room for disagreement increases.
[[When]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[ambiguity exists, there is a greater
risk that eugenics may be discriminatory.]{.underline}]{.mark} On one
hand, eugenic champions might argue that it is unethical to deprive a
mother an opportunity to use gene-editing technology to ensure a healthy
child, and that society has a duty to produce healthier offspring.111
Negative eugenics could be limited to only clear and obvious cases
(e.g., eliminating fatal genetic diseases); positive eugenics could
enhance the human race through safe gene editing practices (e.g.
increasing resistance to diseases). On the other hand, critics might
argue that [[eugenics sits on a slippery slope and if we allow the
possibility of "breeding out" negative characteristics, we will
eventually find ourselves back in the 1940s]{.underline}]{.mark}
alongside the atrocities of the Holocaust. Critics could also point out
that even if society does not descend to such depths, [[the very concept
of eugenics is discriminatory because it suggests that some lives are
not worth livin]{.underline}]{.mark}g.112 If certain racial profiles
become associated with diseases, eugenics risks stigmatizing such
races.113 Furthermore, [[across and within different societies the
economic availability of eugenic technology may greatly exacerbate
inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, if the genes for high
intelligence are identified and eugenic technology was only available at
a high cost, already wealthy families would have a better opportunity to
produce genetic "advantages" for their progeny. [[The ramifications of
accelerating social, economic, and political stratification would be
difficult to reverse]{.underline}]{.mark}.114 For such reasons[[, the
risk of abuse has been deemed intolerable and
eugenics]{.underline}]{.mark} has been mostly
[[rejected]{.underline}]{.mark} in the past several decades.115 On the
other hand, one can argue that there is a significant difference between
preventing the birth of persons with certain genetic conditions and
killing of persons bearing a specific trait. Especially considering the
benefits that would come with eliminating unambiguously harmful genetic
traits (e.g. Tay-Sachs disease116), the benefits of eugenics may
outweigh the risks. Even if one was to accept that eugenics bears a
substantial risk of propagating social inequality, is the risk enough to
deny the benefits of eugenics to society? [[Benefits may come at a
price]{.underline}]{.mark}. Regardless of where one stands on the
eugenics debate, recent technological advances in gene editing have
pumped new life into the eugenics debate. Whereas the historic versions
of eugenics revolved around controlling reproductive partners---either
by bringing persons together, keeping them apart, sterilization, or
gamete selection (as with artificial insemination by donor)117---[[gene
editing refines reproductive strategies by manipulating the very genetic
material in any one individual]{.underline}]{.mark}.118

Many scientists contend that the driving question CRISPR poses is
whether it fulfills an unmet medical need and can be made clinically
safe. Garland-Thomson, along with many of our other contributors,
cautions that we must look further to "what the existence of CRISPR
technology suggests about the limits of being human." Garland-Thomson
worries that [[GGE approaches a "new eugenics." Using germline
editing]{.underline}]{.mark} to enhance or improve future persons, she
says, [[may lead to "morally unacceptable consequences, ranging from
producing medical harm to abrogating consent, intensifying genetic
discrimination, increasing social inequality]{.underline}]{.mark},
promoting [conditional parental acceptance[, turning people into
products]{.underline}]{.mark}, fostering a commercial medical industrial
complex, and encouraging rogue scientific and medical practice."

### Ableism

#### The ideology behind gene editing is ableist\-\--people that are disabled reject the practice

We agree that [science should guide policy---except in cases where it
wouldn't assist people to live their lives but would, instead, exclude
them]{.underline}. [The CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing
technology]{.underline}, for which biochemists Jennifer Doudna and
Emmanuelle Charpentier won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, [has the
potential to do just that]{.underline}. So do other forms of scientific
technologies. We should therefore always be aware of the ethical choices
these technologies can pose. In the case of CRISPR, those choices are
complex. [[CRISPR has many functions]{.underline}]{.mark}; one of these
is that it can be used to treat disease. [Yet [the far-reaching]{.mark},
more fraught [promise of this technology]{.mark}---one about which
scientists seem at once excited and cautious---[lies in its ability to
eliminate]{.mark} from the gene pool [what medical science identifies as
faulty or abnormal genes that cause difference]{.mark} in individual
people]{.underline}. Certainly, goes the logic of CRISPR's promise, the
goal of ridding future generations of terrible diseases that cause
suffering and death and deplete resources, seems an unquestionable
enterprise. But Doudna herself has recognized that CRISPR carries with
it "great risk." In a New York Times interview on October 22, 2020, she
warned of the [unknown consequences of embryo
editing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-jennifer-doudna.html),
cautioning researchers to wait to use CRISPR for these ends. [[As
disability studies scholars and women with genetic differences who are
experts in thinking about the consequences this technology will have for
actual human beings, we have grave worries that the use of these
"**genetic scissors**" will, in the future, cut people like us out of
existence without others even noticing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scientists
who use CRISPR could see editing genes such as ours out of the gene pool
as entirely uncontroversial. This attitude, in fact, would be consistent
with wider societal views. [The idea that ridding society of genetic
differences that count as disease or defect is an undeniable "good"
continues to be pervasive in our society.]{.underline} Americans
generally see no problem with editing genes linked to broad swaths of
people like us; after all, supporters of this view may argue, editing
out a gene-linked condition is different from editing out a person, and
curing disease is an indisputably good thing. [But **[our genetic
conditions are not simply entities that can be clipped away from
us]{.mark}**]{.underline} as if they were some kind of a misspelled word
or an awkward sentence in a document. [We are whole beings, with our
genetic conditions forming a fundamental part of who we are. Still,
many]{.underline} Americans---including medical providers and even some
people with genetic differences---[consider lives such as ours as [not
worth living as they are](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00117).
Further, [the common belief that ridding]{.mark} disease and
[anomaly]{.mark} from society [is]{.mark} an incontrovertible [good can
lead]{.mark} very quickly from the actual possibilities of science [to
fantasies of "improving" humanity where we would all become some
aspirational version of personhood that is somehow better, stronger,
smarter, and healthier. But CRISPR's]{.mark} tantalizing [offer to
achieve the supposedly "best" kind of people at the genetic level is an
uneasy alert to those who are often judged to be biologically
inferior]{.mark}---one we know all too well. People like us whose being
is inseparable from our genetic condition would be the first to
go.]{.underline} We both have genetic conditions that many people
consider serious enough to eliminate from the human gene pool: one of us
lives with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the other a form of syndactyly.
Both of these conditions have shaped our bodies and our lives. Sandy's
affected lungs require several hours of treatments each day, and
Rosemarie's affected hands limit her manual dexterity. We are among the
[one billion people in the
world](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/factsheet-on-persons-with-disabilities.html)
(15 percent of the population) and [61 million people in the United
States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html)
(26 percent of all adults) who are considered disabled. We are among the
10 percent of all adults who have a genetic condition. Because we were
born with our conditions, we have benefited from learning early on how
to live with the characteristics of our particular genetic
distinctiveness. Our supportive families saw to it that we accessed good
health care and received educations suitable to our talents and
interests. Improved medical treatments, social progress, and political
equality movements raised our quality of life in ways that people like
us in generations prior to ours could not have imagined. When Sandy was
born in 1967, people with CF had an average [life expectancy of
15](https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200505-840OE), but during 1970--1990,
life expectancy doubled due to new medical therapies. Today's average
life expectancy is 44, but with novel medicines called cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, people with [CF
are expected to live even longer with fewer
hospitalizations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2020.05.002). These
transformations in life expectancy attest to the changing nature of
prognosis, one for which CRISPR's editing [cannot
account](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202004-0999LE).
When Rosemarie was born, in the late 1940s, people with physical
disabilities like hers were often [institutionalized and led limited
lives](https://futureofchildren.princeton.edu/sites/futureofchildren/files/media/children_with_disabilities_22_01_fulljournal.pdf)
far from the support of their families. At that time, only one in five
children with disabilities were educated in public schools with
nondisabled children. Physically disabled children were most often sent
to segregated schools where they received inferior education. With the
Education for All Act of 1975 (now the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act
([IDEA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/leg/idea/history.html)),
however, the federal government guaranteed public education and services
for all children with disabilities, thus changing their life
trajectories. We learned to thrive with the bodies we have and possess
identities and lives that include our genetic diagnostic categories but
also go beyond them. Yet stubborn beliefs about "good" genes and "bad"
genes nonetheless persist in discriminatory attitudes that affect us
both. When Rosemarie was pregnant with her first child, the obstetrician
assumed that her major concern was that the baby would have hands and
arms like its mother, even though Rosemarie's biggest concern was
finding a good childcare situation that would complement her job
responsibilities. When Sandy considered having a biological child,
friends and medical providers questioned her decision to consider
pregnancy because that meant passing on one copy of her cystic fibrosis
gene to a future child. This imagined child would not have had the
disease since her husband is not a carrier for CF (CF is an autosomal
recessive disease). But some of those in Sandy's circle still believed
pregnancy inadvisable because, to them, producing a child who would
carry the CF gene was equally undesirable. Sandy called out their
assumption: that her condition was inherently inferior---a point they
took as self-evident despite the fact that an estimated [24 percent of
people worldwide are carriers for genetic
conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22975760/). These stories
also reveal an enduring ideology about the inextricable, cultural link
among disability, reproduction, and suffering[. **[They illustrate the
subtle, yet insidious, idea that some genes are inherently bad and
contaminate the human gene pool]{.mark}**;]{.underline} as such, people
who carry them should not propagate and pass those genes on to their
progeny so as to make those children either carriers or affected. [These
ideas also expose an even deeper, ableist assumption: that people with
supposedly "bad genes" fundamentally suffer and hold a less valuable
place in society than others]{.underline}. [This isn't to say that
people with genetic conditions don't suffer, but we don't necessarily
suffer all the time and we don't necessarily suffer any more than other
people without such conditions. Yet the cultural impulse to assume that
people with genetic variations are in a constant state of suffering, and
that it blights our lives, is so pervasive that it is even internalized
by some with genetic conditions themselves. [Such genetic determinism is
a new form of eugenic thinking grounded in]{.mark} what the
communications studies scholar [[James L. Cherney calls "common sense"
ableism](https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/1665/1606), a belief system
that allows people to simultaneously deny any commitment to distasteful
eugenic principles while also holding them up. Common sense
ableism]{.mark} permits, even [encourages,]{.mark} such injurious
attitudes. [Utilizing genome manipulation tools and performing genetic
selection]{.mark} is [tantamount to engaging in]{.mark}]{.underline}
what Rosemarie calls ["[velvet eugenics." **Enforced by laissez-faire
commercialism, rather than by the state, velvet eugenics seems like
common sense, yet it hides its violence and inequality behind claims of
patient autonomy and under a veil of voluntary consent**]{.mark}.
Ultimately, market-driven velvet eugenics embodies a similar goal of
purging unacceptable human variations that campaigns to eliminate the
supposedly unfit and inferior have held in the past. Both [enact a
mandate to [exclude people with disabilities from coming into the
world](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/the-last-children-of-down-syndrome/616928/).
People like us shouldn't be edited out of existence in some version of a
utopian future]{.mark}]{.underline}. This vision of a future without
people like us limits our ability to live in the present. Evaluating the
quality of life of another person is a complex, highly subjective, and
context-dependent task that is morally questionable in a society based
on the concept that all people are of equal value regardless of their
individual differences. The limitations of human imagination make it
questionable, if not unethical, for a person to grasp another person's
(or group of people's) quality of life fully. Expanding diversity in all
its forms, including disability, strengthens the human community
ethically and biologically because it opens the public and private
sphere to a variety of perspectives, life experiences, ideas, and
solutions to live together with mutual flourishing. More important, our
shared founding belief in the equal value of all members of a society
should remind us that people's worth should not be determined by social
judgments about their contribution. All members of a community
contribute to its welfare by existing in their individual
distinctiveness. [[Genome editing]{.mark} is a powerful, scientific

that bad genes don't necessarily lead to bad lives, just as good genes
don't necessarily lead to good lives. [[If CRISPR is put to use to
eliminate rather than to treat genetic difference, we as a society would
essentially instrumentalize this **moralistic and reductionist

#### Genetic engineering undermines social acceptance solidarity toward disability

GENEVA (28 February 2020) -- \"Current developments in medical research
and practice may revive eugenic ideas if safeguards for those affected
are not ensured,\" today said the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of
persons with disabilities, Catalina Devandas, during the presentation of
her [latest
report](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/43/41) to
the UN Human Rights Council. The UN expert explained [that [developments
in gene therapy, genetic engineering]{.mark}]{.underline} and prenatal
screening [experienced enormous growth, increasing our power to repair
the body and prevent disease, but [cautioned about \"eliminating\" human
characteristics deemed undesirable. \"People with disabilities are
genuinely concerned that these developments could result in new eugenic
practices and **further undermine social acceptance and solidarity
towards disability** - and more broadly, towards human
diversity]{.mark},\" she said.]{.underline} In her report, Devandas also
expressed her concerns on the impact of euthanasia and assisted suicide
for persons with disabilities. \"If assisted dying is made available for
persons with health conditions or impairments, but who are not
terminally ill, a social assumption could be made that it is better to
be dead than to live with a disability,\" the expert warned. \"People
have the right to live and to die with dignity, but we cannot accept
that people choose to end their lives because of social stigma,
isolation or lack of access to personal assistance or disability-related
services.\" [[Another major concern, Devandas stressed, is the absence
of persons with disabilities in crucial debates on medical research and
practice. \"Without their experiences directly informing those debates,
narratives suggesting that living with disabilities should be prevented
become reinforced and socially validated]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} The
Special Rapporteur explained that \"ableism\" is at the root of the
problem. \"If the life experiences of people with disabilities continue
to be undervalued, no progress will be made.\" [\"[What we need is a
**profound cultural transformation** on the way society relates to the
difference. That is a commitment to embrace disability as a positive
aspect of human diversity. States must combat all forms of
discrimination based on disability,\" the human rights expert
concluded]{.mark}.]{.underline} Devandas also reported back to the Human
Rights Council on her visits to
[Kuwait](https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/43/41/Add.1),

#### Human germline gene editing stigmatizes imperfection and drives toward eugenics

The surprise announcement in November 2018 that a Chinese researcher had
implanted and brought to term two gene-edited embryos, resulting in the
birth of twin girls, had the effect of galvanizing a debate that goes
back decades (Begley 2018; Evans 2002; Kevles 1985). Should we make
heritable changes in our children's DNA? Until recently, this was
hypothetical only, and the easy response was to say it is too uncertain
and too unnecessary to be tolerated. Suddenly, however[, the possibility
that there might be real uses for mitochondrial DNA replacement or for
germline editing has led to a more nuanced debate]{.underline}, ranging
from calls to double-down on prohibiting this technology to discussions
of how to permit it for a limited range of conditions, under strict
oversight (Baltimore et al. 2015; NAS 2017; UNESCO 2015). [Often lacking
in this debate has been an effort to look back at debates surrounding
[earlier advances]{.mark} in reproductive technologies, [most of which
have been accompanied by fears of eugenics]{.mark}, the loss of human
dignity, and the disruption of parent-child relationships]{.underline}.
While these advances have each had pockets of abusive uses, they have
been integrated into modern life without bringing about wholesale
destruction of society. A true prohibition of germline editing already
exists in a number of countries, by virtue of their signatures to an
international instrument. A number of international efforts focus on
human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms, and the European Social Charter. But it is the
1997 Council of Europe's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Dignity of the Human Being with Regard to the Application of Biology
and Medicine, better known as the Oviedo Convention, that was written
specifically to address the intersection of human rights and biomedical
developments, and aimed to protect the "dignity and identity of all
human beings" (Council of Europe 1997). Article 13 reads: "An
intervention seeking to modify the human genome may only be undertaken
for preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic purposes and only if its aim
is not to introduce any modification in the genome of any descendants"
(emphasis added). In other words, even if done with the best of
intentions, to ward off devastating---even lethal---conditions, the
Convention admits of no alterations that are meant to affect
descendants, though this position has not been without its critics
(Council of Europe 2017; Cyngell, Douglas, and Savulescu 2017; De Wert
et al. 2018; Hasson 2018). Debates around germline editing focus on
multiple concerns. With regard to physical harm to individuals living in
the future, this involves a risk-benefit analysis that is complicated by
the multigenerational potential of the change (Baylis 2018; Rubeis and
Steger 2018). This alone introduces questions about the stability and
durability of the alteration, its effect under future (presumably
different) environments, and the ever-increasing number of generations
between the person affected and the person initially giving consent. A
different objection goes directly to how we understand autonomy. As
noted in the July 2018 report by the UK Nuffield Council, one might
argue that "[[choosing someone else's genetic endowment . . . offends
against the essential dignity and nature of the person as a free and
independent human being]{.mark}." In essence, this argument is that
germline editing interferes with a child's "right to an open
future]{.underline}" (Feinberg 1980, 1992). [But one response has been
not only that parents make many momentous decisions affecting their
children's lives, but that the acceptability of parental choices rests
on whether they serve to expand or narrow a child's prospects, and
whether the changes were made for the welfare of the future child, such
as preventing serious disease and disability]{.underline} (NAS 2017;
Nuffield Council 2018). Of course, [[it should be noted that many in the
deaf community and the community of little people would not define those
conditions as disabilities]{.mark}, but rather as varieties of the human
community. But this is the exception, and other groups with shared
disabilities have not refused the designation, although they often argue
the degree of impairment is as much a function of social and physical
context as it is anything intrinsic to the body. [Other concerns about
germline editing revolve around fear that it will lead to intolerance of
imperfection, turning children into commodities]{.mark}]{.underline}
rather than the subjects of parental love, [[and that it will result in
stigmatization of those who are disabled]{.underline} (Thiessen
2018).]{.mark}

#### Germline gene editing is discriminatory & ableist

6-27-2022, //ms

[On the 20th anniversary of the]{.underline} 1997 European Convention on
Human Rights and Biomedicine ([Oviedo Convention]{.underline}), the
Council of Europe Committee on Bioethics organised an international
conference entitled \'Relevance and Challenges\' last month in
Strasbourg, France. At this meeting, [[delegates discussed the reasons
behind Article 13]{.underline}]{.mark} of this convention, [[which
prohibits intentional [germline](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2520)
procedures]{.underline}]{.mark}. Article 13 indicates that: \'An
intervention seeking to modify the human genome may only be undertaken
for preventive, [diagnostic](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2488) or
therapeutic purposes and only if its aim is not to introduce any
[modification](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2388) in the
[genome](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2320) of any descendants.\'(1)
This means, according to paragraph 91 of the Explanatory Report to this
convention, that: \'Interventions seeking to introduce any modification
in the genome of any descendants are prohibited. Consequently, in
particular genetic modifications of
[spermatozoa](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2337) or
[ova](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2309) for
[fertilisation](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2313) are not
allowed.\'(2) [During the event, [there was repeated questioning of how
the fundamental equality in worth of all human beings could be protected
if Article 13 was deleted]{.mark} or amended. However, [no clear answer
was given. This was unfortunate because the selection of future human
beings, based on their possible quality of life, **is at the very core
of germline procedures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, when a
one-cell [embryo](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2310), or sperm and
[egg](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2309) cells before they are used
in conception, are edited, a new individual who would not otherwise have
existed is being brought into being. Indeed, any change, no matter how
small, to the variables in the creation of an individual results in a
very different person coming into existence.(3) [In other words, with
[most germline procedures one is not treating someone who exists, but
**making sure only certain persons**,]{.mark} and not others, **[are
brought into existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is the important
non-identity dilemma which has not really been addressed, to any extent,
by any of the wide-ranging reports studying the ethical consequences of
[genome editing](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2517), such as the one
prepared in 2017 by the US National Academies of Sciences and
Medicine.(4) However, [[this dilemma needs to be addressed since]{.mark}
making sure that only certain kinds of children are brought into
existence, based on their possible quality of life, [may]{.mark} also
[suggest that there is such a thing as a \'life unworthy of life\' in
society]{.mark}.]{.underline} Of course, it is possible to argue, as
does the 2017 US Academies\' report, that \'unconditional love for a
disabled child once born and respect for all people who are born with or
who develop disabilities are not incompatible with intervening to avert
disease and disability prior to birth or conception\'.(4) But that
report does not explain how or why any deliberate selective
discrimination can be seen as acceptable before birth or conception
while suddenly becoming unacceptable when a person is present.(5) [As
the Dutch ethicist Hans Reinders at the Free University of Amsterdam
argues: **[\'In any given case, the only reasonable answer to the
question of why a disabled child should not be born is by reference to
what one thinks about the lives of people living with the same
disorder]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\'(6) This means that if parents decide
not to have a child with a serious [genetic
disorder](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2318) based solely on
[genetic](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_2316) reasons and not other
factors, such as a lack of societal support for disability in a country,
there is a very real sense that they are doing so because they would
prefer one possible future child over another. In other words, this
decision contradicts the important principle that the lives of all human
beings have the same worth and value, regardless of their state of
health.(7) [It is]{.underline} also [inevitable that the indirect
message being given with such a view is that had one known, with
hindsight, that someone was going to be affected by a certain kind of
disability then one would have selected to create another individual.
[This]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[can clearly be considered
discriminatory and would **undermine the inherent equality in value** of
all persons in society.]{.mark}]{.underline} To be sure, a lot has
already been written about this objection, called the \'expressivist
argument\'.(8) What is more, [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} some people,
including [[a number of individuals affected by disability, this
message]{.underline}]{.mark} may not be problematic. But for others, it
[[may be seen as extremely offensive and
discriminatory]{.underline}]{.mark}.(9) **[[It is, moreover, no answer
to simply state that these people are misguided or mistaken in being
offended by such a message]{.mark}.]{.underline}** More fundamentally,
it is only possible to select between persons, including possible future
persons, on purely genetic reasons if all ethical reasoning is reduced
to consequentialist perspectives. But the Council of Europe does not do
this. Instead, it recognises the equality of value and worth of every
human life, regardless of whether it is short and difficult or long and
pleasurable. This is one of the founding principles of the Council of
Europe. Accordingly, if all persons, including all possible future
persons, are considered to be fundamentally equal in value and worth,
how can a choice between any of them ever be made? This also means that
Article 13 cannot be amended or only a moratorium on germline procedures
accepted, without undermining the radical equality between all human
beings, which is the very basis of civilised society. [The Council of
Europe must, therefore, continue to uphold the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights]{.underline} proclaimed by the General Assembly of the
United Nations in 1948, which recognises in its preamble [that \'the
inherent dignity and\...equal and inalienable rights of all members of
the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the
world\'.]{.underline}

[**reproductive justice advocates are uniquely positioned** to change

### Precautionary principle

#### Caring for the future of human kind is an overwhelming duty in a technological civilization.

The notion that [[we have duties towards future
generations]{.underline}]{.mark} has been supported by several scholars,
following very different approaches.36 However, few authors have
explored this notion in such depth and more engagingly than Hans Jonas.
In his influential Imperative of Responsibility, he [[proposed a new
"categorical imperative" for our technological
civilization]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[runs, "Act so that the effects
of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life:
or expressed negatively]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[Act so that the effects
of your action are nor destructive of the future possibility of such
life]{.underline}]{.mark}." 37 In other words, "[[caring for the future
of humankind is the overruling duty of collective human action in the
age of a technological civilization]{.underline}]{.mark} that has become
'almighty,' if not in its productive then at least in its destructive
potential." 38 This is why, according to Jonas, [[the present generation
has a "metaphysical responsibility" of preserving nature and the human
species.]{.underline}]{.mark}39

#### Precautionary principle is the best organizational method for decisionmaking

Precautionary Principle Puts Values First", Bulletin of Science,
Technology & Society, Vol. 22, No. 3, June 2002, 210-219,
http://www.sehn.org/pdf/putvaluesfirst.pdf

Activists' and advocates' responses to the principle and their
explanations of why it has become important and useful to them vary.
Almost universally, however, they see it as an exercise in something
beyond caution, or even precaution. It is not just a matter of buying up
gas masks, so to speak, or reinforcing cockpit doors. They nearly always
describe it instead in positive terms. Activists who have become
discouraged by the Sisyphean task of trying to protect the Earth and the
health of communities in the face of out-of-control technologies and
damage often say that [[the precautionary]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[principle gives]{.underline}]{.mark} them [[hope]{.underline}]{.mark}.
They say [[it is something positive to work for and that it embodies
common sense]{.underline}]{.mark}. Organizers and policy advocates alike
express gratitude for a unifying idea that makes sense of everything
they are trying to work for and that removes some important barriers to
that work, at least in their own minds. Inevitably, values creep into
these discussions. A typical range of responses came from a group of
ecosystem scientists and advocates assembled by SEHN in May 2001 in
Leavenworth, Washington, to discuss how the principle might apply to
decisions related to ecosystems. After more than a day of discussion
that went straight to the principle's practical implications, the group
was asked, Is the precautionary principle indeed of use to you? Some of
their answers had an equally practical tone: [[By using precaution you
articulate uncertainties that are already there. It is better to think
out consequences. It is important science, but it is also an important
public education tool]{.underline}]{.mark}. It helps people understand
what to do with uncertainty. [[It is an organizing principle in
theory---it takes our ideas and make sense of them---and in practice: it
can galvanize a movement.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[A growing and compelling body of research suggests that nuclear
weapons]{.underline} may not, in fact, make the world more dangerous, as
Obama and most people assume. The bomb [may actually make us
safer]{.underline}. In this era of rogue states and transnational
terrorists, that idea sounds so obviously wrongheaded that few
politicians or policymakers are willing to entertain it. But that\'s a
mistake. Knowing the truth about nukes would have a profound impact on
government policy. Obama\'s idealistic campaign, so out of character for
a pragmatic administration, may be unlikely to get far (past presidents
have tried and failed). But it\'s not even clear he should make the
effort. There are more important measures the U.S. government can and
should take to make the real world safer, and these mustn\'t be ignored
in the name of a dreamy ideal (a nuke-free planet) that\'s both
unrealistic and possibly undesirable. The argument that nuclear weapons
can be agents of peace as well as destruction rests on two deceptively
simple observations. First, [nuclear weapons **have not been used since
1945**]{.underline}. Second, [there\'s **never** been a]{.underline}
nuclear, or even a nonnuclear, [war between two states that possess
them]{.underline}. Just stop for a second and think about that: it\'s
hard to overstate how remarkable it is, especially given the singular
viciousness of the 20th century. As Kenneth Waltz, the leading \"nuclear
optimist\" and a professor emeritus of political science at UC Berkeley
puts it, \"We now have 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It\'s
striking and against all historical precedent that for that substantial
period, there has not been any war among nuclear states.\" To understand
why---and why the next 64 years are likely to play out the same
way---you need to start by recognizing that [all states are **rational**
on some basic level]{.underline}. Their leaders may be stupid, petty,
venal, even evil, but they tend to do things only when they\'re pretty
sure they can get away with them. Take war: a country will start a fight
only when it\'s almost certain it can get what it wants at an acceptable
price. [Not even Hitler or Saddam waged wars they didn\'t think they
could win. The problem historically has been that leaders]{.underline}
often [make the wrong gamble and underestimate the other
side]{.underline}---and millions of innocents pay the price. [Nuclear
weapons change all that by making the costs of war obvious, inevitable,
and unacceptable]{.underline}. Suddenly, [when both sides have the
ability to turn the other to ashes with the push of a button---and
everybody knows it---the basic math shifts. Even the craziest tin-pot
dictator is **forced to accept that war with a nuclear state is
unwinnable** and thus **not worth the effort**]{.underline}. As Waltz
puts it, \"Why fight if you can\'t win and might lose everything?\" Why
indeed? [The iron logic of **deterrence and m**utually **a**ssured
**d**estruction is so compelling, it\'s led to]{.underline} what\'s
known as [the **nuclear peace**: the virtually unprecedented stretch
since the end of World War II in which all the world\'s major powers
have avoided coming to blows]{.underline}. They did fight proxy wars,
ranging from Korea to Vietnam to Angola to Latin America. But these
never matched the furious destruction of full-on, great-power war (World
War II alone was responsible for some 50 million to 70 million deaths).
And since the end of the Cold War, such bloodshed has declined
precipitously. Meanwhile, the [nuclear powers have scrupulously avoided
direct combat, and there\'s very good reason to think they always will.
There have been some near misses, but a close look at these cases is
fundamentally reassuring---because in each instance, very different
leaders all came to the same safe conclusion]{.underline}. Take the
mother of all nuclear standoffs: the Cuban missile crisis. For 13 days
in October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union each threatened
the other with destruction. But both countries soon stepped back from
the brink when they recognized that a war would have meant curtains for
everyone. As important as the fact that they did is the reason why:
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev\'s aide Fyodor Burlatsky said later on,
\"It is impossible to win a nuclear war, and both sides realized that,
maybe for the first time.\" The record since then shows the same pattern
repeating: [nuclear-armed enemies slide toward war, then pull back,
always for the same reasons]{.underline}. The best recent example is
India and Pakistan, which fought three bloody wars after independence
before acquiring their own nukes in 1998. Getting their hands on weapons
of mass destruction didn\'t do anything to lessen their animosity. But
it did dramatically mellow their behavior. Since acquiring atomic
weapons, the two sides have never fought another war, despite severe
provocations (like Pakistani-based terrorist attacks on India in 2001
and 2008). They have skirmished once. But during that flare-up, in
Kashmir in 1999, both countries were careful to keep the fighting
limited and to avoid threatening the other\'s vital interests. Sumit
Ganguly, an Indiana University professor and coauthor of the forthcoming
India, Pakistan, and the Bomb, has found that on both sides, officials\'
thinking was strikingly similar to that of the Russians and Americans in
1962. The prospect of war brought Delhi and Islamabad face to face with
a nuclear holocaust, and leaders in each country did what they had to do
to avoid it. Nuclear pessimists---and there are many---insist that even
if this pattern has held in the past, it\'s crazy to rely on it in the
future, for several reasons. The first is that today\'s nuclear wannabes
are so completely unhinged, you\'d be mad to trust them with a bomb.
Take the sybaritic Kim Jong Il, who\'s never missed a chance to
demonstrate his battiness, or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has denied the
Holocaust and promised the destruction of Israel, and who, according to
some respected Middle East scholars, runs a messianic martyrdom cult
that would welcome nuclear obliteration. These regimes are the ultimate
rogues, the thinking goes---and there\'s no deterring rogues. But are
Kim and Ahmadinejad really scarier and crazier than were Stalin and Mao?
It might look that way from Seoul or Tel Aviv, but history says
otherwise. Khrushchev, remember, threatened to \"bury\" the United
States, and in 1957, Mao blithely declared that a nuclear war with
America wouldn\'t be so bad because even \"if half of mankind died ...
the whole world would become socialist.\" Pyongyang and Tehran support
terrorism---but so did Moscow and Beijing. And as for seeming suicidal,
Michael Desch of the University of Notre Dame points out that Stalin and
Mao are the real record holders here: both were responsible for the
deaths of some 20 million of their own citizens. Yet [when push came to
shove, their regimes **balked at nuclear suicide**, and **so would
today\'s international bogeymen**]{.underline}. For all of
Ahmadinejad\'s antics, his power is limited, and the clerical regime has
always proved rational and pragmatic when its life is on the line.
Revolutionary Iran has never started a war, has done deals with both
Washington and Jerusalem, and sued for peace in its war with Iraq (which
Saddam started) once it realized it couldn\'t win. North Korea,
meanwhile, is a tiny, impoverished, family-run country with a history of
being invaded; its overwhelming preoccupation is survival, and every
time it becomes more belligerent it reverses itself a few months later
(witness last week, when Pyongyang told Seoul and Washington it was
ready to return to the bargaining table). These [countries may be
brutally oppressive, but nothing in their behavior suggests they have a
death wish]{.underline}.

## Advantage 2 -- Extension

### Link Ext -- Economic inequality

#### Germline genetic engineering increases economic inequality 

Scott J. **Schweikart**, Global Regulation of Germline Genome Editing:
Ethical Considerations and Application of International Human Rights
Law, 43 Loy. L.A. Int\'l & Comp. L. Rev. 279 (**2021**). Available at:

The ethical principle of justice is derived from concepts of what is
fair and equitable.45 Issues of justice are of concern for both somatic
and germline genome editing. [[Consider the example of germline genome
editing that would confer a benefit]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as a
modification to help confer immunity):46 [[if such an "enhancement is
available only to the upper classes, it can further widen the already
existing gap between the more advantaged and less advantaged members of
society and thus exacerbate injustices.]{.underline}]{.mark}"[[47
Ethically, the "benefits of heritable genome editing should not
preferentially accrue only to the affluent
individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}."48 Indeed, there is a human rights
aspect with regard to social justice, as "\[t\]he potential for
discrimination against genetic groups increases dramatically as genetic
testing and \[germline manipulation\] techniques become less expensive,
more reliable, and more widely available."49 Maha Munayyer explains that
"\[germline manipulation\] provoke\[s\] discrimination based on genetic
status while simultaneously providing the means to alter that status."50
[[An additional concern is that the price of the technology is yet
another way that inequality may spread, as "editing is likely to be
expensive"]{.underline}]{.mark} and "\[g\]enetic disease, once a
universal common denominator, could instead become an artifact of class,
geographic location, and culture."

[The rich would be buying better genes for their children,]{.mark} which
would be a nightmare,\' says Walter Isaacson. An American author and
professor says he believes [gene editing will be the most consequential
ethical issue humans face in the coming decades]{.mark} --- [and that it
could become problematic if we start using the technology to edit out
our diversity]{.mark}. \"[These \[technologies\] are]{.mark} going to be
totally [transformative]{.mark},\" he told The Current\'s Matt Galloway.
\"Where it crosses a line is when we start not just editing for diseases
in a living patient, but we try to make enhancements in children and in
reproductive cells.\" Last October, American biochemist Jennifer Doudna
and French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier shared the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry for developing the CRISPR gene editing tool. The technology
allows scientists to edit specific genes to remove errors that lead to
disease. CRISPR has been hailed by the scientific community as a
revolutionary tool, and is currently being used to try treating cancer
and other diseases, such as sickle cell anemia. But some experts have
also warned against using it to solve all our social problems, saying
not enough is known about the risks it poses or its long-term effects.
In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui claimed to have made the world\'s
first gene-edited babies. The move drew widespread criticism, and He was
later imprisoned in China for his research. Deploying gene editing
technology in such a way also worries Isaacson. [If we start using gene
editing to enhance our children, we could end up entrenching the
inequalities that already exist in society]{.mark}, he said. \"The rich
would be buying better genes for their children, which would be a
nightmare,\" Isaacson said. \"If every individual gets to say, alright,
\[I want my kid to be\] tall or short, or muscular or not muscular, or
any type of traits a human could have, I think that would be bad to
do.\" What we should be open to is \"medically necessary\" gene editing
that could prevent people from inheriting ailments such as Huntington\'s
or sickle cell disease, he said. However, [deciding what is actually
medically necessary is \"a blurry line]{.mark}.\" Isaacson cited famous
creative minds like Miles Davis, Van Gogh and Hemingway, who lived with
a disease or mental illness. Despite that, they produced incredible
works of art. \"We don\'t want our kids to suffer from psychological
ailments,\" Isaacson said. \"On the other hand, if we wipe our species
clean,\" it could lead us to become a \"very placid species without
diversity, and perhaps without edge.\" Some people have already pushed
back against the idea of using gene editing to prevent certain
conditions. In 2019, Canadian bioethicist Françoise Baylis denounced a
Russian molecular biologist\'s plan to edit human embryos to prevent
deafness. Baylis told As It Happens at the time that it was unclear if
the science to do so was safe, and that [modifying genes could have
unintended consequences]{.mark}. She added that many people in the deaf
community also don\'t see deafness as a disability, but rather as
diversity. These kinds of moral and ethical debates call for
international consensus, said Isaacson. And experts are already trying
to come up with answers. Doudna herself has been calling for
international regulations to control the use of CRISPR, while others
have raised alarm bells about making genetically altered babies.
Isaacson hopes his own insights can help as well. \"I wrote this book so
we can start thinking about those questions,\" he said.

The ruckus over the CRISPR gene-editing system hides a dark reality:
[its high cost may make it unaffordable and questions remain
whether]{.mark} most [insurance companies will pay]{.mark} for it. As
CRISPR begins to move forward in clinical trials, there are some signals
about how it may --- or may not --- be received commercially. Other
types of gene therapies carry a price tag that is likely to induce
sticker shock. If adopted, [these therapies will add striking new cost
burdens to our health care system. "The cost isn't coming down]{.mark},"
said Mark Trusheim, director of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's NEW Drug Development Paradigms, a think tank working on the
problem of how we will pay for expensive new drugs. "Companies will say,
'We are developing these medicines, just pay us'; insurers will say, 'We
can't afford it.\'" A few years ago, Dutch drug company uniQure set up a
plant in Lexington, Mass., to make [a gene therapy called Glybera, at
the time the most expensive drug in the world]{.mark}. It used viruses
to slip copies of a gene into human cells to restore an enzyme needed to
break down fats. The [cost? \$1.4 million per patient.]{.mark} The
company eventually abandoned its bid to bring Glybera to the U.S. and,
after having sold it just once in Germany, recently withdrew it from
European markets, rendering it a commercial failure. Spark Therapeutics
of Philadelphia is vying to bring the [first gene therapy]{.mark} to
market [in the U.S.]{.mark} to treat a rare genetic eye disease called
Leber congenital amaurosis 2. Analysts said it [could cost a
half-million dollars per eye]{.mark}. Like Glybera, Spark's treatment is
a form of traditional gene therapy, which makes use of viruses to get
bits of restorative code into our cells. [CRISPR]{.mark} will allow us
to alter our existing genes. But it often relies on using viruses to
shuttle the molecular gene-editing systems into our cells, and [can be
as expensive as other gene therapies]{.mark}. Editas Medicine plans to
use CRISPR-Cas9 to treat various diseases, including Leber congenital
amaurosis. "Enthusiasm is great for interventions in the eye," New York
University bioethicist Arthur Caplan told me. "They permit trying one
eye at a time and it is easy to tell if anything positive happens.
Safety is much easier to ensure." But in its annual report, Editas noted
"significant uncertainty" on whether payers would cover the treatment.
In fact, a handful of [insurance companies]{.mark} (VantageBlue from
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, Select Health, and VIVA Health)
[have issued policy documents that exclude gene therapy from
coverage]{.mark}, a move that experts say establishes policy against
paying for CRISPR-based therapeutics. The Institute for Clinical and
Economic Review released a report in March stating there are 12 to 14
gene therapy candidates that are expected to be among the first for
commercial approval. "[With payer budgets already stretched, and reining
in the costs high on the agenda, both public and private payers will
likely balk at the cost of]{.mark} some of [these gene-based
treatments]{.mark}," the American Journal of Managed Care wrote in a
reflection on the report. "Europe has the lead in approved gene
therapies, and the [first such drug]{.mark} to be approved [had
a]{.mark} launch [price of \$1.4 million]{.mark}. [Can the US health
care system absorb the cumulative impact of such prices, considering
that 10 percent of the population has a rare condition linked to a
genetic defect?]{.mark}" Five major gene therapy companies went public
last year, suggesting that investors are ready to bet on the commercial
prospects. Editas signed a deal with Juno Therapeutics that could be
worth up to \$737 million. The companies would combine CRISPR with other
tactics to trick the immune system's T cells to fight cancer. Those
tactics could include disabling genes in T cells that prevent cancer
cells from shutting down a T cell response, and adding bits of genetic
code to engineer new receptors into T cells to let them attach to
abnormal proteins in cancer cells called neoantigens. [Gene and cell
therapies]{.mark} that [run into the six figures and beyond]{.mark} are
poised to heighten the cost of cancer treatments, [which not everyone
may be able to afford.]{.mark} In fact, oncologist Dr. Siddhartha
Mukherjee, author of the bestselling "Emperor of All Maladies," gave a
speech this month at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology
meeting that warned about [dividing the world "into the rich who can
afford personalized cancer treatment and the poor who cannot]{.mark}."
Tania Bubela, a law and policy expert, and Chris McCabe, a health
economist, both at the University of Alberta, will be holding a workshop
in late June in Banff, Canada, to explore how to enable access to
high-priced technologies. According to Bubela, [gene-editing systems
such as CRISPR-]{.mark}Cas9 [promise to heighten the tension around
health care policy]{.mark}. One idea for easing the tension is for
regulators to permit drug makers to get reimbursed from insurers before
their gene therapy gets FDA approval, while requiring drug makers to
collect more data before charging full price --- a kind of price
control. "[Companies will charge whatever the market will bear,"]{.mark}
Bubela told me. "I'm not even sure that many of these gene therapies
will work, and [not all medicine is worth the price]{.mark}." But if
these technologies become broadly used, especially in altering T cells
for cancer, payers won't meet the demands of steep prices, and Bubela
predicts that "the system implodes under its own weight." I believe that
part of the problem lies in financial dealings. The Broad Institute, for
instance, holds patents to gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 and
CRISPR-Cpf1 and has issued exclusive licenses to Editas to use these
tools for medical purposes. It could issue more-affordable CRISPR
licenses one gene at a time, say directly to Juno Therapeutics, which
now accesses them through its multimillion dollar deals with Editas. But
that would cut Editas investors out of the loop. Such deals tend to
inflate drug prices, since venture and public investors in Editas demand
a cut on each CRISPR application. As investors engage in layers of
transactional deals along the top of the food chain, the costs of gene
therapies go up while the financiers may shift blame for a lack of
patient coverage to insurance companies. Dr. Stuart Orkin, a pediatric
oncologist at Boston Children's Center, and Dr. Philip Reilly, a partner
at Third Rock Ventures, an Editas funder, coauthored a paper in Science
magazine saying that sticker shock shouldn't halt commercialization. It
can cost \$300,000 a year to treat a single hemophilia patient with
existing standard treatments and \$25,000 to treat a single sickle-cell
patient. Given costs like those, one-time gene therapy treatments
running into the six figures may be comparatively affordable if an
insurer makes payments to a drug-maker over a decade that are tied to
the drug's continued performance. In fact, the idea of spreading
payments over years as annuities originated with corporate-friendly FDA
commissioner Scott Gottlieb in a 2014 paper he co-authored for the
American Enterprise Institute. Other performance-based models are being
tested. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, is trying to bring a \$665,000
gene therapy to the U.S. to treat an immune system disorder. The company
said it will tie the cost of the drug to its performance in patients ---
with a money-back guarantee. "The reality is it's very tough, and it
doesn't come easy," said Jonathan Appleby, a chief scientific officer
for the company's rare disease unit. Orkin and Reilly also like the idea
of using U.S. government funds from the Orphan Drug Act, established in
1983, to pay gene therapy companies for their commercial products.
Another idea for keeping gene therapy, including CRISPR-based therapies,
affordable is that investors could ask insurance companies to buy in
bulk. MIT's Ernst Berndt, inspired in part by volume purchases of
vaccines in Africa, has proposed "advanced market commitments" through
which insurance groups commit to buying a bunch of expensive drugs. That
model that could be applied to gene therapies, but the insurers may not
go for it without a bit more give. In 2009, the Biologics Price
Competition and Innovation Act created a pathway for approving generic
biologics, also known as biosimilars. [It may apply to
CRISPR]{.mark}-based biosimilars, [but]{.mark} generic [gene-editing ---
and]{.mark} thus [competition to drive down prices --- is unlikely to
appear for decades]{.mark}. Cathryn Donaldson, a spokesperson for
American's Health Insurance Plans, noted that a lack of generic forms of
CRISPR means "[drug makers may charge whatever they want for
their]{.mark} branded [medication]{.mark}. " In 1968, Garrett Hardin
argued in his now-classic essay, "The Tragedy of the Commons," that a
shared-resource system will tend to be depleted by self-interested
individuals. He also argued against exponential growth --- to which we
could add today the growth of biotech valuation. Health care is a
limited shared resource, and [expensive new technologies could add
pressures resulting in unequal access]{.mark}, especially to cancer
therapies. Given the aggressive drive for money, and without new
approaches in thinking, [we are headed for disaster]{.mark}. One of two
things will happen: either we will embrace a national health care system
with broad access but that severely limits expensive new drugs, gene
therapies, and CRISPR-based biologics; or [these treatments will be
available to only the wealthiest among us who can pay for them, a
dystopian vision which is]{.mark} perverse but perhaps [more realistic
considering the pressures for a return on investment.]{.mark}

### Inequality Impacts

#### Inequality furthers global warming -- prevents needed action

**UN** 3 September **2016**
https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/wess-policy-brief-the-nexus-between-climate-change-and-inequalities/

[Climate change and inequality are two of the most important
challenges]{.mark} currently faced by the international community. An
extensive review of the evidence in the World Economic and Social Survey
2016: climate change resilience, an opportunity for reducing
inequalities suggests that the impacts of climate change and structural
inequalities are locked in a vicious cycle. [Large inequalities]{.mark}
in access to physical and financial assets; unequal access to quality
health services, education and employment; and inequality with respect
to voice and political representation [aggravate the exposure and
vulnerability]{.mark} of large population groups [to climate
hazards]{.mark}. Better understanding of the links between climate
change impacts and inequalities will help to improve the design and
implementation of policies able to simultaneously address climate change
hazards and socioeconomic inequalities. Climate change and inequality: a
vicious cycle The scheme in figure 1 presents the climate
change-inequality vicious cycle. It shows that multidimensional
inequalities lead to increased exposure and vulnerability of the
disadvantaged groups to climate hazards. As a result, [the disadvantaged
groups suffer disproportionate loss of income and assets]{.mark}
(physical, financial, human and social) [when these hazards]{.mark}
actually [hit them]{.mark}. Consequently, [inequality worsens]{.mark},
and the cycle perpetuates with greater force. Multiple sources of
inequality exacerbate the risk to climate change The more detailed
analysis presented in WESS 2016 shows that inequality (i) increases the
exposure of the disadvantaged groups of society to climate hazards; (ii)
increases their susceptibility to the damages caused by climate hazards,
and (iii) decreases their ability to cope with and recover from the
damages caused by climate hazards. Analysis also shows that various
forms of economic, political and social inequalities play an important
role in exacerbating the impact of climate change on people and
communities. In addition to inequality with respect to income and
wealth, inequality regarding gender, age, ethnicity, race, religion and
geographical location play a role in determining the exposure,
susceptibility and ability of various groups within the population to
cope with and recover from climate hazards. Empirical evidence shows
that [exposure to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} adverse [effects of climate
change is largely determined by]{.mark} the location where people choose
or are forced to live. Both [lack of income]{.mark} (a consequence of
economic inequality) [or lack of rights]{.mark} (a consequence of
political inequality) may compel many disadvantaged people to live in
locations prone to climate hazards, such as coastal low-lying areas,
along river banks, or at the bottom of hills that experience mudslides.
Of the people living in the same area---thus having similar
exposure---the disadvantaged households generally prove to be more
susceptible to damages caused by climate hazards. Again, both economic
and non-economic inequalities play a role in this regard. For example,
among the people living in flood-prone areas, those in houses made of
flimsy material (because of their limited means) are more susceptible to
damage caused by floods than those in sturdy houses. Occupation is
another factor determining susceptibility. Lack of assets often forces
disadvantaged people into hazardous occupations such as artisan
fisheries and crop cultivation in flood-prone areas. As a consequence,
they become more susceptible to damages caused by adverse effects of
climate change. Age and gender also play an important role in
determining susceptibility. For example, young children and the elderly
suffer more from health damages caused by climate hazards. Similarly,
women who have to fetch fuel and water for their households are more
exposed and susceptible to climate hazards. [Inequality also limits the
access of disadvantaged groups to]{.mark} the private, communal, and
public [resources necessary to cope]{.mark} with and recover [from the
damages caused by climate hazards]{.mark}. For example, while higher
income households may buy insurance that provides compensation for
losses, people living in poverty cannot afford such insurance and thus
have to absorb the entire loss, further undermining their asset
position. [Certain groups are often able to exercise control]{.mark}
over common property, [based on their social position]{.mark} vis-à-vis
other marginalized groups. The existence of [entrenched
inequalitie]{.mark}s in the access to voice, power and political
representation [often leads to public policies that perpetuate large
inequalities]{.mark} in access to public resources such as health,
education and infrastructure. Policy implications of the climate
change-inequality vicious cycle The reality of [the climate
change-inequality vicious cycle has significant policy
implications]{.mark}. The international community is committed to
mitigating both climate change and inequality. The Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for the implementation of
policies to address the underlying causes of poverty, vulnerability and
the risk to climate change simultaneously. SDG 10 calls for the
reduction of inequality and SDG 13 calls for actions towards climate
change mitigation and strengthening adaptive capacity and resilience to
climate hazards. Interlinkages between climate change and inequalities
are well reflected in most of the SDGs in recognition of the fact that
it will be much harder for countries to make substantive development
progress in key areas (such as poverty eradication, food security,
healthy lives, among many others) unless people and communities are
resilient to the negative impacts of climate hazards. Achieving these
goals is not easy, however. While the challenges posed by climate change
gained prominence in more recent years, the challenge of reducing the
many dimensions of inequality is long-standing. The persistence, and
often widening, of multiple inequalities testifies to the difficulty
involved in dealing with this problem. [Inequalities of different types
are interrelated.]{.mark} Structural inequalities---such as inequalities
with respect to assets, income, voice and political participation---are
the underlying source of many other forms of inequality. The criterion
that may guide policymakers through this maze of interrelationships is
feasibility, both political and economic. However, what is important to
realize is that the space of feasible actions towards reduction of
inequality has expanded, owing to the urgency of climate
action---perhaps a silver lining in the otherwise dark cloud of climate
change! Many adaptation and mitigation measures have become unavoidable.
[Policy]{.mark} actions, however, [must]{.mark} be consistent to make
sure efforts to build climate change resilience properly [address the
underlying cause of inequality]{.mark}. Otherwise, mitigation and
adaptation measures may have unintended consequences on inequality. For
example, in expanding insurance for people to better cope with and
recover from climate hazards, [care must be taken to include the
disadvantaged groups.]{.mark} This will help them to build assets and
raise income. Similarly, in designing a programme to promote salinity
resistant crops (an adaptation effort), efforts must be made to cover
small and low-income farmers, who so far might have been deprived of
necessary agriculture extension services. This may help them raise
output and thus increase their income and assets. Similarly, in
expanding health services to help local populations better withstand the
health consequences of climate hazards, efforts must be made to ensure
that people usually excluded will also have access to quality public
health services. This will help them to build human capital. In extreme
cases, when population groups need to be relocated, efforts must be made
to ensure land distribution that is more egalitarian in the new location
than it was in the old. There are numerous examples of ways in which
adaptation and mitigation measures create opportunities to reduce
inequality. Addressing the root causes of inequalities enables
adaptation and the building of resilience to climate hazards, but it
requires a continuum of well-designed and integrated policies, including
(i) immediate assistance in the wake of climate hazards and disaster
risk reduction; (ii) support to facilitate adaptation to a changing
climate, entailing, for example, introduction of new crop varieties and
water management techniques; (iii) policies centred on ecosystem
management and on income diversification; and (iv) sound development
policies focused on reducing inequalities to achieve poverty eradication
and social inclusion. These specific measures will be most effective in
reducing climate change vulnerability when they are part of longer-term
transformative strategies which embrace coherent policies across the
economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable
development. Awareness of the interrelations between climate change
resilience and the structural determinants of inequality will help to
identify opportunities to break the vicious cycle between climate change
and inequality and turn it into a path of inclusive and climate
resilient development.

#### Inequality-driven collapse escalates global hotspots, including reactor meltdowns. Its an existential threat. 

Mathew **Maavak** April **2021**, Author at Atlas Institute for
International Affairs, external researcher (PLATBIDAFO) at the
Kazimieras Simonavicius University in Vilnius, Lithuania, "Horizon 2030:
Will Emerging Risks Unravel Our Global Systems?," Salus Journal, Vol. 9,
No. 1, pp 2-17

But what exactly is a global system? Our planet itself is an autonomous
and self- sustaining mega-system, marked by periodic cycles and
elemental vagaries. Human activities within however are not system
isolates as our banking, utility, farming, healthcare and retail sectors
etc. are increasingly entwined. [[Risks]{.mark} accrued in one system
may [cascade into]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[unforeseen
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} within and/or without (Choo, Smith &
McCusker, 2007). Scholars call this phenomenon "emergence"; one where
the behaviour of intersecting systems is determined by complex and
largely invisible interactions at the substratum (Goldstein, 1999;
Holland, 1998). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. While
experts remain divided over the source and morphology of the virus, the
contagion has ramified into a global health crisis and supply chain
nightmare. It is also tilting the geopolitical balance. China is the
largest exporter of intermediate products, and had generated nearly 20%
of global imports in 2015 alone (Cousin, 2020). The pharmaceutical
sector is particularly vulnerable. Nearly "85% of medicines in the U.S.
strategic national stockpile" sources components from China (Owens,
2020). An initial run on respiratory masks has now been eclipsed by
rowdy queues at supermarkets and the bankruptcy of small businesses. The
entire global population -- save for major pockets such as Sweden,
Belarus, Taiwan and Japan -- have been subjected to cyclical lockdowns
and quarantines. Never before in history have humans faced such a
systemic, borderless calamity. COVID-19 represents a classic emergent
crisis that necessitates real-time response and adaptivity in a
real-time world, particularly since the global Just-in-Time (JIT)
production and delivery system serves as both an enabler and vector for
transboundary risks. From a systems thinking perspective, emerging risk
management should therefore address a whole spectrum of activity across
the economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and technological
(EEGST) taxonomy. Every emerging threat can be slotted into this
taxonomy -- a reason why it is used by the World Economic Forum (WEF)
for its annual global risk exercises (Maavak, 2019a). As traditional
forces of globalization unravel, security professionals should take
cognizance of emerging threats through a systems thinking approach.
Methodology An EEGST sectional breakdown was adopted to illustrate a
sampling of extreme risks facing the world for the 2020-2030 decade. The
transcendental quality of emerging risks, as outlined on Figure 1,
below, was primarily informed by the following pillars of systems
thinking (Rickards, 2020): Diminishing diversity (or increasing
homogeneity) of actors in the global system (Boli & Thomas, 1997; Meyer,
2000; Young et al, 2006); Interconnections in the global system
(Homer-Dixon et al, 2015; Lee & Preston, 2012); Interactions of actors,
events and components in the global system (Buldyrev et al, 2010; Bashan
et al, 2013; Homer-Dixon et al, 2015); and Adaptive qualities in
particular systems (Bodin & Norberg, 2005; Scheffer et al, 2012) Since
scholastic material on this topic remains somewhat inchoate, this paper
buttresses many of its contentions through secondary (i.e.
news/institutional) sources. Economy According to Professor Stanislaw
Drozdz (2018) of the Polish Academy of Sciences, "[[a global
financial]{.underline}]{.mark} [[crash of a previously unprecedented
scale]{.underline}]{.mark} is highly probable" by the mid-2020s. This
[[will lead to a]{.underline}]{.mark} trickle-down [[meltdown, impacting
all]{.mark}]{.underline} areas [[of human activity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The economist John Mauldin (2018) similarly warns that the "2020s might
be the worst decade in US history" [[and may lead to a Second Great
Depression]{.underline}]{.mark}. Other forecasts are equally alarming.
According to the International Institute of Finance, global debt may
have surpassed \$255 trillion by 2020 (IIF, 2019). Yet another study
revealed that global debts and liabilities amounted to a staggering
\$2.5 quadrillion (Ausman, 2018). The reader should note that these
figures were tabulated before the COVID-19 outbreak. The IMF singles out
widening income inequality as the trigger for the next Great Depression
(Georgieva, 2020). The wealthiest 1% now own more than twice as much
wealth as 6.9 billion people (Coffey et al, 2020) and this chasm is
widening with each passing month. COVID-19 had, in fact, boosted global
billionaire wealth to an unprecedented \$10.2 trillion by July 2020
(UBS-PWC, 2020). Global GDP, worth \$88 trillion in 2019, may have
contracted by 5.2% in 2020 (World Bank, 2020). As the Greek historian
Plutarch warned in the 1st century AD: "An imbalance between rich and
poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics" (Mauldin,
2014). The stability of a society, as Aristotle argued even earlier,
depends on a robust middle element or middle class. At the rate the
global middle class is facing catastrophic debt and unemployment levels,
widespread social disaffection may morph into outright anarchy (Maavak,
2012; DCDC, 2007). [[Economic stressors]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
transcendent VUCA fashion, may also [[induce radical geopolitical
realignments]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bullions now carry more weight than
NATO's security guarantees in Eastern Europe. After Poland repatriated
100 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2019, Slovakia, Serbia and
Hungary quickly followed suit. According to former Slovak Premier Robert
Fico, this erosion in regional trust was based on historical precedents
-- in particular the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded Czechoslovakia's
Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. As Fico reiterated (Dudik & Tomek, 2019):
"You can hardly trust even the closest allies after the Munich
Agreement... I guarantee that if something happens, we won't see a
single gram of this (offshore-held) gold. Let's do it (repatriation) as
quickly as possible." (Parenthesis added by author). President
Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia (a non-NATO nation) justified his central
bank's gold-repatriation program by hinting at economic headwinds ahead:
"We see in which direction the crisis in the world is moving" (Dudik &
Tomek, 2019). Indeed, with two global Titanics [[-- the United States
and China]{.underline}]{.mark} -- set [[on a collision
course]{.underline}]{.mark} with a quadrillions-denominated iceberg in
the middle, and [[a viral outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark} on its tip, the
seismic ripples will be felt far, wide and for a considerable period. A
reality check is nonetheless needed here: Can additional bullions
realistically circumvallate the economies of 80 million plus peoples in
these Eastern European nations, worth a collective \$1.8 trillion by
purchasing power parity? Gold however is a potent psychological symbol
as it represents national sovereignty and economic reassurance in a
potentially hyperinflationary world. The portents are clear: The current
global economic system will be weakened by [[rising nationalism and
autarkic demands]{.underline}]{.mark}. Much uncertainty remains ahead.
Mauldin (2018) proposes the introduction of Old Testament-style debt
jubilees to facilitate gradual national recoveries. The World Economic
Forum, on the other hand, has long proposed a "Great Reset" by 2030; a
socialist utopia where "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy" (WEF,
2016). In the final analysis, COVID-19 is not the root cause of the
current global economic turmoil; it is merely an accelerant to a burning
house of cards that was left smouldering since the 2008 Great Recession
(Maavak, 2020a). We also see how the four main pillars of systems
thinking (diversity, interconnectivity, interactivity and "adaptivity")
form the mise en scene in a VUCA decade. Environmental What happens to
the environment when our economies implode? Think of a debt-laden
workforce at sensitive nuclear and chemical plants, along with a
concomitant surge in industrial accidents? Economic stressors, workforce
demoralization and rampant profiteering -- rather than manmade climate
change -- arguably pose the biggest threats to the environment. In a WEF
report, Buehler et al (2017) made the following pre-COVID-19
observation: The ILO estimates that the annual cost to the global
economy from accidents and work-related diseases alone is a staggering
\$3 trillion. Moreover, a recent report suggests the world's 3.2 billion
workers are increasingly unwell, with the vast majority facing
significant economic insecurity: 77% work in part-time, temporary,
"vulnerable" or unpaid jobs. Shouldn't this phenomenon be better
categorized as a societal or economic risk rather than an environmental
one? In line with the systems thinking approach, however, global risks
can no longer be boxed into a taxonomical silo. Frazzled workforces may
precipitate [[another]{.underline}]{.mark} Bhopal (1984),
[[Chernobyl]{.underline}]{.mark} (1986), Deepwater Horizon (2010) or
Flint water crisis (2014). These disasters were notably not the result
of manmade [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}. Neither was the
Fukushima [[nuclear disaster]{.underline}]{.mark} (2011) nor the Indian
Ocean tsunami (2004). Indeed, the combustion of a long-overlooked cargo
of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had nearly levelled the city of
Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug 4 2020. The explosion left 204 dead; 7,500
injured; US\$15 billion in property damages; and an estimated 300,000
people homeless (Urbina, 2020). The environmental costs have yet to be
adequately tabulated. Environmental disasters are more attributable to
Black Swan events, systems breakdowns and corporate greed rather than to
mundane human activity. Our JIT world aggravates the cascading potential
of risks (Korowicz, 2012). Production and delivery delays, caused by the
COVID-19 outbreak, will eventually require industrial overcompensation.
This will further stress senior executives, workers, machines and a
variety of computerized systems. The trickle-down effects will likely
include substandard products, contaminated food and a general lowering
in health and safety standards (Maavak, 2019a). Unpaid or demoralized
sanitation workers may also resort to indiscriminate waste dumping. Many
cities across the United States (and elsewhere in the world) are no
longer recycling wastes due to prohibitive costs in the global
corona-economy (Liacko, 2021). Even in good times, strict protocols on
waste disposals were routinely ignored. While Sweden championed the
global climate change narrative, its clothing flagship H&M was busy
covering up toxic effluences disgorged by vendors along the Citarum
River in Java, Indonesia. As a result, countless children among 14
million Indonesians straddling the "world's most polluted river" began
to suffer from dermatitis, intestinal problems, developmental disorders,
renal failure, chronic bronchitis and cancer (DW, 2020). It is also in
cauldrons like the Citarum River where pathogens may mutate with
emergent ramifications. On an equally alarming note, depressed economic
conditions have traditionally provided a waste disposal boon for
organized crime elements. Throughout 1980s, the Calabria-based
'Ndrangheta mafia -- in collusion with governments in Europe and North
America -- began to dump [[radioactive wastes]{.underline}]{.mark} along
the coast of Somalia. Reeling from pollution and revenue loss, Somali
fisherman eventually resorted to mass piracy (Knaup, 2008). The coast of
Somalia is now a maritime hotspot, and exemplifies an entwined form of
economic-environmental-geopolitical-societal emergence. In a VUCA world,
indiscriminate waste dumping can unexpectedly morph into a Black Hawk
Down incident. The laws of unintended consequences are governed by
actors, interconnections, interactions and adaptations in a system under
study -- as outlined in the methodology section.
Environmentally-devastating industrial sabotages -- whether by
disgruntled workers, industrial competitors, ideological maniacs or
terrorist groups -- cannot be discounted in a VUCA world. Immiserated
societies, in stark defiance of climate change diktats, may resort to
dirty coal plants and wood stoves for survival. Interlinked ecosystems,
particularly water resources, may be hijacked by nationalist sentiments.
The environmental fallouts of critical infrastructure (CI) breakdowns
loom like a Sword of Damocles over this decade. Geopolitical The primary
catalyst behind WWII was the Great Depression. Since history often
repeats itself, expect familiar bogeymen to reappear in societies
roiling with impoverishment and ideological clefts. Anti-Semitism -- a
societal risk on its own -- may reach alarming proportions in the West
(Reuters, 2019), possibly forcing Israel to undertake reprisal
operations inside allied nations. If that happens, how will affected
nations react? Will security resources be reallocated to protect certain
minorities (or the Top 1%) while larger segments of society are exposed
to restive forces? Balloon effects like these present a classic VUCA
problematic. Contemporary geopolitical risks include [[a possible
Iran-Israel war; US-China]{.mark} military [confrontation over Taiwan
or]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea;
[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean [prolif]{.mark}eratio]{.underline}n of
nuclear and missile technologies; an [[India-Pakistan nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}; an Iranian closure of the Straits of Hormuz;
fundamentalist-driven implosion in the Islamic world; [[or a nuclear
confrontation between NATO and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fears that
the Jan 3 2020 assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani might
lead to WWIII were grossly overblown. From a systems perspective, the
killing of Soleimani did not fundamentally change the
actor-interconnection-interaction- adaptivity equation in the Middle
East. Soleimani was simply a cog who got replaced.

moratorium on experimenting with gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark}** as
biological weapon tools or allowing experimentation strictly for
benefiting human health. In June, a WHO expert committee published two
reports (see here and here) that made recommendations about how human
genome editing could be governed at the appropriate institutional,
national and global level. Its framework incorporates structures of
governance that already exist in different countries, such as regulatory
authorities or national guidelines regarding genome editing or similar
technologies. It recommends, for example, that ethics committees review
clinical trials and approvals in the area. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark}
these [[recommendations provide some clarity]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is
concerning that **[[these]{.underline}]{.mark}** are simply
**[[guidelines]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[do not have the force of

that the [guidelines do not address issues of safety and
efficacy]{.underline} -- stating this wasn't part of the scope of the
review. But that may change going forward. For now, these
recommendations are the closest thing we have to a global framework of
governance. And [as the technology continues to develop, it is hoped

Given the broad scope and scale of this growing threat, **[[the United
States should take a series of actions to mitigate the
risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, without unduly stunting the growth of the
biotechnology field. [To date, bioterrorist attacks have been low-risk,
high-impact events]{.underline}. **[While they have been extremely rare,
their frequency will only increase as will their
ramifications]{.underline}**. However, overregulating the spread of
biotechnological tools could stunt innovation and the profound potential
of this increasingly important sector. Furthermore, [[existing methods
of preventing bioterrorism may no longer be
effective]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The government could previously monitor
the purchase of expensive and dangerous biotechnology tools and the
laboratories that owned them in large quantities. **This is no longer
possible**]{.underline} to the same degree when such tools are
increasingly cheap, widespread, and usable in a garage. The FBI is
currently attempting to address this risk by building relationships with
the iGEM community and with life scientists so that they can report
suspicious behavior. These [[efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} should
continue, but [[are wildly insufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}, since some
bioterrorists may have minimal contact with the larger community of
biologists and biology hobbyists. The [[release of a bioweapon by a
terrorist]{.underline}]{.mark}, if left unchecked, **[[could spread
throughout the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [just as a naturally
occurring pandemic would]{.underline}. Thus, one major step that the
United States should take is to establish improved responses to disease
outbreaks, particularly learning from COVID-19. This should include
building a larger stockpile of PPE and establishing a set of clear
step-by-step actions to be taken in the event of an attack. Building
resilience in this fashion will not prevent bioterrorism, but it will
mitigate its effects, and may slightly disincentivize utilizing
bioweapons to cause terror. Beyond this, [the United States should
secure its laboratories and the data within,]{.underline} as terrorists
could leverage that knowledge to build bioweapons. For example, **[new
technology allows pathogens to be synthesized from the data describing
their genetic sequences]{.underline}**. In a recent controversial study,
scientists published a methodology that would allow horsepox virus, a
virus very similar to one that causes smallpox, to be synthesized. This
[[research was conducted with a noble]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[goal]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} how
[[the horsepox virus]{.underline}]{.mark} could be used as a potential
treatment for cancer. **[[However, it had significant dual-use
implications]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Research like this should not be
banned outright, but [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[should establish
norms]{.underline}]{.mark}** to evaluate whether it is worth the risk
before such research is conducted, and then ensure that it is conducted
and the results published [in the most secure ways]{.underline}.
Replicability is an important part of science, but **[the general public
should not be able to replicate the most dangerous
experiments]{.underline}**. Where building resilience would reduce the
impact of a bioterror incident, **[[restricting access to
dual-use]{.underline}]{.mark}** methodologies [[will reduce the
likelihood of one]{.mark} occurring in the first place]{.underline}.
Finally, **[[enforcing domestic standards is not
enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Pathogens spread across
borders]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the **[spillover effects of even a
targeted bioterrorist attack could kill many unintended
victims]{.underline}**. Thus, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[must work with other countries to
protect against the bioterrorist threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**, monitor
the emergence of new viruses and bacteria that could be leveraged for a
bioweapon, [limit access to the most dangerous pathogens]{.underline}
(and data associated with those), and build global response networks in
the event of an attack. Importantly, **[[this collaboration should
emphasize working with allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but should also
include adversaries: if China or Russia remain unregulated, an attack
within their borders would still affect the United States and its
allies. Emerging biotechnology will result in new medicines and medical
techniques, a greater understanding of how pathogens function and spread
(and thus a better understanding of how to combat them), a healthier
populace, innovative new capabilities that could transform daily life,
and greater engagement with the biological sciences. While ensuring that
these benefits are maintained, [[the United States and its allies and
partners must take logical steps to protect themselves from the
worst-case scenarios.]{.underline}]{.mark} The **[[risk of bioterrorism
is growing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[the United States must be

**[[gene-edited pathogen designed to turn us into

**[the most well known is rabies]{.underline}**, [which can cause
aggression and hallucination]{.underline} **[and is almost always fatal
once symptoms appear.]{.underline}** But there are others. A recently
discovered kind of wasp, for example, can turn a particular species of
spider (Anelosimus eximius) into "zombies" by laying eggs on their
abdomen. The resulting larvae then attaches itself to the spider,
feeding on it, while the spider, once a social individual, leaves the
colony and prepares to die alone. [Other zombification examples from
nature include the African sleeping sickness, a fatal neurological
condition created by insect-borne parasites, and the Ophiocordyceps
unilateralis fungus]{.underline}, which [changes the behaviour of
carpenter ants before killing them and sprouting out of their

[Weaponising pathogens]{.underline}

Last year, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognised the development of a
type of genetic scissors called [CRISPR-]{.underline}Cas9. Interest in
this technology has been simmering for a while, with equal doses of
excitement and fear. Because of its ability to edit the human genome
with unprecedented precision, replacing a single letter in the DNA,
CRISPR has already proven itself useful in treating genetic conditions
such as sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and many others. But
[CRISPR]{.underline}-Cas9 [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} theoretically
also [[be used for]{.mark} darker purposes]{.underline}, such as
**[[bioterrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It could [[alter pathogens to
make them more transmissible]{.underline}]{.mark} or fatal.
Alternatively, it could turn a non-pathogen, such as a harmless microbe,
into an aggressive virus. The technique may even be able to alter a
virus to make it dangerous for a larger range of species than it
currently infects, or make it resistant to antibiotics or antivirals.
Whether CRISPR could be used to infect humans in a way to make them
zombie-like remains a theoretical speculation. At the moment, there are
probably easier ways to terrorise people. But [[as biotechnologies
improve in the wake of COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[the risk from
bioterrorism is increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If a zombie-like
disease could be created, it clearly wouldn't make deceased people
reawaken as zombies. But [[an infection]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[passed through saliva]{.underline}]{.mark} [[with extremely high
transmission and mortality rate]{.underline}]{.mark}, and which [[caused
agitation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[destructive behaviour and
death]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[wouldn't be far off]{.underline}]{.mark}
the horror that we see in zombie movies. **[Such a virus would spread
rapidly from human to human in a similar manner to diseases such as
Ebola and Marburg viruses]{.underline}**. In the epic zombie film, 28
Days Later, the fictitious "rage virus" was, in fact, inspired by these
two real-life viruses. Given these possibilities, it is not surprising
that the [[director of the US National
Intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}, James Clapper, [[termed gene editing
"weapons of mass destruction and proliferation]{.underline}]{.mark}" in
2018. Many countries are aware of the risks. In 2018, the US government
released its first bio-defence strategy, involving multiple government
agencies. The plan covers not only deliberate bioterror threats, but
also "naturally occurring outbreaks and infectious diseases that escape
a lab accidentally". And, curiously, the US Department of Defense
Strategic Command unit has issued a training programme called CONOP 8888
(Counter-Zombie Dominance), which simulates a zombie apocalypse
situation. However, this was designed to be completely fictitious,
providing military and defence training without the need to involve
real, classified information. How to stop it Do we stand a chance
against such gene-edited pathogens? We have international law
conventions on biological and chemical toxins. These strictly prohibit
states from acquiring or retaining biological weapons. But it is
questionable whether these are adequate in the face of novel approaches.
[[Gene editing technologies such as CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[are
getting cheaper and easier]{.underline}]{.mark}** to work with. [[That

reliable delivery mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[New technologies
are enabling both]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Most [bacterial and viral
agents struggle]{.underline} [to maintain their virulence when
confronted with common environmental factors]{.underline}, such as
sunlight and humidity, and high temperatures or radical temperature
changes. They also evolve and mutate. [Genetic instability is typical
for microorganisms]{.underline}. With [increased transmissibility often
comes reduced virulence]{.underline}. Production of virus molecules
involves passage through host organisms. As the virus is not subject to
any evolutionary pressure to maintain virulence during this scaling-up
process, it tends to accumulate mutations that generate an attenuated
strain. Similarly, bacteria cultured in laboratories tend to lose
virulence.52 **[[Gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark}** and synthetic
biology research are **[[making strides in overcoming the problem of
genetic instability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A study published in 2019
presented [[a new system, CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}-BEST. It [[created
mutations]{.underline}]{.mark} in actinomycetes (bacteria that produce a
wide variety of industrially and medically relevant compounds)
**[[without creating genetic instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
forcing them to rearrange and even delete large parts of their
chromosomes.53 Synthetic biology is also increasingly embracing genetic
instability rather than trying to suppress or compensate for it. With
improved understanding, it is expected to design devices that
incorporate genetic instability as a parameter.54 [Such devices would be
"a true frontier in biological engineering]{.underline}."55

[[Genome sequencing has given rise to]{.underline}]{.mark} a new
generation of [[genetically engineered bioweapons]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[carrying the potential to change the nature of modern warfare and
defense.]{.underline}** Introduction: Biological weapons are designed to
spread disease among people, plants, and animals through the
introduction of toxins and microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria.
The method through which a biological weapon is deployed depends on the
agent itself, its preparation, its durability, and the route of
infection. Attackers may disperse these agents through aerosols or food
and water supplies (1). Although bioweapons have been used in war for
many centuries, a recent [[surge in genetic
understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as a rapid growth in
computational power, **[[has allowed genetic engineering to play a
larger role in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[development
of]{.underline}]{.mark} new [[bioweapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In the
bioweapon industry, [genetic engineering]{.mark} can be used to
[manipulate genes]{.mark} to create new pathogenic characteristics aimed
at [enhancing the efficacy of the weapon]{.mark}]{.underline} [[through
increased survivability]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[infectivity, virulence,
and drug resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} (2). While the positive
societal implications of improved biotechnology are apparent, [the
"black biology" of bioweapon development may be "one of the gravest
threats we will face"]{.underline} (2). Limits of Past Bioweapons.
[Prior to recent advances in genetic engineering, bioweapons were
exclusively natural pathogens]{.underline}. Agents must fulfill numerous
prerequisites to be considered effective military bioweapons, and most
naturally occurring pathogens are ill suited for this purpose (3).
First, bioweapons must be produced in large quantities. A pathogen can
be obtained from the natural environment if enough can be collected to
allow purification and testing of its properties. Otherwise, pathogens
could be produced in a microbiology laboratory or bank, a process which
is limited by pathogen accessibility and the safety with which the
pathogens can be handled in facilities. To replicate viruses and some
bacteria, living cells are required. The growth of large quantities of
an agent can be limited by equipment, space, and the health risks
associated with the handling of hazardous germs (1). In addition to
large-scale production, effective bioweapons must act quickly, be
environmentally robust, and their effects must be treatable for those
who are implementing the bioweapon (3). Recent Advances. [As researchers
continue to transition from the era of DNA sequencing into the era of
DNA synthesis, it may soon become feasible to synthesize any virus whose
DNA sequence is known]{.underline} (4). This was first demonstrated in
2001 when Dr. Eckard Wimmer re-created the poliovirus and again in 2005
when Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger and Terrence Tumpey re-created the 1918
influenza virus (1). The progress of DNA synthesis technology will also
allow for the creation of novel pathogens. According to biological
warfare expert Dr. Steven Block, genetically engineered pathogens "could
be made safer to handle, easier to distribute, capable of ethnic
specificity, or be made to cause higher mortality rates" (2). [[The
growing accessibility]{.underline}]{.mark} of DNA synthesis
capabilities, computational power, and information [[means that a
growing number of people will have the capacity to produce
bioweapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scientists have been able to transform
the four letters of DNA---A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T
(thymine)---into the ones and zeroes of binary code. This transformation
makes genetic engineering a matter of electronic manipulation, which
decreases the cost of the technique (4). According to former Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton, "the emerging gene synthesis industry is
making genetic material more widely available \[...\] [A crude but
effective terrorist weapon can be made using a small sample of any
number of widely available pathogens, inexpensive equipment, and
college-level chemistry and biology]{.underline}." (5) Techniques to
Enhance Efficacy of Bioweapons Scientists and genetic engineers are
considering several techniques to increase the efficacy of pathogens in
warfare. 1. Binary Biological Weapons This technique involves inserting
plasmids, small bacterial DNA fragments, into the DNA of other bacteria
in order to increase virulence or other pathogenic properties within the
host bacteria (2). 2. Designer Genes according to the European
Bioinformatics Institute, as of December 2012, scientists had sequenced
the genomes of 3139 viruses, 1016 plasmids, and 2167 bacteria, some of
which are published on the internet and are therefore accessible to the
public (6). With complete genomes available and the aforementioned
advances in gene synthesis, scientists will soon be able to design
pathogens by creating synthetic genes, synthetic viruses, and possibly
entirely new organisms (2). 3. Gene Therapy Gene therapy involves
repairing or replacing a gene of an organism, permanently changing its
genetic composition. By replacing existing genes with harmful genes,
this technique can be used to manufacture bioweapons (2). 4. Stealth
Viruses Stealth viruses are viral infections that enter cells and remain
dormant for an extended amount of time until triggered externally to
cause disease. In the context of warfare, these viruses could be spread
to a large population, and activation could either be delayed or used as
a threat for blackmail (2).5. Host-Swapping Diseases Much like the
naturally occurring West Nile and Ebola viruses, animal viruses could
potentially be genetically modified and developed to infect humans as a
potent biowarfare tactic (2). 6. Designer Diseases Biotechnology may be
used to manipulate cellular mechanisms to cause disease. For example, an
agent could be designed to induce cells to multiply uncontrollably, as
in cancer, or to initiate apoptosis, programmed cell death (2). 7.
Personalized Bioweapons In coming years it may be conceivable to design
a pathogen that targets a specific person's genome. This agent may
spread through populations showing minimal or no symptoms, yet it would
be fatal to the intended target (4). Biodefense In addition to creating
bioweapons, the emerging tools of genetic knowledge and biological
technology may be used as a means of defense against these weapons. 1.
Human Genome Literacy As scientific research continues to reveal the
functions of specific genes and how genetic components affect disease in
humans, vaccines and drugs can be designed to combat particular
pathogens based on analysis of their particular molecular effect on the
human cell (2). 2. Immune System Enhancement In addition to enabling
more effective drug development, human genome literacy allows for a
better understanding of the immune system. Thus, genetic engineering can
be used to enhance human immune response to pathogens. As an example,
Dr. Ken Alibek is conducting cellular research in pursuit of protection
against the bioweapon anthrax (2). 3. Viral and Bacterial Genome
Literacy Decoding the genomes of viruses and bacteria will lead to
molecular explanations behind virulence and drug resistance. With this
information, bacteria can be engineered to produce bioregulators against
pathogens. For example, Xoma Corporation has patented a
bactericidal/permeability-increasing (BPI) protein, made from genes
inserted into bacterial DNA, which reverses the resistance
characteristic of particular bacteria against some popular antibiotics
(2). 4. Efficient Bio-Agent Detection and Identification Equipment
Because the capability of comparing genomes using DNA assays has already
been acquired, such technology may be developed to identify pathogens
using information from bacterial and viral genomes. Such a detector
could be used to identify the composition of bioweapons based on their
genomes, reducing present-day delays in resultant treatment and/or
preventive measures (2). 5. New Vaccines Current scientific research
projects involve genetic manipulation of viruses to create vaccines that
provide immunity against multiple diseases with a single treatment (2).
6. New Antibiotics and Antiviral Drugs Currently, antibiotic drugs
target DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and cell-wall synthesis
processes in bacterial cells. With an increased understanding of
microbial genomes, other proteins essential to bacterial viability can
be targeted to create new classes of antibiotics. Eventually,
broad-spectrum, rather than protein-specific, anti-microbial drugs may
be developed (2). Future of Warfare The revolution in molecular biology
and biotechnology can be considered as a potential Revolution of
Military Affairs (RMA)," states Colonel Michael Ainscough, MD, MPH (2).
According to Andrew Krepinevich, who originally coined the term
RMA, "**[technological advancement, incorporation of this new technology
into military systems, military operational advancement, and
organizational adaptation in a way that fundamentally alters the
character and conduct of conflict]{.underline}**" are the four
components that make up an RMA. For instance, the Gulf War has been
classified as the beginning of the space information warfare RMA. "From
the technological advances in biotechnology, biowarfare with genetically
engineered pathogens may constitute a future such RMA," says Ainscough
(2). In addition, the exponential increase in computational power
combined with the accessibility of genetic information and biological
tools to the general public and lack of governmental regulation raise
concerns about the threat of biowarfare arising from outside the
military (7). The US government has cited the [efforts of terrorist
networks, such as al Qaida, to recruit scientists capable of creating
bioweapons as a national security concern]{.underline} and "has urged
countries to be more open about their efforts to clamp down on the
threat of bioweapons" (5). Despite these efforts, biological research
that can potentially lead to bioweapon development is "far more
international, far more spread out, and far more diverse than nuclear
science \[...\] researchers communicate much more rapidly with one
another by means that no government can control \[...\] this was not
true in the nuclear era," according to David Kay, former chief U.S.
weapons inspector in Iraq (7). Kay is "extraordinarily pessimistic that
we \[the United States\] will take any of the necessary steps to avoid
the threat of bioweapons absent their first actual use" (7). "There are
those who say: '**[the First World War was chemical; the Second World
War was nuclear; and that [the Third World War]{.mark} -- God forbid --
[will be biological']{.mark}]{.underline}**" (2).

[Large-scale bioweapons programs]{.underline}, such as those run by
states, [pose a double threat]{.underline}: **[[there is always the
possibility of accidental release alongside the potential for malicious
use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Millett believes that these threats are
roughly equal, a conclusion backed by a thousand page report from
Gryphon Scientific, a US defense contractor. Historically, both
accidental release and malicious use of biological agents have caused
damage. In 1979, [there was the accidental release of aerosolized
anthrax from the]{.underline} Sverdlovsk bioweapons production facility
in the Soviet Union -- a clogged air filter in the facility had been
removed, but had not been replaced. Ninety-four people were affected by
the incident and at least 64 died, along with a number of livestock. The
Soviet secret police attempted a cover-up and it was not until years
later that the administration admitted the cause of the outbreak. More
recently, Millett says, [a US biodefense facility "failed to kill the
anthrax that it sent out for various lab trials, and ended up sending
out really nasty anthrax around the world]{.underline}." Though no one
was infected, a 2015 government investigation revealed that "over the
course of the last decade, 86 facilities in the United States and seven
other countries have received low concentrations of live spore
samples... thought to be completely inactivated." [These incidents
pale]{.underline}, however, [in comparison with Japan's intentional use
of bio]{.underline}logical [weapons during the 1930s and
40s]{.underline}. There is "a published history that suggests [[up to
30,000 people were killed]{.mark} in China]{.underline}
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} the Japanese [[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}logical
[[weapons program]{.underline}]{.mark} during the lead up to World War
II. And if that data is accurate, [[that is orders of magnitude bigger
than anything else]{.underline}]{.mark}," Millett says. Given the
[[near-impossibility of controlling the spread of
disease]{.underline},]{.mark} **[[a deliberate attack may have
accidental effects far beyond what was intended]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The Japanese, for example, may have meant to target only a few Chinese
villages, only to unwittingly trigger an epidemic. There are reports, in
fact, that thousands of Japan's own soldiers became infected during a
biological attack in 1941.Despite the 1972 ban on biological weapons
programs, Millett believes that many countries still have the capacity
to produce biological weapons. As an example, he explains that the
Soviets developed "a set of research and development tools that would
answer the key questions and give you all the key capabilities to make
biological weapons." [The BWC only bans offensive research]{.underline},
and "**[[underneath the umbrella of a defensive
program]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Millett says, "**[[you can do a whole
load of research and development to figure out what you would want to
weaponize]{.underline}]{.mark}** if you were going to make a weapon."
Then, all a country needs to start producing those weapons is "the
capacity to scale up production very, very quickly." The Soviets, for
example, built "a set of state-based commercial infrastructure to make
things like vaccines." On a day-to-day basis, they were making things
the Soviet Union needed. "But they could be very radically rebooted and
repurposed into production facilities for their biological weapons
program," Millett explains. This is [known as]{.underline} a "[breakout
program]{.underline}."Says Millett, "I believe there are many, many
countries that are well within the scope of a breakout program ... so
it's not that they necessarily at this second have a fully prepared and
worked-out biological weapons program that they can unleash on the world
tomorrow, but [they]{.underline} might well [have]{.underline} all of
the building blocks they need to do that in place, and **[a plan for how
to turn their existing infrastructure towards a weapons program if they
ever needed to]{.underline}**. These components would be permissible
under current international law."

[Developments such as]{.underline} [[CRISPR present new possibilities
for biowarfare]{.underline}]{.mark}, but biological weapons caused
concern long before the advent of gene editing. The first recorded use
of biological pathogens in warfare dates back to 600 BC, when Solon, an
Athenian statesman, poisoned enemy water supplies during the siege of
Krissa. Many centuries later, during the 1346 AD siege of Caffa, the
Mongol army catapulted plague-infested corpses into the city, which is
thought to have contributed to the 14th century Black Death pandemic
that wiped out up to two thirds of Europe's population. [Though
biological weapons were internationally banned by the 1925 Geneva
Convention]{.underline}, **[[state biowarfare
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}** continued and in many cases
**[[expanded]{.underline}]{.mark}** during World War II and the Cold
War. In 1972, as evidence of these violations mounted, 103 nations
signed a treaty known as the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The
treaty bans the creation of biological arsenals and outlaws offensive
biological research, though defensive research is permissible. Each
year, signatories are required to submit certain information about their
biological research programs to the United Nations, and violations
reported to the UN Security Council may result in an inspection. But
inspections can be vetoed by the permanent members of the Security
Council, and [[there are no firm guidelines for
enforcement]{.underline}]{.mark}. On top of this, [[the line that
separates permissible]{.underline}]{.mark} defensive [[biological
research from its]{.underline}]{.mark} offensive [[counterpart is murky
and remains a subject of controversy]{.underline}]{.mark}. And though
the actual numbers remain unknown, pathologist Dr. Riedel asserts that
"the number of state-sponsored programs has increased significantly
during the last 30 years."

**[financially and technically.]{.underline}** Much of the science is
available for free on the internet, giving anyone with an internet

successfully perform a genetic edit. Additionally, because CRISPR-Cas9
can be done in your kitchen, the operational footprint is quite small.
What's left is how any particular application of CRISPR-Cas9 could be
used as a weapon and what the potential is for mitigation. Scientists at
the National Academy of Sciences have sorted potential applications into
relative levels of concern. The top three concerns share one
particularly troubling characteristic; [they're the simplest
applications of genetic engineering technology]{.underline}**.** Making
existing bacteria more dangerous and altering organisms to produce
different biochemicals are common lab practices around the world today.
Recreating known viruses sounds difficult, but in 2002 scientists
successfully recreated the Polio virus from only the publicly available
genome and mail-order biomolecules. That experiment was conducted before
the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 and the method has only become easier in
the intervening years. Everything discussed up to this point is possible
today with limited resources and scientific know-how. Given more

are rapidly outpacing the ability to manage their consequences:
**"**[[Science is revealing the means to weaponize biology and chemistry

health infrastructure, collaborating with international partners, and
imposing reasonable restrictions on the sale of key biomolecules needs

second is engineering bacteria to make them more dangerous]{.underline},
which could be easily accomplished by inserting genes to confer
antibiotic resistance. "Capabilities to do either of those have been
around for a long time. They are only becoming more readily available,"
Imperiale says. The third major concern is engineering microbes to
produce and release toxic biochemicals. **"[The effects could resemble a
chemical weapon]{.underline}** or food poisoning**,"** says Patrick
Boyle, head of design at Ginkgo Bioworks and an author of the new
report. That scenario is particularly worrisome because it is
**[[unclear how long it would take scientists to detect that a
maliciously engineered microbe was at play rather than a natural

delivered something that has potential to be useful for policy-makers,"
because it prioritized potential threats, says Margaret E. Kosal, a
chemist by training and currently a professor of international affairs
at Georgia Institute of Technology, who reviewed a draft of the report.
"If everything is a problem, then nothing gets addressed," she says. The
report highlights one recently published scientific study outlining how
to construct a horsepox virus, a relative of smallpox thought to be
extinct in nature. Many biodefense experts, including Gregory Koblentz
of George Mason University, have warned that synthetic biology tools
could enable recreation of smallpox. "[[Safeguards against the misuse of
those tools are weak and fragmented]{.underline}]{.mark}," he says.
Currently, some synthetic biology companies choose to run their own
safeguards. Twist Bioscience uses computer programs to scan its DNA
orders, and James Diggans, director of bioinformatics and biosecurity,
says the company would have easily detected the horsepox DNA due to its
similarity to smallpox. "That would have triggered internal review,"
Diggans says. That virus is "not something we would be comfortable
manufacturing," he adds. Diggans, who also reviewed a draft of the
report, applauds the "balanced treatment of the incredibly positive
impact of synthetic biology and its risks." However, he thinks that
synthetic biology doesn't actually make building biological weapons
easier. Kosal concurs. "Making ineffective biological weapons is easy,"
she says. "Making effective biological weapons is not easy." ---RYAN

In September 2016, Jennifer [Doudna]{.underline} called a new colleague
named Kyle Watters to her office. By then, the University of California,
Berkeley, biochemist was famous as the coinventor of CRISPR. The
invention of the fast and versatile tool to edit genes had vaulted her
to global notoriety and to considerable wealth. She was the founder of
several startup companies and had collected millions in science-prize
money. [Ominously, though, as Doudna has recounted, she was haunted by a
dream in which Adolf Hitler appeared, holding a pen and paper,
requesting a copy of the CRISPR recipe. What horrible purpose could
Hitler have]{.underline}? Doudna, in her retellings of her dream, didn't
say. Now Doudna's question was, would Watters like to work on a way to
stop it? **[Stop CRISPR]{.underline}**. CRISPR is found inside bacteria.
It's a billion-year-old defense against marauding viruses that spots
their DNA and uses a scissors-like protein to chop it up. Doudna played
a key role in transforming the find into a revolutionary gene-editing
tool that's been taken up worldwide, propelling a wave of new research
and potential cures. But [[if scientists learn to deliver gene editors
inside people's bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[what's to stop
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** madman, **[[terrorist, or state from employing
CRISPR to cause harm]{.underline}]{.mark}**? People [[imagine
personalized attacks that]{.underline}]{.mark} would **[[strike only at
certain ethnic groups or super soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}** edited to
feel no pain. Doudna was well familiar with the dilemma. In her book A
Crack in Creation, she wrote that she feared gene editing could come to
the world's attention, as atomic power did, in a mushroom cloud. "Could
I and other concerned scientists save CRISPR from itself ... before a
cataclysm occurred?" Now she would have a chance. Earlier in 2016, the
US intelligence agencies had designated gene editing as a potential
weapon of mass destruction. That September, the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency ([DARPA]{.underline}) had [jumped
in]{.underline}, [putting out a call for new ways to control or reverse
the effects of gene-editing technology]{.underline}. The program, called
Safe Genes, would end up with a budget of more than \$65 million, making
it one of the largest sources of cash for CRISPR research, aside from
biotech startups developing new genetic treatments. One problem, as
DARPA saw it, was the **[[lack of any easy-to-use
countermeasure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [undo button, or
antidote]{.underline} **[[for CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [the
more powerful gene editing becomes, the more we might need
one]{.underline}---in case of a lab accident, or worse. As UC Berkeley
put it in a 2017 press release after Doudna, with Watters's help,
claimed part of the big DARPA contract, the university intended to build
tools to counter **[bioterrorism threats including "weapons employing
CRISPR itself]{.underline}**." CRISPR weapons? We'll leave it to your
imagination exactly what one could look like. What is safe to say,
though, is that DARPA has asked Doudna and others to start looking into
prophylactic treatments or even pills you could take to stop gene
editing, just the way you can swallow antibiotics if you've gotten an
anthrax letter in the mail. Scientists under Doudna's project say they
are set to begin initial tests on mice to see if the rodents can be made
immune to CRISPR editors. "Can we shut off CRISPR?" asks Joseph S.
Schoeniger, who leads one arm of the defense effort at Sandia National
Laboratories, in Livermore, California. "That is what we are looking at.
The basic concept is that this technology is coming along, \[so\]
wouldn't it be nice to have an 'off' switch."

Why should this be? [[In what other domain of social life do we treat
the violation of a prohibition as justification for abandoning that
prohibition? We do not accept thievery and murder simply because there
are always thieves and murderers in any society]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Why should we respond to what David Baltimore in his rebuke to He at the
Second International Summit described as "a failure of self-regulation
by the scientific community" by doubling down on self-regulation by the
scientific community (Statement of David Baltimore 2018)? Surely the
judgment of an individual scientist, an advisory committee or even a
whole professional community should not be privileged over a societal
commitment to democratic governance simply because scientists feel
constrained in their freedom to do what they want. Certainly it is
challenging to achieve a democratic and cosmopolitan bioethics
sufficient to govern a technology that "touches on the whole of
humanity" (Hurlbut et al. 2018; Feinstein et al. 2019). [[Surely this
means that we must redouble our efforts, not abandon
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. Far from casting aside the aspiration to
"broad societal consensus," we should see with clear eyes what happens
when scientists (and, thus, science) are left to decide for themselves
the future of humanity. He's hubristic project was an act of
appropriation and has rightly been condemned as such. But so too is the
move to substitute "broad scientific consensus on the responsible
pursuit of human genome editing research and clinical applications" for
"broad societal consensus" about our common future (Dzau, McNutt, and
Bai 2018; Organizing Committee for the International Summit on Human
Gene Editing 2015, emphasis added). One of the most startling features
of the He debacle is the sense of urgency to race ahead that it has
engendered in the upper echelons of international science. It is one
thing for a young, ambitious and reckless scientist operating at
"Shenzhen speed" to put the pedal to the floor (Kirksey 2020). When the
leaders of international science declare an "urgent need to accelerate
efforts," hitting the gas in hot pursuit of runaway science that they
themselves have branded as "rogue," they are recklessly committing to a
race of their own making (Dzau, McNutt and Bai 2018). [[Why not call a
halt instead]{.underline}]{.mark}? In fact, some have done just that,
calling for [[an explicit, international moratorium on creating
genome-edited babies]{.underline}]{.mark} for a defined period of time
(Lander et al 2019). It is extraordinary---and revealing---that this
apparently unobjectionable proposal has itself become a focus of
controversy. Opponents have argued that a de facto moratorium is already
in place, but object to making it explicit by using the term itself
(Begley 2019). The objection comes down to a preference for self-imposed
scientific limitation, so that the scientists who impose limits at one
moment are free to lift them in the next. David Baltimore has argued:
The important point is to be flexible going forward. That's what's wrong
with a moratorium. It's that the idea gets fixed in people's minds that
we're making firm statements about what we don't want to do and for how
long we don't want to do it. With a science that's moving forward as
rapidly as this science is, you want to be able to adapt to new
discoveries, new opportunities and new understandings. To make rules is
probably not a good idea. (Saey 2019) [[Yet setting a rule that clearly
prohibited HGGE]{.underline}]{.mark}---and threatening excommunication
from international science for violating it---[[is precisely what would
have restrained He and his boosters]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given this,
[[why not make firm statements about "what we don't want to
do"?]{.underline}]{.mark} Yet, setting rules for what should or should
not be done is not the remit of science alone. The question of whether
to proceed, particularly on a matter that touches upon such fundamental
dimensions of human life, belongs to all of us. There has not yet been a
serious effort to invite inclusive public deliberation, to say nothing
of anything resembling consensus. [[Why]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore,
[[should the default be to let research go forward]{.underline}]{.mark}?
The reason is that what is at stake for the opponents of the moratorium
proposal is not merely governance of genome editing, but scientific
freedom as such---the sovereign authority of science to self-regulate
and self-govern. As Baltimore explains: restricting gene editing "could
hold back the science" (Saey 2019). In other words, science should race
ahead, and ethics should lag behind---after all, "there's nothing like
actually moving ahead \[with research\] to teach us what the actual
pitfalls are" (Saey 2019). But [[surely He]{.underline}]{.mark} Jiankui
[[has already made it abundantly clear that the pitfall of blindly and
recklessly moving ahead is that one moves ahead blindly and
recklessly]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Value ethics first -- the negative arguments against a ban are an example of manufactured inevitability. Urgent need to protect absolutely.

[[This narrative should now be familiar: a new technology raises
"complex ethical]{.underline}]{.mark} and governance [[issues" yet also
"outpaces]{.underline}]{.mark}" responses to
[[them.]{.underline}]{.mark} The "scientific and medical communities"
who drive forward development of the technology claim the authority and
responsibility to respond, even as actions undertaken and encouraged by
members of those communities "outpace" their own efforts to address
those issues. [[Science first, ethics second]{.underline}]{.mark}. As we
have seen, [[this story is a self-fulfilling
prophesy]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is the story He told himself---and was
told by others---to justify his experiment. Yet He's experiment, driven
by others' predictions of inevitability, was then itself taken as proof
that HGGE is inevitable. [[This is manufactured
inevitability]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it is used to assert an
imperative of governance: science races ahead irrespective of whether
societal consensus is or is not achieved. [[Therefore governance must
cease the futile effort to sail against the winds of scientific and
technological change]{.underline}]{.mark}, shift course [[and catch up
by "thoughtfully crafting regulations of the technology without stifling
it]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Doudna 2019). The inevitable must be embraced
because it is unavoidable. [[But it is unavoidable because it is
embraced.]{.underline}]{.mark} In this vision of governance, catching up
means ceasing to ask whether science has given us a technological future
we wish to welcome or shun. It means acquiescing to what is (putatively)
inevitable and then mitigating its negative effects as best we can.
Governance---steering the ship---becomes on this view an ethically
attenuated effort to regain a modicum of control: reclaiming the helm
from a mutinous rogue who threatens the future of science, but
nevertheless following the course he charted---in effect, doing
responsibly what He did irresponsibly. "\[[[The He\] case highlights the
urgent need to accelerate efforts to reach international agreement upon
more specific criteria and standards that have to be met before human
germline editing would be deemed permissible]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Dzau, McNutt and Bai 2018).

#### Experts support a ban -- its narrowly tailored and still allows somatic engineering

ALICE **PARK** MARCH 13, **2019** 2:22 PM EDT Experts Are Calling for a
Ban on Gene Editing of Human Embryos. Here\'s Why They\'re Worried
https://time.com/5550654/crispr-gene-editing-human-embryos-ban/

The ban applies only to a select set of studies that involve genetic
changes to germline cells: studies that involve altering the genes in
eggs, sperm or embryos that would then be transferred for pregnancy.
[[The vast majority of genetic experts believe it's too early for any
technique]{.underline}]{.mark}, including CRISPR, [[to be used in this
way]{.underline}]{.mark}, because the safety of the technology hasn't
been established yet. Although CRISPR, for example, gives scientists the
most precise molecular scissors possible to snip human DNA exactly where
disease-causing genes or mutations might reside --- or to even replace
portions of the genome with healthy DNA --- studies in animals and cells
in a lab dish show that [[sometimes the scissors splice where they
aren't supposed to. It's also not clear what effect manipulating the
human genome]{.underline}]{.mark} by removing or replacing fragments of
DNA [[might have on people's health]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[now, or
for future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}. The moratorium calls for
researchers and nations to suspend studies on human gene editing of
eggs, sperm and embryos for about five years, and during that time, for
countries agreeing to the ban to encourage societal discussion about how
its citizens would like to see such work proceed. If a nation decided it
was ready to begin conducting such studies again, it would share its
plans with the international community, preferably two years ahead of
time, so additional discussions could ensure that safety and ethical
issues had been addressed. [[The moratorium does not apply to research
on]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[somatic cells]{.underline}]{.mark},
or any other cell except the egg and sperm that are involved in
reproduction. Somatic cells, such as blood and skin, are not passed on
to the next generation, so any genetic changes made to a person's own
genome in these cells are not inherited. Promising studies involving
gene editing to treat sickle cell, for example, won't be affected by the
ban. "Those clinical trials should not in any way be impeded by this,"
says Collins. "[[The only focus on the moratorium is on embryos and
germline manipulation with the intent to implant that embryo in the
mother's womb. It's a very narrow prohibition]{.underline}]{.mark}. All
the rest of the applications of gene editing should not only go forward,
but should go forward vigorously and with great energy."

#### Scientists and ethicists approve of a ban and say it will foster societal consensus

To begin with, [[there should be a fixed period during which **no
clinical uses of germline editing whatsoever are allowed**.]{.mark} [As
well as **allowing for discussions** about the technical,
scientific]{.mark}, medical, societal, ethical [and moral issues]{.mark}
that must be considered before germline editing is permitted, [this
period would provide time to establish an international
framework]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thereafter, nations may choose to follow
separate paths. About 30 nations currently have legislation that
directly or indirectly bars all clinical uses of germline
editing[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00726-5#ref-CR1),
and they might choose to continue the moratorium indefinitely or
implement a permanent ban. However[, [any]{.mark} [nation could]{.mark}
also choose to [allow]{.mark} specific [applications]{.mark} of germline
editing, [provided that it first: gives **public notice** of its
intention to consider the application and engages for a defined period
in international consultation]{.mark} about the wisdom of doing so;
[determines]{.mark} through transparent evaluation that [the application
is justified]{.mark}; and **[ascertains that there is broad societal
consensus]{.mark}** in the nation about the appropriateness of the
application]{.underline}. Nations might well choose different paths, but
they would agree to proceed openly and with due respect to the opinions
of humankind on an issue that will ultimately affect the entire species.
To be clear, [[our proposed moratorium **does not** apply to]{.mark}
germline editing for [research uses]{.mark}, [provided that these
studies do not involve]{.mark} the [transfer of an embryo to a person's
uterus]{.mark}. It also does not apply to genome editing in human
somatic]{.underline} (non-reproductive) [cells to treat
diseases]{.underline}, for which patients can provide informed consent
and the DNA modifications are not heritable. [[The 18 signatories of
this call include **scientists and ethicists who are citizens of 7
countries**]{.mark}. Many of us have been involved in the gene-editing
field by developing and applying the technology, organizing and speaking
at international summits]{.underline}, serving on national advisory
committees and studying the ethical issues raised.

#### International cooperation allows ban to be successful

L. Sophie **Gullino** January **2022** Human genome editing: unlimited
potential or ethical
concern?https://oxsci.org/human-genome-editing-unlimited-potential-or-ethical-concern/

As [[human gene editing has global public health
implications]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[international cooperation
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[essential to provide oversight. This can
involve international agreements, institutions and bodies that can be
developed following international discussion of the different views on
gene editing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Notably, not all countries have
committed the necessary resources to ensure appropriate and effective
regulations of this technology. This introduces the risk of so-called
"ethics dumping" which refers to scientists from strictly regulated
countries purposefully choosing to conduct research in countries that
lack the relevant domestic policy or oversight. [[This issue should
clearly be addressed and international agencies are aiming to assist
countries to create a regulatory framework which prevent the unethical
use of this technology]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Alternatives solve

#### Other successful ways to deal with genetic diseases besides germline editing

I truthfully don\'t think that human genetic engineering offers us much
in the way of benefit. [[If people are worried about genetic disease, we
can already deal with that through preimplantation genetic
diagnosis]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is used in fertility clinics
around the world. [[It lets you make sure your child doesn\'t have a
genetic disease,]{.underline}]{.mark} but it doesn\'t let you improve
your child[[. So]{.underline}]{.mark} I don\'t think the benefits \[of
human germline genetic engineering\] are very high, and [[the potential
cost]{.underline}]{.mark}---in terms of meaning---[[is
enormous.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Part of the objection to GEHR is that [[for all the possible outcomes
that GEHR]{.mark} [may be expected to deliver, there are
existing]{.mark}]{.underline} reproductive
[[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} for securing these outcomes. If this
is the case, [and these]{.mark} established procedures [do not entail
the same risks]{.mark} or uncertainties that GEHR does, then introducing
GEHR could not be a proportionate means to achieve the desired outcome.
What is this outcome? In most discussions of GEHR, this outcome is
usually assumed to be the birth of a child with at least two preferred
characteristics. The first is implicitly (although often only
implicitly) the presence of a direct genetic link to both the
prospective parents, which is achieved through the combining of their
individual genomes, as happens in unassisted sexual reproduction. The
second characteristic is the presence (or absence) of at least one other
genetically conditioned feature that the combination of those genomes
makes it unlikely (or likely) that any resulting child will inherit.
Such a characteristic might be the absence of a serious disease that has
been diagnosed in the prospective parents, like cystic fibrosis. Disease
traits of this kind are usually assumed to be good candidates for the
second characteristic. In such cases, however, [[GEHR is unlikely to be
the only intervention available. There are reproductive technologies
that involve the donation of sperm or eggs from third-party
donors]{.underline}]{.mark}, thereby simply circumventing the genetic
endowment from one parent. Since, however, these children would lack the
first preferred characteristic (genetic relatedness), [[other approaches
are also widely available]{.underline}]{.mark} in many (though not all)
parts of the world. [[They involve genetic testing]{.underline}]{.mark}
to select embryos for transfer (preimplantation genetic testing, or
[[PGT) or]{.underline}]{.mark} to select pregnancies to carry to term
([[prenatal testing]{.underline}]{.mark} and termination of pregnancy,
PNT/ToP).

### Not safe

#### We can't identify correct genetic changes to make -- regardless of advances in CRISPR technology. 

Gregory E. **Kaebnick **is a research scholar at The Hastings Center and
the editor of theHastings Center Report. A Moratorium on Gene Editing?
March 27 **2015**
https://www.thehastingscenter.org/a-moratorium-on-gene-editing/

The second problem [[-- identifying the correct genetic changes -- is
the real issue]{.underline}]{.mark}, though, [[and CRISPR/Cas9 doesn't
even address this problem.]{.underline}]{.mark} In fact, [[no gene
editing tool can solve]{.underline}]{.mark} the second problem, [[any
more than a word processing tool can by itself solve the problem of how
to write the next great American novel]{.underline}]{.mark}. To identify
the "correct" genetic changes, we need to understand what the targeted
gene does, but also how it interacts with other genes, and also how the
genome interacts with environments. [[We're not
there]{.underline}]{.mark}. As David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate and a
member of one of the groups calling for a moratorium, told the Times,"I
personally think [[we are just not smart enough]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[[and won't be for a very long time]{.underline}]{.mark} --- to feel
comfortable about the consequences." This is the second and bigger
reason that the moratorium is a good idea.

#### Scientific experts concede that germline gene editing is not safe or effective enough for use. Serious risk of introducing unintended mutations.

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00726-5

[[For germline editing to even be considered for a clinical application,
its safety and efficacy must be sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
taking into account the unmet medical need, the risks and potential
benefits and the existence of alternative approaches. Although
techniques have improved in the past several years, [[germline editing
is not yet safe or effective enough to justify any
use]{.underline}]{.mark} in the clinic. As was evident at the second
summit[[, there is wide agreement in the scientific community that, for
clinical germline editing, the risk of failing to make the desired
change or of introducing unintended mutations]{.underline}]{.mark}
(off-target effects) is still unacceptably high. Considerable research
is being directed at this issue.

#### Germline gene editing is not effective -- and can result in dangerous mutations.

T.Scholes, YvonneBombard, Lawrence C.Brody, W. AndrewFaucett, Nanibaa'

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929717302471

Regardless of whether it entails somatic or [[germline genome
editing]{.underline}]{.mark}, its efficacy and safety must be
established before any consideration is given to a genome-editing method
as a potential therapeutic approach. CRISPR/Cas9 is indeed highly
efficient in many cell types, but it [[is seldom 100% effective at
introducing alterations at a target site]{.underline}]{.mark}, although
double-digit percentages are routine. [[More concerning is that the
desired "editing" event usually competes with the generation of unwanted
mutations at the target site. Thus, genome-editing applications usually
generate a mixture of genetically heterogeneous
cells]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Editing isn't safe -- too many interactions and genomes we know nothing about.

Scott J. **Schweikart**, Global Regulation of Germline Genome Editing:

Law, 43 Loy. L.A. Int\'l & Comp. L. Rev. 279 (**2021**). Available at:
https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/ilr/vol43/iss3/6

Additionally[[, there is a significant level of uncertainty about the
safety and potential consequences of germline genome
editing]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance[[, it is uncertain "whether
current knowledge of human genes, genomes, and genetic variation and the
interactions between genes and the environment is sufficient to enable
heritable genome editing to be performed safely]{.underline}]{.mark}."28

### NATO says yes

#### NATO can effectively influence norm setting in emerging technology.

December **2021**
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/12/16/why-our-values-should-drive-our-technology-choices/index.html

Within this broadly applicable framing, [[NATO's role is specific. As
the international organisation committed to defence and security in the
North Atlantic area, it convenes considerable political, military,
economic, and technological power]{.underline}]{.mark}. Building in
particular on its political and intellectual capital[[, the Alliance can
credibly spearhead norm setting for technology applications in defence
to comply with Western values.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Strong international frameworks can resolve previous failures of self regulation.

https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4899&context=ndlr

[[The failure of]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[self-regulation is perhaps
a consequence of the fact that there is not currently a stronger
international regulatory framework or set of principles
guiding]{.underline}]{.mark} this subject. There is scant consensus on
how to regulate and what to allow, and this is largely because despite
the potential benefits of germline editing, the field is rife with
controversy surrounding the "safety concerns, unprecedented informed
consent, challenges to human dignity, and the potential for permanent
negative impact on future generations, including its abuse for eugenics
or enhancement (the parental pursuit of specific traits for non-medical
reasons)."11 [[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[a general
consensus that no clinical applications should proceed until there is
"broad societal consensus" involving the opinions of all social
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps [[on a global
scale]{.underline}]{.mark}.12

#### Now is a critical time to build a stronger alliance with NATO

Paul **Belkin** Analyst in European Affairs
<https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/R46066.pdf> NATO: Key Issues for the 117th
Congress Updated June 3, **2021**

Throughout the course of the Trump Administration, Secretary General
Stoltenberg stressed that disagreement among allies is not a new
phenomenon and underscored that [["Europe and North American are doing
more together in NATO today than we have for
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}." 31 More recently, however, Stoltenberg
has acknowledged that [[differences between Europe and the United States
have raised "serious questions about the strength of our alliance on
both sides of the Atlantic" and has pointed to the coming years as a
"historic opportunity to build a stronger alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
To regain trust, and reinforce our unity. [[Europe and North America
working together in NATO, in strategic solidarity."]{.underline}]{.mark}
32 When allied leaders met in London in 2019, they agreed to initiate a
"forward-looking reflection process ... to further strengthen NATO's
political dimension including consultation." 33 Secretary General
Stoltenberg has since launched the NATO 2030 Initiative to develop
proposals to make sure "NATO remains strong militarily, becomes even
stronger politically and takes a more global approach." 34 Stoltenberg
plans to present his proposals to allied heads of state and government
at the June 2021 NATO summit. He says [[his recommendations will focus
on the following three areas: • Reinforcing unity by increasing common
funding for deterrence and the defense of NATO
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}, agreeing to political consultations on
all issues affecting member states' security, and updating NATO's
Strategic Concept---last updated in 2010---to "chart a common course
going forward;" • [[Broadening NATO's approach to security beyond the
military sphere to include societal resilience]{.underline}]{.mark},
increasing collective investments to maintain NATO's technological edge
and interoperability, and addressing the security impact of climate
change; [[and • Defending the rules-based international
order]{.underline}]{.mark}, and countering China's and Russia's
challenges to this order, by strengthening NATO's commitment to
democratic values and enhancing its relationships with like-minded
partners across the globe.35

[An [Information Day]{.mark} took place in Zagreb]{.underline} on Friday
(8 April 2022[), [marking the important achievements accomplished by
Croatia in the framework of the **NATO Science** for Peace and
Security]{.mark} (SPS) [Programme]{.mark}. Scientists, [experts]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} government [rep]{.mark}resentative[s]{.mark} [met to take
stock]{.mark} of the results of civil scientific
cooperation]{.underline} attained amongst Croatia, NATO Allies,
[and]{.mark} partner countries. [They also [share]{.mark}d [views
on]{.mark} the [prospects for potential new]{.mark} activities in
[security-related science and technological innovation]{.mark}, in line
with Croatias research priorities. Over [60 participants
attended]{.mark} the event, which was jointly [organized by the **NATO
Science** for Peace and Security Programme, the Croatian Ministry of
Foreign and European Affairs]{.mark},]{.underline} the Permanent
Delegation of Croatia to NATO, and the University of Zagreb. It was also
streamed online to link up several other universities in the country,
including in Dubrovnik, Osijek and Split. At the official opening, NATO
Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges, David van
Weel, stated: The Science for Peace and Security Programme is a central
component of NATOs science and technology ecosystem, and it has been for
over 60 years. During this time, it has helped to demonstrate NATOs
commitment to scientific and technological advancement. Representing the
host country, [State Secretary Frano Matui]{.underline} highlighted
Croatia\'s participation in 78 SPS projects in collaboration with Allies
and partners from around the globe. He also [[stres]{.mark}sed [the
importance of this Information Day to strengthen and expand future
cooperation]{.mark}. At the margins of the event, [Croatian research
teams displayed]{.mark} various [prototypes developed with support
from]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} Science for Peace and Security Programme,
[demonstrating]{.mark} their [ability]{.mark} to address a wide range of

such as the development and deployment of the Next-generation Incident
Command System (NICS),]{.underline} a web-based command and control
software that facilitates collaboration among first responders during
natural and man-made disasters. Experts from Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Montenegro, Croatia, and North Macedonia, as well as the United States,
worked together to implement and test this platform across the region,
putting it to use in a variety of crisis scenarios. [[Research and
development activities supported by the **NATO Science** for Peace and

Cut By: m.jam

[[The Oviedo Convention]{.underline}]{.mark} (Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to
the Application of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Rights and
Biomedicine) was formulated in 1997 by the Council of Europe. The
Convention is the first convention in international law that has a
particular focus on protecting the rights of individuals in connection
with biomedical treatment and research. The Convention aims to ensure
that scientific and medical advances are not at the expense of human
rights.

[Read the complete Oviedo Convention at the Council of Europe\'s
website](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/164)

See also: [Additional Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights and
Biomedicine, concerning Biomedical
Research](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/195)

The Convention [[was]{.mark} [signed by Norway in 1997, and]{.mark} was
[ratified on 13 October 2006]{.mark}. The Council of Europe has adopted
several additional protocols]{.underline} to the Oviedo Convention. [The
most recent additional protocol [deals]{.mark} specifically [with issues
related to genetic testing]{.mark}]{.underline}. This protocol was
adopted in Strasbourg on 27 November 2008 and is now awaiting
ratification in different countries. Additional protocols are also
binding in Norway.

[[A total of 47 European countries have ratified the Convention and
thereby undertaken to adhere to the provisions therein. Five other
states outside Europe have also adopted the
Convention.]{.mark}\]{.underline}
The Convention covers the rights of research subjects and the duties of
researchers. Medical and health research must be based on respect for
the participants\' dignity and human rights. Consideration for the
participants\' safety, privacy and welfare must take precedence over the
interests of science and society.

Expected benefits for participants and society must be proportionate to
potential drawbacks. Research on humans can only be conducted when there
are no alternative methods that are equally effective.\
[The Convention also sets requirements for the quality of research,
which must meet generally accepted criteria for scientific quality and
be carried out by qualified personnel.]{.underline}

[[The Convention consists of 14 chapters]{.underline}]{.mark} and 38
articles. Some chapters are general and deal with the scope and purpose
of the Convention. Chapter 2 focuses on consent, both ordinary informed
consent and consent when the person does not have the capacity to
consent. Chapter 3 deals with privacy and the right to information[.
[Themes related to the human genome can be found in chapter
4.]{.mark}]{.underline} Research is specifically discussed in chapter 5.
Chapter 6 of the Convention addresses issues related to organs and
tissue taken from a donor for transplantation. Chapter 7 covers the
prohibition of financial gain from the human body or parts thereof.

Several chapters of the Ministry of Health and Care Services\'
report [NOU 2005: 1 God forskning -- bedre

research - better health) refer to the Convention. The Oviedo Convention
is also incorporated into the Act on medical and health research
(Helseforskningsloven), which is concerned with research that involves
humans, human biological material and personal health data.

#### The Oviedo Convention prevents EU member states from engaging in germline editing

North Carolina Central University Science & Intellectual Property Law
Review: Vol. 12 : Iss. 1 , Article 2. Available at:
https://archives.law.nccu.edu/siplr/vol12/iss1/2

[[The Oviedo Convention of the EU has a]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[definitive answer]{.underline}]{.mark} for our purposes.106 Through
Article 13, [[it specifies that an intervention "seeking to modify the
human genome may only be undertaken for preventive, diagnostic or
therapeutic purposes and only if its aim is not to introduce any
modification in the genome of any descendants]{.underline}]{.mark}."107
Accordingly, [[it makes clear that EU member states may not lawfully
engage in human enhancement]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nonetheless, since the
distinction between therapy and enhancement is open to debate, EU states
may enhance their citizens under the guise of therapy. For instance,
soldiers or athletes may receive treatment to make them run faster or
carry oxygen to better treat "fatigue" or "exhaustion."

relatively [[unusual in the international
community]{.underline}]{.mark}, where there are official prohibitions on
human germline editing in many countries, including ones that allow
human embryonic stem cell research.79 That said, germline editing does
not exactly have a clear path forward in the current U.S. regulatory and
political climate. [[Current genome-editing protocols and clinical
trials in the United States do not have their own regulatory framework
and have instead been "absorbed into the preexisting U.S. regulatory
framework for gene therapy,]{.underline}]{.mark} whose overview is
largely derived from gene transfer studies"80---despite the fact that
germline editing, while involving similar technologies and techniques,
has vastly different consequences and implications

## Answers to: 

### A2 Politics

#### Congress has consistently approved blocks on human gene editing technology -- demonstrating their support for a ban.

Walter G. **Johnson and** Diana M. **Bowman** April 22, **2022** It's
time for Congress to stop blocking mitochondrial replacement therapy
https://www.statnews.com/2022/04/22/congress-allow-mitochondrial-replacement-more-forward/

[[Lawmakers have done this by including a rider in laws that fund the
FDA each year]{.underline}]{.mark}. These [budget
bills](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/text)
say that [[the FDA cannot use any of its funding to review an
application to start clinical trials on "a drug or biological product
... in research in which a human embryo is intentionally created or
modified to include a heritable genetic
modification]{.underline}]{.mark}." The rider was [initially
added](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2601488) in
2015, but there was no public discussion at the time about the effects
the rider would have on mitochondrial replacement. [[While the rider was
likely originally intended to block gene editing of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[DNA with tools like
CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [FDA has
interpreted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0477-4) the ban
to apply to mitochondrial replacement as well, even though no nuclear
DNA is edited.

#### Congress clearly supports functional bans on human germline genetic engineering.

Also [[in the USA]{.underline}]{.mark}, the most prolific country with
regard to basic genome editing research,[41](javascript:;) [[several
legal limits to HGGE are in place]{.underline}]{.mark}. These limits are
part of what has been called 'a complex regulatory and statutory web
concerned with human embryo research in general and human germline
modification in particular.'[42](javascript:;) Although HGGE is not
formally prohibited, currently [[several
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}, taken together, [[practically impede
the clinical introduction of this technology]{.underline}]{.mark}.
First, the National Institutes of Health, which is responsible for
research funding in the USA, has stated that it 'will not fund any use
of gene-editing technologies in human
embryos'.[43](javascript:;) Second, the US Food and Drug Administration,
which has the authority to regulate products and drugs involving gene
editing, including human gene editing, has so far stood in the way of
using HGGE for reproductive purposes and is also not likely to change
its policy in the near future. [[Since December 2015, US Congress has
regularly added an amendment to the FDA's funding
bill,]{.underline}]{.mark} a so-called 'bill rider', [[making it
impossible for the FDA to consider any application which involves
'research in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified
to include a heritable genetic modification'.[44](javascript:;) Without
the FDA's approval, implantation of a genetically modified human embryo
is illegal in the USA]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, genetically
modifying human embryos for research purposes are permitted, even though
such experiments remain ineligible for public funding.[45](javascript:;)

#### Congress supports scientific challenges to germline genetic engineering

BY REP. BILL **FOSTER**, PH.D. (D-ILL.) - 07/09/**15** 8:00 AM ET Last
scientist in Congress warns on human genetic engineering
https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/247221-last-scientist-in-congress-warns-on-human-genetic-engineering/

[[It is rare that prominent members of the scientific community come
together to warn our leaders of technological breakthroughs
that]{.underline}]{.mark} our legal system and [[society are not
prepared for. As the last Ph.D. scientist remaining in Congress, I feel
a responsibility to transmit those concerns to my
colleagues]{.underline}]{.mark} and to the public. [[The breakthrough in
question relates to human genetic engineering]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
has long been a theoretical possibility assumed to be decades away from
practicality. In the last several years this has changed significantly,
due to recent breakthroughs that allow inexpensive and precise editing
of chromosomal DNA. The technological potential has been amplified by
the widespread adoption of in vitro fertilization, the rapid decline in
the cost of genome sequencing, increasing use of Big Data to understand
the relationship between genetic variations and behavior, as well as the
rapid spread of these technologies throughout the world. It's time for
leaders in government to take notice. The ability to modify DNA has been
around for decades, but until recently it was expensive, time consuming,
and required a very high level of technical skill. That has changed
significantly in the last few years with the development of new gene
editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9, introduced by Dr. Jennifer Doudna and
others. These tools have been rapidly adopted by researchers around the
world. These tools are revolutionary because they enable any researcher
with basic capabilities in molecular biology to edit genomes. Therein
lies the promise and the danger. Anyone with \$300 and Internet access
can now buy their own CRISPR kit to begin primitive genome editing of
plants and animals. It works like an old-fashioned film reel, where a
director can cut apart a film, take frames out, and fill them in with
something new. Already, this tool is in daily use in laboratories around
the world, editing DNA to produce genetically customized versions of
organisms from cell cultures to insects, plants, mice, and monkeys.
There is the possibility of great benefit from these new technologies.
Animal models with specific genetic variations are being created to
greatly accelerate research to determine the links between genetics and
disease. In agriculture, it has the potential to vastly accelerate our
ability to develop more productive crops, better biofuels, and favorable
animal characteristics like high growth rates and stronger immune
systems to reduce the need for antibiotics. However, environmental risks
are also amplified. Yet what really makes this tool revolutionary is
what it could mean for humans. Many of the potential applications of
this technology are likely to be non-controversial: for example,
replacing the bone marrow of someone suffering from a sickle-cell
disease with a modified version of their own marrow, but with the
genetic defect removed. Genetic modifications of this kind will only
carry risks to a single person and not affect future generations.
However, [[if genetic modifications are made to "germline"
cells]{.underline}]{.mark} -- sperm, eggs, and embryos -- these
modifications will also be carried forward to future generations. [[This
will fundamentally change the course of human evolution, and is
something that ethicists have been concerned about for
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although none of these tools have yet
demonstrated the reliability necessary for safe clinical modification of
the human germline, the rate of technological progress is such that it
is prudent to begin thinking through the implications. Many in the
scientific community believe [[there are critical ethical, legal, and
safety questions that must be answered before this research
advances]{.underline}]{.mark}. Earlier this year, many of [[the most
respected scientists in the field]{.underline}]{.mark} published a
letter [[call]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[for a moratorium on human
germline modification for clinical applications,]{.underline}]{.mark}
warning that "there is an urgent need for open discussion of the merits
and risks of human genome modification."

#### Congress refuses to support funding for clinical applications of human germline gene editing.

Tanya **Lewis** Dec 16, 2015, 1:45 PM Congress just put a massive
roadblock in the way of genetically editing human embryos
https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-bans-funding-for-embryo-gene-editing-2015-12

Congressional Republicans proposed a spending deal late Tuesday night to
fund the government through 2016, and it places new restrictions on the
use of federal funding for gene editing, Politico reported. The House
and Senate are expected to pass the legislation soon. Obama will have to
sign the bill or face the prospect of a government shut down.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} \$1.1 trillion Omnibus [[Spending Bill
contains a provision that outlaws the use of federal money for research
that involves genetically modifying human embryos]{.underline}]{.mark},
a topic of intense debate. [[The technology]{.underline}]{.mark} in
question, [[known as CRISPR/Cas9,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[allows
scientists to precisely and easily tweak the genomes of any
organism]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has already been used by Chinese
scientists to modify human embryos, though not ones that were capable of
surviving until birth. Specifically, [[the bill specifies that none of
the funding be used for clinical research \"in which a human embryo is
intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic
modification.]{.underline}]{.mark}\"

https://www.thehastingscenter.org/a-moratorium-on-gene-editing/

[[CRISPR/Cas9 can be turned to many other uses than editing the human
germline]{.underline}]{.mark}, however. One of the most extraordinary is
[[the possibility of]{.underline}]{.mark} using it in "[[gene drives"
that could be make genetic modifications to sexually reproducing
populations of microorganisms, animals, or plants]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Sexually reproducing organisms have two sets of gene---one from each
parent. [[A gene drive is a set of genes that, if it is inserted into
one set, will get itself copied to the appropriate location on the other
set, replacing any competing genes and also ensuring that all of the
organism's offspring receive the drive.]{.underline}]{.mark} Within
those offspring, the drive will again replace any competing genes,
ensuring that all of the next generation receives the gene. If a species
reproduces rapidly, it might be possible to quickly alter the whole
species. Mosquitoes could be altered so that they can no longer transmit
malaria or dengue, for example.

[[The project of "consciously perfecting" human life begins with the
misguided]{.underline}]{.mark} but well-meaning [[step of seeking to
repair human beings that have been marked as lessor, inferior, or
defectiv]{.underline}]{.mark}e. For He's would-be parents, the defect
lay not in their future children's DNA, but in a society that sorts,
classifies, and seek to correct---or discard---those who do not measure
up. No society is free of such defects. [[Yet acquiescing to
them---editing children to compensate for the deficiencies of the
societies into which they will be born---will amount to nothing less
than affirming those deficiencies]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Developing and
deploying HGGE in the name of some unjustifiable notion of "medical
necessity" amounts to setting this technology free to be
used]{.underline}]{.mark} for genetic fixes for social
problems---"cur\[ing\] prejudice"---of whatever sort the market will
sustain. And the market that He imagined is vast. Liberating the
technology in this way would deny the vast majority of the human
community the freedom to ask whether we want it at all. If there is even
a small possibility that developing heritable human genome editing could
contribute to such a future (and as the He case makes clear, that
possibility is far from remote), humanity has a duty to carefully
contend with the question of how to guide and govern this technology.
This entails asking not only what should be done, but how we should
understand what is at stake: what questions need to be asked but are
going unasked, how the terms of debate are being set, by whom, and with
what consequences for which cultural, J. Benjamin Hurlbut 192
Perspectives in Biology and Medicine moral, and spiritual vocabularies
can contribute to steering the ship. And yet the imperatives of
governance that have guided debate thus far have taken us far off
course. [[Unless we correct, the ways of thinking and speaking that this
essay has examined will continue to drive the direction of
technology---encouraging and justifying irresponsible science,
sidelining serious ethical reflection, constraining democratic
governance, and inhibiting deliberation that draws upon the wealth of
tradition, experience and moral imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}. As we
navigate into the uncharted waters of our technological future, we would
do well to recall, with restraint and humility, that we are an imperfect
species. [[The aspiration to heal the infirmities of our mortal lives,
no matter how virtuous, is endlessly vulnerable to that all-too-human
impulse to redeem ourselves though mastery of nature and
sel]{.underline}]{.mark}f. It is but a short step from the desire to
repair what is imperfect to the impulse to perfect. And one need not
look long to see that the will to perfectibility is also a will to
power--- to render fragile and vulnerable human life an object of
manipulation and control. Beneath a hunger for prestige and a belief in
the virtue and righteousness of his project, He Jiankui was also driven
by the thrill of it: the reckless speed, the heroic transgression, the
wielding of an unprecedented and seemingly righteous power over the
fragility of human life. So too were his aiders and abettors, members of
a guild that wields ever-increasing powers over life. They encouraged He
not in the name of healing the sick, but in the name of an imagined
right---and righteousness---of radical scientific freedom to ordain the
lives we shall have and the purposes for which we shall live. J. Robert
[[Oppenheimer described this ethos more than half a century ago: "When
you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do
it,]{.underline}]{.mark} and you argue about what to do about it only
after you have had your technical success" (US Atomic Energy Commission
1954). [[The sweet successes of the nuclear age threatened to extinguish
civilization itself. Biology's emerging powers over the stuff of life,
though far more subtle, are no less threatening to human integrity. It
is at our peril that we the people cede the authority to guide and
govern our common future to those who would mistake the sweetness of
their own success for progress]{.underline}]{.mark}

I truthfully don\'t think that human genetic engineering offers us much
in the way of benefit. [[If people are worried about genetic disease, we
can already deal with that through preimplantation genetic
diagnosis]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is used in fertility clinics
around the world. [[It lets you make sure your child doesn\'t have a

enormous.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**The "medical necessity" argument is a farce -- the cases are
vanishingly rare**

/nfs

And yet, for all the summits, advisory reports, and deliberations, there
has been remarkably little direct engagement with what strikes me as the
most fundamental question of governance: [[What is this technology for?
This question has mostly been approached as a challenge to come up with
scenarios in which]{.underline}]{.mark} embryo [[editing is "medically
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}" because it is the only means through
which someone could have a healthy, genetically related child. [[Such
cases are vanishingly rare.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Nuffield Council
(2018) consulted with [[a number of genetic
counselors]{.underline}]{.mark}, who [[reported never having encountered
such a case in what amounted to hundreds of years of combined clinical
experience]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet regardless of how vanishingly rare
candidate cases may be, searching for them amounts to a search for
justification, not an inquiry into the technology's purpose. The
designer's intentions do not determine what a technology is for --- that
is, the reasons it will be used and the uses it will be put to. To
understand what a technology is for one must inquire into the ways it is
likely to be incorporated into people's lives and societies, looking to
the ends it might be made to serve, and the senses of desire,
obligation, or need that usher it in. Once again, the He case offers
insight---and a powerful warning.

#### We can't identify correct genetic changes to make -- regardless of advances in CRISPR technology.

The second problem [[-- identifying the correct genetic changes -- is
the real issue]{.underline}]{.mark}, though, [[and CRISPR/Cas9 doesn't
even address this problem.]{.underline}]{.mark} In fact, [[no gene
editing tool can solve]{.underline}]{.mark} the second problem, [[any
more than a word processing tool can by itself solve the problem of how
to write the next great American novel]{.underline}]{.mark}. To identify
the "correct" genetic changes, we need to understand what the targeted
gene does, but also how it interacts with other genes, and also how the
genome interacts with environments. [[We're not
there]{.underline}]{.mark}. As David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate and a
member of one of the groups calling for a moratorium, told the Times,"I
personally think [[we are just not smart enough]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[[and won't be for a very long time]{.underline}]{.mark} --- to feel
comfortable about the consequences." This is the second and bigger
reason that the moratorium is a good idea.

### A2 Germline Leadership Turn

#### Plan allows NATO to reinvent itself in ways that act as a liberal bulwark against Russia and China

Resilience Right to Withstand Russia and China
https://www.lawfareblog.com/nato-must-get-resilience-right-withstand-russia-and-china

[[NATO is at arguably the most important juncture
in]{.underline}]{.mark} its post-Cold War [[history. NATO must
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark} not only its military preparedness but also
[[its approach to the nonmilitary]{.underline}]{.mark}---and
specifically illiberal---[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} that Russia
and China pose to its resilience and cohesion. To advance their
geopolitical interests, [[Russia and China exploited the openness of
society in NATO allies and the divisions between them over the past
decade]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO must always be wary of external
challenges that could undermine its unity. This was true during the Cold
War in the face of an ideological rival seeking to undermine confidence
in Western democratic governments, and it remains true in the face of
Russia and China today. Conversely, NATO needs to navigate its
adaptation to its illiberal challenge while avoiding functional
over-extension. The alliance is at [risk of
maladaptation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2020.1799786),
whereby it extends its own activities unnecessarily into civilian areas
of security in which it lacks necessary expertise and legacy. Strong

importance to collective defense. An [influential

#### US affirmation of shared NATO principles is an historic opportunity to develop a cohesive relationship on multiple issues -- including emerging tech, climate change, and China.

[[The first pillar is to regain trust and reaffirm the unbreakable
security and defence ties within NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The reason
behind this is strategic]{.underline}]{.mark} - the Biden administration
correctly regards the North Atlantic alliance as [[a key tool in
confronting and containing aggressive Russian behaviour and Chinese
influence.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Alliance is already undergoing a
detailed self-reflection process, i.e. NATO 2030, after which Secretary
General Stoltenberg will propose that allies develop a new NATO
Strategic Concept in early 2021. [[This represents an opportunity for
the US to exercise more prominent NATO leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}
right from the start of the new administration. The upcoming 2021 NATO
Summit will open diplomatic doors to allow for symbolic gestures of
reaffirmation of the American commitment to European security. [[It will
equally be a useful framework for substantive discussions about the
future direction of the Alliance on emerging
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[climate change,
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, critical infrastructure protection as well
as how to deal with difficult allies that transgress on democratic
principles. [[In this context, the Biden administration could drive a
new stage of NATO adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark} beginning in 2021:
\'œAs president, I will do more than just restore our historic
partnerships; I will lead the effort to reimagine them for the world we
face today\' (Biden, 2020a).

#### No hegemony impact -- empirics and political [psychology]{.underline} prove US [posture]{.underline} is unrelated to [great power peace]{.underline}

Overestimated Benevolence

**[Both strains of the [heg]{.mark}emonic-[stability]{.mark} explanation
[assume]{.mark} not only that [US power is benevolent]{.mark}, but
[that]{.mark} [others perceive it that way.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[Heg]{.mark}emonic stability [depends on]{.mark} the [perceptions of
other states]{.mark} to be successful; [it has no hope]{.mark} to
succeed [if it encounters resistance]{.mark} from the less powerful
members of the system, or even if they simply refuse to follow the
rules]{.underline}**. Relatively small police forces require the general
cooperation of large communities to have any chance of establishing
order. They must perceive the sheriff as just, rational, and essentially
nonthreatening. The lack of balancing behavior in the system, which has
been puzzling to many realists, seems to support the notion of
widespread perceptions of benevolent hegemony.101 Were they threatened
by the order constructed by the United States, the argument goes,
smaller states would react in ways that reflected their fears. Since
internal and external balancing accompanied previous attempts to achieve
hegemony, the absence of such behavior today suggests that something is
different about the US version.

**[Hegemonic-stability theorists purport to understand the perceptions
of others, at times better than those others understand
themselves]{.underline}**. Complain as they may at times, other
countries know that the United States is acting in the common interest.
Objections to unipolarity, though widespread, are not "very seriously
intended," wrote Kagan, since "the truth about America's dominant role
in the world is known to most observers. And the truth is that the
benevolent hegemony exercised by the United States is good for a vast
portion of the world's population." 102 **[In the 1990s, [Russian
protests regarding NATO]{.mark} expansion---though nearly
universal---[were not taken seriously]{.mark}, since US planners
believed the alliance's benevolent intentions were apparent to
all.]{.underline}** Sagacious Russians understood that expansion would
actually be beneficial, since it would bring stability to their western
border.103 **[President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren
Christopher were caught off guard by the hostility of their counterparts
regarding the issue at a summit in Budapest in December
1994]{.underline}**.104 **[[Despite warnings from]{.mark} the vast
majority of academic and policy [experts about the]{.mark} likely
[Russian reaction]{.mark} and overall wisdom of expansion itself, the
administration failed to anticipate Moscow's position.]{.underline}**105
The Russians did not seem to believe American assurances that expansion
would actually be good for them. The United States overestimated the
degree to which others saw it as benevolent.

**[Once again, the culture of the United States might make its leaders
more vulnerable to this misperception. The need for [positive
self-regard appears]{.mark} to be particularly [strong in North
America]{.mark}n societies]{.underline}** compared to elsewhere.106
Western egos tend to be gratified through self-promotion rather than
humility, and independence rather than interdependence. Americans are
more likely to feel good if they are unique rather than a good cog in
society's wheel, and uniquely good. The need to be perceived as
benevolent, though universal, may well exert stronger encouragement for
US observers to project their perceptions onto others.

**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates almost certainly [frightens
others more than]{.mark} its [leaders perceive]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[A quarter of the 68,000 respondents to a 2013 Gallup poll in
sixty-five countries identified the United States as the "greatest
threat to world peace," which was more than three times the total for
the second-place country]{.underline}** (Pakistan).107 **[The
international community always has to worry about the potential for
police brutality, even if it occurs rarely]{.underline}**. Such
ungratefulness tends to come as a surprise to US leaders. In 2003,
Condoleezza Rice was dismayed to discover resistance to US initiatives
in Iraq: "There were times," she said later, "that it appeared that
American power was seen to be more dangerous than, perhaps, Saddam
Hussein." 108 Both liberals and neoconservatives probably exaggerate the
extent to which US hegemony is everywhere secretly welcomed**[; it is
not just petulant resentment, but understandable [disagreement
with]{.mark} US [policies]{.mark}, that [motivates]{.mark}
[counterhegemonic]{.mark} beliefs and [behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[To review, assuming for a moment that US [leaders]{.mark} are subject
to the same forces that affect every human being, they
[overestimate]{.mark} the amount of [control they have]{.mark} over
other actors]{.underline}**, **[and are not as important to decisions
made elsewhere as they believe themselves to be.]{.underline}** And they
probably perceive their own benevolence to be much greater than do
others. These common phenomena all influence US beliefs in the same
direction, and may well increase the apparent explanatory power of
hegemony beyond what the facts would otherwise support. The United
States is probably not as central to the New Peace as either liberals or
neoconservatives believe.

In the end, what can be said about the relationship between US power and
international stability? Probably not much that will satisfy partisans,
and the pacifying virtue of US hegemony will remain largely an article
of faith in some circles in the policy world. Like most beliefs, it will
remain immune to alteration by logic and evidence. Beliefs rarely
change, so debates rarely end.

For those not yet fully converted, however, **[perhaps it will be
significant that corroborating evidence for the relationship is
extremely hard to identify. If indeed hegemonic stability exists, it
does so without leaving much of a trace.]{.underline}** **[[Neither
Washington's spending]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nor its **[interventions,
[nor]{.mark}]{.underline}** its overall **[[grand strategy]{.mark} seem
to]{.underline}** **[[matter]{.mark} much [to]{.mark} the [levels of
armed conflict]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}** (apart from those
wars that Uncle Sam starts). **[[The empirical record does not
contain]{.mark} strong [reasons to believe]{.mark} that [unipolarity
and]{.mark} the New [Peace are related]{.mark}, and [insights from
political psychology suggest]{.mark} that [heg]{.mark}emonic stability
[is]{.mark} a belief particularly [susceptible to
misperception]{.mark}]{.underline}**. US leaders probably exaggerate the
degree to which their power matters, and could retrench without much
risk to themselves or the world around them. **[Researchers will need to
look elsewhere to explain why the world has entered into the most
peaceful period in its history.]{.underline}**

The good news from this is that **[[the New Peace
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** probably **[[persist]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for quite some time, **[[no matter how dominant the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is, or what policies]{.mark} President [Trump
follows]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or how much resentment its actions cause
in the periphery. **[The people of the twenty-first century are likely
to be much safer and more secure than any of their predecessors, even if
many of them do not always believe it]{.underline}**

#### The liberal order's structure makes it [resilient]{.underline}.

**[Four [characteristics reinforce]{.mark} and draw states [into the
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, it **[has [integrative
tendencies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Over the last century states with
diverse characteristics have found pathways into its "ecosystem" of
rules and institutions. Germany and Japan found roles and positions of
authority in the post-war order; and after the cold war many more
states---in Eastern Europe, Asia, and elsewhere---have joined its
economic and security partnerships. **[It is the [multilateral
logic]{.mark} of the order that [makes it]{.mark}]{.underline}**
relatively **[[easy]{.mark} for states [to join]{.mark} and rise up
within the order]{.underline}**. Second, **[the liberal order
offers]{.underline}** opportunities for leadership and **[[shared
authority. One state does not "rule"]{.mark} the system. The system is
built around [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[this
[provide]{.mark}s [opportunities for]{.mark} shifting and expanding
[coalitions]{.mark} of states to share leadership]{.underline}**. Formal
institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank, are led by boards of
directors and weighted voting. Informal groups, such as the G-7 and
G-20, are built on principles of collective governance. Third, **[the
actual [economic gains]{.mark} from participation within the liberal
order are widely shared]{.underline}**. In colonial and informal
imperial systems, the gains from trade and investment are
disproportionately enjoyed by the lead state. In the existing order,
**[the ["profits]{.mark} of modernity" [are distributed]{.mark} across
the system]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[[China's]{.mark} great economic
[ascent was]{.mark} only [possible because]{.mark} the liberal
international [order rewarded]{.mark} its pursuit of [openness and
trade]{.mark}-oriented growth]{.underline}**. For the same reason,
states in all regions of the world have made systematic efforts to
integrate into the system. Finally, **[the liberal international order
accommodates a [diversity]{.mark} of models and strategies of growth and
development]{.underline}**. In recent decades the Anglo-American model
of neoliberalism has been particularly salient. But the post-war system
also provides space for other capitalist models, such as those
associated with European social democracy and East Asian developmental
statism. The global capitalist system might generate some pressures for
convergence, but it also provides space for the coexistence of
alternative models and ideologies.

**[These aspects of the liberal international order create incentives
and opportunities for states to integrate into its core economic and
political realms]{.underline}**. The order allows states to share in its
economic spoils. **[Its [pluralistic character creates]{.mark}
possibilities [for states to "work the
system"]{.mark}]{.underline}**---to join in, negotiate, and maneuver in
ways that advance their interests. **[This]{.underline}**, in turn,
**[creates an order with [expanding constituencies]{.mark} that have a
stake in its continuation]{.underline}**. Compared to imperial and
colonial orders of the past, **[the existing [order is easy to
join]{.mark} and [hard to overturn]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Rising states want to preserve it.

Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs

What Rising States Want **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** liberal
international **[[order was built by]{.mark} the
[West]{.mark}ern]{.underline}** liberal **[democracies, [but
its]{.mark}]{.underline}** basic **[[features do not exclusively
advance]{.underline}]{.mark}** the interests of **[[these]{.mark}
countries]{.underline}**. In fact, as **[China and]{.underline}** other
**[non-Western [developing states]{.mark} rise]{.underline}**, they have
**[already [demonstrated]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[a growing [interest
in]{.mark} the perpetuation of]{.underline}** some sort of **[open and
multilateral global system. These countries]{.underline}** may not want
Western dominance of global institutions, but they **[want [the West's
rules]{.mark} and organizational principles.]{.underline}**

These rising states certainly want **[an open world
economy]{.underline}**. They want access to other countries for
**[trade, investment, and technology. [It is their
outward]{.mark}-oriented development [strategies
that]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[have [propelled them]{.mark}
forward]{.underline}**. The ascent of these countries began in the late
1980s with broad-gauged reform efforts. Countries why the liberal world
order will survive such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and
Turkey broke with their closed, authoritarian pasts and moved toward
more reform-oriented and accountable governments. Together with China,
these countries opened up to the world economy. As Ted Piccone argues,
they all "entered the global marketplace through an increasing reliance
on international trade, migration, remittances, energy, and foreign
investment flows." This liberalization and economic openness has come
along with a mix of nationalist and populist appeals, and ideological
critiques of Western neoliberalism. More generally, however, these
**[rising [states see]{.mark}]{.underline}** their **[prospects for
[growth]{.mark} and advancement]{.underline}** to be **[[tied to]{.mark}
engagement with]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[integration
into]{.underline}** **[a reformed [an]{.mark}d [open]{.mark} world
[econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline}**.

The **[rising]{.underline}** non-Western **[states]{.underline}** also
**[have]{.underline}** an **[interest in the]{.underline}**
preservation---and perhaps the **[expansion]{.underline}**---**[of a
rules-based international system. A [multilat]{.mark}eral
system]{.underline}** of rules and institutions **[[offers]{.mark}
rising [states]{.mark}]{.underline}** some measure of protection and
**[[equal treatment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As John Ruggie argues,
multilateralism is an "institutional form that coordinates relations
among three or more states on the basis of generalized principles of
conduct: that is, principles which specify appropriate conduct for a
class of actions." Multilateralism gives relations among states a
rule-based character. **[The more rule-based]{.underline}** the order
is, **[the less]{.underline}** it is subject to the straightforward
**[domination of powerful states. This]{.underline}** sort of system of
governance **[should be [attractive to]{.mark}]{.underline}** weak and
**[[peripheral states]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So, too, **[as rising
states gain]{.underline}** in **[wealth]{.underline}** **[and standing,
they]{.underline}** will **[want a rule-based system]{.underline}** to
protect their gains. **[One [fear]{.mark} of these [states]{.mark}
is]{.underline}** that **[they [will face discrimination]{.mark} and
marginalization]{.underline}**. In the trade area, for example, **[[the
W]{.underline}]{.mark}**orld **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization **[[is attractive to rising
states]{.mark} because of its multilateral principle of equal and
most-favored nation treatment]{.underline}**.

For these reasons, **[[rising states have incentives to be
stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark}** in some sort of updated and reformed
liberal international order. As Miles Kahler argues, **[[Brazil, China,
and India]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n themselves to be [the
"conservative globalizers."]{.mark}]{.underline}** None is directly
allied with the United States, yet **[each]{.underline}** has **[made
"large bets on opening its economy and breaking with a more autocratic
past";]{.underline}** and along the way their
**[["populations]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
**[[endorsed]{.underline}]{.mark}** the benefits of trade and foreign
investment, providing **[[a political base for]{.underline}]{.mark}**
this turn to **[[the global econ]{.mark}omy."]{.underline}** Rising
states want predictable and fair-minded access to and treatment within
an open global system. They resist the political domination of existing
global institutions by Western powers. But **[the remedy]{.underline}**
for this problem **[is]{.underline}** actually the
**[deepening]{.underline}** of **[the foundations of an open and
rule-based order, not its destruction.]{.underline}**

In his book The Future of Human Nature, [[Jürgen Habermas makes the case
that the use of germline genetic engineering would give us an exorbitant
power over our descendants and lead to a dramatic loss of liberty for
future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}. In his view, [[preventing the
manipulation of the genome of our descendants "is crucial for our
capacity to see ourselves as the authors of our own life history, and to
recognize us as autonomous persons]{.underline}]{.mark}." 47 He claims
that the principle of equality between generations crucially depends on
the condition that each individual's features are more to the result of
chance than choice, of contingency rather than human design. Certainly,
it can be argued, as is often done, that the germline alterations will
only aim at preventing the transmission of genetically related diseases.
The problem is that, even if this were the initial focus, the risk is
too high that we will then gradually start to make genetic changes for
the non-therapeutic design of children.48 [[Even the best-intentioned
efforts to restrict the use of the technique to specified conditions
would be unlikely to hold]{.underline}]{.mark}, for a number of reasons
that cannot be discussed here.49 [[Besides that, it is well-known that
the boundaries between "therapy" and "enhancement" are extremely
difficult to define in real practice]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, the
expression "therapeutic purpose" is itself somehow misleading in this
context. [[Germline gene editing does not aim to treat, cure, or prevent
diseases in any existing patient.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead, it aims
to modify the genes of future children and generations through the
intentional creation of embryos with altered genomes. [[Strictly
speaking, the procedure is not a medical intervention but a way to
satisfy parental desires for genetically related children or for
children with specific genetic traits]{.underline}]{.mark}.50 In other
words, we are not dealing with a therapeutic procedure but with a
wish-fulfilling technology, which is something very different from an
ethical and legal point of view. It must be noted that germline
engineering is radically different from other technologies in the sense
that it does not aim to change the tools that we use but the users
themselves (that is, ourselves, or rather, our descendants), and in an
irreversible manner. Some reports from scientific academies have argued
that the procedure could become acceptable once the risks of side
effects on the children can be reduced to a minimum.51 However, besides
the fact that the concerns raised by the technique exceed by far the
question of the purely medical side effects, [[can a risk that may
unpredictably affect future people]{.underline}]{.mark} --either
physically or psychologically -- [[ever be regarded as
"minimal"?]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Is the classic risk--benefit analysis
really applicable to this radically new scenario?]{.underline}]{.mark}
These questions are difficult to answer. What is clear is that humankind
has rarely been confronted with such challenging issues concerning our
self-understanding as free, non-engineered human beings, and the
long-term effects of our technological choices.

**Regulations cannot resolve the ethical issues -- no responsible path
forward unless a ban.**

[[There is no responsible path forward for the use of germline]{.mark}
genome [editing]{.mark} at all. The procedure has potentially racist and
strikingly ableist implications which would negatively impact the
long-term future of the international disability rights community. As
such, [no international oversight structures could make any path forward
for germline genome editing ethical or responsible]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Additionally[, [it is]{.mark} quite [unlikely that an international
oversight structure would be fully able to govern germline]{.mark}
genome [editing.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, although the United
Nations or another international body could develop a Convention on the
Ethical Use of Germline Genome Editing, countries could simply choose
not to sign and/or ratify the Convention. Even if we assume that all
interested countries signed and ratified such a document, international
standards, even when binding, can remain unenforced. For example,
although a great many countries have signed and ratified the Convention
on the Rights of People with Disabilities, very few of these countries
have made substantial progress towards enforcing Article 12 of the
Convention, which requires that States Parties take "appropriate
measures to provide access by persons with disabilities to the support
they may require in exercising their legal
capacity."[7](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2019/10/asan-comments-on-the-clinical-use-of-human-germline-genome-editing/#f+6187+1+7)
Some individual countries are also quite likely to interpret any
international governing standards such as to allow whatever action they
take, regardless of whether the standards actually do so. Regardless of
the presence or absence of international standards, individual
organizations or persons will exist who defy them, who will face little
accountability.
