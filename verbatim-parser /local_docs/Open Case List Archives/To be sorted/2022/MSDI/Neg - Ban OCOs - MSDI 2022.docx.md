### 1NC\-\--Russia Deterrence DA

#### Russian reliance on cyberwarfare escalates now\-\--NATO is next

Missing Cyberwar: Russia's Hacking Succeeded in Ukraine---And Poses a

After Russia invaded Ukraine, many observers initially expected
cyberattacks to steal the limelight as a major instrument in Russia's
arsenal. But after a month of fighting, a host of prominent scholars and
[[analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} of cyberconflict have reached the
opposite conclusion. [Russia's activities in cyberspace]{.underline},
they claim, [have been paltry or even nonexistent]{.underline}. They
[[have]{.mark} [dismissed]{.mark} the role of
[cyber]{.mark}-op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}, variously
[proposing that]{.underline} digital preparations for the invasion in
Ukraine never occurred, were haphazard or [lacked any real
impact]{.underline}, or were mere continuations of Russia's long-term
cyber-activity against Ukraine that fell below the threshold of outright
war. **[[This is a dangerous misdiagnosis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. All
available evidence indicates that [Russia has employed a coordinated
cyber-campaign intended to provide its forces with an early
advantage]{.underline} during its war in Ukraine. The apparent
disconnect between these observed incidents, on the one hand, and the
public analysis that Russian cyber-operations have been minimal, on the
other, is jarring. Preconceived notions of the role of cyberattacks on
the battlefield have made it hard for analysts to see cyber-operations
in Ukraine for what they are and for the role they play within Russia's
military campaign. Leaning on these preconceptions will only lead to
future policy and intelligence failures. Cyberspace is still a nascent
domain of operations, and events in Ukraine will have outsized
implications not just for any appreciation of Russian cyberpower but for
an understanding of the nature of cyberconflict itself. OPENING SALVO
The belief that cyber-operations have played no role in Ukraine does not
stem from a lack of real-world impact. To the contrary, the magnitude of
Moscow's pre-kinetic destructive cyber-operations was unprecedented. On
the day the invasion began, Russian cyber-units successfully deployed
more destructive malware---including against conventional military
targets such as civilian communications infrastructure and military
command and control centers---than the rest of the world's cyberpowers
combined typically use in a given year. The cumulative effects of these
attacks were striking. [In the hours prior to invasion, [Russia hit a
range of important targets in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [rendering
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [computer [systems of multiple
government]{.mark}, military, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[critical
infrastructure sectors **inoperable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Forensic
analysis by Microsoft, the cybersecurity company Symantec, and the
Slovak firm ESET has found that these attacks affected numerous
government agencies, military institutions, civil emergency services,
and a range of other critical infrastructure sectors such as defense
industrial base manufacturers, information technology services, and
energy companies directly relevant to Ukraine's military capacity.
[Cyber-enabled sabotage also knocked offline the satellite Internet
provider]{.underline} KA-SAT, which Ukraine's military, intelligence,
and police units depend on. Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine's
State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection, has
characterized the satellite outage as "a really huge loss in
communications in the very beginning of war." U.S. defensive cyberspace
operations prevented further Russian attacks from disrupting the railway
networks that were being used to transport military supplies and help
millions of Ukrainian citizens evacuate. [[Russia continues to draw from
its wartime arsenal of **cybertools**]{.underline},]{.mark} [deploying
additional destructive malware on a weekly basis.]{.underline} Cities
under siege from Russian shelling, including Kharkiv and Kyiv, have
experienced cyber-enabled disruptions to Internet services. Ukraine's
national cyber-authorities continue to expose intrusion attempts by
Russian and Belarussian cyber-units. All of this has occurred against
the backdrop of a series of website defacements, denial-of-service
attacks, and other destabilizing cyber-operations intended to produce
chaos and further exhaust Ukraine's cyberdefenses. If observers see this
cyber-offensive as a series of isolated events, its scale and strategic
significance get lost in the conventional violence unfolding in Ukraine.
But a full accounting of the cyber-operations reveals the proactive and
persistent use of cyberattacks to support Russian military objectives.
The misperception that Russia has been restrained or ineffective in the
prosecution of its cyberwar on Ukraine likely stems from the fact that
Russia's cyber-operations have not had the standalone, debilitating
effects that assessments before the war imagined they would have. But
those assessments pose an unrealistic test of strategic value. [No
single domain of operations has an independent, decisive effect on the
course of war.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the lack of overwhelming
"shock and awe" in cyberspace has led to the flawed presumption that
Russia's cyber-units are incapable, and even worse, that
cyber-operations have offered Russia no strategic value in its invasion
of Ukraine. THUNDER RUN Analysts should assess the use of cyberpower in
its proper context. Evaluating Russia's cyber-operations in Ukraine is
impossible without accounting for the multiple tactical and strategic
errors that have bedeviled other aspects of Moscow's military campaign.
Russian planners expected a swift victory in Ukraine, but their strategy
failed for multiple reasons: inadequate coordination and preparation,
the underestimation of the strength and resilience of Ukraine's
military, and various intelligence lapses. Russia's missteps and
struggles have almost certainly hurt its ability to fully employ its
cyber-program in support of its conventional forces. But even with those
limitations, Russian cyber-units successfully attacked a range of
targets in accordance with Russia's war plans. Russian cyberattacks on
government and military command and control centers, logistics,
emergency services, and other critical services such as border control
stations were entirely consistent with a so-called thunder run strategy
intended to stoke chaos, confusion, and uncertainty, and ultimately
avoid a costly and protracted war in Ukraine. Indeed, Russian
cyber-units have demonstrated their ability to succeed without a great
deal of advance warning and direction, and despite the overarching
difficulties hampering Russia's military effort. The reason for this
relative success lies in the unique nature of competition and conflict
in cyberspace. Unlike troop buildups or other forms of military
mobilization that are infrequent and highly visible, cyber-operations
are the result of operational cycles that occur covertly and
continuously through peacetime and wartime[. The targeting of sensitive
networks during peacetime lets attackers lay the groundwork for malware
intended for wartime use. T]{.underline}he methods attackers use to
establish initial footholds for espionage activities are
indistinguishable from those that precede cyberattacks. For cyber-units,
war does not fundamentally change the way they prepare or start to
fight. [Russia's cyberattacks prior to the invasion suggest **methodical
preparations**]{.underline}, with the attackers likely gaining access to
Ukrainian networks months ago. This stands in stark contrast to the
evident lack of preparation across Moscow's other military instruments,
including on the ground, in the air, and in its frequently used
influence operations through media and social media. Russian cyber-units
did not need direct military orders to prepare for the invasion or to
generate new capabilities for the war. The operational realities of
cyberspace required them to be ready well in advance. Russian
cyber-units will probably continue to be in a state of permanent
readiness and capable of supporting tactical and strategic objectives on
short notice, either in Ukraine or beyond, as the war persists. The
emerging consensus that claims Russian cyber-operations were ineffective
misses the bigger picture. Russia's strategy failed to capitalize on the
full capabilities and numerous operational successes of its cyber-units.
For instance, [Russian cyber-units have not yet shut down electricity or
Internet connectivity on a massive scale in Ukraine. That does not mean
Russia is incapable of such]{.underline} attacks, as some observers have
suggested, [but that it envisioned a swift victory and did not see the
need for such widespread]{.underline}, indiscriminate
[disruptions]{.underline}. In all likelihood, Russian military units
were reliant on Ukrainian civil infrastructure for their planned seizure
of Kyiv and could not risk blowback to their own operations. Russia is
almost certainly capable of cyberattacks of greater scale and
consequence than events in Ukraine would have one believe. [Moscow has
significantly improved its ability to conduct comprehensive
cyber-operations in recent years and has actively invested in its
cyber-capabilities, developing new and harder-to-detect variants of its
more advanced malware]{.underline} and operational infrastructure. NO
RESTRAINT **[[The war in Ukraine is not over]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Russia has been forced to change its operational approach, and Western
intelligence points to Moscow shifting toward a strategy of attrition.
[[With]{.mark} the likelihood that the conflict will become [a
protracted war, Russia will probably not exercise restraint]{.mark} in
its use of additional **disruptive** and **destructive**
cyber-actions]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir [[Putin is most
likely to double down on early cyber-successes and seek to]{.mark}
**[further disrupt and undermine]{.mark}** government, military, and
civilian [infrastructure]{.mark}, as well as defense industrial base
enterprises]{.underline}. Russia's recent attempts to strike the same
targets it hit on the day of the invasion with additional destructive
malware indicate this new phase of the conflict is well underway.
Although less visible than cyberattacks, **[cyber-enabled
espionage]{.underline}**---the theft of sensitive information, in this
case from Ukrainian networks---[is also likely to play a grisly role in
the Russian offensive.]{.underline} Russia's Federal Security Service
has allegedly used personal information stolen from Ukrainian federal
databases to draw up kill lists of people who could lead a Ukrainian
resistance movement in the event of a Russian victory. And as the war
carries on, Russia may be increasingly tempted to tap into the latent
strategic potential of hacking collectives aligned with the Kremlin that
specialize in ransomware and can unleash chaos at a moment's notice.
Western policymakers should also be prepared for cyber-operations to
spread beyond the confines of Ukraine. [[Several Russian
cyber-op]{.underline}]{.mark}eration[s]{.underline} since the invasion
[have already [had **spillover effects into NATO
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [affecting critical sectors and
civilian Internet connectivity across Europe. Russia knowingly accepted
the risk that its cyberattacks would cause collateral damage and has a
history of similar **reckless behavior.**]{.underline} The U.S. Office
of the Director of National Intelligence's Annual Threat Assessment
released in March judged that "[[Russia is]{.mark} particularly [focused
on **improving its ability to target**]{.mark} **[critical
infrastructure ... in U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[as well as in allied and partner
countries]{.underline}**."]{.mark} [Active Russian preparations for
future cyber-operations indicate that this not an idle
threat.]{.underline} Cyber-operations have been Russia's biggest
military success to date in the war in Ukraine. They will continue to
provide Moscow a flexible tool capable of hitting a range of targets in
Ukraine and beyond. Disregarding their unprecedented use will only leave
policymakers and analysts unprepared for what's next. **[[A
clear]{.mark}-eyed [view of]{.mark} the role
[cyberwar]{.mark}fare]{.underline}** has [[played]{.mark} so far [in
Ukraine]{.mark} and a better]{.underline} [understanding of its place in
modern warfare [are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[imperatives for NATO's

#### They'll target U.S. critical infrastructure\-\--only by advancing cyber mechanisms can Russia be deterred

International cooperation to this degree is not an asset that Russia
benefits from. [[With the support of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence's research and
development projects, expertise, and training, [[U.S. retaliation
to]{.mark} a potential]{.underline} [Russian cyber attack [could
be]{.mark}]{.underline} not only detrimental but even **[[more profound
as a multilateral response]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Based on all this,
[[the fear of retaliation could]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[prevent
Putin from engaging in **o**]{.underline}]{.mark}ffensive
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**yber
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**peration**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** against
the United States. Finally, Putin has lost the upper hand in launching
an attack by surprise. For instance, Russia invaded Georgia during the
Olympics Games in Beijing in 2008, and Ukraine during the Sochi Winter
Olympics in 2014. When Putin waged war on Ukraine in
2022---incidentally, immediately following the Beijing Winter Olympic
Games---the West anticipated it. Putin invaded Ukraine anyway. He is
unlikely to act recklessly in this way again, considering the failures
the Russian military has experienced since the invasion. Furthermore,
knowing that the United States and European allies have shielded up,
Putin has no incentive to strike. Nevertheless, would Putin wait for a
more favorable moment? Or scale back a potential attack, for instance,
by meddling in the U.S. midterm elections in November? [[It would be
misleading]{.mark}, however, [to underestimate Russian
cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities [or Putin's mind games [and lose
vigilance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2020, despite denying its
involvement, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} evidently
[[hacked]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. software company
[[SolarWinds]{.mark}. By installing malware into the company's
updated]{.underline} Orion [software]{.underline} program, [the attack
affected]{.underline} thousands of customers, a hundred companies such
as Microsoft and Intel, and some [federal agencies]{.underline} like the
Treasury Department, the Pentagon, and the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency. Cyber experts acclaimed the code used as
phenomenal. More astonishingly, if not for a performance assessment and
proper investigation, the attack could have easily gone unnoticed. For
over six months, Moscow tracked emails and other traffic of sensitive
information. [Could there already be a similar malware in U.S.
networks]{.underline}? Now, on the brink of a new Cold War, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[must
keep its guard up on cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although
there are significant factors that challenge the probability of an
imminent Russian cyber-retaliation, [**[the U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [should not disregard]{.mark} the potential for
[malicious activity]{.mark} in the near future]{.underline}. It needs to
keep a sober view and not act hastily. Setting priorities for the long
run, [**[the U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [needs to continue
advancing cyber mechanisms]{.mark} that detect sensitive activity like
the Solar Winds hack]{.underline}, and invest more in training and
education about cyber hygiene for government agencies, private
companies, and the public. It should not neglect to regularly test
offline backups, run software updates, report incidents, use multifactor
authentication, block unusable domain IP addresses, and assess
third-party risks. Although [[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} intentions
are far from clear, his [[decision to pursue a cyberattack on the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates'
[[critical infrastructure that **would instantly shut down
electricity**]{.mark} or disrupt clean water supply]{.underline}, the
offense [[might come unexpectedly, and soon]{.underline}. **[Cornered
with sanctions]{.underline}** [and burdened by the bitterness of defeat,
Putin might act furiously]{.underline}. **[The
U]{.underline}**]{.mark}[nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and Western allies
need **to be vigilant**]{.mark} and maintain strong lines of
communication about any malicious activity. **[With a strong

[given]{.underline} current **[[unpreparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[would]{.underline} likely [[result in]{.mark} **[societal
collapse]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Terrorists, criminals, and even lone
individuals can build a non-nuclear EMP weapon without great trouble or
expense, working from Unclassified designs publicly available on the
internet, and using parts available at any electronics store. In 2000,
the Terrorism Panel of the House Armed Services Committee sponsored an
experiment, recruiting a small team of amateur electronics enthusiasts
to attempt constructing a radiofrequency weapon, relying only on
unclassified design information and parts purchased from Radio Shack.
The team, in 1 year, built two radiofrequency weapons of radically
different designs. One was designed to fit inside the shipping crate for
a Xerox machine, so it could be delivered to the Pentagon mail room
where (in those more unguarded days before 9/11) it could slowly fry the
Pentagon's computers. The other radiofrequency weapon was designed to
fit inside a small Volkswagon bus, so it could be driven down Wall
Street and disrupt computers--- and perhaps the National economy. Both
designs were demonstrated and tested successfully during a special
Congressional hearing for this purpose at the U.S. Army's Aberdeen
Proving Ground. Radiofrequency weapons are not merely a hypothetical
threat. Terrorists, criminals, and disgruntled individuals have used
home-made radiofrequency weapons. The U.S. military and foreign
militaries have a wide variety of such weaponry. Moreover, non-nuclear
EMP devices that could be used as radiofrequency weapons are publicly
marketed for sale to anyone, usually advertised as ''EMP simulators.''
For example, one such simulator is advertised for public sale as an
''EMP Suitcase.'' This EMP simulator is designed to look like a
suitcase, can be carried and operated by one person, and is
purpose-built with a high energy radiofrequency output to destroy
electronics. However, it has only a short radius of effect. Nonetheless,
a terrorist or deranged individual who knows what he is doing, who has
studied the electric grid for a major metropolitan area, could---armed
with the ''EMP Suitcase''--- black out a major city. A CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER. An EMP weapon can be used by state actors who wish to level the
battlefield by neutralizing the great technological advantage enjoyed by
U.S. military forces. EMP is also the ideal means, the only means,
whereby rogue states or terrorists could use a single nuclear weapon to
destroy the United States and prevail in the War on Terrorism or some
other conflict with a single blow. The EMP Commission also warned that
states or terrorists could exploit U.S. vulnerability to EMP attack for
coercion or blackmail: ''Therefore, terrorists or state actors that
possess relatively unsophisticated missiles armed with nuclear weapons
may well calculate that, instead of destroying a city or military base,
they may obtain the greatest political-military utility from one or a
few such weapons by using them---or threatening their use---in an EMP
attack.'' The EMP Commission found that states such as Russia, China,
North Korea, and Iran have incorporated EMP attack into their military
doctrines, and openly describe making EMP attacks against the United
States. Indeed, the EMP Commission was established by Congress partly in
response to a Russian nuclear EMP threat made to an official
Congressional Delegation on May 2, 1999, in the midst of the Balkans
crisis. Vladimir Lukin, head of the Russian delegation and a former
Ambassador to the United States, warned: ''Hypothetically, if Russia
really wanted to hurt the United States in retaliation for NATO's
bombing of Yugoslavia, Russia could fire an SLBM and detonate a single
nuclear warhead at high altitude over the United States. The resulting
EMP would massively disrupt U.S. communications and computer systems,
shutting down everything.'' China's military doctrine also openly
describes EMP attack as the ultimate asymmetric weapon, as it strikes at
the very technology that is the basis of U.S. power. Where EMP is
concerned, ''The United States is more vulnerable to attacks than any
other country in the world'': ''Some people might think that things
similar to the 'Pearl Harbor Incident' are unlikely to take place during
the information age. Yet it could be regarded as the 'Pearl Harbor
Incident' of the 21st Century if a surprise attack is conducted against
the enemy's crucial information systems of command, control, and
communications by such means as... electromagnetic pulse weapons... Even
a superpower like the United States, which possesses nuclear missiles
and powerful armed forces, cannot guarantee its immunity...In their own
words, a highly computerized open society like the United States is
extremely vulnerable to electronic attacks from all sides. This is
because the U.S. economy, from banks to telephone systems and from power
plants to iron and steel works, relies entirely on computer networks...
When a country grows increasingly powerful economically and
technologically...it will become increasingly dependent on modern
information systems... The United States is more vulnerable to attacks
than any other country in the world.'' Iran---the world's leading
sponsor of international terrorism---in military writings openly
describes EMP as a terrorist weapon, and as the ultimate weapon for
prevailing over the West: ''If the world's industrial countries fail to
devise effective ways to defend themselves against dangerous electronic
assaults, then they will disintegrate within a few years... American
soldiers would not be able to find food to eat nor would they be able to
fire a single shot.'' The threats are not merely words. The EMP
Commission assesses that Russia has, as it openly declares in military
writings, probably developed what Russia describes as a ''Super-EMP''
nuclear weapon---specifically designed to generate extraordinarily high
EMP fields in order to paralyze even the best protected U.S. strategic
and military forces. China probably also has Super-EMP weapons. North
Korea too may possess or be developing a Super-EMP nuclear weapon, as
alleged by credible Russian sources to the EMP Commission, and by
open-source reporting from South Korean military intelligence. But any
nuclear weapon, even a low-yield first generation device, could suffice
to make a catastrophic EMP attack on the United States. Iran, although
it is assessed as not yet having the bomb, is actively testing missile
delivery systems and has practiced launches of its best missile, the
Shahab--III, fuzing for high- altitude detonations, in exercises that
look suspiciously like training for making EMP attacks. As noted
earlier, Iran has also practiced launching from a ship a Scud, the
world's most common missile---possessed by over 60 nations, terrorist
groups, and private collectors. A Scud might be the ideal choice for a
ship-launched EMP attack against the United States intended to be
executed anonymously, to escape any last-gasp U.S. retaliation. Unlike a
nuclear weapon detonated in a city, a high-altitude EMP attack leaves no
bomb debris for forensic analysis, no perpetrator ''fingerprints.''
Under present levels of preparedness, communications would be severely
limited, restricted mainly to those few military communications networks
that are hardened against EMP. Today's microelectronics are the
foundation of our modern civilization, but are over 1 million times more
vulnerable to EMP than the far more primitive and robust electronics of
the 1960s, that proved vulnerable during nuclear EMP tests of that era.
Tests conducted by the EMP Commission confirmed empirically the theory
that, as modern microelectronics become ever smaller and more efficient,
and operate ever faster on lower voltages, they also become ever more
vulnerable, and can be destroyed or disrupted by much lower EMP field
strengths. Microelectronics and electronic systems are everywhere, and
run virtually everything in the modern world. All of the civilian
critical infrastructures that sustain the economy of the United States,
and the lives of 310 million Americans, depend, directly or indirectly,
upon electricity and electronic systems. Of special concern is the
vulnerability to EMP of the Extra-High-Voltage (EHV) transformers, that
are indispensable to the operation of the electric grid. EHV
transformers drive electric current over long distances, from the point
of generation to consumers (from the Niagara Falls hydroelectric
facility to New York City, for example). The electric grid cannot
operate without EHV transformers---which could be destroyed by an EMP
event. The United States no longer manufactures EHV transformers. They
must be manufactured and imported from overseas, from Germany or South
Korea, the only two nations in the world that manufacture such
transformers for export. Each EHV transformer must be custom-made for
its unique role in the grid. A single EHV transformer typically requires
18 months to manufacture. The loss of large numbers of EHV transformers
to an EMP event would plunge the United States into a protracted
blackout lasting years, with perhaps no hope of eventual recovery, as
the society and population probably could not survive for even 1 year
without electricity. Another key vulnerability to EMP are Supervisory
Control And Data Acquisition systems (SCADAs). SCADAs essentially are
small computers, numbering in the millions and ubiquitous everywhere in
the critical infrastructures, that perform jobs previously performed by
hundreds of thousands of human technicians during the 1960s and before,
in the era prior to the microelectronics revolution. SCADAs do things
like regulating the flow of electricity into a transformer, controlling
the flow of gas through a pipeline, or running traffic control lights.
SCADAs enable a few dozen people to run the critical infrastructures for
an entire city, whereas previously hundreds or even thousands of
technicians were necessary. Unfortunately, SCADAs are especially
vulnerable to EMP. EHV transformers and SCADAs are the most important
vulnerabilities to EMP, but are by no means the only vulnerabilities.
Each of the critical infrastructures has their own unique
vulnerabilities to EMP: The National electric grid, with its
transformers and generators and electronic controls and thousands of
miles of power lines, is a vast electronic machine---more vulnerable to
EMP than any other critical infrastructure. Yet [[the]{.mark} electric
[grid is]{.mark} the **[most important]{.mark} of all critical
infrastructures**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} is in fact the **keystone
supporting modern civilization**]{.underline}, [as it powers **all the
other critical infrastructures**]{.underline}. [As of now it is our
**technological [Achilles Heel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The EMP
Commission found that, [if the electric grid collapses, so too will
collapse **all the other critical infrastructures**]{.underline}. But,
if the electric grid can be protected and recovered, so too all the
other critical infrastructures can also be restored.
**[Transportation]{.underline}** is a critical infrastructure because
modern [civilization cannot exist without the goods and services moved
by road, rail, ship, and air]{.underline}. Cars, trucks, locomotives,
ships, and aircraft all have electronic components, motors, and controls
that are potentially vulnerable to EMP. Gas stations, fuel pipelines,
and refineries that make petroleum products depend upon electronic
components and cannot operate without electricity. Given our current
state of unpreparedness, in the aftermath of a natural or nuclear EMP
event, transportation systems would be paralyzed. **[Traffic control
systems]{.underline}** that avert traffic jams and collisions for road,
rail, and air depend upon electronic systems, that the EMP Commission
discovered are especially vulnerable to EMP.
**[Communications]{.underline}** is a critical infrastructure because
modern economies and [the cohesion and [operation]{.mark} of modern
societies [depend]{.mark} to a degree unprecedented in history
[on]{.mark} the rapid movement of
[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}---accomplished today mostly by
electronic means. Telephones, cell phones, personal computers,
television, and radio are all directly vulnerable to EMP, and cannot
operate without electricity. Satellites that operate at Low-Earth-Orbit
(LEO) for communications, weather, scientific, and military purposes are
vulnerable to EMP and to collateral effects from an EMP attack. Within
weeks of an EMP event, the LEO satellites, which comprise most
satellites, would probably be inoperable. **[Banking and
finance]{.underline}** [are the critical infrastructure that sustain
modern economies.]{.underline} Whether it is the stock market, the
financial records of a multinational corporation, or the ATM card of an
individual---financial transactions and record keeping all depend now at
the macro- and micro-level upon computers and electronic automated
systems. Many of these are directly vulnerable to EMP, and none can
operate [without electricity]{.underline}. The EMP Commission found that
[an]{.underline} EMP [event could transform the modern electronic
economy into a **feudal economy based on barter**. **Food**]{.underline}
[has always been]{.underline} **[vital to]{.underline}** every person
and **[every civilization]{.underline}**. [The critical infrastructure
for producing, delivering, and storing food depends upon a **complex web
of [tech]{.mark}nology**,]{.underline} [including machines for planting
and harvesting and packaging, refrigerated vehicles for long-haul
transportation, and temperature-controlled warehouses.]{.underline}
[Modern technology [enables]{.mark} over **[98 percent of the]{.mark}
U.S. National [population]{.mark}**]{.underline} to be fed by less than
2 percent of the population. Huge regional warehouses that resupply
supermarkets constitute the National food reserves, enough food to feed
the Nation for 30--60 days at normal consumption rates, the warehoused
food preserved by refrigeration and temperature control systems that
typically have enough emergency electrical power (diesel or gas
generators) to last only about an average of 3 days. [Experience with
storm-induced blackouts proves that when these big regional food
warehouses lose electrical power, **most of the food supply will rapidly

population as noted above, **[cannot feed 310 million
Americans]{.underline}** [if deprived of the means that currently makes
possible this technological miracle.]{.underline} Water too has always
been a basic necessity to every person and civilization, even more
crucial than food. The critical infrastructure for purifying and
delivering potable water, and for disposing of and treating waste water,
is a vast networked machine powered by electricity that uses electrical
pumps, screens, filters, paddles, and sprayers to purify and deliver
drinkable water, and to remove and treat waste water. Much of the
machinery in the water infrastructure is directly vulnerable to EMP. The
system cannot operate without vast amounts of electricity supplied by
the power grid. A natural or nuclear EMP event would immediately deprive
most of the U.S. National population of running water. Many natural
sources of water---lakes, streams, and rivers---would be dangerously
polluted by toxic wastes from sewage, industry, and hospitals that would
backflow from or bypass wastewater treatment plants, that could no
longer intake and treat pollutants without electric power. Many natural
water sources that would normally be safe to drink, after an EMP event,
would be polluted with human wastes including feces, industrial wastes
including arsenic and heavy metals, and hospital wastes including
pathogens. Emergency services such as police, fire, and hospitals are
the critical infrastructure that upholds the most basic functions of
government and society---preserving law and order, protecting property
and life. Experience from protracted storm-induced blackouts has shown,
for example in the aftermath of Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina, that when
the lights go out and communications systems fail and there is no gas
for squad cars, fire trucks, and ambulances, [[the worst

#### Russian cyberattacks cause NC3 entanglement

Ukraine,"

[To say that the world is closer to the brink of nuclear war today than
at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 feels less
controversial by the day]{.underline}. United Nations Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres recently told media representatives that the "prospect
of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of
possibility." Certainly, Russian President Vladimir [Putin has been
signaling a willingness to at least consider the nuclear
optio]{.underline}n. In late February, he raised the readiness level of
Russia's nuclear response force, stating that Western interference in
the ongoing war in Ukraine will result in "consequences greater than any
you have faced in history." And despite calming messaging from the Biden
administration, further Russian mobilizations---including the deployment
of nuclear missile launchers to Siberia and nuclear submarines to the
Barents Sea for supposed "drills"---have continued to stoke public fears
over nuclear weapons' use. Even Russia's recent pledge not to use
nuclear weapons in Ukraine has done little to calm fears about the
potential use of tactical nuclear devices, with many claiming the
statement is nothing more than an attempt to bolster Moscow's
negotiating position. [[Amid]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[rising nuclear
tensions]{.underline}, [there is]{.underline}]{.mark} [one dimension of
**[potential escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has not yet received
much public attention: that [[of]{.mark} [a cyber-enabled nuclear
event.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's time for policymakers to consider
whether cyber operations affecting elements of nuclear command, control
and communications, or NC3, systems could prompt nuclear escalation in
the current crisis. [Experts across the West have been scrambling to
place Putin's threats]{.underline}, both tacit and explicit, in
strategic and political context in order to gauge the possibility of a
nuclear escalation leading to nuclear war. Others still have more
narrowly---and perhaps more realistically---focused their analysis on
what strong nuclear threats mean for fraught international engagement
with Russia, and on whether Putin is likely to authorize the use of any
nuclear weapons at all. On the digital side of things, [experts on cyber
conflict have]{.underline} thus far **[narrowly]{.underline}**
[focused]{.underline} their [attention on the **non-nuclear**
aspects]{.underline} of tactics being employed in the war. Scholars
rightly predicted that the "cyber blitzkrieg" anticipated by many
pundits was unlikely, pointing out that, contrary to popular portrayals,
cyber instruments actually make for poor tools of coercion and
battlefield augmentation. By contrast, the entry of so many nonstate and
semi-state cyber forces into the conflict on both sides, including
nearly 300,000 volunteers coordinated by the Ukrainian government and a
pro-Russia equivalent calling itself "Killnet," was less expected. Even
given so much robust analysis of the ongoing war, [the **nuclear
tie-in** has remained curiously **underexamined**]{.underline}. This is
particularly concerning given the manner in which scholars have in
recent years suggested that the **[logic of [cyber]{.mark}
warfare]{.underline}** [[could undermine the]{.mark} logic of nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} under highly specific circumstances.]{.underline}
Overall, experts are right to dismiss the threat of a so-called
"cyberwar," a fantastical scenario that contradicts what we know about
the strategic and operational functions of cyber instruments. But
[[could cyber operations affecting]{.mark}]{.underline} elements of
[**[NC3]{.underline}** [prompt **nuclear escalation in the current
crisis?**]{.underline}]{.mark} Perhaps. The conflicting logics of cyber
and nuclear warfare, when considered in the context of the present
crisis, suggest real reasons to be concerned about the possibility of a
cyber-enabled nuclear escalation. Off the bat, it's important to
remember that several elements involved in that question could present
themselves in a range of ways. Nuclear escalation itself could take a
number of forms, from additional escalatory rhetoric or mobilization to
the actual use of a nuclear weapon. Likewise, a cyber operation
impacting NC3 systems---which essentially comprise the networks of
intelligence sensors, communications systems, other early warning assets
and arms control mechanisms that underlie a country's nuclear deterrent
forces---could be an actual attempt to interfere with a nation's
deterrent capability by means of disrupting or taking over an element of
its command system. That could be perceived by the targeted party as a
prelude to a preemptive strike. But it could also be something as simple
as an exploratory probe not intended to subvert system functions.
Significantly, these different attacks could be hard to differentiate
from the defensive perspective and so misinterpretation is entirely
possible. While countries like Russia and the United States have
historically reacted with caution to nuclear provocations, uncertainties
borne of the current crisis might diminish that inclination. Such
uncertainties could also encourage Russian leaders to lend less weight
to the cyber attribution problem---that is, the difficulty inherent in
identifying the party responsible for a cyber-attack that, even under
ordinary circumstances, complicates efforts to organize an appropriate
response. Even more concerning than the uncertainties bound up in
interpreting certain cyber actions is the oft-cited and well-documented
vulnerabilities of most states' NC3 systems. Scholars have noted that
[[NC3 weaknesses are widespread and]{.underline}]{.mark}, at times,
quite glaring. There's little doubt that [American or Russian
[second-strike]{.mark} capabilities [could]{.mark} be made to [function
effectively in the event of a nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}. But both
sides' reliance on a blend of new and legacy technologies to coordinate
a complex detection, analysis and strike apparatus for nuclear weapons
virtually guarantees errors in how these systems function as a whole.
For example, in the past, American forces have lost contact with launch
systems for hours due to faulty circuitry. At other times, they have
detected false launches because legacy machinery was mishandled by
operators. These base conditions are cause for at least minimal concern.
Both the probability of either side's NC3 systems being vulnerable to
some form of cyber compromise and the possibility that [[either side
might]{.mark} **mistakenly** [believe its NC3 is being targeted by
hostile foreign cyber operations]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly create the
potential for a cyber-enabled nuclear event where perceived
cyber-preemption against NC3 leads directly to either coercive or real
military escalation. Admittedly, the stakes of nuclear weapons' use
suggest that escalation is not an especially likely outcome most of the
time, even given these known issues. But unique circumstances might
change this calculus. In particular, [[the conflicting logics of cyber
and nuclear warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}, when considered in the context
of the present crisis, [[suggest real reasons to be concerned.]{.mark}
Nuclear]{.underline} and cyber forces are polar opposites with regard to
their operational features. The former [relies on open signaling to
"warn"]{.underline} [adversaries]{.underline} about potential
consequences in order to generate a deterrent effect. The latter
typically banks on secrecy, exploiting the element of surprise to avoid
giving an opponent the opportunity to upgrade their defenses. The
combination of the two creates unusual commitment problems, where the
[coercive brinksmanship usually on display in nuclear contests might be
absent as one side tries to use cyber instruments to neutralize the
other's NC3. Importantly, with cyber in the mix, the side that detects
cyber activity targeting NC3 will likely also notice that the attempted
breach was done in secret, creating new uncertainties over how they
might respond to such an attack.]{.underline} In addition to the
potential weaknesses of NC3 systems, the [[unique political
dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} currently on display [[in Moscow, where
Putin seems]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to be]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[[isolated and dependent on]{.underline}]{.mark} politicized
[[intelligence that has]{.mark} effectively]{.underline} [[undermined
his decision-making, complicates this]{.underline}]{.mark} game of
nuclear chicken. Given the difficult intelligence assessments and
operational decisions that any government trying to reconcile cyber and
nuclear logics in real-time will be required to make, this is worrisome
to say the least. And [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} many obvious
[[logistical failures]{.mark} in launching its invasion [are cause for
further concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, [objectively assessing
the risks]{.underline} [of cyber-enabled nuclear interference requires
having the ability to locate potential NC3 compromises]{.underline} and
to mitigate any that are found. [This means robust]{.underline}
intra-service [communication and]{.underline} deployment of
[expertise]{.underline}, [neither of which has been on prominent display
in Moscow]{.underline} [when it comes to the invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline} The range of [[cyber forces arrayed against
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}'s government in the current crisis also
represents a potential source of further uncertainty that [[could
produce cyber-prompted nuclear escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
addition to Ukraine's cyber forces, which are active against Russian
targets of all stripes, Kyiv has benefited from massive Western support
for its operations in cyberspace, including from hacktivist elements to
hundreds of thousands of volunteers that are being coordinated by
Ukrainian state auspices. Added to this is the fact that, in addition to
military equipment, Kyiv has been receiving non-battlefield aid from
NATO member states, particularly those that are most geographically
proximate, including Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. There is
clearly a narrow situation here in which [[Russian
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}, under the current internal political
conditions, [[may see]{.underline}]{.mark} possible **[[Western
intention in cyber events involving NC3]{.underline}]{.mark}** or
related systems.

#### It blurs the line of mutually assured destruction cascading in preemptive strikes\-\--it's the *[only]{.underline}* scenario for nuclear war

Jacquelyn **Schneider**, 03-07-**2022**, (Jacquelyn Schneider is a
Hoover Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University), "The
Biggest Cyber Risk in Ukraine?, Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-07/biggest-cyber-risk-ukraine/ceng

Why the apparent restraint? It is almost impossible to know exactly why
(or if) the Russians have indeed held back. Perhaps cyber-operations
have been attempted and failed; perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin
has held his cyber-capabilities in reserve, saving them for later. Or
maybe cyber-operations have taken place, but their effect---which is
often virtual and not clearly attributed---will take longer to
materialize. What is known is that the conflict is far from over, and
the next question becomes whether cyber-operations could play a larger
role as the war turns more violent. It is likely that the next stage of
conflict will more than ever be defined by planes, tanks, artillery, and
soldiers. It seems unlikely, given the amount of indiscriminate damage
currently being inflicted by Russia, that cyber-operations will escalate
the violence of the campaign within Ukraine. That said, [[could
cyber-operations lead to horizontal escalation, **drawing NATO into
the** fight]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example? Or, given that the United
States and Russia are the world's largest nuclear powers, [[could
cyber-operations escalate to]{.underline}]{.mark} the worst possible
outcome---[**[nuclear war]{.underline}**? [Recent]{.underline}]{.mark}
[wargaming [research suggests]{.mark} that [cyber-exploits into nuclear
**command and control**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[may]{.mark} be enticing
for states looking to [neutralize a **nuclear**]{.mark} **escalation
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the midst of a conventional war, [and
that [actors]{.mark} may [underestimate the danger of]{.mark}
these]{.underline} exploits and vulnerabilities [to **[nuclear
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. GETTING PULLED IN [One way
cyber-operations could lead to escalation is by pulling]{.underline} the
United States or NATO into the conflict. Mark Warner, the Democratic
senator from Virginia, warned in late February that potential Russian
cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine could have accidental
spillover effects on NATO countries---for instance if a Russian
cyberattack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure caused an outage in a
NATO neighbor like Poland. This could inadvertently trip Article 5 of
NATO's founding treaty, which states that an armed attack against one
member state will be considered an attack against them all. This would
be uncharted waters for NATO, which only recently publicly stated that
cyberattacks might invoke Article 5 and is still ambiguous about what
types of cyberattack---which range from virtual outages to data
manipulations to physical damage (in extremely rare
circumstances)---might be serious enough for NATO to respond with
conventional retaliation. The Biden administration has warned that the
United States would respond to cyberattacks on U.S. critical
infrastructure, such as the country's electrical grid or water supply
(although officials stopped short of saying how the United States would
respond). So far, the United States has answered previous cyberattacks
with either sanctions, law enforcement actions, or the confiscation of
cryptoassets. None of these options seem likely to deter Putin at this
point, and so the Biden administration may find itself in an
unprecedented position of having few credible options to threaten
Russia. It is certainly possible that Putin, facing a conventional war
that he thinks he might lose, could attack critical infrastructure in
the United States or other NATO countries in the hope that their
citizens will push their governments to abandon Ukraine. The financial
sector, in particular, would seem to be a logical target for Russian
cyberattacks, given the damage that Western economic actions have
already done to the Russian economy. It is difficult to create
widespread and long-lasting effects with cyberattacks, however, and the
financial sector is the best equipped and most advanced cyber-defender
in the world. Plus, research I've conducted with Sarah Kreps, director
of the Cornell Tech Policy Lab, finds that the American public views
cyberattacks as qualitatively different from conventional means of
warfare---more akin to economic sanctions than bombs. Thus, cyberattacks
are unlikely to provoke the kind of retaliation or emotional response
that would pull the United States or its NATO allies into a war with
Russia. What's more, the United States can probably withstand the
short-term damage to critical infrastructure that a Russian cyberattack
might create, and such attacks might actually increase resolve to
support Ukraine. This means a deliberate choice by Russia to use
cyberattacks against the United States or NATO to "escalate to
dominate"---deliberately ratcheting up the pressure to force Washington
to back off---would likely fail. [A]{.underline} more [troubling
scenario involves **[accidental escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[from
cyber-operations]{.underline}]{.mark}---that is, [when critical
infrastructure is unintentionally damaged by a cyberattack or when a
cyberattack is misattributed to Russia (or the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates). This is especially
dangerous for civilian infrastructure that also serves military or
security purposes---for example, harming a refugee train by using a
cyberattack targeting railroads also used to move troops and supplies to
the front. Plus, [[a jumble of actors has jumped into this space,
from]{.underline} **[criminal syndicates]{.underline}** [to
**cyber-militias**]{.underline}]{.mark} to hacker collectives such as
Anonymous. [[That increases the chances that one of these
players]{.mark} will target civilian infrastructure, and
misattribution]{.underline} to either Russia or the United States
**[[could]{.mark} needlessly [trigger
retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. WHEN CYBER GOES NUCLEAR [By far the
most dangerous form of escalation is the possibility that a
cyber-operation increases the likelihood of **nuclear
war.**]{.underline} [How likely is such a scenario? No one may know if
Russia has a cyberweapon that can target nuclear weapons]{.underline}
(or, for that matter, whether the United States does[), but there are
theories and some data about how the cyber-realm might **affect nuclear
stability.**]{.underline} American policymakers have generally
recognized that [[attempting to interfere with nuclear command, control,
and communications could lead]{.mark} to **dangerous incentives for
[states to launch nuclear weapons preemptively]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Threats to nuclear command and control, for example, could leave states
so fearful about their second-strike capability]{.underline} (the
ability to launch a nuclear weapon in retaliation against an attacker)
[that in the midst of a conflict they would feel compelled to use
nuclear weapons **preemptively**]{.underline}. Some scholars have warned
that [[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} against nuclear command-and-control
systems [could [make it **impossible to control nuclear war and keep it
limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[[leading to]{.mark}
inadvertent [nuclear Armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Despite these
fears about the dangers of attacking nuclear command and control, there
was never an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union
(and subsequently Russia) to not attack each other's nuclear command,
control, and communications. **[[Would Russia]{.mark}, or even the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies, [[launch
a cyberattack against]{.mark} an [enemy]{.mark}'s nuclear
[command-and-control]{.mark}]{.underline} system if they could? And how
might that capability affect nuclear instability? Beginning in 2017,
[[my team at the Naval War College]{.mark} and the Hoover Institution
**[ran a wargame that explored this]{.mark}** very
question]{.underline}. It took place [[over three years]{.mark} and
included 580 players]{.underline} from across the world---predominantly
nuclear, cyber, and military experts ranging from former heads of state
to military officers to industry leaders. In our simulations, we found
that [[teams who were told they possessed
cyber-exploits]{.underline}]{.mark} against nuclear command-and-control
systems **[overwhelmingly [used them]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[Because
cyber-op]{.mark}eration[s can be denied and are covert]{.mark} and
virtual, [players appeared to believe that they]{.mark} [did not pose
too great a risk of escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The tools seemed
too valuable not to use, especially because they have a quick expiration
date, with vulnerabilities quickly patched once discovered.

### 1NC\-\--OCOs Good

#### Deterrence in cyberspace is [possible]{.underline} and [sufficient]{.underline} to avoid conflict, but NATO having [offensive]{.underline} capabilities is necessary to prevent Russian malfeasance

**Maldre 16** -- Patrik Maldre, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for
European Policy Analysis, "Moving Toward NATO Deterrence for the Cyber
Domain," May 2016, https://cepa.ecms.pl/files/?id_plik=2446

[Cyber deterrence]{.underline} clearly [warrants more discussion among
NATO members than ever]{.underline}, given the threats they now
face---particularly from the East. Yet the Cyber Defence Committee
doesn't really cover it, nor will a full-fledged cyber deterrence
concept be announced at the upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw. The main
debate in Brussels and in national capitals centers on whether
cyberspace should even be considered a domain of warfare, as many member
states have already decide; the fuzzy concept of active cyber defense is
only tentatively mentioned. [However, senior NATO leaders have espoused
deterrence as a potential future direction for the
alliance]{.underline}. Importantly, several member states, including the
United States, Britain and Estonia, are also publicly exploring such a
strategy.20 The moment is not yet right for an alliance-wide declaration
on this topic, but with concerted effort at all levels, NATO can and
should continue to move toward deterrence for the cyber domain.
Deterrence aims to discourage an adversary from taking offensive action.
Traditionally, its two pillars have been deterrence-by-denial and
deterrence-by-punishment. The first refers to measures that reduce or
eliminate the benefits of a certain aggressive move, while the second
seeks to impose additional costs for performing it. [[NATO's]{.mark}
traditional [mandate of defending its]{.mark} own [systems fits]{.mark}
comfortably [into]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[deterrence-by-denial]{.underline}]{.mark}** part of this framework.
Deterrence-by-punishment, however, is far more controversial because of
the problem of attribution---which refers to the difficulty of
identifying the perpetrators of operations. Finally, both concepts also
rely on intent, capability and credibility. As it stands, a palpable
lack of trust among member states hinders collective action on both
fronts. Progress in the denial category will be easier and more visible,
but countermeasures should be considered as well. [NATO has come a long
way in terms of working together to shore up technical defenses in
cyberspace]{.underline}. The main barrier to further cooperation,
however, is the difference in technical and administrative capacities as
well as human and financial resources among member states. This, along
with differing national views, remains the main barrier to further
integration. The alliance is only as strong as its weakest member. When
it comes to deterrence-by-denial, therefore, all member states must have
the basics in place: computer security laws, national cyber strategies,
a police focus on cybercrime, national CERTs, public-private
partnerships and capable intelligence agencies. From there, members
should enact effective, actionable information-sharing programs. After
that, the next step is to develop joint situational awareness.
Typically, adversary espionage campaigns target multiple NATO and
memberstate organizations simultaneously. Early warning and shared
situational awareness can prevent multiple entities in different
countries from being breached by the same operation. The end goal for
the denial part of the deterrence strategy is, of course, resilience. If
NATO and its members can effectively work together to prevent, detect,
respond and recover from cyber attacks, this would significantly
decrease the benefits and increase the costs for an adversary. NATO
collective action should continue in this direction, and joint efforts
can help to promote trust and confidence---a key ingredient in further
cooperation in deterrence-by-denial, but even more crucial when it comes
to deterrence-by-punishment. Preventing adversaries from benefitting
from offensive actions, or at least limiting their gains, can help
discourage them from conducting such attacks in the first place.
Punishing them after the fact is another. While the term has an
aggressive connotation, this part of the strategy is defensive and
retaliatory in nature. It can refer to a broad spectrum of
actions---from naming-and-shaming to nuclear strikes. In the cyber
domain, the problem of attribution hinders the goal of effective
deterrence. For this reason, [[NATO]{.mark} and its member states
[should]{.mark} invest heavily [in]{.mark} the **[technological and
analytical capabilities]{.mark}** necessary [to discern signs of
a]{.mark} particular [adversary]{.mark}, including in cooperation with
the private sector]{.underline}. [[As]{.mark} numerous [cases of
attribution to Russia]{.mark}n cyber threat actors [demonstrate, this is
**already taking place**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, member
states should complement technical attribution with political and
diplomatic attribution. Currently, months and even years pass before
politicians and leaders feel comfortable about ascribing blame. For
deterrence to work, however, governments must carry out both high-level
and private attribution in conjunction with media and private companies
as soon as they have conclusive evidence. Calling out threat actors and
their state sponsors in diplomatic forums, public discussions and
private meetings can motivate them to conduct less aggressive
operations. [[NATO]{.mark} and its member states [should]{.mark} also
[adopt joint approaches to]{.mark} developing and **employing [offensive
capabilitie]{.mark}s for collective defense purposes**]{.underline}.
Laudably, [many individual allies]{.underline} have already declared
that they [possess such capabilities]{.underline} and the doctrines for
using them. However, considerable mistrust persists among the allies,
creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and doubt---which weakens
deterrence as a whole. To overcome this hurdle, [allies can begin by
making political statements about potentially **using these capabilities
in case of attack**]{.underline}, and in accordance with international
law as part of a collective defense response. Ultimately, [[NATO should
move toward **sharing these capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps
by using existing models based on nuclear doctrine. [Transparency and
[straightforwardness]{.mark} in this arena [could]{.mark} contribute
substantively to **[deter]{.mark}ring
[adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} and reinforce collective defense
among NATO members. [Intent and credibility will play into adversaries'
calculations for any type of countermeasure]{.underline}. For this
reason, policy innovations and capability development need to be
complemented by effective strategic communication. You cannot achieve
deterrence if your adversary doubts that you'll do what you say--- and
even less so if it doesn't think you can do what you say. From this
perspective, demonstrations such as the Aurora test in 2007 can be quite
useful.21 Other, more subtle means include presentations by top
officials at security conferences. Operations against third-party
adversaries other than the intended target of deterrence can also deter
attacks; few doubt that **[[Russia paid close attention to]{.mark} the
[Stuxnet]{.mark} case]{.underline}**, or that NATO drew conclusions from
the Ukraine grid attack. In sum, effective strategic communication---
both public and private---can be a key component or complement of a
deterrence-by-punishment strategy.

#### Offensive capabilities allow iterative training that increases coordination

**Lewis 15** -- James A. Lewis, senior vice president and director of
the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, "The Role of Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO's
Collective Defence," 2015,
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf

It could be argued, given NATO's defensive orientation ( pace Russian
fears of diabolic plots), that a purely defensive and technical focus
for cyber operations is appropriate. [[The
question]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is whether NATO can field a
credible]{.mark} military [force]{.mark} without some **public linkage
to [an offensive cyber capability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here again,
the nuclear precedent offers some suggestions for a way forward. In the
NATO phonetic alphabet, "whiskey" ("W") and "romeo" ("R") were used by
NATO's command structure in conflict to "warn" capitals that with a
deteriorating situation on the ground it would be sending a request to
release nuclear weapons for NATO use. Romeo was the actual request for
release of nuclear weapons to NATO control. This terminology prepared
nuclear capitals to make the decision on release. Just as nuclear
weapons remain under national control but senior NATO commanders can
request their release, [[the US and UK could retain]{.mark} control of
[offensive]{.mark} cyber [capabilities but]{.mark} be prepared to
**[make them available to NATO]{.mark} commanders** upon
request]{.underline}. In practice, [[national teams could be assigned
to]{.mark} support [NATO commanders]{.mark} in theatre or could carry
out some operations against targets selected by NATO
commanders]{.underline} form their national duty station. [[Such]{.mark}
an arrangement]{.underline} needs more than ad hoc coordination. It
[[requires an identified structure]{.mark} for request and release [that
is regularly practised]{.mark}]{.underline}. It demands offensive cyber
operations used for defence purposes to be included in planning and
exercises. It would also be beneficial for NATO's defence mission if the
exercise of systems for the use of offensive cyber capabilities in
support of defensive operations was made public. [Cyber operations
necessitate advance planning and practice]{.underline}, particularly for
multinational operations that are already inherently complex in their
coordination and de-confliction requirements. Offensive cyber operations
create conflicts between goals and missions for the use of cyber
techniques. The fundamental decision is whether to collect intelligence
or to engage in military operations. This creates an immediate problem
for NATO, because decisions on intelligence collection will be taken at
the national level whereas military operations are in the purview of the
NATO military command structure. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
consideration would necessarily be part of the decision process in
national capitals, which [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be an
**iterative process** to allow]{.mark} for additional [input]{.mark}

### 1NC\-\--Elections Turn

#### OCOs [well in advance]{.underline} of threats [secures elections]{.underline}. 

**Sulmeyer \'18** \[Michael; 2/13/18; Director of the Cyber Security
Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in
the Harvard Kennedy School; \"Testimony of Michael Sulmeyer,\"
https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Sulmeyer_02-13-18.pdf\]

[In addition to **improving defenses**]{.underline} and becoming more
resilient, [[we should]{.mark} also consider how best to **[counter
threats]{.mark}** abroad **[before they hit]{.mark}**]{.underline} us at
home. To that end, let me transition to how I see some potential roles
for the military in protecting our elections. I will focus my remarks on
roles that the military could play outside of the United States. [There
are two **necessary conditions** of posture]{.underline} that I see as
critical: 1. Reconnaissance Posture: [Our [cyber]{.mark} mission [forces
should be **constantly** conducting]{.mark} **reconnaissance
[missions]{.mark}**]{.underline} abroad [[to discover
**election**]{.mark}**-related** [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
United States [[and]{.mark} provide **indicators** and
**[warnings]{.mark}**]{.underline} to our forces and decision-makers.
[There will never be sufficient resources to prioritize all threats
equally, so prioritizing threats to]{.underline} our [elections
and]{.underline} our [democratic processes is crucial. If we do not
prioritize collecting information abroad]{.underline} about
election-related threats, than [we cannot hope [to **disrupt
them**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 2. Force Posture: Our [cyber mission
[forces must]{.mark} be sufficiently **ready to [strike]{.mark}**
against **[targets abroad]{.mark}** identified by **reconnaissance** as
threats to our election. [**Readiness** is]{.mark} a **[critical]{.mark}
issue** for our armed forces]{.underline} today, and I would encourage
the Senators on this committee to ensure they are asking tough questions
about the readiness of our cyber mission forces just as they would about
any other area of our military. Our [[forces]{.mark} must be ready to
create different effects against a range of targets]{.underline}.
Sometimes, [they [will **not have much notice**]{.mark}, so developing
[tactics]{.mark} that can be [**employed on the fly** is
important]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the military's reconnaissance and
forces are postured to focus on threats to our elections from abroad,
there are four objectives that our forces should be prepared to pursue.
[It should go without saying that undertaking these [actions]{.mark}
would [need to be **consistent** with **i**]{.mark}nternational [**law**
and]{.mark} other]{.underline} relevant [[U.S.
**commitments**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 1. Preventing Attacks from
Materializing: Based on election-focused reconnaissance, [U.S.
[cyber]{.mark} mission [forces should]{.mark} develop options to
**[disrupt]{.mark}** the [activities of those **planning to
meddle**]{.mark}]{.underline} in our elections, [[and those]{.mark} who
are [in]{.mark} the [early steps]{.mark} of doing so]{.underline}.
Because [these would be actions conducted by U.S. forces [with a]{.mark}
**relatively [long lead time]{.mark}**]{.underline}, scenario-based
plans should be developed and socialized with decision-makers so they
are aware of the viability, risks, and benefits of different options. 2.
Preempting Imminent Attacks: [Reconnaissance abroad may provide
**indicators** and **warnings** of an imminent cyber attack]{.underline}
against election-related infrastructure, campaigns, and media and social
media platforms. [Our [forces can]{.mark} prepare to [neuter]{.mark}
those [attacks **before they commence**]{.mark}. Such [actions]{.mark}
would [need to be **undertaken rapidly**]{.mark} as [opportunities to
strike may be fleeting]{.mark}, so developing options in advance to
deliver effects promptly when so ordered is essential.]{.underline}

#### The [success]{.underline} of election interference disintegrates the [global liberal order]{.underline}.

The Ideals of the American Republic

[The stakes in the Russo-American conflict are **high**]{.underline}.
Russian leader Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} seeks to **undermine
confidence** in **democratically elected institutions**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [the **institution of democracy itself** in the United
States and the West.]{.underline}1 [He [is trying to interfere
with]{.mark} the [ability of]{.mark} American and European [peoples to
**choose their leaders freely**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and is
undermining]{.mark} the **[rules-based international
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on which **American**]{.mark}
**prosperity** and [**security** rest]{.mark}]{.underline}. [His actions
in Ukraine and Syria have driven the **world** toward **greater
violence** and **disorder**.]{.underline} [The **[normalization of
Putin's]{.mark} illegal [actions over time]{.mark}** [will]{.mark}
likely **[prompt other s]{.mark}tates [to emulate his behavior]{.mark}**
[and cause]{.mark} further **[deterioration of]{.mark} the international
[system.]{.mark}** [Moscow's war on]{.mark} the **very idea of
[truth]{.mark}** has been perhaps the most **damaging** Russian
undertaking in recent years]{.underline}. [The most basic element of the
Russian information strategy]{.underline}, which we will consider in
more detail presently, [is the creation of a sense of **uncertainty**
around **any important issue**]{.underline}. [Russia's strategy does not
require persuading Western audiences that its actions in]{.underline}
Ukraine's [Crimea]{.underline}n Peninsula [or the Kerch
Strait]{.underline}, which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov,
for example, [were legal or justified]{.underline}.3 [It is enough to
create an environment in which many people say simply, "who knows?" The
"who knows?" principle feeds powerfully into the phenomena of viral
"fake news," as well as other falsehoods and accusations of falsehoods
which]{.underline}, **[[if left unchecked]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[will]{.mark} ultimately [make civil discourse
**impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Kremlin's propaganda does not
necessarily need its target audiences to believe in lies; its primary
goal is to make sure they do not believe in the truth. [[This]{.mark}
[aspect]{.mark} of Putin's approach]{.underline} is one of the greatest
obstacles to forming an accurate assessment and making recommendations.
It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[one of the [most insidious
threat]{.mark}s]{.underline}** [the current [Russian strategy **poses**
to]{.mark} the **[survival of]{.mark} the [American
republic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The good news is that the war on the
idea of truth **does not involve military operations or
violence**]{.underline}, [though it can lead to both]{.underline}. [The
bad news is that it is **extraordinarily difficult to
identify**]{.underline}, **[let alone to counter.]{.underline}** [Yet we
**must counter it** if we are to **survive** as a **functioning
polity.**]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--OCOs Good

#### Sustained, preemptive offense against the [initial cyber threat]{.underline} is necessary against armed attack and armed force.

\"What are Military Cyberspace Operations Other Than War?"
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_10_What-Are-Military-Cyberspace-OperationsOther-Than-War.pdf\]

In recent testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee,
Michael Sulmeyer proposed "[two [necessary conditions]{.mark} of
posture" [for]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. military [[cyber]{.mark} mission
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline} to be better prepared to defend the U.S.
against foreign attempts to interfere with elections. First,
"[[Our]{.mark} cyber [mission]{.mark} forces [should be **constantly
conducting reconnaissance**]{.mark}]{.underline} missions abroad [[to
discover]{.mark} election-related [threats]{.mark} to the **U**nited
**S**tates [and **provide indicators**]{.mark} and warnings [to]{.mark}
our [forces]{.mark} and **decision-makers**]{.underline}." Second,
"[[Our cyber mission]{.mark} forces [must be]{.mark} sufficiently
**[ready to strike]{.mark}** against **targets abroad**
identified]{.underline} by reconnaissance as threats to our election"
(Sulmeyer, 2018). Although Sulmeyer's proposal was in the specific
context of reactions to Russian meddling in U.S. elections in 2016, [[at
a]{.mark} more [general level these]{.mark} two [conditions apply to
**any**]{.mark} **application** of military [OCO]{.mark} capabilities:
first, [they are]{.mark} **highly [dependent]{.mark}** [upon **sustained
reconnaissance** of]{.mark} **potential [adversaries]{.mark}** and their
[**systems**; and]{.mark} second, [they **need to be maintained**
at]{.mark} a **[high]{.mark} level** of **[readiness]{.mark}** because
[there may]{.mark} be [little or no warning before they need to be
engaged. If a nation intends to use **o**]{.mark}ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yberspace **[c]{.mark}**apabilities [to **precede** or
**pre-empt**]{.mark} kinetic operations, then **[operational
prep]{.mark}aration** of the cyber battlefield [must become **"as
routine as recon**]{.mark}**naissance** or surveillance [of]{.mark}
potential [adversary activity]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Kehler, Lin &
Sulmeyer, 2017). [[What does]{.mark} "operational [preparation]{.mark}
of the cyber battlefield" [involve?]{.mark}]{.underline} Robert Chesney
spells it out clearly in his analysis of the 2018 DOD Cyber Strategy:
"[[**Intrusions** into]{.mark} the systems of **potential
[adversaries]{.mark}** in order [to **secure access**]{.mark} of a kind
[that can]{.mark} be [**exploited** for]{.mark} **disruptive** or
[**destructive** effect **if and when**]{.mark} the **[need]{.mark}**
later **[arises]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Chesney, 2018).

#### Offensive capabilities are necessary to adapt to changing adversary capabilities -- the aff just establishes a cyber [Maginot Line]{.underline} that is begging to be pushed back

**Lewis 15** -- James A. Lewis, senior vice president and director of
the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, "The Role of Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO's
Collective Defence," 2015,
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf

[The nature of [warfare is changing]{.mark}]{.underline} as opponents
seek to circumvent Western military power by using a blend of political
action, special forces, proxies and irregular units, unconventional
tactics and cyber techniques to find a different way of applying force
to gain their ends. [What Russia sometimes call "[hybrid warfare" will
challenge NATO]{.mark} defence [planning. A **cyber defensive
orientation**]{.mark} is]{.underline}, however, [the equivalent of a
static defence, defending fixed positions rather than manoeuvring, and
**[conced]{.mark}ing [initiative to opponents]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The next public iteration of NATO cyber [policy]{.underline} [should
describe how [NATO members with **offensive cyber capabilities**
would]{.mark}]{.underline} retain national control, but [[make
these]{.mark} capabilities [available to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the event of aggression. [NATO should be more explicit in how offensive
cyber operations fit into its defensive and deterrent
strategy.]{.underline} Finally, it needs to identify and describe a
regular coordinating process to be established (similar to the Nuclear
Planning Group) in NATO's Cyber Defence Committee (CDC). NATO would
never refrain from using fighter aircraft because they can serve
offensive purposes, and say it would rely solely on air defence missiles
and damage control to deal with the threat of air attack. Nor would NATO
renounce armoured vehicles and rely only on static defence. [[A
defensive approach]{.mark} that forsakes the possibility of offensive
action [is]{.mark} essentially [a **cyber Maginot Line**.
This]{.mark}]{.underline} defensive orientation [[serves no
on]{.mark}e's interest [except]{.mark} that [of our
**opponents**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Offensive cyber operations are
similarly a part of warfare that advanced militaries cannot ignore. The
mechanisms for incorporating offensive cyber into NATO will be
complicated by national sensitivities, and public presentation will need
to be carefully crafted to reinforce a deterrent message; but [the next
step]{.underline}, however politically difficult, for NATO
transformation [is to publicly embrace offensive cyber
capabilities]{.underline} in planning and exercises. Warfare is evolving
as technological and political developments change the requirements for
effective operations. [[Military innovations create a new dynamic
for]{.mark} calculating [risk]{.mark} among potential
adversaries]{.underline}. Forces and concepts that once seemed adequate
for stability are called into question. It will be neither easy nor
quick for NATO to discuss publicly the role of offensive cyber
operations, but it is ultimately unavoidable.

#### Less cyber offense is the worst possible outcome.

[[Russia]{.mark}n [aggression]{.mark} in the cyber domain]{.underline}
over the past decade [[show]{.mark} that mere **[passive
response]{.mark}** to cyber attack [is **not sufficient**]{.mark} to
prevail [against]{.mark} a [**well-rehearsed** adversary that
**combines** **o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yberspace
**[o]{.mark}**perations [with **combat**]{.mark} **operations**. [Fear
of]{.mark} the [unknown cannot be an excuse for idleness]{.mark},
and]{.underline} the US cannot afford [to be "cyber punching bags" in
combat]{.underline}.103 **[[Inactivity is not an
option]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Lieutenant General Nakasone told senators
in a confirmation hearing March 1, 2018 "[[As cyber]{.mark}space
[develops, the longer]{.mark} that [we have **inactivity**, the
longer]{.mark} our **[adversaries]{.mark}** are able to [**establish**
their **own norms**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and I think that is very,
very important that we realize that." 104 This sentiment resonates with
Moltke in his statement that "[[**omission** and **inactivity** are
**worse** than resorting to]{.mark} the **[wrong
expedient]{.mark}**]{.underline}."105 While DCO-RA may not be a perfect
solution, as its analogies in the physical domain demonstrate,
[[perfection is not]{.underline}]{.mark} always [[necessary]{.mark}.
Overcoming an adversary is the art of combining what is possible with
what is necessary to achieve defense. [At some
point]{.mark}]{.underline} the US must [[stop being the world's cyber
**punching bag** and **counter**]{.underline}]{.mark} its [adversaries
[with]{.mark} a few **[cyber jabs]{.mark}**]{.underline} of its own.
This research demonstrates that DCO-RA, when fully and properly enabled,
is capable of doing just that.

#### The best cyber defense is day-to-day cyber offense.

**Bigelow \'19** \[Brad; June 2019; Principal advisor to Assistant Chief
of Staff for Communications, Information Services and Cyber Defence for

\"What are Military Cyberspace Operations Other Than War?"
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_10_What-Are-Military-Cyberspace-OperationsOther-Than-War.pdf\]

[[Some]{.mark} have [argue]{.mark}d]{.underline} that
[**[military]{.mark} operations** in **[cyber]{.mark}space** outside the
context of **armed conflict** [should be **limited** to]{.mark} the
[protection]{.mark} of military networks and information
systems]{.underline}. Miriam Dunn Cavelty has flatly stated that
"Militaries cannot defend the cyberspace of their country -- it is no
space where troops and tanks can be deployed because the logic of
national boundaries does not apply" (Dunn Cavelty, 2012). Stephen J.
Anderson agrees, writing that traditional concepts of national defense
cannot be applied in cyberspace: "The US Navy defends the littoral
territorial boundaries; air defenses, either through missile defense
initiatives or alert aircraft, define airspace boundaries. Those lines
are not readily identifiable in cyberspace" (Anderson, 2016). Some go
even further, arguing that an active military role in peacetime cyber
security undermines investment in alternative mechanisms. In a 2013 post
for the Lowy Institute, Ian Wallace wrote that such efforts
disincentivized "other longer-term and more sustainable efforts to
address the new challenges that cyber brings to security systems"
(Wallace, 2013). [Yet this debate has **evolved**
significantly]{.underline} in recent years, [in large part thanks to
increasing evidence of **state-sponsored attacks** on civilian
cyberspace infrastructure]{.underline}. In a recent paper entitled
Rethinking Cyber Security, James Lewis has stated that "[[The
primary]{.mark} source of **[risk]{.mark}** in **cybersecurity** [comes
from]{.mark} conflict between [states]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Lewis,
2018). This assessment is echoed by the Netherlands' National Cyber
Security Centrum, which concluded in its 2018 assessment that "[The most
**significant threats** are [**sabotage** and **disruption**]{.mark} by
nation-states]{.underline}" (National Cyber Security Centrum, 2018). [As
consensus on the state actor threat in cyberspace has grown, so have
calls for the military to take a more active role]{.underline} in the
defense of cyberspace. In the 2017 U.S. Senate deliberations on
increasing the Secretary of Defense's authority to conduct clandestine
military cyberspace operations, Senator John McCain asserted that the
need for a strong military role in peacetime was self-explanatory: "It's
the Department of Defense's job to defend this nation: that's why it's
called the Department of Defense" (Pomerleau, 2017). This [[more
**active**]{.mark} **role**]{.underline}--- [sometimes referred to as
**[defending forward]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[is reflected in recent
updates to military cyber strategies]{.underline}. The 2018 U.S. Defense
Department Cyber Strategy, for example, states explicitly: "[We are
engaged [in]{.mark} a long-term [**strategic competition** with
**China** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}" and declares that [this
[requires (and justifies)]{.mark} "action in [cyber]{.mark}space [during
**day-to-day competition** to preserve]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S.
[**[military]{.mark} advantages** and to defend]{.underline} U.S.
[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2018).
Similarly, the Netherlands' Defence Cyber Strategy 2018, subtitled
Investing in cyber striking power for the Netherlands, concludes that
[the current security environment demonstrates that "a [more active
contribution]{.mark} from Defence within the existing structures [is
required]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Netherlands Ministry of Defence, 2018).
Jan Kallberg and Thomas S. Cook have gone even further, stating that
[[nations should]{.mark} be prepared not only to [use **military
cybers**]{.mark}**pace [forces]{.mark}** [in **peacetime**]{.mark} but
to **actively** foster these capabilities as an alternative to armed
conflict: ["Cyber is]{.mark} no longer a mere enabler of joint
operations, but instead [a **viable strategic option** for **confronting
adversarial societies**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Kallberg & Cook, 2017).

#### Balance of tech favors offensively disarming adversaries. 

**Davis \'19** \[Susan; 4/18/19; General Rapporteur to the NATO

27\. [[Although]{.mark} **cyber security** and [**defence capabilities**
continue to **improve**]{.mark}, most **[experts]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[argue]{.mark} that the **[offence has the
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in cyber space [and]{.mark} that [this
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[unlikely to change]{.underline}**]{.mark}
soon. [Given sufficient **time**, **skills**, and **resources**,
attackers could **easily** perpetrate]{.underline} [a cyber attack,
finding the targeted system's vulnerabilities, gaining access, and
delivering their payload. This is a]{.underline} **[key
reason]{.underline}** [why [the Alliance must complement dissuasion
with]{.mark} strategies of **[deterrence by
punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In other words, [they must]{.mark}
try "to **[prevent an attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}
**[threatening]{.underline}** [unacceptable damage
so]{.underline}]{.mark} [that in the attacker's cost-benefit
calculations [the **best choice** is **not to
attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Morgan, 2009; italicised in original).
It should be noted some experts would argue that the offence is not as
dominant. For example, the more sophisticated cyber weapons are, the
more opportunities the defender has to stop an attacker and the more
errors the attacker is likely to make. Additionally, continued
organisational deficiencies could be a key reason why the attackers have
had the advantage thus far (Slayton, 2017).

Though hard to accept, the [[detonation]{.mark} of a nuclear device --
[by **states** or **non-state** actors -- is]{.mark}]{.underline} today
a **[[plausible]{.underline}]{.mark}** scenario. And while much of the
world's focus has been on the current nuclear weapons arsenals possessed
by states -- about 14,550 warheads, all of which carry the risk of
intentional or unintentional use -- [the **threat of nuclear terrorism**
is here and **increasing**. For more than a decade, **Al Qaeda**, **Aum
Shinrikyo**, and]{.underline} other **[[terrorist
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [expressed]{.underline} their
[[desire]{.mark} to **acquire fissile material** to **build** and
**detonate** [a]{.mark}]{.underline}n improvised [[nuclear bomb.
None]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [[could]{.mark} fulfill that goal --
[so far.]{.mark}]{.underline} But [[that does not mean]{.mark} that
[they will not succeed]{.mark} in the future.]{.underline} Making
matters worse, [there is evidence of an **illicit market** for **nuclear
weapons-usable materials**. There are sellers in search of potential
buyers]{.underline}, as shown by the dismantlement of a nuclear
smuggling network in Moldova in 2015. [There certainly are plenty of
sites from which to obtain nuclear material.]{.underline} According to
the 2016 Nuclear Security Index by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, [24
countries]{.underline} still [host inventories of nuclear weapons-usable
materials, stored in **facilities** with **different degrees of
security**.]{.underline} And in terms of risk, it is not necessary for a
given country to possess nuclear weapons, weapons-usable materials, or
nuclear facilities for it to be useful to nuclear terrorists:
[[**Structural**]{.mark} and **institutional [weaknesses]{.mark} in a
country** may [make it favorable for]{.mark} the [**illicit trade of
materials**.]{.mark} **Permeable boundaries**, high levels of
**corruption**, **weaknesses in judicial systems**, and consequent
**impunity** may give rise to a series of transactions]{.underline} and
other events, [which could **end in a nuclear attack**.]{.underline} The
truth is that, at this stage, [[no country in possession of]{.mark}
nuclear weapons or weapons-usable [materials can guarantee their full
protection]{.mark}]{.underline} against nuclear terrorism or nuclear
smuggling. Because we live in a world of growing insecurity, where
explicit and tacit agreements between the relevant powers -- which
upheld global stability during the post-Cold War -- are giving way to
increasing mistrust and hostility, a question arises: How would our
lives be affected if a current terrorist group such as the Islamic State
(ISIS), or new terrorist groups in the future, succeed in evolving from
today's Manchester style "low-tech" attacks to a "high-tech" one,
involving a nuclear bomb, detonated in a capital city, anywhere in the
world? We attempted to answer this question in a report developed by a
high-level multidisciplinary expert group convened by the NPSGlobal
Foundation for the Latin American and Caribbean Leadership Network. We
found that there would be multiple harmful effects that would spread
promptly around the globe (Arguello and Buis 2016); a more detailed
analysis is below, which highlights the need for the creation of a
comprehensive nuclear security system. The consequences of a terrorist
nuclear attack [[A **small**]{.mark} and **primitive**]{.underline}
1-kiloton [[fission]{.mark} bomb]{.underline} (with a yield of about
one-fifteenth of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and certainly much less
sophisticated; cf. Figure 1), [detonated in any]{.underline} large
capital [city]{.underline} of the developed world, [[would cause]{.mark}
an [**unprecedented catastrophic scenario**.]{.mark}]{.underline} An
estimate of direct effects in the attack's location includes a death
toll of 7,300-to-23,000 people and 12,600-to-57,000 people injured,
depending on the target's geography and population density. [**Total
physical destruction** of the city's infrastructure, due to the
**blast**]{.underline} (shock wave) [and thermal
**radiation**]{.underline}, would cover a radius of about 500 meters
from the point of detonation (also known as ground zero), while ionizing
radiation greater than 5 Sieverts -- compatible with the deadly acute
radiation syndrome -- would expand within an 850-meter radius. From the
environmental point of view, [such an area would be unusable for
years.]{.underline} In addition, radioactive fallout would expand in an
area of about 300 square kilometers, depending on meteorological
conditions (cf. Figure 2). But the [consequences would go far beyond the
effects in the target country]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline}
promptly [**propagate worldwide**.]{.underline} Global and national
security, economy and finance, international governance and its
framework, national political systems, and the behavior of governments
and individuals would all be put under severe trial. The severity of the
effects at a national level, however, would depend on the countries'
level of development, geopolitical location, and resilience. [[Global
security]{.mark} and regional/national defense schemes [would be
**strongly affected**.]{.mark}]{.underline} An [[increase in]{.mark}
**global [distrust]{.mark}** [would **spark rising tensions**]{.mark}
among countries and [**blocs**, that]{.mark} could]{.underline} even
[[lead to]{.mark} the brink of **[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use]{.mark}**
[by **states**]{.mark}]{.underline} (if, for instance, a sponsor country
is identified). The consequences of [such a shocking [scenario
would]{.mark}]{.underline} include a **[[decrease]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in [[states' **self-control**]{.mark}, an [**escalation** of **present
conflicts** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**emergence** of **new
ones**]{.mark}, accompanied by]{.underline} an [**increase** in
**military unilateralism** and **military expenditures**.]{.underline}

To date, **[[no]{.mark} direct use]{.underline}** [of [OCO]{.mark}

retaliate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[when]{.mark} the path of
[**escalation** is **unclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rid & Buchanan,
2015). [Most importantly]{.underline}, however, the actions of [armed
forces in democratic countries are constrained by]{.underline} the
**[rule of law]{.underline}**, which translates into multiple
authorities to ensure responsible and acceptable use, and safeguard
against escalation. The [fine-grained [control]{.mark} of
**OCOs**]{.underline} compared to conventional military force [provides
a way to **[manage escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[without]{.mark}
the direct use of physical or military assets, whose effect in
**[sparking conflict]{.mark}** is **much better known**]{.underline}. In
other words, [[instead of]{.mark} reacting to an **[escalating]{.mark}
conflict**]{.underline} by deploying physical military assets to a
region, [[an OCO can be]{.mark} employed **[covert]{.mark}ly** to incur
more **[controllable]{.mark} costs**]{.underline} on the adversary, with
the benefit of plausible deniability (Hare, 2018). [Depending on the
type of OCO employed, if there is a reduction in tension, the effects of
the OCO can be [**reversed** or **scaled back**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[One]{.mark} of the]{.underline} greatest [**[reservation]{.mark}**s
against communicating a willingness to take punitive actions
[concerns]{.mark} the [risk of **escalation**]{.mark} and increased
tension due to a more assertive]{.underline} or offensive [posture.
[Yet]{.mark} when looking into possible responses -- retaliation [in
**cyber**]{.mark}space, for example -- a number of [**"self-dampening"
mechanisms** appear]{.mark} to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be
**applicable** to many types of responses]{.underline}.30 [[One]{.mark}
example [is]{.mark} the requirement to establish]{.underline} some level
of **[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of aggression on which to base
a response. As discussed above, while attribution is rarely impossible,
[it can be a time-consuming and technically-challenging endeavor. In a
high-stakes scenario the **time** taken]{.underline} to get attribution
as right as possible [means [there will be **plenty of time** to **think
twice**]{.mark} about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to **[lean
on diplomatic measures]{.mark}** in **parallel**. [An example]{.mark} of
a self-dampening mechanism [related to]{.mark} the **[cyber]{.mark}**
domain [is]{.mark} the **[large investment]{.mark}** required to develop
credible offensive capabilities. Moreover, an offensive cyber capability
is a **transitory tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability to access a
computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only temporary**
and **dependent** on a **very rapid and ongoing patching** of
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the cyber
instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might have a
de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility to the
opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline} [[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory
showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to the challenge of **identifying**
and **developing targets** of adequate strategic significance -- **not
too much, not too little** -- to achieve the desired effect. Responding
to hybrid aggression by applying "middle range" punitive
[actions]{.mark} that are **[proportionate]{.mark}** to the aggression
threatened or suffered [will]{.mark} also **[self-limit]{.mark}** the
escalatory potential. [It is **unlikely**]{.mark} to be [in the
**interest** of **any**]{.mark} hybrid aggressor [to pursue
**a**]{.mark}n **escalatory [spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where
they were looking to compete in the first place: on the hybrid
level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way to mitigate the risk of
escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight and interagency
coordination -- would be to establish rules of engagement for punitive
actions on the hybrid level32 . This would provide decision-makers with
common guidelines to pursue punitive actions that fall below the "use of
force threshold". Moreover, this could actually bolster the credibility
of punitive actions by signaling to hybrid aggressors the intent to take
pre-prepared punitive actions when deemed necessary: in other words, a
"playbook" for countering hybrid threats.

Russian Assertiveness The notion that a **[[major war]{.mark}
among]{.underline}** **[developed]{.underline}** **[countries
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[wildly unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[has]{.underline}** **[frequently]{.underline}** **[been taken to have
been challenged by the]{.underline}** experience of the **[armed dispute
between]{.underline}** **[Russia and]{.underline}** neighboring
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** **[that began in 2014]{.underline}**. It
resulted in the peaceful, if extortionary, transfer of Crimea, a large
peninsular chunk of Ukraine, to Russia, and then in a sporadic, and
ultimately stalemated, civil war in Ukraine in which ethnic Russian
secessionist groups in a portion of Ukraine's east were supported by
Russia. The fear, in particular, is that Russia's successful expansion
-- justified, it says, in part by the desire to protect persecuted
ethnic Russians in a neighboring land -- will cause, or tempt, it to
expand elsewhere reflecting the manner in which Hitler expanded in
order, he said, to protect ethnic Germans from persecution particularly
in areas to his east. Indeed, NATO planners busily check roads in
Western Europe to see if they are suitable for military transport in the
event that Russia launches a full-scale invasion of the continent.50 And
in 2018, at the badgering of President Donald Trump, NATO countries all
agreed to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic
product by 2024, something he implied was a triumph although it merely
reaffirmed a commitment they had made at the time of the Crimean
takeover in 2014. 51 In the settlement that led to the unification of
Germany in 1990, the United States verbally promised that, although East
Germany would now become part of a NATO country, there would be no
further expansion of the alliance to the east.52 A few years later,
however, NATO began just such an expansion very much against many
agitated concerns by specialists. Among these was George Kennan who
warned that "the Russians will react quite adversely" and called the
policy "a tragic mistake," pointing out that "there was no reason for
this whatsoever. No one was threatening anyone else."53 The expansion
was carried out with good intentions. and there were many statements
seeking to mollify Russian concerns including offering it a sort of
adjunct position in the alliance with the possible further prospect of
actual membership.54 Nevertheless, although the Russians were powerless
to stop the expansion, they greeted it with considerable dismay and
opposition, voiced not just by Communists and by ultra-nationalists, but
by very many in the Western-oriented elite. This should have been a
warning. But it wasn't. As Christopher Fettweis observes, "In the 1990s,
Russian protests regarding NATO expansion -- although nearly universal
-- were not taken seriously, since U.S. planners believed the alliance's
benevolent intentions were apparent to all."55 The situation was
strained further in 1999 when NATO bombed Serbia, a country with
considerable historical links to Russia, securing the secession of the
Kosovo province as Russia stood by helplessly, a development discussed
in Chapter 3. Russia sometimes sees this as precedent for its Crimean
seizure. As he was taking office as president of Russia in 2000,
Vladimir Putin did tell a British interviewer, "Russia is part of
European culture and I can't imagine my country cut off from what we
often refer to as the 'civilized world'."56 However, the strains from
NATO expansion and from the Kosovo experience were already in place, and
they gradually escalated in the new century as Putin's regime became
increasingly autocratic and as the United States, and particularly
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, together with its West European
allies issued strong support for anti-Putin protests that took place in
Russia in 2011--12. 57 Russia's concern about NATO enlargement focused
especially on the possible Westernization of Ukraine, the large new
country to its west that had previously been part of the Soviet Union.
One American observer who had served in the Obama administration
supplies an arresting parallel: "The United States would hardly sit by
idly if Russia formed an alliance with Mexico and Canada and started
building military installations along the US border."58 Unlike the
neighboring countries to its west in what had previously been known as
"East Europe," Ukraine, although fairly open and democratic, had become
a basket case economically despite an enormous potential. A few
statistics may serve. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991,
Ukraine's per capita GDP was higher than Poland's; 25 years later, it
was less than onethird that of Poland.59 In a study comparing 25
post-Communist countries, Ukraine comes out dead last in economic
growth.60 Ukraine is now the poorest country in Europe.61 In this, it
was like other, smaller counties that essentially lie between Russia and
Western Europe: Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Belarus.
These countries have been characterized not by the substantial political
liberalization and economic development that has variously taken place
in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Estonia, Bulgaria, and Romania, and in countries that emerged out of
Yugoslavia after its breakup in 1991. Rather, the "in-between"
countries, led by the most important, Ukraine, suffer from a set of what
Samuel Charap and Timothy Colton call "post-Soviet pathologies":
dysfunctional governmental institutions, economies lacking functioning
markets, a rule of law that is weak or absent, patronal politics, close
links between political power and control of major economic assets, and
"pervasive corruption."62 In the case of Ukraine, this phenomenon has
been exacerbated by outside efforts from Russia and from Europe to
influence the country. These have made it easier for Ukraine to avoid
desperately-needed reforms.63 Among these are huge economic distortions
concerning energy. The world average for energy consumption per dollar
of GDP is 10 British thermal units. For the US it is 7.5, for the UK
3.8, for Ukraine 56.3. 64 Things came to a head when mass protests by
Western-oriented Ukrainians broke out in the capital city, Kiev. Their
duly elected president, who was perhaps even more corrupt than his
equally duly elected predecessors, had been juggling various opposing
aid offers from the West and from Russia. When he more or less accepted
the (higher) Russian bid, protests broke out, and these endured through
the cold and snowy winter of 2013--14 heightened by sporadic violence by
security forces and by elements within the protest movement,
particularly those from the highly anti-Russian far right.65 In February
2014, Ukraine's president fled to Russia abruptly leaving the
extravagant private zoo he had created behind.66 In the subsequent
chaos, parliament removed provisions that had previously allowed the use
of Russian as an official language under some conditions.67 Largely
ignored in these development were the interests of Russian speakers in
the country, some 30 percent of the population, who are concentrated in
the east and south and were decidedly unsympathetic to the Kiev
protests.68 This was particularly the case in the large Crimea peninsula
to the south where Russia, by an agreement brokered when the Soviet
Union split up in 1991, maintains a substantial naval base for its Black
Sea Fleet. Putin was alarmed at the developments in Kiev where
anti-Russian ideologues now occupied one-third of the cabinet seats. He
was also deeply concerned that the new government might abrogate or fail
to renew the lease on the naval base, seen to be vital national asset.69
And he was doubtless miffed that Western leaders had boycotted the
winter Olympics he had hosted a few months earlier.70 He bolstered troop
strength at the naval base, and soon men in green uniforms without
insignia (known as "little green men") were fanning out in Crimea
occupying military and government facilities.71 Crimean Russians often
felt neglected over the years by government in Kiev, and they feared
after the fall of the president that they would be violently
persecuted.72 The local Crimean authorities organized a referendum on
secession and on March 16, 2014, a vote, boycotted by many, was held in
which 97 percent of those who voted supposedly supported leaving Ukraine
and joining Russia. Backed enthusiastically by his parliament and by the
citizenry of Russia, Putin graciously accepted the request. Meanwhile,
in Donbas -- areas abutting Russia in eastern Ukraine -- local Russians,
emboldened by the events in Crimea, organized a secession movement,
setting up their own ad hoc governments. Ukrainian armed forces, led
initially mainly by volunteer paramilitaries, were sent to put them
down.73 Aided by infiltrators from Russia, the secessionists were able
to hold them to a stalemate. Over 10,000 were killed in the violence.74
Ukraine cut off financial subsidies, electricity, and water supplies to
Crimea, and tourism, an important Crimean industry, dropped
precipitously. But Russia, at considerable cost, worked to alleviate
these problems, and in 2018 a 12-mile \$3 billion bridge -- the contract
went to one of Putin's buddies, a former judo partner -- had been
constructed to link Crimea with Russia, a country that, otherwise, ranks
ninety-fourth in the world in infrastructure. Putin drove the first
truck across the span himself.75 Efforts to integrate Crimea into Russia
have been extensive, and Russian retirees (especially military ones) are
encouraged to move there even as those opposed to the Russian takeover
often emigrate to Ukraine. If the goal of Russia was to keep Ukraine
from seeking to embrace the West while, in Robert Person's words,
"establishing a pliant pro-Russian regime in Kiev," its efforts failed
miserably.76 As one observer predicted at the time, "Far from dissuading
Ukrainians from seeking a future in Europe, Moscow's moves will only
foster a greater sense of nationalism in all parts of the country and
turn Ukrainian elites against Russia, probably for a generation."77 Or
as Daniel Treisman observed in the aftermath, "If Putin's goal was to
prevent Russia's military encirclement, his aggression in Ukraine has
been a tremendous failure, since it has produced the exact opposite."78
In addition, [**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[experience
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [2014]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}**
and crisis in Ukraine **[[suggests]{.mark} that]{.underline}**
**[countries cannot engage in]{.underline}** such **[enterprises
without]{.underline}** **[[automatic]{.mark}ally]{.underline}**
**[paying a substantial]{.underline}** **[economic price -- it is
something like an]{.underline}** **[[economic doomsday]{.mark}
machine]{.underline}**. Because of its antics, **[Russia suffered a
[decline in]{.mark} the]{.underline}** [**[value]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[its [currency]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[capital flight]{.underline}**, **[a drop in its]{.underline}**
[**[stock market]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a
decline in]{.underline}** **[foreign [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
And, perhaps most importantly, **[there was a]{.underline}** **[very
substantial drop]{.underline}** **[in confidence by investors, buyers,
and sellers]{.underline}** throughout the world, a condition that is
likely to last for years, even decades.79 As Charap and Colton stress,
"Moscow is at serious risk of permanently alienating the entire EU,
which as a bloc has long been Russia's largest trading partner and
direct investor."80 One prominent British observer puts it even more
starkly, suggesting that the events "mark the end of an era, the end of
the hope that Russia could be incorporated into a united and peaceful
Europe."81 As part of this, Russia's behavior has set off a determined
effort by Europeans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy
supplies -- a change that could be permanent. And **[the]{.underline}**
**[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of]{.underline}** the conflict and
of supporting its new distant dependencies **[have been visited by
Russia on itself]{.underline}**. Crimea was less well off economically
than most of Ukraine and required subsidies from Kiev.82 And the Donbas
region was heavily subsidized by Ukraine as well.83 These
**[burdens]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}** now **[[shifted
to]{.mark} Russia]{.underline}**. **[There have been]{.underline}**
other **[economic costs]{.underline}** as well. Economic
**[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** have been **[visited on
Russia]{.underline}** **[by other states]{.underline}**. Although
especially costly to Europe, they were embraced after rebels in eastern
Ukraine (perhaps accidentally) shot down a civilian airliner with a
missile presumably supplied by Russia.84 Unrelated to the crisis, there
was a severe drop in prices for oil on the international market, a
development that is especially harmful to Russia: for every decline of
\$25 in the price of oil, Russia experiences a nearly 2 percent decline
in GNP, and oil and gas sales fund about 36 percent of the Russian
annual budget. The economic pain inflicted by the oil price drop has
been much greater -- perhaps four times greater -- than that of the
sanctions.85 There is **[likely]{.underline}** as well **[to be
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[special political cost for
Putin]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Since he came to power in 2000, there has
been a steady improvement in Russia each year in GDP per capita. That
process was reversed in 2014. From 2014--17, real disposable income fell
by 15 percent.86 Aspirational purchases as for homes and cars have
shifted to ones devoted to daily needs.87 And Russia's Stabilization
Fund, built up when oil prices were high and meant to fund pension
payments and to support the ruble, was significantly depleted and may
run out of money entirely. Over time, **[some]{.underline}** may **[see
this as a]{.underline}** [**[break]{.underline}** **[with his promise
to]{.underline}** **[provide]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the]{.underline}** **[[stability]{.mark} and order]{.underline}**
**[necessary to allow economic progress]{.underline}** to take place.88
The **[developments in Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014
**[were]{.underline}** **[unsettling]{.underline}**, of course. However,
**[it is]{.underline}** **[impressive]{.underline}** that **[the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** Western
[**[Europe]{.underline}** **[never]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[even [came
close to]{.mark} seriously considering [the use of]{.mark} direct
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}** to deal with the issue. Although the
crisis created, as Steven Pinker notes, "just the kinds of tensions that
in the past had led to great-power wars," nothing like that took
place.89 In fact, **[the West behaved in much]{.underline}** **[the same
way it would have]{.underline}** behaved **[if it had]{.underline}**
**[not possessed]{.underline}** **[a great and expensive]{.underline}**
**[military capacity]{.underline}**. Indeed, President Barack Obama, who
presided over the episode, was given to taunting his hawkish critics:
"Now, if there is somebody in this town that would claim that we would
consider going to war with Russia over Crimea and eastern Ukraine, they
should speak up and be very clear about it."90 The
**[events]{.underline}** **[inspired concerns]{.underline}** that
**[Putin had or has wider intentions]{.underline}**.91 The
**[natural]{.underline}** **[next step]{.underline}**, suggest some,
**[would be some sort of invasion of the]{.underline}** **[Baltic
states]{.underline}** of Latvia, Lithuania, and/or Estonia.
**[Each]{.underline}**, like Ukraine, **[has a Russian
minority]{.underline}** which, in many cases, has not blended in well
with the majority culture and might even consider itself to be
persecuted. West Point's Robert Person has **[looked at]{.underline}**
the **[parallels]{.underline}** **[and finds them
wanting]{.underline}**.92 To begin with, **[[Ukraine
has]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Person calls "**[a]{.underline}**
**[deep [symbolic meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[for
Russia]{.underline}**." It had been part of the Russian empire since the
sixteenth century and is often considered to be "the cradle of eastern
Slavic civilization." Moreover, Crimea did not become part of Ukraine
until it was "gifted" to that Soviet republic in 1954 by Nikita
Khrushchev in a process that was quixotic and arbitrary and never
actually made official even by the regulations of Soviet or Communist
law.93 And, of course, Crimea's Russian naval base added special
significance. **[By contrast]{.underline}**, continues Person,
**[Latvia]{.underline}**, **[Lithuania]{.underline}**,
**[Estonia]{.underline}**, unlike Ukraine, **[have frequently enjoyed
an]{.underline}** **[independent status]{.underline}**, **[and
[Russians]{.mark} "have]{.underline}** **[[long
recognized]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[the [Baltics
are]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[culturally and historically
[different]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[from Russia]{.underline}**."
Moreover, **[Russians]{.underline}** **[in the Baltics]{.underline}**
**[[do not]{.mark} seem to [have]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[separatist]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}** not least in part **[because they
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}** much **[[higher standards]{.mark} of
living]{.underline}** **[than]{.underline}** do their **[counterparts
o]{.underline}**n **[the other side of the border]{.underline}**. And
**[because the Baltic states are members of the]{.underline}**
**[European Union]{.underline}** **[and its associated]{.underline}**
**[Schengen zon]{.underline}**e, **[their citizens would no
longer]{.underline}** **[enjoy the]{.underline}** associated **[ease of
travel to the continent]{.underline}** if they became part of Russia.94
In all, then, **[the]{.underline}** **[[notion]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[that [Putin]{.mark}'s Russia [is on an]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[expansionary mission]{.underline}**]{.mark}, so commonly voiced at
the time of the 2014 events, **[seems to]{.underline}** **[[have little
substance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.95 It has **[[not]{.mark} even [sought
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[officially annex]{.underline}**
**[separatist areas]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}**. A special issue of the journal Daedalus,
published in 2017, ran a series of essays dealing with Russia's future.
None envisioned territorial expansion.96 Definitions of superpower
status common during the Cold War generally stressed the possession of
stocks of nuclear weapons. If that criterion continued to be embraced,
Russia should still probably be considered a superpower. However, as
Dmitri Trenin points out, **[Russia "[has]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[few]{.mark} formal [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[no satellite
states]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} \... **[[no]{.mark}
[ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}** to compare with the comprehensive dogma
of Marxism-Leninism." Moreover, "although it is still a nuclear
superpower, **[it [lags]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[far]{.underline}**
**[behind the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [S]{.mark}tates in
non-nuclear [military]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Economically, Russia]{.underline}**
-- with its estimated 1.5 percent of the global gross domestic product
-- **[is a dwarf]{.underline}**."97 Its GDP ranks twelfth in the world,
but is only one-fifteenth that of the United States and about half that
of California. Moreover, GDP growth in Russia has been weak with recent
figures at about 1.8 percent per year, and it relies heavily on selling
energy abroad: nearly 50 percent of its exports are in oil and gas. Its
**[[population]{.mark} is]{.underline}**
**[[shrinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** and may, according to medium-term
projections, be reduced to 125 million by 2094 from the current level of
about 148 million. **[For an economy that is]{.underline}** **[more
people-intensive]{.underline}** **[than other advanced economies,
[this]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[spells trouble]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
As Barack Obama pointed out derisively, if undiplomatically, in his
final news conference as president, "Their **[economy doesn't
produce]{.underline}** **[anything that anybody wants]{.underline}**
**[to buy]{.underline}**, except oil and gas and arms. They don't
innovate."98 The (rather **[bizarre) Russia suffers from]{.underline}**
the same problems as the "in-between" counties as discussed above while
**[being]{.underline}** **[[burdened]{.underline}]{.mark}** in addition
**[[by a]{.mark} much larger military budget -- although]{.underline}**
**[[weak]{.mark} GDP [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** also **[been reflected [in
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[shrinking]{.underline}**
**[military]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[budget]{.underline}**, down about
5 percent in 2018 from 2017. Like China, it has **[devolved into a form
of]{.underline}** **[crony capitalism]{.underline}**
**[where]{.underline}** **[[property rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[are [insecure]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[capital
[flight]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is [common]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[is
[rampant]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[economic [stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Anders Aslund concludes, the state
has been captured by a small group of top officials with the topmost
being Vladimir Putin, who has 20 palaces, four yachts, 58 aircraft, and
a collection of watches worth \$600,000. 99 **[[Ukraine]{.mark}
episode]{.underline}** of 2014 **[[seems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like
the Korean invasion of 1950, **[to]{.underline}** **[be [a

**[opportunistic]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** probably
**[under-considered]{.underline}** **[escapade that]{.underline}**
**[proved to be unexpectedly costly to the perpetrators]{.underline}**.
As with the Korean case, **[massive [extrapolation
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[unjustified and
[ill-advised]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, the Ukrainian venture,
contrary to much initial speculation, does not seem to be a
game-changer.100 As Trenin points out, **[Moscow's]{.underline}**
**[most important objective]{.underline}** **[is to reassert its role as
a]{.underline}** **[great power]{.underline}** **[with a global
reach]{.underline}**. However, **[it does]{.underline}**
**[not]{.underline}** **[seek to impose its own model on]{.underline}**
**[the world]{.underline}**. In all this, [**[neither
side]{.underline}** **[envisions a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[real

adversary]{.underline}** **[and neither wants]{.underline}** to allow
**[the situation to become]{.underline}**
**[uncontrollable]{.underline}**.101

#### No conventional invasion [NOR]{.underline} escalation

3 Studies on potential nuclear escalation scenarios **[[The question
whether Russia would use]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [**[nuclear forces
in the Baltic region has]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[also [intrigued
many]{.mark}]{.underline}** academics and military experts recently. One
of the most radical discussions in this field is a blog post by Loren B.
Thompson, 'Why the Baltic states are where nuclear war is most likely to
begin'. He argues that the likelihood of nuclear war between Russia and
the United States is probably growing and is the reason why it is most
likely going to start is a future military confrontation over three
Baltic countries. Thompson describes eight reasons why nuclear weapons
could potentially be used in future warfighting scenarios with regard to
the Baltics and argues that according to the bottom-line scenario, the
East--West conflict escalates into the use of nuclear weapons in the
Baltic area, and neither side of the conflict understands what actions
might provoke nuclear use by the other. Thompson comes to a somewhat
surprising conclusion -- at least in the eyes of the Baltic countries --
that the United States needs to reassess the situation, suggesting that
it would make no sense to tie security of the United States to countries
of 'such modest importance that are situated in such unpromising
tactical circumstances' (Thompson, 2016). Potential nuclear conflict
escalation scenarios are in more detail discussed in another
publication, a NATO playbook entitled 'Preventing escalation in the
Baltics' by Ulrich Kühn. The author argues that the risk of escalating a
wider conflict between Russia and NATO is dangerously high particularly
in the case of the Baltic countries because it would be difficult for
NATO to defend the region. Kühn suggest three possible escalation
scenarios, i.e., deliberate escalation, inadvertent escalation, and
accidental escalation. All three scenarios also involve nuclear threats;
however, two of the scenarios stop short of actual Russian
nuclear-weapon usage (Kühn, 2018). The analysis provides an interesting
hypothetical construct for the experts at both the transatlantic and
local levels, as it points to many practical issues in regard to the
nuclear deterrence from the NATO's political decision-making process to
the role of domestic policies in tackling such a crisis. Conflict
escalation scenarios that involve nuclear capabilities are discussed
also in other studies. For example, in a study called 'Reducing the risk
of nuclear war in the Nordic/Baltic region' by Barry Blechman and
co-authors, two scenarios of conventional war ending in the exchange of
nuclear weapons are constructed (namely, 'Escalation in Estonia' and
'Regional War'). Although the authors emphasize that the scenarios are
purely illustrative and **[the [probability of nuclear use
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[low]{.underline}**]{.mark}, they argue
that it is useful to reduce these risks even further and suggest two
initiatives, such as a strengthening of the Alliance's conventional
military capabilities and particularly the ability to move quickly into
the Baltic region, as well as to establish a Baltic nuclear weapons free
zone, or at least examining the possibility to do so (for further
discussion, see Blechman et at., 2015). Jüri Luik and Tomas
Jermalavičius in their article 'A plausible scenario of nuclear war in
Europe, and how to deter it: A perspective from Estonia' point to
various alarming signs, e.g., Russia's large-scale exercises incorporate
limited nuclear strike scenarios against NATO as part of Russia's
'escalation to de-escalate' strategy; Russia is expanding the range of
its tactical delivery systems, the country's political rhetoric includes
nuclear threats toward the West, and so on. They emphasize that the
Alliance's range of response options to such threats and limited nuclear
war scenarios has shrunk considerably and that the Alliance lacks a
collective will to call those threats a bluff (Luik and Jermalavičius,
2017). A large part of the research in this field more or less considers
it likely that Russia could use its nuclear forces in the Baltic region.
However, there are also articles that oppose this conviction. For
example, Viljar Veebel and Illimar Ploom in 'The deterrence credibility
of NATO and the readiness of the Baltic states to employ the deterrence
instruments' disagree with the idea that the Baltic countries could be
under potential nuclear attack, which could in turn evolve to a nuclear
war. They argue that **[[although Russia and NATO]{.mark} as potential
conflict parties [have]{.mark} a [striking capability, it would
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[irrational for both]{.mark} of
them]{.underline}** **[[to]{.mark} execute a nuclear
[strike]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[even as a]{.mark} measure of [last
resort]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The authors stress that [**[it
is]{.underline}** **[hard to believe]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[has]{.underline}**
**[any]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[rational
[motivation]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Russia war never escalates---empirics

**[Zeeberg 18]{.underline}** -- Amos, freelance science journalist based
in Tokyo, "Why Hasn't the World Been Destroyed in a Nuclear War Yet?",

http://nautil.us/blog/-why-hasnt-the-world-been-destroyed-in-a-nuclear-war-yet,
01-15-2018

But **[[after]{.mark} all these [nuclear near-misses, one starts to
wonder if it]{.mark} really [is]{.mark} plain dumb [luck]{.mark}. The
Nash equilibrium accurately describes a certain kind of rational,
perfectly logical approach to choices under conflict.]{.underline}** And
exactly in keeping with game theorists' advice, **[[the USSR and U.S.
went to great lengths]{.mark} to make sure their arsenals would be
feared]{.underline}** as legitimate threats. **[Yet [each time]{.mark}
they had an [opportunity to make good on]{.mark} those
[threats]{.mark}---to launch a crushing response to an apparent attack
or mercilessly exploit a weakness]{.underline}**, as many armchair
analysts recommended---**[[something held them]{.mark} back: a
disobedient soldier, a circumspect engineer, an optimistic leader. The
two nations]{.underline}** were engaged in a battle of wills, staring
each other in the eyes, and they **[both blinked. Repeatedly. Maybe,
when millions of lives hang in the balance, [people are not]{.mark} so
[rationally cold-hearted as]{.mark} those old [game-theory models
imply]{.mark}. Or maybe they're using a [different kind of
rationality]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### 1NC\-\--Cyber Impact

#### No catastrophic cyberattacks -- 25 years of empirics prove they stay [low-level]{.underline} and [non-escalatory]{.underline}

**Lewis 20** -- James Andrew, senior vice president and director of the
Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. "Dismissing Cyber Catastrophe", Center for Strategic &
International Studies,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe>, 08-17-2020

A **[[catastrophic cyberattack]{.mark} was]{.underline}** first
**[predicted in the mid-1990s. Since then, predictions]{.underline}** of
a catastrophe **[have appeared regularly]{.underline}** and have entered
the popular consciousness**[.]{.underline}** As a trope, a cyber
catastrophe captures our imagination, but as analysis, **[it
[remains]{.mark} entirely [imaginary]{.mark} and is of dubious value as
a basis for policymaking[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There has never been a
catastrophic cyberattack. To qualify as **[a
[catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an event **[[must produce]{.mark}
damaging [mass]{.mark} effect, including [casualties]{.mark} and
destruction[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[fires that swept across
California]{.underline}** last summer **[were a catastrophe.
Covid]{.underline}**-19 **[has been a catastrophe]{.underline}**,
especially in countries with inadequate responses**[.]{.underline}**
With man-made actions, however, a catastrophe is harder to produce than
it may seem, and **[for [cyber]{.mark}attacks a [catastrophe
requires]{.mark} organizational and [technical
skills]{.mark}]{.underline}** most **[[actors]{.mark} still [do not
possess.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It requires planning, reconnaissance to
find vulnerabilities, and then acquiring or building attack
tools---things that require resources and experience. To achieve mass
effect, either a few central targets (like an electrical grid) need to
be hit or multiple targets would have to be hit simultaneously (as is
the case with urban water systems), something that is itself an
operational challenge. It is easier to imagine a catastrophe than to
produce it. The 2003 East Coast blackout is the archetype for an attack
on the U.S. electrical grid. No one died in this blackout, and services
were restored in a few days. As electric production is digitized,
vulnerability increases, but many **[electrical companies have made
cybersecurity a priority.]{.underline}** Similarly, at water treatment
plants, the chemicals used to purify water are controlled in ways that
make mass releases difficult. In any case, it would take a massive
amount of chemicals to poison large rivers or lakes, more than most
companies keep on hand, and any release would quickly be diluted. More
importantly, **[there are powerful strategic constraints on those who
have the ability to launch catastrophe attacks. We have]{.underline}**
more than **[two decades of experience]{.underline}** with the use of
cyber techniques and operations for coercive and criminal purposes and
have a clear understanding of motives, capabilities, and intentions**[.
We can be guided by the]{.underline}** methods of the **[Strategic
Bombing Survey]{.underline}**, which used **[interviews]{.underline}**
and observation (**[rather than hypotheses]{.underline}**) to determine
effect**[.]{.underline}** These methods apply equally to cyberattacks.
The conclusions we can draw from this are: Nonstate actors and most
states lack the capability to launch attacks that cause physical damage
at any level, much less a catastrophe. There have been regular
predictions every year for over a decade that nonstate actors will
acquire these high-end cyber capabilities in two or three years in what
has become a cycle of repetition. The monetary return is negligible,
which dissuades the skilled cybercriminals (mostly Russian speaking) who
might have the necessary skills. One mystery is why these groups have
not been used as mercenaries, and this may reflect either a degree of
control by the Russian state (if it has forbidden mercenary acts) or a
degree of caution by criminals. **[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
enough [**[uncertainty]{.underline}** **[among potential attackers
about]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
[ability to attribute]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that they are unwilling
to risk]{.mark} massive [retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in
response to a catastrophic attack. (They are perfectly willing to take
the risk of attribution for]{.underline}** **[espionage]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[coercive cyber actions.)]{.underline}** No one
has ever died from a cyberattack, and only a handful of these attacks
have produced physical damage. **[A cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon,
and]{.underline}** **[it is intellectually lazy to equate them to
nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** Using a tactical nuclear weapon against
an urban center would produce several hundred thousand casualties, while
a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of millions of casualties
and immense physical destruction. These are catastrophes that some hack
cannot duplicate. The shadow of nuclear war distorts discussion of cyber
warfare. **[State use of cyber operations is consistent with their broad
national strategies and interests.]{.underline}** **[[Their]{.mark}
primary [emphasis is]{.mark}]{.underline}** on **[[espionage and]{.mark}
political [coercion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** has **[[opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and is in conflict with them, but they **[[have no interest in]{.mark}
launching [a catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[since it would]{.mark} certainly [produce]{.mark} an equally
[catastrophic retaliation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Their goal is to stay
below the "use-of-force" threshold and undertake damaging cyber actions
against the United States, not start a war. This has implications for
the discussion of **[[inadvertent escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
something that **[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[never
occurred.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The concern over escalation deserves a
longer discussion, as there are both technological and strategic
constraints that shape and limit risk in cyber operations, and the
**[absence of inadvertent escalation [suggests]{.mark} a [high]{.mark}
degree of [control]{.mark} for cyber capabilities [by advanced
states.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[Attackers]{.underline}**]{.mark},
particularly **[among the United States' major opponents]{.underline}**
for whom cyber is just one of the tools for confrontation, **[[seek to
avoid]{.mark} actions that could trigger
[escalation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The United States has two opponents
(China and Russia) who are capable of damaging cyberattacks. **[Russia
has demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid,
but]{.underline}** neither **[Russia]{.underline}** nor China **[would
be well served by a similar attack on the United States.]{.underline}**
Iran is improving and may reach the point where it could use
cyberattacks to cause major damage, but it would only do so when it has
decided to engage in a major armed conflict with the United States. Iran
might attack targets outside the United States and its allies with less
risk and continues to experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli
critical infrastructure. North Korea has not yet developed this kind of
capability. One major failing of **[catastrophe
[scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}** is that they
**[[discount]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[robustness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and resilience **[[of modern
econ]{.mark}omies.]{.underline}** These economies present multiple
targets and configurations; **[they are harder to damage through
cyberattack than they look, [given]{.mark} the growing]{.underline}**
(albeit incomplete) **[[attention to cybersecurity]{.mark}; [and]{.mark}
experience shows that [people]{.mark} compensate for damage and
[quickly]{.mark} repair or [rebuild.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This was one
of the counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey. Pre-war
planning assumed that civilian morale and production would crumple under
aerial bombardment. In fact, the opposite occurred. Resistance hardened
and production was restored.1 This is a short overview of why
catastrophe is unlikely. Several longer CSIS reports go into the reasons
in some detail. Past performance may not necessarily predict the future,
but **[[after 25 years without]{.mark} a single catastrophic
cyberattack]{.underline}**, we should invoke the concept cautiously, if
at all. **[[Why]{.mark} then, it is [raised so
often?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Some of the explanation for the emphasis
on cyber catastrophe is hortatory. When the author of one of **[[the
first reports]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[in the 1990s]{.underline}**) to
sound the alarm over cyber catastrophe was asked later why he had warned
of a cyber Pearl Harbor when it was clear this was not going to happen,
his reply was that he **[[hoped to scare people into
action.]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"Catastrophe is nigh; we must act\" was
possibly a reasonable strategy 22 years ago, but no longer. The
resilience of historical events to remain culturally significant must be
taken into account for an objective assessment of cyber warfare, and
this will require the United States to discard some hypothetical
scenarios. **[[The]{.mark} long experience of living under the [shadow
of nuclear annihilation still shapes]{.mark} American [thinking]{.mark}
and conditions the United States [to expect extreme outcomes.]{.mark}
American thinking is [also]{.mark} shaped [by]{.mark} the experience of
[9/11]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[a wrenching attack that caught the
United States by surprise[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fears of another 9/11
reinforce the memory of nuclear war in driving the catastrophe trope,
but when applied to cyberattack, these scenarios do not track with
operational requirements or the nature of opponent strategy and
planning. The contours of cyber warfare are emerging, but they are not
always what we discuss. Better policy will require greater objectivity.

#### Russia demonstrating restraint\-\--no cyberattack

On the other hand, [[both]{.mark} states might [not desire]{.mark}
further [escalation]{.mark}, preferring to restrain the conflict to
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Each would follow the "tit-for-tat" logic and
accuse each other]{.underline} **[while [never reaching]{.mark} a
tipping point where the conflict spills over to a [conventional]{.mark}
war]{.underline}**. Such a tipping point would be linked to the
intensity of the attack or the nature of the targets. [Both
[nations]{.mark} would [keep]{.mark} the [cyberattacks **small**]{.mark}
enough not to trigger a bigger reaction. The same would be observed on
the choice of targets, with both avoiding certain critical or sensitive
targets, for instance critical infrastructures.]{.underline} In order to
contain the conflict in cyberspace, both states would have **[[to
demonstrate]{.mark} their [restraint]{.mark} by selecting [options with
low]{.mark} risk of [miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lin, 2012,
pp. 64--66). In the future, [it might also be possible to [see a
deescalation in]{.mark} the form of the emergence of an international
treaty or at least further **bilateral [treaties]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark} the [USA and Russia]{.mark} on
cyberattacks]{.underline}. For example, during the last few years,
businesses in the USA were often hacked and spied on by the Chinese
military. These intrusions were mostly cyber-economic-espionage and were
said to have supported the theft of billions of dollars' worth of
intellectual property (Bamford, 2016). [In]{.underline} September [2015,
the USA and China signed an agreement engaging both countries not to
support or conduct cyber-theft of intellectual property]{.underline}.
Moreover, the parties have made the commitment not to use cyberattacks
against each other's critical infrastructures in peace-time and to
support the establishment of international behavioral norms in
cyberspace (Rosenfeld, 2015). [Both states also highlighted the fact
that they could not control each individual in their country and
therefore could not be held responsible for individual
acts.]{.underline} Since then it seems that the number of attacks on
commercial targets has diminished (Timm, 2016). Former President Obama
suggested the creation of a position of cybersecurity ambassador to deal
with bilateral or multilateral treaties concerning cyber-norms (Lee,
2016). For this kind of de-escalation to take effect, the termination of
the conflict at hand must be the stated aim of both parties. A clear
common understanding of the terms of agreement is required and must be
based on trust-building efforts, as well as the assurance of mutual
adherence. The difficulty of tracking the implementation of such
agreements in cyberspace has been an obstacle preventing more states
consenting to such solutions (Lin, 2012, pp. 62--64). Nevertheless, **[a
[dialogue on cyberspace]{.mark} already [exists]{.mark} between the USA
and Russia]{.underline}** since July 2013. This **[[cooperation
includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Confidence Building Measures
(**[[CBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [such as the creation of working groups
on the issue of ICT security, exchange of information between the two
national]{.underline} Computer Emergency Response Teams
([[CERT]{.underline}), **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the creation of
a [direct communication]{.mark} line [to]{.mark} directly
[manage]{.mark} ICT [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal, 2016; The
White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2013). In October 2016,
former President Obama used the latter to inform Russian President Putin
that the USA was accusing Russia of interference in the election process
(Ignatius, 2016). Furthermore, Russia and the USA take part in the UN
GGE supporting the future establishment of international norms on
actions in cyberspace. [They stated that international law can be
applied in cyberspace and therefore, the rules of proportionality and
limited collateral damage should also be respected in
cyberattacks]{.underline} (Ignatius, 2016; United Nations General
Assembly, 2015). These examples demonstrate that **[even though the two
states are involved in a "tit-for-tat" logic in their relations on a
tactical level, [there was]{.mark} still a [dialogue on the strategic
level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least until 2015. The recent
cyberattacks in USA and the election of Donald Trump as US President,
bring new uncertainties.

Willingness to Engage in Cross-Domain Escalation

[Just as [the limited ability of **o**]{.mark}ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber **[o]{.mark}**perations to [generate]{.mark}
meaningful and sustained [costs]{.mark} against a target [reduces their

diminishes the **likelihood** of **cross-domain escalatory** responses

#### No cyber war or retaliation

Program Manager at Fortescue Metals Group. "The Threat of Cyber War is
Exaggerated",

11-11-2018

For the regular person on the street, the term 'cyber war' is more
likely to bring to mind the 1983 movie "WarGames" and the **[[doomsday
articles]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[appear regularly in the media
[about]{.mark} the '[cyber]{.mark} battlefield' and]{.underline}** an
**[impending [World War III]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This essay argues
that **[the threat of cyber war [is exaggerated]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** although it can, by definition, be stated that we
are already in a state of cyber war, the impact on states is
**[negligible]{.underline}** compared to conventional war domains. The
argument is presented in 3 steps. The first step is to define cyber war
and cyber weapons, referencing scholars and experts in the area of
conventional war and the cyber domain. The second step is to explore who
has been exaggerating the threat of cyber war and what their motivations
might be. The third is to explore the evidence and quantify the
probability and impact that cyberwar has had on states to date. 'Cyber
war' is a term often used interchangeably in media with cyber-crime,
cyber-attacks, cyber-conflict and cyber-incidents, creating confusion
amongst the public and scholars alike. Clausewitz (1989, 75), in his
book, On War, defines war as 'an act of force to compel the enemy to do
our will'. Rid (2012, 7) on the other interprets Clausewitz use of
'force' as meaning 'violent' force. According to Rid, if an act is not
potentially violent, it is not an act of war. However, Stone (2013, 107)
describes 'cyber war' as a politically motivated act of force, not
necessarily lethal and not necessarily attributable. The definition by
Powers and Jablonski states more simply that cyber war is the
utilisation of digital networks for geopolitical purposes (Nocetti 2016,
464). Neither of the latter two definitions requires violence to qualify
as cyber war. Under these definitions, the Stuxnet cyber-incident in
2010 and the Estonia incident in 2007 would constitute an act of cyber
war, and as such we could say that nations have been at cyber war in the
past and are likely to continue to engage in cyber war in years to come.
For this essay, I will use Stones definition to argue that even though
states may engage in cyber war, the concept of cyber war is exaggerated.
It seems that **[cyber war is deliberately exaggerated [in]{.mark} the
[media and by politicians for financial and political
gains]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are countless examples in the media
and in politics of the exaggeration of the threat of cyber war and the
language used plays a big factor in creating a sense of fear in the
community. The Four Corners report, Hacked, is a classic example where
the reporter, Andrew Fowler describes the current situation in Australia
as '... a secret war where the body count is climbing every day' (Fowler
2013). The documentary reveals nothing violent or lethal about cyber
incidents. The documentary is actually about hackers working from
locations overseas, having targeted key Federal Government departments
and major corporations in Australia. In another example, NATO may be
interpreted as exaggerating the threat of Cyber War when they invited
Charlie Millar to present at their Conference for Cyber Conflict at the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in 2017. Millar is
an independent security evaluator, and his presentation was titled 'Kim
Jong-il and me: How to build a cyber army to attack the US'. He later
presented similar content at Def Con 2018. His presentation described
the steps he would take to mount a cyber war, including the types of
people he would engage, how much he would pay them, what his strategy
would be and how much it would cost in total. Who stands to gain from
the exaggeration and hype? Logically, **[one group would be those that
gain financially from the sale of cyber protective services and
software]{.underline}**. According to Valerino, 57% of technical experts
surveyed said that we are currently in a cyber arms race and 43% said
that the worst-case scenarios are inevitable (Valeriano and Ryan 2015).
Translate this into sales and Gartner projects worldwide security
spending will reach \$96 Billion in 2018, up 8 Percent from 2017 and to
top \$113 billion by 2020 (Gartner 2017). Additionally, **[there may be
political motivations to exaggerate the threat of cyber
war]{.underline}**. Cyberspace is not well understood by the general
public and fear is natural. In the US's cyber security debate, observers
have noted there is a tendency for policymakers, **[military leaders,
and media]{.underline}**, among others, **[to use frightening
'cyber-doom scenarios' when making a case for action on cyber
security]{.underline}** (Dunn 2008, 2). There is some evidence to
suggest that more recently in the political arena; we may be maturing in
our understanding of the real threat of cyber war. The Tallinn Manual,
an academic, non-binding study on how international law applies to cyber
conflicts and cyber warfare, was written at the invitation of the
Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. It
was first published in 2013 with the title 'The Tallinn Manual on the
International Law of Cyber War'. In 2017, it was re-released with the
revised title 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law of Cyber
Operations'. The change in title from 'war' to 'operations' signifies a
more moderate use of language from NATO and is an acknowledgement that
cyber incidents generally fall below the threshold at which
International Law would declare them to be a formal act of war.
Experience over the 4 short years from 2013 to 2017 has demonstrated
that cyber incidents tend to have a low-level impact on the target
state. As the book's authors put it 'the focus of the original Manual
was on the most severe cyber operations, those that violate the
prohibition of the use of force in international relations, entitle
states to exercise the right of self-defence, and/or occur during armed
conflict' while the new version 'adds a legal analysis of the more
common cyber incidents that states encounter on a day-to-day basis and
that fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict'
(Leetaru 2017). To get a better sense if cyber war is exaggerated, we
must also consider the probability of cyber war in the future. The
probability of cyber war should be weighed up against the probability of
conventional war. Where tensions are already high, for example, between
North Korea and the US or Russia and Estonia, I would argue that cyber
war is more likely than conventional war. This is due to factors
including; cyber warfare is less costly than conventional warfare,
states are less rational in their decision space in the cyber realm,
states find cyber attribution very difficult to achieve so attacks can
be undertaken covertly and cyber war is considered 'a challenge' and
central to the hackers' ethos (Junio 2013, 128). Further, Sanger
describes in his book, The Perfect Weapon, cyber weapons (such as cyber
vandalism, Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS), intrusions and advanced
persistent threat (APT)) as the 'perfect weapons' for the following
reasons; They are cheap: When compared to Nuclear weapons, there are
only a handful of nations globally that can afford the technology to
create a nuclear weapon. They are easily accessible: Unlike a Nuclear
bomb that requires uranium, a highly protected metal, in the production
process, a cyber weapon can be created with minimal investment and
highly available IT infrastructure. They can be dialled-up or
dialled-down relatively easily. A ballistic missile, the force of the
explosion cannot be adjusted as easily as a DDOS attack. A DDOS attack
can be adjusted to last an hour, a few days or a few weeks. They have a
huge range in how they are used: Sabotage as with Stuxnet, Espionage as
with the Chinese industrial spying on the US, North Korea's infiltration
of Sony, the Iranians attack on Las Vegas Sands Corp. casino operators.
The significant factor is that cyber weapons can and are being used
every day for discrete, **[[low-level cyber]{.mark}
conflicts]{.underline}** to undermine and disrupt rivals, but
historically it **[[has not progressed to]{.mark} open [conflict,
nor]{.mark} has it [warranted]{.mark} a [military
response]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sanger 2018). **[Additionally,
[massive]{.mark} cyber operations [would]{.mark} necessarily impact the
civilian population and [violate]{.mark} the [immunity]{.mark} of
non-combatants. The conditions of war dictate that [this is "taboo"
and]{.mark} to date, rival [states]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n
[restraint]{.mark} in their use of cyber weapons for this
reason]{.underline}** (Valeriano and Ryan 2015). **[It appears that [the
threat]{.mark} that cyber weapons represent to national security is
overstated and the threat of cyber war [is
overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The US and]{.underline}** likely
**[other highly [networked nations appear
reticent]{.mark}]{.underline}** about using cyber weapons for
significant cyber conflict **[[given]{.mark} their
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ironically, NSA programs such
as PRISM have made the US more of a target given the sheer volume of
sensitive information stored in one place. Regardless of US defences,
there is no way to make this information completely secure from
intrusion, and as such, the very act of storing the information makes
them more vulnerable. Rid (2012) is among some academics who argue that
**[[cyber war]{.underline}]{.mark}** has never and **[[will]{.mark}
likely [never eventuate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The benefits of being on
this side of the debate mean that public funding can be allocated away
from offensive cyber security initiatives to other, potentially more
important initiatives, such as public health and housing. The government
is constantly under pressure to prioritise public spending and it is
imperative that they have realistic, accurate projections regarding the
risk of cyber war, the probability and the impact, to allow them to
focus spending on the most important areas.

#### No nuclear retal

**[[No]{.mark}, the [US Won't Respond to]{.mark} A [Cyber]{.mark} Attack
[with Nukes]{.mark}]{.underline}** Defense leaders won't completely rule
out the possibility. **[But [it's]{.mark} a [very, very, very
remote]{.mark} possibility]{.underline}**. **[The idea that the U.S. is
building]{.underline}** new **[low-yield nuclear weapons to respond to a
cyber attack is "not true,"]{.underline}** military leaders told
reporters in the runup to the Friday release of the new Nuclear Posture
Review. "The people who say we lowered the threshold for the use of
nuclear weapons are saying, 'but we want these low-yield nuclear weapons
so that we can answer a cyber attack because we're so bad at cyber
security.' That's just fundamentally not true," Gen. Paul Selva, vice
chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday at a meeting with
reporters. **[It's [an idea]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[military
[leaders]{.mark} have been [push]{.mark}ing [back against since]{.mark}
the [N]{.mark}ew [Y]{.mark}ork [T]{.mark}imes [ran
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** Jan. 16 [**[story]{.mark} headlined, "Pentagon
Suggests Countering Devastating Cyberattacks With Nuclear
Arms."**]{.underline} When would the U.S. launch a nuclear attack in
response to a non-nuclear event? The Defense Department says **[[the
threshold hasn't changed]{.mark} since]{.underline}** the
**[Obama]{.underline}** administration's own nuclear posture review in
2010, but a draft of the new review that leaked online caused a bit of
drama in its attempts to dispel "ambiguity." The new review gives
examples of "non-nuclear strategic attacks," Robert Soofer, deputy
assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy, told
reporters on Thursday. "It could be catastrophic attacks against
civilian populations, against infrastructure. It could be an attack
using a non-nuclear weapon against our nuclear command-and-control
\[or\] early-warning satellites. But **[[we don't talk about
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**." In his own conversation with reporters,
Selva broadened "early warning" systems to include ones that provide
"indications of warning that are important to our detection of an
attack." He also emphasized, "We never said 'cyber.'" **[There's [a
reason]{.mark} for that]{.underline}**. While **[[cyber]{.mark}
attacks]{.underline}** on physical infrastructure can be very dangerous,
they **[[are unlikely to kill enough]{.mark} people [to provoke
a]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear response]{.mark}]{.underline}**. An National
Academies of Science and Engineering analysis of the vulnerability of
U.S. infrastructure makes that point. **[A]{.underline}** major **[cyber
attack could cut off electrical power]{.underline}**, resulting in
"people dying from heat or cold exposure, etc.," said Granger Morgan,
co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and one
of the chairs of the report. "A large outage of long duration could
cover many states and last for weeks or longer. Whether and how many
casualties there could be would depend on things like what the weather
was during the outage." **[It's]{.underline}** a huge problem but
**[[not]{.mark} an event [resulting in tens of thousands of]{.mark}
immediate [deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Contrast that with a nuclear
attack on a city like Moscow, even one using a device of 6 kilotons,
much smaller than the ones the United States used against Japanese
targets in World War II. The immediate result: there would be 40,000
deaths, according to the online nuclear simulation tool NukeMap.
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[demonstrated]{.underline}** a
**[willingness]{.underline}** to take down power services with cyber
attacks, as they did in Ukraine on Christmas Eve 2015.
**[But]{.underline}** these **[[attacks were brief and occured
in]{.mark} the context of [actual fighting]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
other words, **[the [worst]{.mark}]{.underline}** cyber physical
**[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[top [experts believe
credible]{.mark} likely [does not meet the threshold]{.mark} that the
[Defense]{.mark} Department [has]{.mark} set out [for]{.mark} deploying
[a nuc]{.mark}lear weapon]{.underline}**.

#### Cyberwar falls short of kinetic attacks\-\--stabilizing

University. Previously, she served as Senior Director on the U.S.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2022-04-15/cyber-escalation-fallacy/ceng

[A third lesson of cyber-operations over the past decade is that U.S.
[officials should **adopt a more flexible mindset**]{.mark} **in their
response to them.**]{.underline} Rather than focusing on retaliatory
action, [the United States should devote more resources to enhancing
resilience---the ability to absorb and rapidly]{.underline} [recover
from disruptive occurrences. [Embracing this]{.mark} type of [approach
means accepting that cyberattacks are likely]{.mark} to take place
[and]{.mark}, more important, that the overwhelming majority of them
[will not have cataclysmic effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the past
several years, the United States has improved its resilience to such
attacks, expanding the agencies responsible for working with and
maintaining critical infrastructure, such as the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency. The U.S. government has also created the
Office of the National Cyber Director to harmonize its cybersecurity
efforts and collaborate with the private sector. But these entities are
still relatively new, and efforts to implement meaningful regulation of
the private sector to promote resilience still have a long way to go. A
CYBER ESCAPE VALVE? Just because cyber-operations have not yet caused
escalation does not mean that they will never do so. If conflicts such
as the war in Ukraine lead to greater instability in the international
system and increased great-power competition, the risks of
cyber-escalation may grow. The opposite is also possible, however: in a
more unstable world, [**cyber-operations may provide an important outlet
for recurring tensions**, given their lack of physical violence and
relatively limited effects. As international politics become more
dangerous, [cyberspace can offer a way]{.mark} for states [to respond
to]{.mark} perceived [aggressions **without causing physical
destruction**]{.mark} **or loss of life, [thus providing]{.mark} a kind
of [stability in itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ultimately, [escalation
is in the eye of the beholder]{.underline}---it depends as much on the
target's perception of an event as on the perpetrator's intent or the
reality of the strategic context. Therefore, a further priority of U.S.
policymakers should be to improve their understanding of how adversaries
interpret Washington's activities in cyberspace and leverage that
knowledge to conduct cyber-operations that minimize the risk of
escalation. During a crisis, for instance, the United States may want to
avoid conducting cyber-operations in a manner that an adversary might
perceive as a precursor to conflict or to a military strike, especially
if that is not the intent. If there is a pressing strategic or military
imperative to conduct these types of operations, they should occur in
tandem with efforts to communicate their purpose to avoid
misunderstandings. For too long, policymakers have drawn the wrong
lessons from cyber-operations. [The absence of escalation across decades
of strategic interaction in cyberspace---a record that has only been
reinforced in the conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}---[should cause
policymakers to reevaluate long-standing assumptions about the
cyber-domain.]{.underline} In doing so, they may be able to see how
[cyber-actions are but one of a number of strategic tools
that]{.underline}, properly understood, can limit the risk of conflict
as much as increase it. Of course, the potential for cyberattacks to
temporarily paralyze large information networks or even whole sectors of
an economy should not be discounted. But in a world in which armed
conflict continues to destroy entire cities and wreak terrible human
costs, both civilian and military, cyber-operations should be regarded
less as another form of hard power than as a way for states to pursue
strategic goals by other means.

#### Ukraine proves

John **Mueller**, 03-22-**2022**, (John Mueller is a Political Scientist
at Ohio State University and a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute. His
most recent book is The Stupidity of War: American Foreign Policy and
the Case for Complacency.), "The Cyber-Delusion", Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-22/cyber-delusion/ceng

[When [Russian forces launched their invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} last
month, governments and [experts]{.mark} worldwide [warned about the
danger of]{.mark} catastrophic [cyberattacks]{.mark}. Indeed, in the
days leading up to Moscow's invasion, [hackers defaced]{.mark} Ukrainian
[websites]{.mark}, unleashed malware on [government systems, and]{.mark}
targeted [the]{.mark} country's [banking system---albeit with limited
effect]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although no cyber-Armageddon has
materialized, officials increasingly fear that Russia might eventually
step up its efforts and even target the United States. [Russia's
invasion is no doubt catastrophic. But in reacting to it and preparing
for what comes next, [leaders]{.mark} in Washington and elsewhere
[should eschew the alarmism that has]{.mark} long [warped cybersecurity
policy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, claimed in 2011 that "the single biggest existential
threat out there, I think, is cyber." The following year, his successor,
Martin Dempsey, noted that "a cyberattack could stop our society in its
tracks." Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta sternly warned in 2012 of
an impending "digital Pearl Harbor." Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity
reporter at The New York Times, has routinely asked insiders when "a
cyber-enabled cataclysmic boom will take us down" and has always been
told "18 to 24 months." She began her survey well over 100 months ago.
[This contemporary approach to cyberthreats resembles the aftermath of
9/11, when almost all experts believed an even larger terrorist attack
would soon take place. Then, as now, **[the threat is
overblown]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Although occasionally dramatic,
[cyberattacks have turned out to be a]{.mark} comparatively
**[minor]{.mark} and manageable [threat]{.mark}**. Far [too much
discussion]{.mark} around the issue [focuses on **worst-case
scenarios**]{.mark}**, fails to contextualize the problem**, and
neglects to weigh the costs of cyberattacks against the **enormous value
of the Internet and artificial intelligence**. Most commentary,
moreover, does not fully appreciate the ability of the business
sector---by far the most tempting of targets for malevolent hackers---to
develop effective countermeasures]{.underline}. Over the past decade,
the global obsession with digital threats has taken various forms, with
a particular focus on the potential military implications of emerging
cyber-capabilities. To be sure, the military needs to worry about
keeping its communications and command and control operations secure
from hostile attackers. Any disruptions, however, are more likely to be
instrumental or tactical than strategic. Despite statements to the
contrary, the U.S. military itself seems to have recognized this
reality. When Panetta proclaimed in 2013 that cyber was "without
question, the battlefield for the future," political scientist Micah
Zenko observed at the time that the Pentagon was spending less than one
percent of its budget on cybersecurity, and an assessment from 2019
suggests it may be more like one-tenth of one percent. If those funds
prove adequate for the challenge, it would be something of a bargain.
Cyber also supposedly enhances a state's ability to carry out such
ancient endeavors as espionage, propaganda dissemination, and sabotage.
Analysts have even coined a new term, "hybrid warfare," that usually
includes these three enterprises---although, since the term does not
include direct armed conflict, it might more plausibly be called
"denatured warfare." Cyber's contribution to these three areas, however,
is relatively limited. Should invading hackers engage in digital
espionage against the United States, for instance, they are likely to
find that most of what they come across is already well known, and that
much of the rest is not worth knowing in the first place. Wikileaks'
2010 publication of thousands of classified U.S. government documents
demonstrated the degree to which governments worldwide have fallen
victim to over-classification. When Bill Keller, the editor in charge of
poring over the documents at The New York Times, was asked whether the
reporting team found anything they didn't already know, he responded
"no" without hesitation. Much the same holds for concerns over the theft
of intellectual property. Not only is this practice centuries old, but
systematic stealing has often proved unwise because it distracts
governments from homegrown innovation. Cyber-propaganda efforts, in
turn, are more likely to increase the overall amount of available
information and disinformation---an age-old problem in warfare---than to
provide a decisive advantage. [The achievements of cyber-sabotage have
also been quite modest. The United States and Israel famously used a
computer virus known as Stuxnet to hamper Iran's progress toward
developing a nuclear weapon. Although observers hailed the operation as
a dangerous new development in modern conflict, the damage proved
temporary. Iran quickly rebuilt its centrifuges, and the attack actually
proved counterproductive, as it encouraged Tehran to accelerate its
nuclear program.]{.underline} There have also been efforts by the United
States to physically interfere with missile development in North Korea.
Yet, much like the Iranians, Pyongyang eventually solved whatever the
problem was, and the attacks had little long-term effect on their
program. [Cyber-alarmists have also warned about hackers disabling major
infrastructure]{.underline} such as power grids---potentially crippling
entire countries. [[Grids do go down]{.mark} occasionally, b[ut the
culprits are typically squirrels]{.mark} and lightning. Regardless of
the source, such disruptions are usually brief and bearable, and
engineers are increasingly designing systems that are resilient to such
threats]{.underline}. Estonia, for instance, the victim of a major and
oft-discussed cyberattack in 2007, is now the home of NATO's Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.

NATO\'S CYBER DEFENSE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW The U.N. Charter and the
North Atlantic Treaty (the founding treaty of NATO) were adopted in 1945
and 1949 when the creation of cyberspace was a matter of the future
rather than a consideration of the times. Currently, it is clear that
information and communication technologies have transformed the nature
of war and changed historical understanding of armed attacks.
Traditional applications of the use of force prohibition fail to
adequately safeguard shared community values threatened by Computer
NetworkAttacks (CNA).\" The use of force is strictly limited in
international law according to the U.N. Charter. Consequently, the
central questions are the following: [Could a cyberattack be equated to
an armed attack according to international law? If a cyberattack equates
to an armed attack, how should the principle of collective defense of
NATO be interpreted to give member states legal guidance on the concept
of a cyberattack? [Do we need]{.mark} amendments in [Article 5]{.mark}
of the North Atlantic Treaty [to clearly define what constitutes a
cyberattack?]{.mark} Answers to these questions can provide insights for
defining rules of cyber operations in case of cyberattacks.]{.underline}
The definitions of the use of force and armed attack are not provided in
the U.N. Charter. In this regard, in its argument on a case concerning
Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice rejected a narrow
interpretation of \"use of force\" that limits the term to the
employment of either kinetic force or non-kinetic operations generating
comparable effects. The Court held that a state\'s arming and training
of guerrilla forces engaged in hostilities against another state
qualified as a use of force, a position that has since become widely
accepted.\'\" The logic of the holding leads to the conclusion that
non-destructive cyber operations may amount to a use of force. For
example, providing malware to a rebel group and training its members to
employ that malware in a destructive manner would seemingly qualify.20
However, every unfriendly act does not cross the use of force threshold.
The International Court of Justice held that financing guerrillas,
albeit an unlawful \"intervention,\" did not fall into the same
category. Therefore, cyber operations intended to economically coerce
another state to engage in, or desist from, a particular course of
action would not amount to a use of force; nor would financing a rebel
group\'s cyber operations. Beyond these directly parallel examples,
uncertainty remains as to where the threshold lies.2 1 [The NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence launched a major research
project in late 2009 to examine the public international law governing
cyber warfare]{.underline}2 2 [and cyber operations, resulting in [the
**Tallinn Manual**]{.mark} 1.0 and Tallinn Manual 2.0. These two
documents [provide]{.mark} international [**experts\' analysis**
on]{.mark} how existing international law applies to cyber warfare and
cyber operations.]{.underline} Through Tallinn Manual 1.0, [the
International Group of Experts developed a nonexclusive list of
[**factors** that]{.mark} would likely [influence]{.mark} the
[**characterization** of **cyber op**eration**s**]{.mark} by a state as
a use of force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness,
measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive
legality. Additional factors found meaningful by the Experts included,
inter alia, the prevailing political environment, the nexus of an
operation to prospective military force, the attacker\'s identity, the
attacker\'s track record with respect to cyber operations, and the
nature of the target. These and other factors operate [in concert as
states make **case-by-case determinations**.]{.mark} Of them, severity
alone can qualify a cyber operation as a use of force.]{.underline}23 In
this regard, the Group unanimously agreed that any cyber operation
causing greater than de minimis damage or injury suffices. For instance,
they concurred that the damage to Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010
resulting from the Stuxnet virus crossed the threshold.24 As for the
concept of cyberattacks and cyberwarfare, there are no widely accepted
definitions. The U.S. Department of Defense defines \"computer network
attacks\" as \"actions taken by using computer networks to disrupt,
deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer
networks, or the computers and networks themselves.\"2 5 Yale Law
Professor Oona Hathaway and her colleagues have devised a broader
definition of a \"cyberattack.\" In a 2012 article, they wrote: \"A
cyberattack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a
computer network for a political or national security purpose.\" The
article goes on to say that \"any action\" includes \"hacking, bombing,
cutting, inflecting, and so forth,\" as long as the action has the
objective of undermining or disrupting a computer network. The word
\"purpose\" seems to apply to the intent of the attacking party.26
According to the Tallinn Manual\'s Rule 30. \"A cyberattack is a cyber
operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected
to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to
objects.\"27 In this regard, Professor Antonia Chayes, in an article
titled, \"Rethinking Warfare: The Ambiguity of Cyber Attacks,\"
highlights that a cyber operation can constitute an attack even before
the damaging consequences of such an operation become evident, citing
the example of implanting malware that will be activated at a later
time, but for which the intended consequences meet the requisite
threshold of harm as an event that could be defined as an attack
\"irrespective of whether the malware is activated\" this is a direct
parallel to implanting. In a similar vein, a cyberattack that has been
launched but defeated still amounts to an attack. The Manual does warn
that great care should be exercised when identifying the perpetrator of
the attack.28 Professor Chayes emphasizes that these [**definitional
iterations** help to refine the issues, although they **cannot** be
expected to **answer all questions.** They]{.underline} do [serve to
narrow differences in approach somewhat and to begin to assure that
officials are addressing common issues. **However**, [the **lack of
internationally accepted distinctions**]{.mark} among \"cybercrime,\"
\"cyberattack,\" and \"cyber war\" [make]{.mark} concerted international
[action]{.mark} more **[difficult]{.mark} to achieve**]{.underline}.
[The [definitions alone **do not delineate**]{.mark} civilian and
military [roles]{.mark}, nor do they [designate a legal
framework]{.mark} under which to operate, since the issue of whether an
attack warrants a military response-even in the military domain-remains
ambiguous.]{.underline} Economic attacks may be handled through a
variety of international means, judicial and diplomatic. But crippling
economic attacks without serious casualties might not be sufficient to
warrant acts in selfdefense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter nor, as
in the case of Estonia, a collective response under Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty. [As for [NATO\'s official position]{.mark} on
interconnection between the existing international legal regulations and
cyberspace, the Wales Summit Declaration]{.underline} (issued by the
Allies in Wales on 4-5 September 2014) [emphasizes]{.underline}: \"Our
policy recognizes that international law, including international
humanitarian law and the U.N. Charter, applies in cyberspace.
Cyberattacks can reach a threshold that threatens national and
Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and stability. Their impact could be
as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack. [We affirm
therefore that cyber defense is part of NATO\'s core task of collective
defense. A decision as to when a cyberattack would lead to the
invocation of Article 5 [would be taken]{.mark} by the North Atlantic
Council [on a **case-by-case basis**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}30 [This
means that]{.underline}, on the one hand, member states of the Alliance
agreed that international law applies to cyberspace but, on the other
hand, in the case of a cyberattack, [a decision about invoking Article 5
will be made by the members of NATO based on the particular criteria.
Therefore, the principle of collective defense is not an automatic
mechanism. [The exact criteria]{.mark} by which cyber incidents may
trigger an Article 5 invocation of collective defense [have not been
determined. **However**, the **N**]{.mark}orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic
**[C]{.mark}**ouncil [is **very likely** to consider the following
elements]{.mark} in its deliberations.]{.underline} \" [[Scope]{.mark}:
Is the incident widespread across a geographic area or industrial
sectors? The wider the attack is, the more likely NATO action will be;
\" [Duration]{.mark}: Is the incident a single event or does it last
over time as part of a longer campaign? NATO is more likely to act for
extended incidents; \" Intensity/[Scale]{.mark}: Has the incident caused
death or substantial property destruction? If not, NATO is unlikely to
declare collective defense; \" External [Actor]{.mark}: Is the incident
directed from a foreign or domestic adversary? NATO is unlikely to act
against a purely domestic foe.]{.underline}31

Cyber technology, of course, lacks the clear devastating effects of
nuclear weapons, and that poses a different set of problems, because
there is no crystal ball. During the Cold War, the great powers avoided
direct engagement, but that is not true of cyber conflict. And yet
**[the [threat of]{.mark} cyber [Pearl Harbor]{.mark}s [has been
exaggerated. Most]{.mark} cyber [conflicts occur below the
threshold]{.mark} established by the rules of armed conflict. They are
[economic and political, rather than lethal. It is not credible to
threaten]{.mark} a [nuclear response]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[to cyber
theft]{.underline}**]{.mark} of intellectual property by China
**[[or]{.mark} cyber [meddling]{.mark}]{.underline}** in elections by
Russia. According to American doctrine, **[deterrence is not limited to
a cyber response]{.underline}** (though that is possible). **[The [US
will respond]{.mark} to cyberattacks across domains or sectors, with any
weapons of its choice, [proportional to]{.mark} the [damage]{.mark} that
has been done. [That can range from]{.mark} naming and [shaming
to]{.mark} economic [sanctions]{.mark} to kinetic
weapons]{.underline}**. Earlier this year, a new doctrine of "persistent
engagement" was described as not only disrupting attacks, but also
helping to reinforce deterrence. But the technical overlap between
intrusion into networks to gather intelligence or disrupt attacks and to
carry out offensive operations often makes it difficult to distinguish
between escalation and de-escalation. Rather than relying on tacit
bargaining, as proponents of "persistent engagement" sometimes
emphasize, explicit communication may be necessary to limit escalation.

#### Self-dampening [checks]{.underline} escalation

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation [One
of the]{.underline} greatest [**reservation**s against communicating a
willingness to take punitive actions concerns the risk of **escalation**
and increased tension due to a more assertive]{.underline} or offensive
[posture. Yet when looking into possible responses -- retaliation [in
**cyber**]{.mark}space, for example -- a number of [**"self-dampening"
mechanisms** appear]{.mark} to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be
**applicable** to many types of responses]{.underline}.30 [One example
is the requirement to establish]{.underline} some level of
**[attribution]{.underline}** of aggression on which to base a response.
As discussed above, while attribution is rarely impossible, [it can be a
time-consuming and technically-challenging endeavor. In a high-stakes
scenario [the **time** taken to get **attribution**]{.mark} **as
[right]{.mark} as possible** [means]{.mark} there will be
**[plenty]{.mark} of time** to **[think twice]{.mark}** about actions
and consequences, [and]{.mark} to **[lean on diplomatic measures]{.mark}
in parallel**. An example of a self-dampening mechanism related to the
**cyber** domain is the [**large investment** required to
develop]{.mark} **credible [offens]{.mark}ive capabilities**. Moreover,
**an [offens]{.mark}ive cyber capability** [is]{.mark} **a
[transitory]{.mark} tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability to access a
computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only
[temporary]{.mark}** [and **depend**]{.mark}**ent** [on]{.mark} a **very
[rapid]{.mark} and ongoing [patching of
vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the
cyber instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might
have a de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility
to the opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**self-[limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline} [[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory
showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to the challenge of **identifying**
and **developing targets** of adequate strategic significance -- **not
too much, not too little** -- to achieve the desired effect. Responding
to hybrid aggression by applying **["middle range"]{.mark} punitive
[actions]{.mark}** that are **[proportionate]{.mark}** to the aggression
threatened or suffered [will]{.mark} also **self-[limit]{.mark}** the
escalatory potential. [It is **unlikely**]{.mark} to be [in the
**interest** of **any**]{.mark} hybrid aggressor [to pursue
**a**]{.mark}**n escalatory [spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where
they were looking to compete in the first place: on the hybrid
level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way to mitigate the risk of
escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight and interagency
coordination -- would be to establish rules of engagement for punitive
actions on the hybrid level32 . This would provide decision-makers with
common guidelines to pursue punitive actions that fall below the "use of
force threshold". Moreover, this could actually bolster the credibility
of punitive actions by signaling to hybrid aggressors the intent to take
pre-prepared punitive actions when deemed necessary: in other words, a
"playbook" for countering hybrid threats.

6\. Expanding Cyber Security Data **[Our team has been
[coding]{.mark}]{.underline}** cyber incident **[data [since
2010]{.mark}]{.underline}** and serves as a unique example of how the
process of collecting cyber security data and evidence can be done. Our
first peer reviewed published work appeared in 2014 in Journal of Peace
Research (Valeriano & Maness, 2014). In this article we note that
**[[cyber conflict is]{.mark} much more [restrained]{.mark} than
generally understood]{.underline}** by popular discourse. **[[Threat
inflation is ripe]{.mark} in cyber security]{.underline}**, and the real
use of cyber tools seems to be to enhance the power of strong states.
The data that Valeriano and Maness (2014, 2015) have built challenges
the cyber revolution perspective and does so with the tools of social
science, and is a necessary turn given the general tone of the debate.
We first determine that a viable data collection method in light of
limited resources was to focus on states that are committed interstate
rivals (Diehl & Goertz, 2001). This allows us to focus on those actors
with an intense history of recent hostilities that should be the most
likely users of cyber technology on the battlefield (Maness & Valeriano,
2018). In our research (Maness & Valeriano, 2016; Maness, Valeriano, &
Jensen, 2017; Valeriano & Maness, 2014, 2015), we have been able to
marshal a massive amount of evidence that is useful in dissecting the
actual trends on the cyber battlefield in a geopolitical context. We
demonstrate that while **[[cyber-attacks]{.mark} are increasing in
frequency, they [are limited in severity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, are
**[directly [connected to traditional]{.mark} territorial
[disagreements, and]{.mark}]{.underline}** mostly **[[take the shape
of]{.mark} espionage and [low-level]{.mark} disruptive [campaigns rather
than]{.mark} outright [war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}**. Given this
data-based perspective, we question the dynamics of the cyber security
debate and offer a countering theory where **[[states]{.mark} are
[restrain]{.mark}ed from using more malicious cyber actions [due
to]{.mark} the [limited nature]{.mark} of the weapons, the possibly of
[blowback]{.mark}, the [connection between]{.mark} the digital world and
civilian [infrastructure, and]{.mark} the
[reality]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[any]{.mark} cyber
[weapon]{.mark} launched [can be replicated and used]{.mark} right
[back]{.mark} against the attacker]{.underline}**. Given all of these
perspectives gleamed from the data, **[we must moderate our
views]{.underline}** about the transformation that is offered by cyber
strategists who stress a more revolutionist tone (Lango, 2016).
**[[Social science]{.underline}]{.mark}** clearly
**[[matters]{.underline}]{.mark}** for contemporary technological policy
debates. **[[Absent]{.mark} rigorous [methods]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
much of what is in **[[the field is]{.underline}]{.mark}** basically
**[[guesswork]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Our work really owes an
intellectual debt to J. David Singer, who started the effort to quantify
war at the University of Michigan with the Correlates of War (COW)
project (Small & Singer, 1982). Our project builds on this methodology
and uses many of the same coding strategies. We recognize that data is a
work in progress and seek to build more and more knowledge through
subsequent updates. By gathering the full picture, we can gain the
perspective that really matters in these emerging policy debates
regarding the cyber battlefield.

Limited Costliness of Offensive Cyber Effects Even under circumstances
in which a state may possess the right cyber response capabilities at
the desired time, [its [response may not generate]{.mark} **[sufficient
costs]{.mark}** against the target [to be **perceived as
escalatory**]{.mark}]{.underline}.41 Fundamental limits on the
cost-generation potential of offensive cyber operations stem from the
fact that [cyber capabilities lack the **physical violence** of
conventional and nuclear ones.]{.underline} [Cyber weapons target
**data**; they disrupt, manipulate, degrade, or destroy data resident on
networks and systems or in transit]{.underline}.42 Moreover, [aside from
those cyber capabilities that permanently destroy data and for which
there are no backups to which a target can revert, [cyber effects are
**temporary** and]{.mark} often **[reversible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The utility of military instruments of power for the purposes of
coercion or brute force inheres in their abilities to
inflict]{.underline}---or credibly threaten to inflict---[**significant
damage** and **harm** against a target state]{.underline} (its civilian
population or its military forces) [to achieve a political
objective]{.underline}.43 [Cyber weapons]{.underline} could be (and have
been) used to disrupt an adversary's networks and systems---overwhelming
them such that they temporarily lose the ability to function or the
target loses confidence in their reliability---or [even to produce
destructive effects by destroying data resident on these
systems]{.underline} or, in rarer circumstances, [producing effects in
the physical realm.]{.underline}44 While conducting multiple
cyberattacks against a targeted state's critical national
infrastructure, for example, could in theory generate significant
economic and national security consequences, [the **temporal aspects**
of offensive cyber]{.underline} [operations as described above **limit**
the ability of even the most **capable states** to sustain persistent,
high-cost effects against **multiple strategic targets**]{.underline}
over time. [There is simply **no guarantee** that a state can generate
**significant costs** against a target in th]{.underline}e context of an
[unfolding crisis]{.underline}. This reality starkly contrasts with the
relative predictability and reliability of conventional effects. Indeed,
the empirical record has largely validated this claim; "[[the **vast
majority** of **malicious cyber activity** has taken place far below the
**threshold of armed conflict**]{.mark} between states, and has not
risen to the level that would]{.underline} [trigger such a
conflict]{.underline}."45 This is why, in Lin's parlance, "[going cyber
is **pre-escalatory**" and **[countervalue
cyberattacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} (those that target civilian, rather
than military, assets) [[occur "**all the time** now and are at the
**BOTTOM** of the escalation ladder]{.underline}]{.mark}" \[emphasis in
original\].46 Rather than their ability to wreak permanent, destructive
effects, [cyber operations are often prized for their **temporary** and
**reversible nature**]{.underline}.47 [One metric to assess the
cost-generation potential of offensive cyber is in terms of loss of
life]{.underline}. By this measure, [cyber operations are **unlikely**
to inflict significant harm]{.underline}. While theoretically possible
that cyber operations could lead directly to a loss of life, [[no one
has reportedly **died to date** as a direct]{.mark} [**result of a
cyberattack** despite over **30 years** of recorded cyber
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.48 Even in hypothetical catastrophic
scenarios, [the cost in terms of human casualties is
**minimal**.]{.underline} For instance, [common worst-case scenarios of
cyberattacks revolve around the **loss of power** stemming from a
cyberattack]{.underline} on [an **electric grid**]{.underline}.49
However, even in this instance, [the conceivable damage from the loss of
power over an **extended period** is **far less** than that which could
be wreaked using **basic, limited conventional
capabilities**]{.underline}. To draw a comparison, when Hurricane Sandy
hit the United States' eastern seaboard in late October 2012, over 8.5
million people were left without power---with many going weeks and even
months before it was brought back online.50 [Yet a US National Hurricane
Center postmortem of Hurricane Sandy reported]{.underline} that of the
159 people in the United States killed either directly or indirectly,
only "[**about 50 of these deaths** were the result of extended power
outages during **cold weather**, which led to deaths from
**hypothermia**]{.underline}, falls in the dark by senior citizens, [or
**carbon monoxide** poisoning from improperly placed
generators]{.underline} or cooking devices."51 [If a cyberattack took
out power of a similar magnitude and duration of Hurricane Sandy, it is
conceivable that an **equivalent number** of casualties would result.
[The 2015 **synchronized cyberattacks** against **Ukrainian power
companies**]{.mark}, attributed to Russia]{.underline}, was the first
known example of an offensive cyber operation targeting a state's power
grid. [Its cost was ultimately low---service was temporarily [disrupted
to 225,000 customers]{.mark} for several hours, and energy providers
operated at a limited capacity for some time after service]{.underline}
was restored.52 [[There were no **reported
casualties**]{.underline}]{.mark} from this power outage. While any
casualty resulting from a cyberattack would certainly be lamentable[,
even **worst-case scenario** figures are **minor** in comparison to the
cost in **human lives** stemming from other, **even limited**, kinetic
military operations.]{.underline}

What do the insights in this book tell us about the future of cyber
exchanges between rivals? To paraphrase the acclaimed science fiction
writer William Gibson, the future is already here, it is just not evenly
distributed. The next 10 years will likely see an acceleration in the
use of what Soviet thinkers called active measures and what George
Kennan called political warfare. We are not optimistic that the current
US administration will be able to sustain, much less lead, a
multilateral cyber order that constrains the worst tendencies of rivals
engaged in strategic competition. Yet, given the unique nature of cyber
operations, [[we]{.mark} still [assess **minimal risks** to]{.mark}
covert [action in cyberspace unleashing]{.mark} inadvertent
[escalation]{.mark} in the military domain.]{.underline} The world is
witnessing the reawakening of an old strategic practice: political
warfare. The connectivity of the modern world puts a premium on coercive
diplomacy in the shadows. From election tampering and fake news
disseminated across multimedia in Ukraine (2014), the United States
(2016), and France (2017), states such as Russia use cyber operations to
enable covert influence campaigns short of war. These operations extend
beyond undermining democracies, and are also creating rifts among
autocratic allies. In June 2017, an APT group linked to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) triggered a diplomatic crisis in the Persian Gulf by
taking control of a Qatari news website. After hacking the online news
feed, the group planted false information showing the emir praising Iran
and calling for good relations with Israel while (contradictorily)
backing Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood (Bing 2017a). The intrusion was
followed by a massive DDoS attack on Al-Jazeera, the Qatari owned media
outlet (Kirkpatrick and Frankel 2017). In effect, UAE operatives
conducted a classic psychological warfare operation that undermined the
integrity of an alliance network. The news agencies in multiple Gulf
States ran with the false story, leading to a diplomatic and economic
blockade of Qatar by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE.
Cyber incidents like these show how states are mixing the old with the
new. Much like the early Cold War, emerging cyber operations combine
espionage, propaganda, economic warfare, and sabotage in an effort to
signal resolve and shape adversary foreign policy (Valeriano, Maness,
and Jensen 2017). The character of war and strategic competition is
changing. The new Cold War is online. The connectivity of the digital
domain amplifies the effects of political warfare. Social media helps
rival states reach key constituencies in their competitor's domestic
populations, a phenomenon on display in the Russian purchases of ads on
Facebook and Twitter during the 2016 US election. The extension of
commerce and governance online creates vulnerabilities for states.
Rivals can target economic capacity in a manner that used to require
states to wage open, economic warfare. They can conduct sabotage through
malicious code, as opposed to explosive satchel charges. The question
that remains is, why are we not seeing more concessions as a result of
cyber coercion? The answer lies in the unique character of cyber
operations. [Cyber [instruments]{.mark} are a use-it-and-lose-it
coercive instrument that [come with an **inherent amount of risk**. To
gain network access for higher-cost]{.mark} and compellence-producing
[degradations, states must]{.mark} first [infiltrate]{.mark} and map
[their rival]{.mark}'s networks.]{.underline} This access gives them a
position of advantage. They can extract information and monitor their
rival, even if imperfectly. The decision on whether or not to execute a
follow-up attack has to be balanced with the costs of losing network
access. [[Once you convert]{.mark} your initial [infiltration into an
attack]{.mark} vector, **[you lose]{.mark} the
[access]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} In theory, [[this]{.mark}
additional cost [shifts]{.mark}]{.underline} the cost-benefit calculus
associated with [cyber [operations **in favor of restraint** or using
**lower-level**]{.mark} **cyber [disruptions]{.mark}** that do not burn
exploits [because]{.mark} to do [otherwise is]{.mark} quite
[risky.]{.mark}]{.underline} This "use it and lose it" dynamic is
amplified by the shadow of the future unique to political warfare in the
digital domain. For leading powers such as United States that have
multiple cyber rivals (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea), the [cost
associated with burning a vulnerability is increased. Once a cyber
operation is outed, states and the private sector move to **patch the
vulnerability**.]{.underline} There are not an infinite number of
vulnerabilities. Therefore, [every attack]{.underline}, in theory,
[**decreases the number of future attacks you can launch** against a
rival.]{.underline} For the United States, this condition means that if
it chooses to launch a cyber degradation action against China, that
specific attack vector will likely be lost in exchanges with Russia.
Therefore, while the world is likely to see an increase in election
hacking, false flag operations, DDoS attacks targeting key companies,
and ransomware, there is unlikely to be an increase in political
concessions. The risk of 21st-century cyber disruption and intrigue lies
more in proliferation risks. [[A further constraining feature]{.mark} on
launching cyber operations [is]{.mark} the fact [that]{.mark}, unlike a
limited missile strike, [the **rival can copy the code** and **increase
its own cyber capabilities**.]{.mark} Rivals learn from and can emulate
cyber coercive instruments at a faster rate than they can from military
competition. States find it is easier to replicate code]{.underline}
associated with a rival's cyber offensive operation than they do
building a fifth-generation aircraft based on stolen plans.
