Ulrike Esther **Franke, 2021** (Ulrike Esther Franke, 2021, European
Council on Foreign Relations, ARTIFICIAL DIVIDE: HOW EUROPE AND AMERICA
COULD CLASH OVER AI, https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep29123,

[Obstacles to cooperation Both sides]{.underline} of the Atlantic
[are]{.underline} already [motivated to cooperate with each other on
AI]{.underline}. But, [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[shared
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[transatlantic cooperation on AI may
not be straightforward]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Four trends, in
particular, could pose problems: [transatlantic estrangement; European
digital autonomy efforts; differing views on China]{.underline}; and,
potentially, Brexit. **[Transatlantic estrangement]{.underline}**
**[[The transatlantic alliance has had a bad four
years]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Trump administration's criticism of
the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, the president's
[threats to leave NATO]{.underline}, [and his active criticism of the
EU]{.underline} all made Europeans wonder whether they had lost their
most important partner. Moreover, [in light of the conflict over
5G]{.underline}, in the minds of many Europeans,
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[in particular has become an area
that creates conflict in the transatlantic
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark} [[rather than]{.underline}]{.mark}
fostering [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although transatlantic
[relations are likely to improve under Biden, substantial damage has
been done]{.underline}, and it will take some time to mend these ties.
But, even if relations improve, **[it is becoming increasingly obvious
that US has a diminishing interest in Europe]{.underline}** as a
geopolitically important part of the world. This trend was already
visible under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. It is, therefore,
unsurprising that, on technology cooperation, both sides emphasise the
importance of working with other actors as well as each other. [The US
National Security Commission on AI, for example, recommends that the US
Departments of State and Defense "should negotiate formal AI cooperation
agreements with Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and
Vietnam]{.underline}". Its March 2020 report emphasises on several
occasions the importance of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.
Meanwhile, Europeans are pursuing the idea of an alliance for
multilateralism. And, on technology and AI more specifically, they have
also begun to reach out to other democratic allies. [**European digital
autonomy** The most important aspect of transatlantic
estrangement]{.underline}, [however, is not the loss of trust between
the US and Europe -- which they will eventually reverse]{.underline}.
Rather, during the four years of the Trump administration, and partly in
response to isolationist tendencies in the US, **[[Europeans have
become]{.underline}]{.mark}** much **[[more comfortable talking
about]{.underline}]{.mark}** European **[[strategic
autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}** or sovereignty. [Without
encouraging]{.underline} the narrative [that these efforts are directed
against the US, or were primarily an answer to Trump]{.underline},
Europeans aim **[[to empower Europe as an actor]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in its own right. In the technological realm, this led to the idea of
[[European digital sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, the aim of which is
to build up European technological capabilities. Although [European
digital sovereignty is not specifically targeted at the US]{.underline},
it [[has led]{.underline}]{.mark}, among other things, [[to efforts such
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the possible **[[regulation of American
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology [[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
concerns over American firms]{.underline} acquiring European start-ups.
[European campaigners and some policymakers believe US tech giants such
as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon are forces to protect
against]{.underline}. [[European thinking on
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology partly **[[developed in opposition to
the US]{.underline}]{.mark}** and US companies. Thus, **[European
efforts to build up digital sovereignty may impede transatlantic
cooperation.]{.underline}** The EU's [[effort to strengthen ethical
AI]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to make 'trustworthy AI' a unique selling
point for Europe, might [[also end up creating problems for
transatlantic cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many EU policymakers
believe that the EU's insistence on ethical AI will eventually become a
location advantage for Europe (much like data privacy): as more people
become concerned about unethical AI and data security, they will prefer
to use or buy AI 'made in Europe' rather than elsewhere. In this
respect, two European aims are at odds with each other: on the one hand,
Europeans want to ensure that AI is developed and used in an ethical
way. Partnering with a powerful player such as the US on this matter
should be an obvious way to help them achieve this goal. However, if the
EU considers ethical AI not just a goal for humanity but a development
that may also create commercial advantages for Europe, then
**[transatlantic cooperation on this issue is
counterproductive]{.underline}**, as it would undermine Europe's
uniqueness. Finally, many Europeans have expressed scepticism about the
extent to which Europe and the US are indeed aligned on ethical AI
principles. For example, the Danish national AI strategy argues for a
common ethical and human-centred basis for AI. It describes ethical AI
as a particularly European approach: "[Europe]{.underline} and Denmark
[should not copy the US]{.underline} or China. Both countries are
investing heavily in artificial intelligence, but with little regard for
responsibility, ethical principles and privacy." **[Many Europeans feel
that the US "has no idea how to regulate" cyberspace]{.underline}** and
continues to show little enthusiasm for doing so. The EU, however, likes
to think of itself as a trailblazer when it comes to digital rights,
such as the 2014 "right to be forgotten" or the 2018 General Data
Protection Regulation. **[Differing views on China]{.underline}** As
noted, only a few European states look at AI through a geopolitical
lens, and EU efforts on this matter focus primarily on strengthening the
EU as a global player. This means that [the American interest in using
**[transatlantic cooperation as a means to curb Chinese
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} is **[[likely to have only limited traction
in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [US companies, rather than Chinese
ones, currently remain the primary 'other' for Europe to measure itself
against]{.underline}. European regulation efforts still concentrate on
US companies rather than Chinese firms. In light of recent changes in
language on China in both NATO and the EU, which describe the country as
a "strategic competitor" and "systemic rival", [European and American
views of China may converge eventually]{.underline}. But, **[at the
moment, Europeans do not feel the same urgency as the US]{.underline}**
when it comes to pushing back against China. Unfortunately **[for those
in the US who favour greater transatlantic cooperation]{.underline}**,
the European nation that most often thinks in geopolitical terms,
**[France, is among those most sceptical of the US]{.underline}**.

**[A Pivot Point of U.S. Confidence]{.underline}**

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should
launch]{.underline}]{.mark} a signature [[global initiative
on]{.underline}]{.mark} Covid-19 [[vaccine supply]{.underline}]{.mark},

epidemic over the course of the summer, and **[[it should seize that

domestic challenges and [[making the case for U.S. global
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} to the American people. The
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[has already taken
important]{.underline}]{.mark} [[steps to]{.underline}]{.mark} support
[[the global vaccination effort]{.underline}]{.mark} but should do more,
quickly, to lay the diplomatic and operational groundwork, leveraging
the global leadership role of the Office of the President and President
Biden's personal commitment. [The administration should signal its
intent to begin to scale up the sharing of vaccine doses with lower- and
middle-income countries]{.underline}, beginning at the earliest possible
moment and accelerating through the fall. It should work with
international partners to develop an international coalitional effort to
bring greater transparency and accountability to the global vaccine
marketplace and to create voluntary incentives for technology transfer
to increase regional manufacturing capacity. It should [prioritize
improving production, quality control, and pricing to ensure equitable
access to vaccines]{.underline}. And it should spearhead innovations
that will strengthen partner country readiness and increase public trust
and confidence in vaccines and vaccine demand. These are fundamentally
ethical, economic, and national security matters. [[Concerted U.S.
action]{.underline}]{.mark} internationally [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}
strengthen the protection of Americans at home but also [[lift the
threat posed by the pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark} to the world's most
vulnerable populations, [[expedite the reopening of the global
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[and enhance U.S.
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in shaping solutions that align with
U.S. values and interests. These goals can be advanced while epidemic
controls are consolidated at home. And even in the setting of a
successful domestic vaccination campaign, failure to adequately address
critical vaccine shortages abroad means extended time periods for
Covid-19 transmission globally. This longer pandemic window will
accentuate human suffering, hamper global economic development, continue
to limit international travel for at least the next one to two years,
and increase the risk of vaccine-escape variants that can undermine
control in the United States and globally.

### VS Cyber

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its unilateral security measures in the realm of cybersecurity by \[doing the aff\]

#### The US is miles ahead of the competition -- but refuses to use its capabilities -- the CP resolves that without involving NATO 

Joseph **Marks, 21**, (Joseph Marks, Anchor of The Cybersecurity 202
newsletter, 6-28-2021, Washington Post, Analysis,

6-24-2022) SCade

**[[The United States remains]{.underline}]{.mark}** by far **[[the
world's most cyber-capable nation with no major
competitors]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the title. [That's the conclusion
from a mammoth 182-page report]{.underline} released today by British
think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies [that
reviews the cyber capabilities of 15 of the world's biggest players in
hacking and digital defense]{.underline}. The report assesses both
government and private-sector capabilities. The report relegates [the
most troublesome U.S. adversaries, Russia and China, to a second tier of
cyber powers]{.underline}. That group [also contains the United Kingdom,
Canada, Australia, Israel and France.]{.underline} However, [China's
rapid digital development]{.underline} and its growing slate of
technology firms [make it "the only state currently on a trajectory to
join the U.S]{.underline}. in the first tier of cyber powers," the
authors warn. [The report marks a major endorsement for U.S. cyber
capabilities]{.underline}, which have been called into question by a
string of major cyberattacks by Kremlin-linked hackers and Russia-based
cybercriminals. It also comes as U.S. officials are struggling to temper
the global growth of Chinese tech firms, which they fear could give
Beijing a critical edge in cyber competition. "China has made
significant progress in bolstering its capabilities since 2014, but
nowhere near enough to close the gap with the U.S.," said IISS Senior
Fellow for Cyber, Space and Future Conflict Greg Austin. "The main
reason is the relative standing of the two nations' digital economies,
where the U.S. remains far advanced despite China's digital progress."
Yet [[all of the U.S. advantages in cyberspace haven't kept it
safe]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[American companies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
government agencies [[are being pummeled by less capable
nations]{.underline}]{.mark} --- including not just Russia and China but
also Iran and North Korea. And [[U.S. government hackers are less likely
to punch back because]{.underline}]{.mark} they're trying to follow
rules [[of good behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} in cyberspace
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[[adversaries
ignore]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to the report. "**[The ways in
which the U.S. wields its cyber power appear politically and legally
constrained]{.underline}** when compared with its main cyber
adversaries," the report notes. It adds that "factors have combined to
give the adversaries of the U.S. an edge in the use of unsophisticated
cyber techniques that are aimed at subversion but pitched below the
legal threshold for an act of aggression that might justify an armed
response." In other words, [U.S. officials can\'t legally justify
responding to most adversary hacks by counterpunching with]{.underline}
traditional arms or [cyberattacks]{.underline}. But more measured
responses, such as economic sanctions and indicting hackers, have done
little to deter adversaries. IISS places Iran and North Korea in a third
tier of cyber capability along with India, Japan, Indonesia and
Malaysia.

### 2NC\-\--US Leadership Key

#### Only the US has ethical AI standards -- key to set norms globally and counteract bad norms by Russia and China

[Even if military AI systems work exactly as intended]{.underline}, [[is

decision-maker in the \"kill chain]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" so that no
weapon will pick a target and fire on its own without an OK. But [[other
nations may not be as careful]{.underline}]{.mark}, he says. \"As far as
we know, **[[the U.S. military is the only one that has established
ethical principles for AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" Twenty-two nations
have asked the United Nations to ban automated weapons capable of
operating outside human oversight, but so far no agreements have been
signed. Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups have called for
similar bans to no avail. If Russia, China and others give AI weapons
the authority to choose targets, the U.S. may face a choice: go along or
operate at a military disadvantage. [That sets up a

### 2NC\-\--NATO Fails in AI

#### Too many operational constraints and interoperability challenges for NATO's AI Adoption 

Dr. Sanur **Sharma, 22**, (Dr. Sanur Sharma, Dr Sanur Sharma is

[NATO's AI Adoption: Challenges and Limitations]{.underline}

[The influence of AI on NATO comes with a set of opportunities,
challenges and risks]{.underline}. Its adoption process has been
incremental and prescriptive. The **[rising geopolitical conflicts and
the use of AI]{.underline}** in such conflicts **[have required the
establishment of a dynamic ecosystem to support
interoperability]{.underline}**. The [military adoption of AI requires
an innovation ecosystem that is self-sufficient, supports deterrence and
resilience]{.underline}, and encompasses the strategic innovation
process. [[NATO's AI strategy raises many concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[related to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}-driven
[[autonomous weapon systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[as it does not
adequately address the development]{.underline}]{.mark}** of such
systems, **[[its deployment and governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The
AI strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly [[talks about the ethical and
responsible use of AI]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[and has
omitted]{.underline}]{.mark}** the challenges related to **[[the use of
lethal autonomous weapon systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For the US, its
priorities lie in ensuring responsible use of AI-enabled systems with
their allies for operational and data sharing. [[It remains to be seen
if all the 30 NATO states agree on the same rules]{.underline}]{.mark}
and would be willing to agree on practical guidelines for the
operational use of AI-enabled systems. [[Another challenge for
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[is to standardise
rules]{.underline}]{.mark}** for all member states in dealing with
AI-enabled autonomous weapon systems. Countries like
[Turkey]{.underline} are [working on autonomous weapons]{.underline} and
have developed AI-enabled loitering munitions. Turkey has requested the
US for upgraded F-16 fighter jets that are said to be AI-enabled.25 The
Biden Administration has asked the Congress to approve the upgrade of
Turkey's F-16 fighter jet fleet.26 Turkey's armed drones have also been
used in the Ukraine conflict. For smooth functioning of such systems**[,
it will be necessary for all NATO members to have standardised
rules]{.underline}** when it comes to deployment of such systems. Also,
[[there is no transparent allocation of roles]{.underline}]{.mark} for
different NATO bodies, **[[and "no dedicated line of funding" for its AI
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.27 The finances are shared through
multiple funding like NATO Innovation Fund and DIANA which manages
funding for various other projects leading to uncertainty over
availability of funds and budget cuts. This will be a **[[significant
challenge for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[effective implementation of
the AI strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.28 Some other challenges with the
adoption of AI strategy through innovation include [fragmented national
innovation initiatives]{.underline}, **[allied technological
categorisation and digitisation gaps, speed of adoption and spending
levels and the underuse of NATO's mechanisms to undertake collaborative
defence innovation]{.underline}**.29 [NATO will also have to focus on
the vulnerabilities and intrusion issues with the AI-enabled
systems]{.underline} and will need to set up dedicated centres for AI
development and testing in order to maintain a test-safety regime for
systems-of-systems employed using AI. The challenges related to AI use
in wars and geopolitical conflicts need to be addressed to generate
confidence in the use of such systems. Additionally, testing mechanisms
and accuracy standards need to be implemented for system components.
Policymakers need to address the operational risks and ethical
considerations of employing AI in military systems.

#### NATO is ill-equipped for AI warfare -- ambiguity and lack of norms

[[The future of war]{.underline}]{.mark}fare [[will involve
a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence
systems acting [[as lethal weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, and much like
cyber a decade ago, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies are
**[[ill-equipped to manage the potential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
said current and former European leaders speaking at the Munich Security
Conference. Kersti Kaljulaid, president of Estonia, estimated a 50
percent chance that by the middle of this century we will have an AI
system capable of launching a lethal attack. And yet, just as the world
was not prepared for a cyberattack when Russia first launched a
cyberattack against Estonia in 2007 --- bombarding websites of Estonian
parliament, banks, ministries, and news outlets --- there is no strategy
or international law to deter such tactics of warfare. First, "[we need
to understand the risks]{.underline} --- what we're afraid of," said
Kaljulaid,, [pointing to three]{.underline}: someone [[using AI
disruptively]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[intelligence going
widespread]{.underline}]{.mark}; **[[and AI depleting
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "Right now we know we want to give
systems some right of auto decision-making when it has the necessarily
information to react," Kaljulaid said. But once that is accomplished,
"then we have the responsibility" to establish standards --- the ability
to apply reporting requirements to AI system, or to even shutdown
systems if they are deemed threatening. The kind of standards gradually
being put in place for cybersecurity "need to apply to the AI world,
exactly the same way," she said. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} such
[[standards to potentially be established for AI]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[there must be acceptable models of use in
combat]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and in conjunction with that, when there
is evidence that AI is deployed outside those established boundaries,
there must be a right to intervene. And much like nuclear
non-proliferation efforts, "if we say that we will have the right to
intervene, we have to have the right to international inspection,"
Kaljulaid said. Among the standards advocated by Anders Fogh Rasmussen,
former NATO secretary general, is that AI always involve human beings.
There are three options, he said during the panel: humans can be in
charge, always "in the loop;" humans can be "on the loop" through a
supervisory role, able to intervene; or humans can be "out of the loop"
-- telling the system to attack, and then leaving the rest to the
machine. "I'm in favor of trying to introduce legally binding
\[standards\] that will prevent production and use of these kinds of
autonomous lethal weapons," Rasmussen said, strongly advocating for a
human role. But such **[[standards don't come
fast]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It took until 2017 for NATO to declare that
a cyberattack would spur an Article 5 response -- that being, collective
defense among allies --- after a massive computer hack paralyzed
portions of government and businesses in Ukraine before spreading around
the globe. In the meantime, much like cybersecurity, **[[AI presents an
opportunity for Russia as well as China to use "grey
zones]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Rasmussen -- not initiating open
military conflict, but provoking allies enough to disrupt.

Preface It is in [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[strategic interests to ensure that the world mobilizes effectively to
end the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic]{.underline}. [[A proactive U.S. role is
essential]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to secure the
gains]{.underline}]{.mark} underway **[[in the United States and ensure
Americans' health, safety, and prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}** into
the future. [Helping to secure the future of lower- and middle-income
countries is also simply the right thing to do, on humanitarian,
economic, and security grounds.]{.underline} Today, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[is quickly
approaching a moment]{.underline}]{.mark}** of genuine promise, **[[when
exceptionally effective vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[accelerated
distribution at home]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} an [enlarged
American vaccine industrial base open the door for]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration **[[to
bring]{.underline}]{.mark}** American **[[leadership to urgent global
vaccine challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States' health,
economic, and national security interests argue for seizing this moment,
beginning with [presidential leadership to explain the stakes to
Americans still legitimately worried about the epidemic at
home]{.underline}. The United States ignores at its own peril the acute
threat posed by viral variants, geopolitical rivals who take advantage
of the moment, and [deep vaccine inequity around the world]{.underline}.
[By sharing American vaccine resources]{.underline} starting at the
soonest possible moment, [the United States can claim ascendancy against
these risks]{.underline}. That essential step should be part of a
four-part U.S. diplomatic strategy that will: Bring order to the
Covid-19 vaccine marketplace; Expand global Covid-19 vaccine supply,
including by enhancing manufacturing capacity; Build local Covid-19
vaccine distribution capacity; and Strengthen global demand for Covid-19
vaccines. A Pivot Point of U.S. Confidence The United States should
[launch a signature global initiative on Covid-19 vaccine supply,
delivery, and demand, propelled by high-level U.S. diplomacy and
combined with a robust strategy with concrete, quantifiable
goals]{.underline}. The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[is
on track to reach]{.underline}]{.mark} a pivot point of
[[confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in managing the domestic epidemic over
the course of the summer, [[and it should seize that opportunity to
escalate its international engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} while
attending to the ongoing domestic challenges and **[[making the case for
U.S. global engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the American people.
The Biden administration has already taken important steps to support
the global vaccination effort but should do more, quickly, to lay the
diplomatic and operational groundwork, leveraging the global leadership
role of the Office of the President and President Biden's personal
commitment. [The administration should signal its intent to begin to
scale up the sharing of vaccine doses with lower- and middle-income
countries]{.underline}, beginning at the earliest possible moment and
accelerating through the fall. It should work with international
partners to develop an international coalitional effort to bring greater
transparency and accountability to the global vaccine marketplace and to
create voluntary incentives for technology transfer to increase regional
manufacturing capacity. It should **[prioritize improving production,
quality control, and pricing to ensure equitable access to
vaccines]{.underline}**. And it should spearhead innovations that will
strengthen partner country readiness and increase public trust and
confidence in vaccines and vaccine demand. These are fundamentally
ethical, economic, and national security matters. Concerted U.S. action
internationally will strengthen the protection of Americans at home but
also lift the threat posed by the pandemic to the world's most
vulnerable populations, expedite the reopening of the global economy,
and enhance U.S. influence in shaping solutions that align with U.S.
values and interests. These goals can be advanced while epidemic
controls are consolidated at home. And even in the setting of a
successful domestic vaccination campaign, failure to adequately address
critical vaccine shortages abroad means extended time periods for
Covid-19 transmission globally. This longer pandemic window will
accentuate human suffering, hamper global economic development, continue
to limit international travel for at least the next one to two years,
and increase the risk of vaccine-escape variants that can undermine
control in the United States and globally. Why act now? The situation at
home is changing fundamentally and rapidly. The United States possesses
several exceptionally safe and effective vaccines, production is scaling
up, and supply stockpiles will soon exceed domestic demand. The rapidly
expanding domestic vaccine rollout is laying the groundwork for an exit
out of the acute phase of the epidemic at home, at the same time that
portions of the \$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan are consolidating
the core components of the U.S. domestic response. Confidence is rising
steadily that the United States will soon have the suite of tools needed
to control the epidemic at home over the summer and stabilize and reopen
the economy and society by fall. These promising changes, arriving more
quickly than originally anticipated, open the door for increased U.S.
engagement globally. At home, leaders will still need to address the
risk of a spring surge and the threat of vaccine-escape variants; plan
to vaccinate older children by late summer and younger children by late
2021 and into 2022; address the possible manufacturing and distribution
of booster shots and recurrent vaccines; continue to urge masking and
social distancing measures and also find and stop clusters; and answer
the questions of Americans who have concerns about vaccine safety or
refuse to accept them. The race will continue to resolve scientific
unknowns (e.g., how effectively vaccines stop infectious transmission by
variants, including those that have not yet emerged; and how long
immunity lasts). But **[[with the rapid deepening of U.S. capacities
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[expansion of vaccine
coverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is in]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The US is a leader in biotech but needs strong action to revitalize it and level the global playing field 

Joe **Kennedy, 18**, (Joe Kennedy, Joe Kennedy is a senior fellow at the
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, where he focuses on
economic issues., 5-7-2018, STAT, Strong action is needed to preserve
the competitiveness of America\'s life-science industries,
https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/07/life-sciences-america-preserve-competition/,
6-24-2022) SCade

[Living standards in the United States]{.underline} increasingly [depend
on the competitiveness of industries that compete
internationally]{.underline}, particularly those that succeed by
producing new innovations. [[The life-science sector, which
includes]{.underline}]{.mark} pharmaceuticals,
[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, and medical devices, is one of
those industries. It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[an American
success story]{.underline}]{.mark}: Our country captures **[[more than
40 percent of the world's major patents in both pharmaceuticals and
medical devices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But as I describe in a new
report written for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation,
[[the continued health of the U.S. life-sciences sector is at
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} because a growing number of foreign
competitors are making determined efforts to gain global market share,
often using unfair tactics. [The importance]{.underline} of the
life-science sector [for the U.S. economy is difficult to
overstate]{.underline}. [It employs more than 1.2 million U.S.
workers]{.underline}, with average wages ranging from \$124,400 in
pharmaceuticals to \$86,200 in medical devices. And unlike U.S.
manufacturing, where the number of jobs has fallen over the last 15
years, the number of life-science jobs has been steadily growing. [[U.S.
pharmaceutical firms invest more in r]{.underline}]{.mark}esearch [[and
d]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment as a share of value added --- 43.8
percent --- [[than any other industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact,
**[[they invest a higher share than any other nation in the
world,]{.underline}]{.mark}** accounting for more than half of all
private-sector pharmaceutical research and development among countries
in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. [This is
one reason the American life-sciences sector is highly competitive, and
helps explain why the U.S. is home to the most company headquarters and
its researchers develop the most new drugs and devices]{.underline}. But
[other countries, including China]{.underline}, [Ireland, Singapore,
India, and the United Kingdom, are quickly gaining ground]{.underline}.
They are doing so with policies aimed at increasing the competitiveness
of their life-sciences industries. Some of these efforts, such as
greater investment in research and better intellectual property
protection, benefit the cause of life-sciences innovation globally. But
**[other policies harm both the global quest for innovation in
drugs]{.underline}** and devices and the U.S. economy. [India
and]{.underline} several [other countries]{.underline}, for example,
[maintain [high tariffs]{.mark} on some medical devices]{.underline}.
**[Exporters to China must deal with [regulatory
delays]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[routine violations of intellectual
property rights, and rampant counterfeiting]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Perhaps more surprising, the International Trade Administration recently
concluded that pharmaceutical innovations have effectively become
un-patentable in Canada. [[These practices]{.underline}]{.mark} and more
[[hurt U.S. companies]{.underline}]{.mark} [by closing off export
markets. The trend]{.underline} [is one reason why the U.S. trade
deficit]{.underline} in life sciences [has been growing]{.underline}. In
pharmaceuticals[, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [ran a
deficit last year of \$56.2 billion]{.underline}; in medical devices it
was more than \$4 billion. **[[A compounding factor has
been]{.underline}]{.mark}** the widespread practice of
**[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}** around the world to
**[[use]{.underline}]{.mark}** their **[[monopsony power to negotiate
artificially low prices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Because some revenue is
better than no revenue, [[U.S. companies have little choice but to
accept these deals]{.underline}]{.mark}. But the forced discounting
drives down export values, which drives up the U.S. trade deficit. This
manipulation of the trading system could be responsible for around 40
percent of the pharmaceutical industry's trade deficit. Moreover, by not
paying U.S. firms for the full cost of the drugs that they use, other
nations are dramatically slowing the global pace of life-sciences
innovation, because lower revenues limit the industry's ability to
conduct the research necessary to discover the next round of new
treatments. [[Any effective U.S]{.mark}. life-sciences [innovation
policy needs to]{.mark} make [level]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} global
[playing field]{.mark} a top priority]{.underline}. This means taking
more forceful action to address unfair trade practices that harm the
industry and the jobs it supports. Here are three good places to start:
[Penalize nations that engage in life-sciences mercantilism by removing
them from the Generalized System of Preferences, which eliminates duties
on thousands of products entering the United States from 120 countries
and territories. Ensure the existence of strong intellectual
property]{.underline} protections for life-science products, [including
biological drugs]{.underline}, in all new or renegotiated trade
agreements. **[Increase pressure on foreign nations to stop free riding
on the United States when it comes to life sciences and innovation by
increasing payments for drugs]{.underline}**. **[Better trade policy,
while necessary, won't be sufficient to preserve the competitiveness of
America's life-science industries. We need stronger policies at home,
too.]{.underline}** The White House should establish an interagency
life-sciences competitiveness council to ensure that all agencies,
including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug
Administration, the United States Trade Representative, and the
Department of Health and Human Services, take U.S. life-sciences
competitiveness issues into consideration in everything they do. These
efforts could include negotiating lower trade barriers, streamlining
regulations, and more effectively spurring the commercialization of
federal research.

2.[Challenges to a Multilateral Treaty Banning LAWS]{.underline}
Development and Use **[[The near-term prospects of a multilateral treaty
banning LAWS]{.underline}]{.mark}** development and use---[[which
includes the major military powers]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[are not
great]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Two of the most significant
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} facing the ban [[are (1) the uncertain
legal status]{.underline}]{.mark} of the technology145 [[and (2) the
potential military advantage]{.underline}]{.mark} of LAWS146 in
combination with the competitive pressure from rival States.147 The
[[powerful influence of these factors and the early
stage]{.mark}]{.underline} nature **[[of LAWS development create highly
unfavorable conditions for the creation of a treaty banning LAWS
development and use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Evaluating the impact of
each of the aforementioned challenges indicates that [there are key
differences that distinguish a LAWS ban from prior successful weapons
bans, such as the ban on anti-personnel landmines or blinding
lasers]{.underline}.148 First, [LAWS' incompatibility with IHL
obligations]{.underline}, as surveyed in the section above, [is not as
clear as previous weapons]{.underline}. For example, anti-personnel land
mines faced more significant challenges with IHL compliance due to the
operator's inability to control the impact of the explosives and the
operator's inability to distinguish between combatants and
noncombatants.149 [[Even when banning]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[more
legally problematic weapo]{.underline}]{.mark}n, [[the

Russia, and India [[still declined to sign the
treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}.150 As discussed previously, at a minimum
LAWS have the potential to adhere to IHL obligations in some battlefield
contexts.151 Therefore, [the legal basis supporting a total ban on LAWS
is not as strong as the previous examples.]{.underline}

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks Given the threat
environment facing NATO, as well as the activities of several NATO
members, the alliance should deliberately---but purposefully---consider
incorporating offensive cyber operations below the level of armed
conflict into its deterrence strategy. [Any effort to explore a role for
offensive cyber operations should also consider the challenges and risks
that may come with doing so.]{.underline} A central challenge is that,
at the political level, [[NATO allies lack]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[consensus on the appropriate application of offensive cyber
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[especially below the level of armed
conflict]{.underline}. Addressing these disagreements among member
states is essential because [[conducting offensive cyber operations
often requires maneuvering through]{.underline}]{.mark} or operating on
[[networks controlled by]{.underline}]{.mark} an ally or
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Right now, **[[NATO members do not
collectively agree on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[protocols]{.underline}]{.mark}** and processes for partner actions
in allied networks---[and they]{.underline} also [disagree on how to
define sovereignty in cyberspace]{.underline}, [or when an offensive
cyber operation would rise to the level of an armed attack]{.underline}.
[[Offensive cyber operations for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[present real interoperability challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
role of intelligence in cyber operations is likely to complicate NATO
planning processes. [Even [close allies are]{.mark} likely to be [wary
about sharing sensitive intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline} for a number
of reasons. For instance, they may be averse to [sharing information
gleaned from signals intelligence collection or because a member state
may be using the same exploits for both offensive action and their own
espionage]{.underline}---including intelligence collection against

#### Russia hacking US AND NATO now -- aff takes too long -- unilateral action is quicker

**[[Russia is expanding its espionage]{.mark} and influence
[operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[against Ukraine and its
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[including **malicious cyber
activity**]{.underline}]{.mark} that requires a coordinated, robust
response, Microsoft Corp said in a report published Wednesday. Russia
has deployed a [three-pronged strategy of coordinated military, cyber
and propaganda efforts since it invaded Ukraine]{.underline} in
February, Microsoft said. The **[cyberattacks included \"wiper\" malware
that Russian hackers deployed]{.underline}** against Ukrainian computer
systems, the company said, and malware masquerading as legitimate
emails. **[[Nearly two-thirds of Russian cyber espionage targets outside
Ukraine were NATO countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with **[[nearly half
of all campaigns directed at government agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
according to the report. Russian hackers have most frequently [[tried to
conduct network intrusions against US
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark}, with attackers also aiming to breach
entities based in Poland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Turkey,
the company said. **[[Cyberattacks directed at critical infrastructure
accounted for about 19% of the activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of the
attempted Russian hacking detected by Microsoft since the start of the
war, [29% has been successful]{.underline}, according to the report.
Roughly a quarter of the successful breaches have resulted in the theft
of data, the company said. Data stored on-site is more vulnerable than
information in the cloud, according to the report. "The key to a
country's digital resilience in wartime is the ability quickly to move
data outside the country while still connecting to and relying on it for
a government's digital operations," researchers wrote. Meanwhile,
Microsoft found, [the spread of Russian propaganda has spiked in
Ukraine, the US and elsewhere since the war began]{.underline}.
Pro-Russian news articles have sought to justify the initial February
invasion, explain how Ukraine\'s revolution led to the war and criticize
the countries aligned with Ukraine. "The **[escalation follows years of
unsuccessful talks, broken ceasefire agreements and a standoff between
Russia and the West]{.underline}**," according to one article cited as
an example in Microsoft's report. A representative for the Russian
embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to an email seeking
comment Wednesday. The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration
**[[has repeatedly warned of cybersecurity threats against US companies
and critical infrastructure since the outbreak of the
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. US officials have urged companies to update
their software and increase threat detection capabilities in the face of
Russian aggression in cyberspace, among other recommendations.  

### A2: US Not Leading Cyber

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} essentially **[[led the cyber pack since the

evolved government approach]{.mark} to cybersecurity and managing
hacking risks** The think tank places Russia and China behind U.S.
allies]{.underline} such as the United Kingdom, France and Australia
when it comes to investing in protecting industry against cyberattacks.
[But they're far ahead of those U.S. allies when it comes to launching
offensive hacking operations.]{.underline} "In their development of
offensive cyber mass, the scale of their respective operational
experience, their proven reach on cyber espionage and the clarity of
their political direction and doctrinal thinking, **[[China and Russia
probably surpass all other states except the
U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}**.," the report states. [The most important
factor for a country's overall cyber capability is having a cadre of
domestic companies focused on information and communications technology
that can develop cyber expertise]{.underline}, the report finds. [That's
what gives China]{.underline}, with its raft of growing tech and
telecoms firms, [the best chance of challenging the United States'
top-tier position]{.underline}. It also means tech-savvy Japan is most
likely to move into the second tier, despite being relatively weak in
cyber capabilities now.

### A2: NATO Cyber AI

As [Russia intensifies cyber hostilities]{.underline} and [China
weaponises artificial intelligence]{.underline}, joining forces in the
field of high-tech warfare will feature high on the list of topics
discussed by Nato allies at a summit next week. But the transatlantic
alliance's 30 members will need to move fast if they aim to make up lost
ground. Nato is proposing a new tech innovation centre bringing together
military personnel with industry to foster digital defence start-ups.
Some of these might be financed by a separate initiative, also set to be
debated: a venture capital fund for innovation which member states could
choose to opt in to. The efforts are belated, as Nato secretary-general
Jens Stoltenberg himself acknowledged. "[[For decades,
Nato]{.underline}]{.mark} allies [[have been leading when it comes to
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, but **[[that's not obvious any
more]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he told the Financial Times in an
interview last week. "We see [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} especially
[[investing heavily in]{.underline}]{.mark} new, [disruptive
tech]{.underline}nologies like [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence, [[autonomous
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, big data, and they [[implement them into
new advanced weapon systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, drones, submarines,
aircraft and so on." He is not the first to sound the alarm. Eric
Schmidt, the former Google chief executive who now chairs the US's
National Security Commission on AI, warned earlier this year that
Beijing was planning to undermine conventional military forces by
"leapfrogging" to new technologies. The commission's report, published
in March, raised concerns that China would use AI for "reconnaissance,
electromagnetic countermeasures and co-ordinated firepower strikes".
[[Part of the problem is that western defence institutions have been
slow]{.underline}]{.mark} to recognise the potential of innovation
beyond their own industry. "[For decades, a lot of technological
development would happen within the defence sector]{.underline} --- the
internet, nuclear, GPS, all of that was developed by the defence
industry and then shared with the civilian sector," Stoltenberg said.
"[Now, it goes the other way around]{.underline}. It's [a civilian
sector]{.underline} which [is leading in the development of artificial
intelligence, quantum computing, and many of the new disruptive
technologies]{.underline}." **[[Some Nato members are ahead of
others]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The US]{.underline}]{.mark} and France
have **[[published military AI strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while
the UK announced this year that it is to establish a centre for defence
AI. For the first time, Britain's intelligence agency, MI6, is
recruiting from the private sector for a new head of its "Q" branch ---
the technical lab made famous in the James Bond films. Establishing a
new Nato hub --- known as an "accelerator" --- in which tech companies
and members of the armed forces can experiment with new ideas has
advantages, according to Professor Fiona Murray, co-director of MIT's
innovation initiative. Start-ups and investors do not always have the
time to tackle defence challenges when solutions are "hard to test,
markets are fragmented and procurement is slow", Murray said. Working
together would create a wider market for new products and enhance
collective security, she noted. It was "not enough" for countries to be
handling this individually, she said. [[The US has started marshalling
allies on the policy implications of using new
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. **[[The Pentagon's "AI Partnership for
Defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**", [[comprising 13
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} ([including Nato members Canada, Denmark,
Estonia, the UK, France and Norway]{.underline}) met virtually for the
first time last year to agree joint military standards on AI. Schmidt's
commission has called on the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance
(the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) to work more closely on
developing AI systems. Ulrike Franke, an expert in military technology
at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that Nato's tech
centre will be most effective if it prioritises systems designed to
facilitate joint military operations. The alliance should look at areas
such as AI-enabled command and control, she said, which could give
members a unified picture of the battlefield across multiple regions,
using intelligent data analysis to sift information. Franke said that in
the vast arena spanning drones to quantum computing, there was a
temptation to cover too much. "[[It makes massive sense for Nato to
look]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[at this
\[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology\]", she said. "The question is, what
exactly are they focusing on? **[[There's a danger of Nato spreading
itself too thin]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[[The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee
announced]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[the alliance has sent a
counter-hybrid team to Montenegro to face Russian hybrid
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Last week in Brussels, the Chairman of
the NATO Military Committee (MC), Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, **[announced
the effort of the Alliance in facing Russian hybrid
attacks.]{.underline}** The term "[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}" [refers
to a military strategy which employs political warfare and blends
conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyberwarfare with other
influencing methods, such as fake news, diplomacy, lawfare and foreign
electoral intervention.]{.underline} Peach said that the NATO alliance
had set up the first NATO counter-hybrid team in Montenegro. "The [first
NATO counter-hybrid team has been deployed to our ally state,
Montenegro, with the aim of helping to strengthen Montenegro's
capacities and deterring hybrid challenges]{.underline}", Peach said.
Several countries, especially Russia, continue their aggressive
operations against foreign states, and **[cyber warfare is becoming the
main concern]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} almost [any
government]{.underline}. The official explained that **[[since
2014]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[defence spending to face hybrid
threats has continued to increase]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it has been
estimated that by 2024 that amount will reach \$ 400 billion. "[[NATO
data shows a 4,6% increase in 2019]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is the
fifth consecutive year of growth. By the end of this year, [[allies will
have invested over \$130 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}", added Marshal
Peach [United States Army General Mark Milley]{.underline}, the highest
military officer and military adviser to the President, Minister of
Defence and U.S. National Security Council, [accused the Russian
Government of attempting to destabilize the members of the alliance and
divide it]{.underline}. "it is evident that **[Russia has been trying to
divide NATO and make it weaker]{.underline}**". General Milley said.
"**[It would be their benefit]{.underline}**. **[It would be detrimental
to Europe and the US if NATO just collapsed and
disintegrated]{.underline}**." Representatives of Montenegro's Defence
Ministry confirmed that NATO counter-hybrid team visited Montenegro in
November. Experts fear that Russia could attempt to influence the
forthcoming parliamentary elections that will take place in October
2020. "This visit was the first such engagement in one of the allies,
and it was an important experience for Montenegro. **[[Montenegro wants
to enhance its capacities and the focus of NATO's team was on
strengthening legislative framework]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this
domain and its implementation", said Ivica Ivanović, director general
for defence policy. On June 5, 2017 Montenegro officially joined NATO
alliance despite the strong opposition from the Russian Government that
threatened to retaliate. [Cybersecurity experts believe that a new wave
of attacks from the cyberspace will hit the state]{.underline}. In
February 2017, for the second time in a few months, Montenegro suffered
massive and prolonged cyberattacks against government and media
websites. Researchers at security firm FireEye who analyzed the attacks
observed malware and exploits associated with the notorious
Russia-linked APT group known as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm,
Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit, and Tsar Team). Another massive attack hit
the country's institutions during October 2016 elections, amid
speculation that the Russian Government was involved. Hackers targeted
Montenegro with spear-phishing attacks, the malicious messages used
weaponized documents pertaining to a NATO secretary meeting and a visit
by a European army unit to Montenegro. At the time, the cyberspies
delivered the GAMEFISH backdoor (aka Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT, and
Sofacy), a malware that was used only by the APT28 group in past
attacks.

[NATO's climate security agenda]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} has long been [[known as a threat
multiplier]{.underline}]{.mark} and is increasingly recognised as a
"shaping threat" that [dramatically alters the environments in which
Allied militaries will have to operate in the coming
decades]{.underline}. From higher frequency and intensity of storms,
through extreme heat and cold, to reduced supplies of drinking water and
faster wear and tear of military equipment, [[climate change has
significant implications for NATO on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[tactical, operational and strategic levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
addition to **[[climate-related risks to military infrastructure and
force readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, more **[[extreme weather
events]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[increase conflict and
migration potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** in and beyond NATO's
immediate neighbourhood. Born of the Cold War and designed to defend its
members against any external aggression, [[NATO is evolving to reflect
the new security reality]{.underline}]{.mark} of actorless threats,
**[[such as pandemics, biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a security organisation, NATO cannot
be indifferent to these challenges. For NATO to be able to fulfil its
core mission of keeping the Euro-Atlantic space safe, building
resilience to the impacts of a changing climate and integrating
sustainable practices into military planning and capability development
is a necessity, not a choice. Evolving consensus The good news is that
**[[the Alliance is not starting from scratch]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For over 50 years now, [NATO has been paying attention to environmental
challenges]{.underline}, mostly through a wide range of scientific
research activities. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[developed six environmental protection
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} (STANAGs) that concern military camps,
management of waste, and sustainability of military training areas.
Climate change was written into the 2010 Strategic Concept and has been
factored into summit declarations since then. In 2014, NATO adopted a
Green Defence Framework and integrated energy efficiency and other
environmental considerations into the design of the current NATO
headquarters, which was completed in 2018. **[[The building blocks for a
more ambitious and visible role with respect to climate security are
already there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, [[NATO]{.mark} as an
alliance of 30 countries [works by consensus]{.mark}, which is always
evolving]{.underline}. As a former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change,
Jens Stoltenberg began [[advocating for NATO to take greater
climate-related]{.underline}]{.mark} [[action]{.underline}]{.mark} many
years ago, but [[his efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} may have been
[[stymied during the previous U.S. administration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The growing number of climate and weather related disasters, which
continue to impact lives and livelihoods both within and outside of
NATO's borders, has marked an evident shift in awareness and acceptance
of climate change as an issue of national security across the Alliance.
[[In view of increasing societal pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
current political momentum, [[which includes the renewed U.S. leadership
on climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[NATO]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} now **[[poised to push a more ambitious climate
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The United States is well on its way to protecting Americans from the
coronavirus]{.underline}. It's time to help the rest of the world. By
marshaling this nation's vast resources to produce and distribute enough
vaccines to meet global demand, the United States would act in keeping
with the nation's best traditions and highest aspirations while
advancing its geopolitical and economic interests. It is a moment of
both obligation and opportunity. [[Unfortunately]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[instead of a bold]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[comprehensive strategy to
vaccinate the world]{.underline}]{.mark} as quickly as possible, the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[has thus far
made]{.underline}]{.mark} a string of [[tactical
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}: donating millions of doses to countries
in need, signaling its support for patent waivers that might expedite
vaccine production efforts and nudging two companies --- Merck and
Johnson & Johnson --- to collaborate on increasing supply. [[These are
good steps]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[but they are not nearly
sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}** to meet the moment. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and the rest
of the world's wealthiest nations [[are facing a great moral
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Covax, [[the World Health
Organization's]{.underline}]{.mark} initiative to pool vaccine
resources, [[remains profoundly underfunded]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[and
has failed to meet even its modest target]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
vaccinating one-fifth of the population in the Global
South]{.underline}. Without a major course correction, the rest of the
world will have to wait until 2023 or later for large-scale vaccination
initiatives like the one underway in the United States. [[The
consequences of this disparity are]{.underline}]{.mark} expected to be
[[severe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hundreds of thousands more people will
get sick and die from a disease that is now preventable with a vaccine.
[The global economy will contract by trillions of dollars, according to
the International Chamber of Commerce, and tens of millions of people
will plummet into extreme poverty as the virus continues to fester and
evolve in the world's more vulnerable reaches.]{.underline} As global
hunger rises and global life expectancy falls, instability will prevail.
Already, [Colombia is mired in deadly protests over the pandemic's
economic fallout]{.underline}. [India is facing its gravest humanitarian
catastrophe in a generation]{.underline}. As the United Nations has
warned, a similar [crisis in Syria would be catastrophic]{.underline}.
President Biden can start by announcing that the United States intends
to help and by [appointing a vaccine czar]{.underline} to oversee the
expansion of vaccine production. The federal government has ample legal
power to [compel the participation of the pharmaceutical
companies]{.underline}, including the [sharing of critical information
and technologies]{.underline}. Congress has appropriated \$16 billion to
scale up production, most of which remains unspent. [[Increasing
manufacturing capacity has proved tricky]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[global demand for vaccines may be high now]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
[[once the coronavirus pandemic recedes, it will plummet back to normal

[[The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee
announced]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[the alliance has sent a
counter-hybrid team to Montenegro to face Russian hybrid
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Last week in Brussels, the Chairman of
the NATO Military Committee (MC), Marshal Sir Stuart Peach,
**[[announced the effort of the Alliance in facing Russian hybrid
attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The term "[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}"
[refers to a military strategy which employs political warfare and
blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyberwarfare with
other influencing methods, such as fake news, diplomacy, lawfare and
foreign electoral intervention.]{.underline} Peach said that the NATO
alliance had set up the first NATO counter-hybrid team in Montenegro.
"The [first NATO counter-hybrid team has been deployed to our ally
state, Montenegro, with the aim of helping to strengthen Montenegro's
capacities and deterring hybrid challenges]{.underline}", Peach said.
Several countries, especially Russia, continue their aggressive
operations against foreign states, and **[[cyber warfare is becoming the
main concern]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[[any government]{.underline}]{.mark}. The official explained that since
2014 the defence spending to face hybrid threats has continued to
increase, it has been estimated that by 2024 that amount will reach \$
400 billion. "NATO data shows a 4,6% increase in 2019. That is the fifth
consecutive year of growth. By the end of this year, allies will have
invested over \$130 billion", added Marshal Peach [United States Army
General Mark Milley]{.underline}, the highest military officer and
military adviser to the President, Minister of Defence and U.S. National
Security Council, [accused the Russian Government of attempting to
destabilize the members of the alliance and divide it]{.underline}. "it
is evident that **[Russia has been trying to divide NATO and make it
weaker]{.underline}**". General Milley said. "**[It would be their
benefit]{.underline}**. **[It would be detrimental to Europe and the US
if NATO just collapsed and disintegrated]{.underline}**."
Representatives of Montenegro's Defence Ministry confirmed that NATO
counter-hybrid team visited Montenegro in November. Experts fear that
Russia could attempt to influence the forthcoming parliamentary
elections that will take place in October 2020. "This visit was the
first such engagement in one of the allies, and it was an important
experience for Montenegro. **[Montenegro wants to enhance its capacities
and the focus of NATO's team was on strengthening legislative
framework]{.underline}** in this domain and its implementation", said
Ivica Ivanović, director general for defence policy. On June 5, 2017
Montenegro officially joined NATO alliance despite the strong opposition
from the Russian Government that threatened to retaliate.
[[Cybersecurity experts believe that a new wave of attacks from the
cyberspace will hit the state]{.underline}]{.mark}. In February 2017,
for the second time in a few months, Montenegro suffered massive and
prolonged cyberattacks against government and media websites.
Researchers at security firm FireEye who analyzed the attacks observed
malware and exploits associated with the notorious Russia-linked APT
group known as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy,
Sednit, and Tsar Team). Another massive attack hit the country's
institutions during October 2016 elections, amid speculation that the
Russian Government was involved. Hackers targeted Montenegro with
spear-phishing attacks, the malicious messages used weaponized documents
pertaining to a NATO secretary meeting and a visit by a European army
unit to Montenegro. At the time, the cyberspies delivered the GAMEFISH
backdoor (aka Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT, and Sofacy), a malware that
was used only by the APT28 group in past attacks.

### 2AC\-\--US Failing at AI

#### The US is no longer demolishing China in the race -- need full NATO cooperation to outpace China

[The US-China Race for Artificial Intelligence]{.underline} Combining
decades of experience advancing frontier technologies, on the one hand,
and analyzing national security decisionmaking, on the other, we have
been collaborating over the past year in an effort [to understand the
national security implications of China's great leap forward in
artificial intelligence (AI]{.underline}). Our purpose in this essay is
to **[[sound an alarm over China's rapid progress and the current
prospect of it overtaking the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[in applying
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the decade ahead; to explain why AI is for
the autocracy led by the Chinese Communist Party (hereafter, the
"Party") an existential priority; to identify key unanswered questions
about [the dangers of an unconstrained AI arms race between the two
digital superpowers]{.underline}; and to point to the reasons why we
believe that this is a race the United States can and must win. We begin
with four key points. First, most **[[Americans believe that U.S.
leadership in advanced tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [[is so
entrenched]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it is
unassailable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Likewise, [[many]{.mark} in the
American national security community [insist that in the AI arena China
can never be more than a "near-peer competitor]{.mark}."]{.underline}
**[[Both are wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, **[[China stands
today as a full-spectrum peer competitor]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
United States [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} commercial and [[national
security applications of AI]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beijing is not just
trying to master AI---it is succeeding. Because AI will have as
transformative an impact on commerce and national security over the next
two decades as semiconductors, computers and the web have had over the
past quarter century, this should be recognized as a matter of grave
national concern.1,2,3 Second, [[China's zeal to master AI]{.mark} [goes
far beyond its recognition]{.mark} [that this]{.mark} suite of
[tech]{.mark}nologies [promises to be the biggest driver of economic
advances]{.mark} in the next quarter century]{.underline}. **[For the
Party, AI is mission critical]{.underline}**. The command of 1.4 billion
citizens by a Party-controlled authoritarian government is a herculean
challenge. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Americans have been
confident that authoritarian governments are doomed to
fail---eventually. But [AI offers a realistic possibility of upending
this proposition]{.underline}. AI could give the Party not just an
escape hatch from the "end of history,"4 but [a claim to advance a model
of governance---a national operating system---superior to today's
dysfunctional democracies]{.underline}. As one former Democratic
presidential candidate put it: "**[China is using technology to perfect
dictatorship]{.underline}**."5 It's a value proposition that resonates
with many leaders around the world. As former Google ceo Eric Schmidt
has argued: "if the Soviet Union had been able to leverage the kind of
sophisticated data observation, collection and analytics employed by the
leaders of Amazon today, it might well have won the Cold War." Third,
while [we share the general enthusiasm about AI's potential to make huge
improvements in human wellbeing]{.underline}, [[the development of
machines with intelligence]{.mark} vastly [superior to humans]{.mark}
will [pose]{.mark} special, perhaps even [unique
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1946, Albert Einstein warned, "the
unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of
thinking, and thus we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe." We
believe the same could be said of AI. Henry Kissinger has identified
these risks in what we call "Kissinger's Specter." In his words, [AI
threatens an unpredictable revolution]{.underline} in our consciousness
and our thinking, and an "inevitable evolution in our understanding of
truth and reality."6 In response to Einstein's insight, the
technologists and strategists who had built and used the bomb to end
World War II joined forces to find ways to prevent a nuclear World War
III. Meeting the challenges posed by AI will require nothing less.
Fourth, **[[China's advantages in size]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[data
collection and national determination]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[have
allowed it over the]{.underline}]{.mark} past [[decade to close the gap
with America]{.underline}]{.mark}n leaders of this industry. **[[It is
currently on a trajectory to overtake the United States in the decade
ahead]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nonetheless, if the United States will
awake to the challenge and mobilize a national effort, we believe that
it can develop and execute a winning strategy.

WASHINGTON --- [[Two NATO agencies recently kicked off an
a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence
[[initiative]{.underline}]{.mark} to better understand the technology
and its potential warfare applications. **[[More than 80 AI
experts]{.underline}]{.mark}**, researchers and academics [from the
U.S.]{.underline} and other member countries [[are involved with the
venture]{.underline}]{.mark}, known as a strategic "horizon scanning,"
[put together by the NATO Science and Technology Organization and the
NATO Communications and Information Agency]{.underline}. An inaugural
meeting and workshop was held this month in The Hague, Netherlands,
where the NCI Agency's data science and AI facilities are located. "[[AI
is one of the key emerging]{.underline}]{.mark} and disruptive
[[technologies identified by NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as vital for the
maintenance of its technological edge," NATO Chief Scientist Bryan Wells
said in a statement. "By working together, the STO and the NCI Agency
are able to bring together global experts to ensure the very best
scientific expertise is available to advise NATO and its allies and
partners on the latest scientific trends in this area." The NATO
guarantee of a collective defense and the advantage of numbers, both on
the battlefield and in the lab, has been much discussed amid Russia's
latest invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent membership applications
made by Finland and Sweden. **[[NATO ministers in October adopted the
alliance's first-ever AI strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
describes the capability as "changing the global defense and security
environment" and offering "an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen
our technological edge but will also escalate the speed of the threats
we face." The strategy [[emphasizes responsible use of AI for
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} across six tenets: [lawfulness;
responsibility and accountability; explainability and traceability;
reliability; governability; and bias mitigation. AI frameworks and other
guidance drafted by the U.S. and its defense community take a similar
approach]{.underline}. NATO allies in 2019 agreed to focus on seven
emerging and disruptive technologies, data, computing and AI among them.
Making sure there are shared standards, and that systems will work with
systems, will be critical to success, officials said. "[[One of the big
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} when we go into this new phase of
disruptive technologies [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} how do you keep all
allies on the same hymn sheet when it comes down to communicating with
each other, [[using the same technology]{.mark}, being
interoperable]{.underline}," David van Weel, NATO assistant secretary
general for emerging security challenges, told Defense News in March
2021. "So **[[that's a big part]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[of the
strategy\] **[[and a big role for NATO to play]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[should standardize and regulate AI]{.underline}]{.mark} to keep up

Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). CEPA's comments came as it
published a series of AI-related recommendations for NATO amid growing
geopolitical tensions with the likes of Russia, China and North Korea.
[Its [recommendations include AI standardization]{.mark}]{.underline},
[encouraging and improving AI literacy and [spurring private sector
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Such undertakings would allow NATO
allies to better scale and deploy AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and keep
pace with rivals. "These new capabilities will revolutionize NATO's
military and strategic affairs, thus strengthening NATO's ability to
fulfill its essential core tasks of collective defense, crisis
management and cooperative security," CEPA's Nicholas Nelson and Nico
Luzum wrote. [The pair cited AI projects being undertaken by
adversaries, including China's attempts to develop purported
mind-controllable drones and AI assistants for fighter
pilots.]{.underline} But [[NATO allies have their own
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[[including U.S.-developed
autonomous tanks]{.underline}]{.mark}** and British-made systems that
provide ground troops with information on the surrounding terrain. The
think tank's study suggests that at present, [[NATO is leading the AI
race]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[[but risks losing its competitive
advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}** to peer competitors "competitors if
allies fail to leverage the private sector, coordinate implementation
and engage with the public." CEPA suggests that NATO allies should
accelerate AI adoption and actively encourage private sector innovation.
"Ultimately, we hope that [these recommendations enable NATO allies to
better innovate, scale, deploy, and integrate AI]{.underline} and
autonomy-based technologies to form agile, system-wide solutions.

In March, [[WIRED ran a story]{.underline}]{.mark} with the headline
"[[Russia\'s Killer Drone in Ukraine Raises Fears About AI in
Warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}," with the subtitle, "The maker of the
lethal drone claims that it can identify targets using artificial
intelligence." The story [[focused on the KUB-BLA,]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [[small kamikaze drone]{.underline}]{.mark} aircraft that smashes
itself into enemy targets and detonates an onboard explosive. The
KUB-BLA is made by ZALA Aero, a subsidiary of the Russian weapons
manufacturer Kalashnikov (best known as the maker of the AK-47), which
itself is partly owned by Rostec, a part of Russia's government-owned
defense-industrial complex. The WIRED story understandably attracted a
lot of attention, but [[those who only read the sensational

article's **[[critical caveat]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "**[[It is unclear
if the drone may have been operated in]{.underline}]{.mark}** this
\[**[[an AI-enabled autonomous\] way]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Ukraine."
Other outlets re-reported the WIRED story, but irresponsibly did so
without the caveat. WIRED's assessment that [[Kalashnikov
claims]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[KUB-BLA]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[boasts
the ability to identify targets using a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence[[" is based on two main pieces of
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}: a Kalashnikov press release about ZALA
Aero's "Artificial Intelligence Visual Identification (AIVI)"
capabilities for its unmanned aircraft, and the original Kalashnikov
press release announcing the KUB-BLA in 2019. However, [[these]{.mark}
two **[pieces of evidence are less than they
seem]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The Russian]{.mark}-language]{.underline}
AIVI [[press release never mentions]{.mark} the [KUB-BLA or military
applications]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, it describes a ZALA Aero
machine-learning AI drone product line that is marketed to industrial
and agricultural sectors. **[[Incorporating modern machine-learning
AI]{.mark} [into military applications is significantly more
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** than in industrial or agricultural
applications. Modern machine-learning AI using deep neural networks
offers the opportunity for incredible gains in performance, but that
performance depends on having lots of training data during development.
Moreover, that training data needs to closely resemble operational
conditions. In general, it is much easier to get such training data from
commercial customers than from an enemy military, especially if friendly
weapons systems and sensors do not often come within range of enemy
ones. [[The most mature military AI applications
are]{.underline}]{.mark} ones like [[satellite
reconnaissance]{.underline}]{.mark}: even in peacetime, satellites get
to take a lot of pictures of Russian and Chinese military forces, and
[[those pictures can be digitally labeled by human experts]{.mark} to
turn them into training data.]{.underline} Training data is what machine
learning AI systems learn from. The combination of a learning algorithm
and training data is how AI systems learn to recognize what is in the
image. But training data is generally application-specific. Satellite
image recognition training data only helps build satellite image
recognition AI. One cannot magically use labeled satellite image data to
train an AI for a robotic drone's targeting computer (at least not with
today's technology). [[Getting enough]{.underline}]{.mark} of the right
sort of [[training data]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
incorporate]{.underline}]{.mark} modern [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} into,
say, a robotic tank's targeting computer, **[[is a much tougher
technical challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is not impossible in
principle, but in practice, there are far fewer opportunities to collect
the right sort of training data.

AI's Shortfalls for Military Applications [[As the military looks to
incorporate AI's success]{.underline}]{.mark} in these tasks into its
systems, [[some challenges must be acknowledged]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The first is that **[[developers need access to
data.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Many [AI systems are trained]{.underline}
using data that has been labeled [[by some expert
system]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., labeling scenes that include an air
defense battery), [[usually a human]{.underline}]{.mark}. Large datasets
are often labeled by companies who employ manual methods. [[Obtaining
this data and sharing it is a challenge]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[especially for an organization]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[that prefers
to classify data]{.underline}]{.mark}** and restrict access to it. An
example military dataset may be one with images produced by
thermal-imaging systems and labeled by experts to describe the weapon
systems found in the image, if any. [[Without
sharing]{.underline}]{.mark} [this with preprocessors and
developers]{.underline}, **[[an AI that uses that]{.underline}]{.mark}**
set **[[effectively cannot be created]{.underline}]{.mark}**. AI systems
are also vulnerable to becoming very large (and thus slow), and
consequently susceptible to "dimensionality issues." For example,
training a system to recognize images of every possible weapon system in
existence would involve thousands of categories. Such **[[systems will
require an enormous amount of computing power and lots of dedicated time
on those resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And because we are training a
model, the best model requires an infinite amount of these images to be
completely accurate. That is something we cannot achieve. Furthermore,
as we train these AI systems, we often attempt to force them to follow
"human" rules such as the rules of grammar. However, humans often ignore
these rules, which makes developing successful AI systems for things
like sentiment analysis and speech recognition challenging. Finally, AI
systems can work well in uncontested, controlled domains. However,
[[research is demonstrating that under adversarial
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[AI systems can easily be
fooled]{.underline}]{.mark}, resulting in errors. Certainly, many
**[[DoD AI applications will operate in contested
spaces]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[like]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} domain, [and thus, we should be wary of
their results]{.underline}. Ignoring the enemy's efforts to defeat the
AI systems that we may employ, there are limitations to these seemingly
super-human models. An AI's image-processing capability is not very
robust when given images that are different from its training set---for
example, images where lighting conditions are poor, that are at an
obtuse angle, or that are partially obscured. Unless these types of
images were in the training set, the model may struggle (or fail) to
accurately identify the content. Chat bots that might aid our
information-operations missions are limited to hundreds of words and
thus cannot completely replace a human who can write pages at a time.
Prediction systems, such as IBM's Watson weather-prediction tool,
struggle with dimensionality issues and the availability of input data
due to the complexity of the systems they are trying to model. Research
may solve some of these problems but few of them will be solved as
quickly as predicted or desired. Another simple weakness with [AI
systems is their inability to multi-task]{.underline}. A human is
capable of identifying an enemy vehicle, deciding a weapon system to
employ against it, predicting its path, and then engaging the target.
This fairly simple set of tasks is currently impossible for an AI system
to accomplish. At best, a combination of AIs could be constructed where
individual tasks are given to separate models. That type of solution,
even if feasible, would entail a huge cost in sensing and computing
power not to mention the training and testing of the system. Many AI
systems are not even capable of transferring their learning within the
same domain. For example, a system trained to identify a T-90 tank would
most likely be unable to identify a Chinese Type 99 tank, despite the
fact that they are both tanks and both tasks are image recognition. Many
researchers are working to enable systems to transfer their learning,
but such systems are years away from production.
[Artificial-intelligence systems are also very poor at understanding
inputs and context within the inputs. AI recognition systems don't
understand what the image is, they simply learn textures and gradients
of the image's pixels]{.underline}. Given scenes with those same
gradients, AIs readily identify portions of the picture incorrectly.
This lack of understanding can result in misclassifications that humans
would not make, [such as identifying a boat on a lake as a
BMP]{.underline}.

[NATO's climate security agenda]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} has long been [[known as a threat
multiplier]{.underline}]{.mark} and is increasingly recognised as a
"shaping threat" that [dramatically alters the environments in which
Allied militaries will have to operate in the coming
decades]{.underline}. From higher frequency and intensity of storms,
through extreme heat and cold, to reduced supplies of drinking water and
faster wear and tear of military equipment, [[climate change has
significant implications for NATO on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[tactical, operational and strategic levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
addition to **[[climate-related risks to military infrastructure and
force readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, more **[[extreme weather
events]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[increase conflict and
migration potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** in and beyond NATO's
immediate neighbourhood. Born of the Cold War and designed to defend its
members against any external aggression, [[NATO is evolving to reflect
the new security reality]{.underline}]{.mark} of actorless threats,
**[[such as pandemics, biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a security organisation, NATO cannot
be indifferent to these challenges. For NATO to be able to fulfil its
core mission of keeping the Euro-Atlantic space safe, building
resilience to the impacts of a changing climate and integrating
sustainable practices into military planning and capability development
is a necessity, not a choice. Evolving consensus The good news is that
**[[the Alliance is not starting from scratch]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For over 50 years now, [NATO has been paying attention to environmental
challenges]{.underline}, mostly through a wide range of scientific
research activities. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[developed six environmental protection
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} (STANAGs) that concern military camps,
management of waste, and sustainability of military training areas.
Climate change was written into the 2010 Strategic Concept and has been
factored into summit declarations since then. In 2014, NATO adopted a
Green Defence Framework and integrated energy efficiency and other
environmental considerations into the design of the current NATO
headquarters, which was completed in 2018. **[[The building blocks for a
more ambitious and visible role with respect to climate security are
already there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, [[NATO]{.mark} as an
alliance of 30 countries [works by consensus]{.mark}, which is always
evolving]{.underline}. As a former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change,
Jens Stoltenberg began [[advocating for NATO to take greater
climate-related]{.underline}]{.mark} [[action]{.underline}]{.mark} many
years ago, but [[his efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} may have been
[[stymied during the previous U.S. administration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The growing number of climate and weather related disasters, which
continue to impact lives and livelihoods both within and outside of
NATO's borders, has marked an evident shift in awareness and acceptance
of climate change as an issue of national security across the Alliance.
