### Laundry List

#### A strong NATO solves a laundry list of conflicts and impacts 

**Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 22**, (Netherlands Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, 3-21-2022, Government of the Netherlands, What does
NATO do? Foreign Affairs in plain language,

Safety and security in the Netherlands A safer world also means a safer
Netherlands. Why? [[Take]{.underline}]{.mark} for instance
[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[nuclear weapons or
cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These threats have one thing in
common: [[they don't stop at borders]{.underline}]{.mark}. So our own
safety and security often starts abroad. That's why it's important to
have good relations with other countries. And to protect stability in
the world together. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs works hard to do
this. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[plays an important
role]{.underline}]{.mark}. But what exactly is NATO? What is NATO? NATO
stands for 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization'. It is a military
alliance of 30 countries in Europe and North America. Its headquarters
is in Brussels. The Netherlands is a member of NATO. NATO was set up in
1949, not long after the end of the Second World War. Its aim: to
[protect the security and freedom of all the countrie]{.underline}s that
are members (the Allies). And right now, **[that Alliance is perhaps
more important than ever]{.underline}**. Worldwide security challenges
The world is a less safe place than before. Even in areas near the
Netherlands. Take for instance the [[war in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}
started by President Putin. [[Or China]{.underline}]{.mark}: a
[[growing]{.underline}]{.mark} global **[[economic and military
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that is flexing its muscles more and more
often]{.underline}. [[Tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological developments
also [[lead to new threats]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[like
cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Or the use of modern weapons, like
[drones]{.underline}, that can attack targets without humans having to
risk their lives. **[[And climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also
lead to more conflicts, or make conflicts worse. Countries need each
other so they can prevent and combat these global threats. NATO and
diplomacy NATO is a defensive military alliance. [You might think NATO
is all about military action]{.underline}. But there is another very
important step that comes first. **[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark}** main
**[[priority is diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[By talking to each
other]{.underline}]{.mark} and with other countries, we try to **[[solve
conflicts without using force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Within NATO, the
Allies work together and make agreements. For instance on [protecting
democratic values]{.underline}. Examples are: [being able to hold free
and fair]{.underline} [elections, equal rights for everyone, and freedom
of expression]{.underline}. Within NATO, military and non-military
experts meet to exchange information about what is happening in the
world. In this way, **[[NATO prepares]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself
**[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the challenges and **[[threats of today
and of the future.]{.underline}]{.mark}** With military and diplomatic
action. NATO in the world [NATO also helps other countries -- that
aren't members of NATO]{.underline} -- with their security. For instance
by helping them train their soldiers. NATO soldiers can also be sent to
deal with a crisis. This is important for the Netherlands too. Because
the world is becoming more and more closely connected. And our safety
and security is also connected to that of other countries. Article 5:
what happens if a NATO country is attacked? An attack one of NATO's
member countries is an attack on all of them. Article 5 is the most
important part of the North Atlantic Treaty, the treaty on which NATO is
based. If one NATO member country is attacked, all members will provide
it with military support. This way, the country that has been attacked
doesn\'t stand alone. The attack doesn\'t have to be with tanks and
guns; it could also be a cyberattack, for instance. So basically,
**[[NATO make us safer together]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But how does a
country become a member of NATO? When can a country join NATO? A country
can't just simply join NATO. There are certain requirements and steps
that the country has to take. Step 1: the country must meet NATO's three
basic requirements. Only European countries and countries in North
America can join NATO. That was decided when NATO was first set up. The
country must be democratic. And the country must contribute to security
in the European-Atlantic region. Step 2: the country must take part in
the Membership Action Plan. This means the country is assessed and given
help with meeting NATO's other requirements. Those requirements have to
do with freedom, human rights, democracy and the legal system. Sometimes
it means that reforms are needed in the country that wants to be a
member. Step 3: the country must agree to NATO's aims, rights and
obligations. The country makes these agreements in talks with NATO
members. Step 4: all NATO member countries must agree to the country's
membership. All NATO members sign a document called the accession
protocol. Step 5: the country's own people must agree to NATO
membership. This can be decided by parliament, or by holding a
referendum. Every country is different. So some countries may take
longer to become a member than others. NATO and the Netherlands [To
protect our way of life]{.underline}, the Netherlands works to build a
strong Europe and [a strong NATO]{.underline}. By working together with
other countries and making agreements with them, [we stand stronger in
the world.]{.underline}

#### NATO cohesion solves a litany of impacts while ensuring increased EU capabilities 

Ben **Hodges, 18**, (Ben Hodges, 12-7-2018, GMFUS, Why the United States
Needs a Cohesive NATO,
https://www.gmfus.org/news/why-united-states-needs-cohesive-nato,
6-26-2022) SCade

**[[If a conflict with China arises, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[will need a strong, cohesive NATO]{.mark},]{.underline}** as well as
other partnerships around the world [[to maintain]{.underline}]{.mark}
order and [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} in Europe's neighborhood, and
perhaps even beyond. The United States remains committed to Europe's
security and stability. But it also expects its European allies to pick
up their share of the burden for collective security so as to help
maintain order in the continent and around the globe. **[[It is of vital
importance]{.mark} to the United States [that its defense and security
relationship with European countries]{.mark}, especially within NATO,
[not only remains healthy but is correctly oriented to]{.mark} current
and likely [future challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Several things
remain to be achieved if Europe and the United States in this regard.
[First, **[they must build a common approach]{.mark} not only in
defense**, but across economic, information, and political
domains]{.underline}. Second, they must solve the continued inequity in
burden sharing that hinders a stronger relationship between them and
erodes the confidence of many Americans in the efficacy of NATO. Third,
it is necessary to achieve greater coherence on NATO's eastern flank,
particularly in the Black Sea region. Fourth, NATO must continue its
efforts to improve its deterrence capability against Russia's aggressive
behavior. The interests and responsibilities of the United States are
global, with freedom of navigation on the seas and preservation of the
global commons being prime examples. Its allies and partners benefit
from these freedoms as well, but these have now come under threat, most
notably in the South China Sea and with China's growing control over
much of the infrastructure of the world, particularly in Europe and
Africa[.]{.underline} The threat from China is real and growing, and if
it materializes the United States will need a strong, cohesive NATO, as
well as other partnerships around the world to maintain order and
security in Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond, while the
majority of its forces and capabilities, particularly air and naval
ones, are operating in the Pacific theater. The stability, security, and
economic prosperity of the United States are directly linked to that of
Europe. The bulk of its global economic relationships are in North
America and the European Union, and the majority of its most reliable
allies and partners are in Europe. To give but one example, the shared
intelligence obtained from Europe is essential to the implementation of
the recently published U.S. National Defense Strategy. In this context,
it is of vital importance to the United States that its defense and
security relationship with European countries, especially within NATO,
not only remains healthy but is correctly oriented to current and likely
future challenges. The U.S. Priority: China [A war between China and the
United States is not inevitable, but [the next 15 years could see the
eruption of]{.mark} such a [conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} While this
may not reach the threshold of full-scale war or a nuclear conflict,
[[the]{.mark} leaders of the Chinese Communist Party ([CCP]{.mark})
[have set]{.mark} their country [on a trajectory that will lead
to]{.mark} a strategic situation that may result in [sustained armed
conflict]{.mark}, potentially stretching across the Pacific
region,]{.underline} in all domains[.]{.underline} Furthermore, the
combination of China's huge population, export-oriented economy, and
lack of natural resources could generate an inexorable push towards
conflict. The CCP leadership has emphasized the development of military
capabilities that could deny the U.S. Navy access to the South China
Sea, including long-range air and missile defense and anti-ship
capabilities. This anti-access area denial (A2AD) capability does not
depend on a large Chinese navy but instead uses well-protected,
land-based systems. The creation of artificial islands in the region,
most of which are already being armed and garrisoned with A2AD
capabilities, are violations of international law and agreements that
clearly demonstrate the CCP's strategy and intentions. Enforcement of
freedom of the seas and recognized international waters by the United
States and others is necessary to counter these policies. In one recent
[demonstration of CCP intent, there was a near-collision incident
between Chinese and U.S. Navy ships, caused by unsafe and unprofessional
behavior by the Chinese one.]{.underline} Statements by the China's
minister of defense during his recent visit to the Pentagon, including
demands that the U.S. forces stay away from the articifial islands,
indicate that his country will continue to push aggressively its
territorial claims. Meanwhile, in Europe China has become an
increasingly significant and potentially divisive influence in a variety
of aspects; especially in infrastructure, technology transfer, and
trade. The Belt and Road Initiative has resulted in dramatic increases
in Chinese investment in Europe, control of hundreds of European
companies, and ownership or control of more than 10 percent of Europe's
ports. These developments, and the CCP's strategy and behavior, are
cause for concern about the potential for conflict with China within the
next 15 years. They also show why the United States must prepare for
this eventuality. During the Cold War, the United States used a "two and
a half wars" framework for force structure. This was not a strategy, but
rather a mechanism meant to assess how much capability and capacity its
armed forces needed to deter effectively and, if necessary, win
simultaneous conflicts in two different operational theaters and "hold"
in a third, minor theater at the same time, for as long as necessary.
Today, and for the foreseeable future, the United States can no longer
exercise this capability and capacity. [Therefore, in the event of
conflict with China, [it will need a **strong, cohesive NATO**]{.mark}
as well as partnerships around the world [in order to continue
deterring]{.mark} a **revanchist [Russia]{.mark}** [and to carry on
**counter-terrorism** ]{.mark}operations in the Middle East while the
majority of U.S. forces and capabilities are operating in the
Pacific.]{.underline} The U.S. Commitment to Europe Many European
leaders have expressed uncertainty about the United States' commitment
to Europe, based on President Barack Obama's "pivot to the Pacific" and,
more recently, President Donald Trump's questioning of the relevance and
value of NATO and the EU. The facts on the ground, however, demonstrate
that the United States, including the current administration, is fully
committed to its long-time allies and partners in Europe. Everything
promised by the Obama administration at the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw
is being delivered by the Trump administration: a rotational armored
brigade combat team, pre-positioned equipment for an army armored
division, and the Enhanced Forward Presence battle group in Poland. The
administration just announced an additional 1,500 soldiers in an
artillery brigade and short-range air defense battalion that will be
assigned to Europe. The operational contingency fund, known as the
European Reassurance Initiative, which started during the Obama
administration, has increased steadily over the last three years and is
now known as the European Deterrence Initiative, reflecting U.S. backing
for Europe and deterrence of Russia. Also telling was the Senate vote
just prior to this year's NATO's summit in Brussels, which affirmed by a
98:2 margin U.S. support for Article 5. The United States' commitment to
European partners like Ukraine and Georgia also remains very strong, as
evidenced by provision of the Javelin anti-tank weapon system, other
equipment, and training, as well as continued support for these
countries' eventual membership in NATO and the return of their
territories from Russia. U.S. Perspectives on European Military
Capabilities and Strategic Autonomy Europe is responding to these U.S.
initiatives with increased investments, adaptation of NATO's command
structures, increased training and readiness, and renewed efforts within
European frameworks to improve security and defense capabilities. The
United States will continue to welcome any increases in the capability
of its European allies and partners to contribute to collective security
and defense, and to take on more responsibility for the burdens of
global security and stability. The creation of the Permanent Structure
for Cooperation framework is particularly encouraging in that it is
legally binding and is already showing promise, with key projects such
as the one on military mobility. Efforts to create a larger EU military
structure, however, might be met with less enthusiasm. Parallel to NATO,
such a structure would create redundant and unnecessary capabilities,
and draw away the officers needed to fill existing European commitments
to the alliance. Some European leaders have called for European security
autonomy. However, the notion of autonomy is confusing and poorly
understood, even in Europe, let alone in the United States Even the
latter does not have unlimited autonomy: it seeks allies and builds
coalitions for everything it does. Furthermore, the United States does
not have the capacity nor the desire to carry out missions alone, as,
for example, in Afghanistan, Libya, or Syria. However, if a more
independent European security policy was to move forward in a spirit of
transparency while consciously avoiding redundancy, the United States
would likely be supportive. Having European troops on counter-terrorism,
counter-piracy, and peacekeeping missions in Africa is a welcome form of
burden sharing[.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, the United States depends on
European countries to lead in solving European problems, and to take on
a greater share of collective security in Europe; for example, with air
and missile defense, intelligence, and logistics. European help in the
Middle East and even in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific further
contributes to burden sharing. What Needs to Be Done Several things
still remain to be achieved if Europe and the United States are to get
to the point where they need to be. [First, they must build a common
approach not only in defense, but across economic, information, and
political domains as well. Inconsistencies in the behavior of some
European countries that pursue political and economic policies that are
counter to transatlantic security efforts are unhelpful, particularly
with respect to the deterrence of Russia and countering the growing
threat from China.]{.underline} As Assistant Secretary of State Wess
Mitchell recently stated, "We expect those whom America helps to not
abet our rivals. Western Europeans cannot continue to deepen energy
dependence on the same Russia that America defends it against. Or enrich
themselves on the same Iran that is building ballistic missiles which
threaten Europe."1 The United States supports the the Three Seas
Initiative as a way to build energy independence for Central and Eastern
Europe as well as improving infrastructure connection between Northern
and Southern Europe -- all of which will enhance Europe's stability,
security, and prosperity. Additional investment by the United States and
Western European countries into Central and Eastern Europe would be an
effective way to counter attempts by Russia and by China to drive a
wedge between the United States and Europe, and between European
countries. Second, continued inequity in burden sharing hinders a
stronger relationship between the United States and Europe, and it
erodes the confidence of many Americans in the efficacy of NATO.
Addressing the realities and the perceptions of this inequity is
important to address a sense of unfairness and unmet expectations in the
United States. The 2 percent defense spending pledge of all NATO members
at the Wales Summit in 2014, notably including using 20 percent of their
spending to invest in major new equipment and related research and
development, is an important step forward as well as a strategic message
to Russia that the alliance is prepared to address the changed security
environment. These investments are the necessary underpinning for all
that must be done for deterrence, defense, and projecting stability. To
paraphrase NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, it was acceptable to
reduce defense investment when tensions were low but it is also
important and necessary to be willing to increase them when tensions
rise. The need for European countries to increase defense spending is
nothing new. Every president since Dwight Eisenhower has challenged the
United States' European allies to do more. Even President Obama called
some European countries "free riders". Thanks to the efforts of
Stoltenberg and many national leaders, including President Trump, the
alliance has made meaningful progress with most members at or on a path
to achieve the 2 percent obligation by 2024. Nearly every one of them
has increased their defense spending or at least halted falls in it. In
reaching the necessary spending threshold, a more sophisticated
definition of burden sharing and the 2 percent goal is required.
Investments must be oriented towards collective security, and to do so
the focus must shift from inputs to outcomes. Stoltenberg has referred
to the "Three Cs": cash, capabilities, and contributions. The
transatlantic allies must invest today what is required to develop
capabilities tomorrow to make operational contributions the day after
tomorrow. Many of these required capabilities are not purely military,
nor are they financed by the budgets of the various Ministries of
Defense. Transportation infrastructure is well below what is needed for
fully effective deterrence or, if deterrence fails, operational
requirements. Cyber protection is necessary for all the airports and
seaports the alliance needs for rapid reinforcement and sustainment.
Fuel pipelines that reach into potential operational fields are
necessary. Protected fiber communications networks need to be in place
ahead of a crisis for moving rapidly forces from across the alliance.
NATO member states need to improve or build highways, bridges, and
tunnels that can accommodate larger vehicles. This is particularly the
case in Central and Eastern Europe because modern military vehicles,
such as German Leopard tanks or U.S. Abrams tanks, are much heavier and
larger than those that were typically used in former Warsaw Pact
countries. These are not military-specific capabilities but they are
essential for everything NATO does or will need to do. National defense
investment could be incentivized by counting spending on these essential
capabilities if they have demonstrable, dual-use military value. Third,
it is necessary to achieve greater coherence on NATO's eastern flank,
particularly in the Black Sea region. A new sort of Iron Curtain has
developed with Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey on one side and Russia on
the other, along with NATO's partners Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.
Russia has almost 10,000 soldiers occupying Abkhazia and South Ossetia
in Georgia. It has over 25,000 soldiers in the illegally annexed Crimean
peninsula and thousands of soldiers aiding separatists in Luhansk and
Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. In the Sea of Azov, Russia has built a
bridge across the Kerch strait, connecting its mainland to Crimea. This
effectively blockades Ukrainian ports because the bridge is too low to
allow the passage of many commercial vessels that would normally carry
Ukrainian steel from Mariupol to different markets. This was
intentionally done to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and stop its
efforts to join the West. It can also lead to a dangerous military
escalation, as illustrated by the recent seizing of Ukrainian naval
vessels by Russia. All of these activities are part of Russia's overall
effort to extend its control and influence in the Black Sea region,
which is vital to its operations in Syria, the eastern Mediterranean and
the Middle East. Europe needs to maintain its sanctions until Russia
lives up to the Minsk Agreement and returns Ukraine's occupied
territories. It should also continue to support eventual membership in
the EU and NATO by Georgia and Ukraine. Georgia should be invited to
join NATO immediately. Fourth, NATO must continue its efforts to improve
its deterrence capability against Russia's aggressive behavior.
Deterrence requires having the real capability to compel a potential
adversary. This is not simply a matter of equipment or formations, but
rather recognizing Russia's new approach to conflict, which seeks to
blur the distinction between peacetime and wartime, to use cyber and
misinformation to prevent political and military leaders from realizing
what is happening, and then to intimidate and coerce using the threats
or even force necessary to achieve its objectives. Underpinning this
capability are three different "speeds". First, speed of recognition.
This means using all means necessary to identify rapidly a situation
before it becomes a true crisis. [[This requires that the EU and NATO
improve intelligence sharing and communications]{.mark}, networks that
will certainly be under stress and likely targeted by
cyber-attacks.]{.underline} Second, speed of decision. Political leaders
will need to make decisions quickly in order to allow military
commanders to start the movement of equipment, units, and materiel when
necessary[. At the same time, they will want to avoid doing anything
that looks provocative or escalatory.]{.underline} This means, for
example, that planners cannot assume that governments will automatically
waive normal EU road restrictions, prioritize military convoys over
civilian commercial traffic on highways, or give priority to military
equipment on rail over previously scheduled commercial shipments. Thus,
most if not all initial reactions will happen in peacetime conditions.
Third, speed of assembly. This is key in order to give political leaders
options other than a liberation campaign. The transatlantic allies must
be able to move quickly to demonstrate to Russia that NATO is prepared,
determined, and positioned to protect its members and key interests.
This is why military mobility, essential for effective deterrence, is
already identified and supported as a priority by NATO and the EU. This
is the perfect nexus for their cooperation, one that was emphasized at
the NATO summits in Warsaw and Brussels. As they transition from
expeditionary operations to a deterrence posture, European members and
partners of the transatlantic alliance must regain a culture of
readiness where equipment, formations, and headquarters are all able to
perform their assigned missions. Having units that are not fully manned
or trained, or expensive vehicles or aircraft or ships that are not
properly maintained are clear signals that the alliance is not prepared
to defend its members -- and thus increases the risk of miscalculation
by Russia. Conclusion The United States is committed to the stability
and security of Europe, as it has been for over 100 years ever since the
first U.S. soldiers arrived in France during World War I. This has been
demonstrated regardless of who has been in the White House and which
party-controlled Congress. The American people have a special affinity
for Europe, and the economic prosperity of the United States depends on
the continent's security and stability. But they also expect that their
European friends and allies will pick up their share of the burden for
collective security so as to help maintain order around the globe and
ensure that Europe remains whole, free, and at peace.

### China Mod

#### NATO key to countering China in SCS and ECS 

**Brzezinski 6/1** - Ian Brzezinski is a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic
Council focusing on the Transatlantic Security Initiative and the
Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. He is the Former Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Policy, 2020 ("NATO's
role in a transatlantic strategy on China", available online at
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/natos-role-in-a-transatlantic-strategy-on-china/>,
The Atlantic Council)

On the eve of the NATO Summit in London last December, the Alliance's
Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg addressed the need for a collective
response to China's emergence as a global power]{.underline}. "This is
not about moving NATO into the South China Sea," he stated, "but [it's
about taking into account that China is coming closer to us---in the
Arctic, in Africa, investing heavily in our infrastructure in Europe, in
cyberspace.]{.underline}" At the summit, [NATO heads of state
diplomatically declared that China has become a concern:
"w]{.underline}e recognize that China's growing influence and
international policies present both opportunities and challenges that we
need to address together as an Alliance."

[Indeed, it is hard, if not impossible, for NATO to avoid
China]{.underline}[. **[Beijing presents a]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[full spectrum [challenge to the transatlantic
community]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a challenge whose potential mirrors,
if not surpasses, that once posed by the former Soviet Union. [China's
\$14 trillion economy is expected to soon surpass that of the United
States, and Beijing exercises that might in a **predatory fashion around
the globe**,]{.underline} including in the United States and Europe.
[China threatens to boycott companies and countries that criticize its
policies, leverages its debt instruments against poor nations, and is
buying up critical infrastructure around the world]{.underline}. Its
acquisition of European ports has raised concerns of top NATO commanders
who warn that such ownership could adversely affect the Alliance's
ability to use those facilities in times of crisis.

[[**China is a technological challenge to the West**.]{.mark} It is a
leader in [5G]{.mark} communications, [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, [hyper-sonic weapons, and quantum
computing]{.mark}. [It has demonstrated]{.mark} repeatedly that [it is
willing to exercise that prowess against Western interests and
security]{.mark}. Chinese cyber espionage and disinformation campaigns
have become part of daily life for all NATO allies, including both their
governments and private enterprises]{.underline}.

[Beijing's military is a major driver behind China's technological edge
and is developing and exercising global reach. China's \$260 billion
defense budget has a purchasing power estimated to equal or exceed 70
percent of that of the US defense budget.]{.underline} China's military
cooperation with Russia continues to expand and the two exercise not
only in the plains of Central Asia but in the Mediterranean and Baltic
Seas. **[[Chinese military forces]{.mark} are the pointy of end of the
spear Beijing uses to [undermine the rules based international
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Its maritime claims and aggressive
activities in S]{.mark}outh [and E]{.mark}ast [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}eas [stand among its more prominent
actions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[And, China's leadership relishes its role as an ideological challenge
to the West and the latter's practice of liberal democracy. China
usesits economic, technological, and military power to promote globally
its form of national authoritarianism.]{.underline} Beijing even asserts
that its political model has provided the most adept and agile response
to today's coronavirus epidemic.

So how should NATO should respond to China's growing global
assertiveness? What should be NATO's China strategy?

When considering this issue, [it is important to recognize that **[the
foundation for a]{.mark} relevant [NATO role in a transatlantic China
strategy has long been established]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For decades,
the Alliance has been operating around the world[. NATO has led the
International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan since 2003. Its
naval forces have patrolled against pirates off the shores of Africa,
commencing with operation OCEAN SHIELD in 2008. As a member of the
Coalition to Defeat ISIS, NATO provides training to military
establishments across the Middle East. And, on a daily basis the
Alliance addresses terrorism, cyber-threats, disinformation, and other
global issues.]{.underline}

[[Most relevant]{.mark} to addressing China [are the Alliance's
long-standing relationships with key democracies of the Indo-Pacific
region]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [NATO established Global
Partnerships with Korea, New Zealand, and Mongolia in 2012, Australia in
2013, and Japan in 2014.]{.underline} These relationships are
predominantly consultative, but most of these partners have contributed
to NATO missions, including in Afghanistan.

[As the transatlantic community's lead instrument for security
collaboration, NATO can contribute to the former's relationship with
China in three important ways. [As a multinational security forum, it
can foster among NATO allies and partners a shared awareness of China's
capacitie]{.mark}s and activities that generate risk to and opportunity
for the North Atlantic community]{.underline}. [NATO has long served as
an important forum through which its Allies and partners share
intelligence data and assessments needed to foster and facilitate
collaborative action.]{.underline}

Second, [[NATO can help develop and promulgate a transatlantic security
strategy]{.mark} and posture regarding China. [That]{.mark} strategy's
objectives [should include the development of a cooperative relationship
with China]{.mark} as well the dissuasion of China from undermining the
interests of the transatlantic community.]{.underline} The latter would
define the appropriate role and means for the Alliance to contribute to
deterrence and when necessary defense against Chinese aggression that
imperil those interests.

Third, [[NATO's civilian and military capacities should be used to
facilitate]{.mark} the defense and security component of a Western
strategy addressing China---including in the tasks of [engagement,
deterrence, and defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### SCS war escalates to extinction.

**Klare 17 --** Michael Klare, Professor of Peace and World Security
Studies at Hampshire College, "Escalation Watch: Four Global Hotspots
for Trump", Asia Times, 1-20,
http://www.atimes.com/article/escalation-watch-four-global-hotspots-trump/

Within months of taking office, President Donald Trump is likely to face
one or more [major international [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}, possibly
[[entail]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[a risk of **nuclear
escalation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not since the end of the Cold War has
a new chief executive been confronted with as many [potential
[**flashpoints** involv]{.mark}]{.underline}ing such [a
[potential]{.mark} for **[explosive conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This proliferation of crises has been brewing for some time, but [the
situation appears **[especially]{.mark} ominous** now [given
Trump]{.mark}'s pledge to bring American military force swiftly to bear
on any threats of foreign transgression]{.underline}. With so much at
risk, it's none too soon to go on a permanent escalation watch,
monitoring the major global hotspots for any sign of imminent flare-ups,
hoping that early warnings (and the outcry that goes with them) might
help avert catastrophe.

Looking at the world today, four [[areas]{.mark} appear to [pose
a]{.mark}n **especially [high risk]{.mark}** [of sudden]{.mark} crisis
and [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}: North Korea, [[the
**S**]{.mark}**outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}, the
Baltic Sea region, and the Middle East. Each of them has been the past
site of recurring clashes, and all are primed to explode early in the
Trump presidency.

Why are we seeing so many potential crises now? Is this period really
different from earlier presidential transitions?

It's true that the changeover from one presidential administration to
another can be a time of global uncertainty, given America's pivotal
importance in world affairs and the natural inclination of rival powers
to test the mettle of the country's new leader. There are, however,
other factors that make this moment particularly worrisome, including
the changing nature of the world order, the personalities of its key
leaders, and an ominous shift in military doctrine.

Trump may lift gold as new leaders carry risk

Just as the United States is going through a major political transition,
so is the planet at large. [[The]{.mark} sole-superpower [system]{.mark}
of the post-Cold War era [is]{.mark} finally giving way to a multipolar,
if not increasingly [fragmented]{.mark}, world in which [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[must
share]{.mark} the limelight [with]{.mark}]{.underline} other major
actors, including [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia, India, and Iran.
Political scientists remind us that [transitional periods can often
prove disruptive, as "status quo" powers]{.underline} (in this case, the
United States) [resist challenges to their dominance from ["revisionist"
states]{.mark} seeking to alter the global power equation. Typically,
this [can entail **proxy wars** and]{.mark} other kinds of [sparring
over]{.mark} contested areas, as]{.underline} has recently been the case
[in]{.underline} Syria, the Baltic, and [[the **S**]{.mark}outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline}.

This is where the personalities of key leaders enter the equation.
[Though]{.underline} President [[Obama]{.mark} oversaw constant warfare,
he [was]{.mark} temperamentally [disinclined to respond]{.mark} with
force]{.underline} to every overseas crisis and provocation, fearing
involvement in yet more foreign wars like Iraq and Afghanistan. His
critics, including Donald Trump, complained bitterly that this stance
only encouraged foreign adversaries to up their game, convinced that the
US had lost its will to resist provocation. In a Trump administration,
as The Donald indicated on the campaign trail last year, America's
adversaries should expect far tougher responses. Asked in September, for
instance, about an incident in the Persian Gulf in which Iranian
gunboats approached American warships in a threatening manner, he
typically told reporters, "When they circle our beautiful destroyers
with their little boats and make gestures that ... they shouldn't be
allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water."

Although with Russia, unlike Iran, Trump has promised to improve
relations, there's no escaping the fact that Vladimir Putin's urge to
restore some of his country's long-lost superpower glory could lead to
confrontations with Nato powers that would put the new American
president in a distinctly awkward position. Regarding Asia,
[[Trump]{.mark} has often spoken of his intent to punish
China]{.underline} for what he considers its predatory trade practices,
a stance guaranteed to clash with President Xi Jinping's goal of
restoring his country's greatness. [This [should]{.mark}]{.underline},
in turn, [[generate **additional possibilities** for
confrontation]{.mark}, especially in the contested South China
Sea.]{.underline} Both Putin and Xi, moreover, are facing economic
difficulties at home and view foreign adventurism as a way of
distracting public attention from disappointing domestic performances.

### China Mod -- Extension

#### Weakening NATO means Asian allies bandwagon to China -- takes SCS/Taiwan

Hans **Binnendijk**, 3-19-20**19**, distinguished fellow at the
**Atlantic Council**. He previously served as senior director for
defense policy on the Clinton administration's National Security
Council.

\"5 consequences of a life without NATO,\" Defense News, Acc:7-1-2020
(ermo/sms)

The fourth consequences of life without NATO would be global. [[American
bilateral alliances in Asia would each be shaken to their core should
NATO fail. America's defense commitments there would become
worthless]{.underline}]{.mark}. With China determined to claim a
dominant position in Asia, [[the collapse of NATO would
cause]{.underline}]{.mark} America's [[Asian partners to seek
**accommodation** with China]{.underline}]{.mark}, much as the
Philippines is in the process of doing.

Trump's decision to abandon the economic Trans-Pacific Partnership
agreement has already given China new advantages in the region. Without
credible American security commitments, [[there would be little to stop
China from controlling the **South China Sea and** probably occupying
**Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark} as well. [[Add to]{.underline}]{.mark}
this equation the [[new footholds that China is building in central
Asia, Africa and Europe: Abandoning NATO would]{.underline}]{.mark} help
[[assure China's]{.underline}]{.mark} competitive
[[success]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The final impact of [[NATO's retirement would]{.underline}]{.mark} be
the near [[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} of what has been called [[the
"liberal international order." This order consists of treaties,
alliances, agreements, institutions and modes of
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly [[created]{.underline}]{.mark} by
the United States in an effort [[to safeguard
democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[This order has kept relative peace]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
trans-Atlantic space [[for seven decades]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Trump
administration has begun to unravel elements of this order in the naive
notion that they undercut American sovereignty. [[The entire European
project is built on]{.underline}]{.mark} the edifice of [[this order.
NATO is its **principal keystone**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Collapsing this
edifice would undercut the multiple structures that have brought seven
decades of peace and prosperity.

So the answer is clear. Life without NATO would be more dangerous and
less prosperous. [Russia and [China would be the big winner]{.mark}s at
America's expense]{.underline}. NATO simply can't retire.

Yes, NATO has problems. It needs to be managed. But there is too much
left to be done for retirement. And there is too much to lose [[if NATO
fails]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### War over the South China Seas goes nuclear: 

Polina **Tikhonova**, 11/28/20**15** ([[Master\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}
Degree [[in English Philology from the University of
Oxford,]{.underline}]{.mark} "US Faces Nuclear War Threat Over South
China Sea -- Chinese Professor,"
http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/11/us-nuclear-war-south-china-sea/,
Acccessed 2/7/2017, rwg)

U.S. could provoke nuclear war with China And while the U.S. does not
have its core interests [[in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea, [the disputed islands present China's strategic
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is why this kind of asymmetry in
stakes would certainly give Beijing an advantage in "the balance of
resolve" over Washington, according to the professor. [And [if
the]{.mark} South China Sea [situation escalates and starts spiraling
into a nuclear confrontation between the U.S. and China,]{.mark}
Washington will face a choice of either backing down first or fighting a
nuclear-armed power]{.underline} and the world's largest military force
with a strength of approximately 2.285 million personnel. "[Neither
option is attractive and both exact high costs, either in reputation or
human lives]{.underline}, for the U.S.," Baohui wrote. So it would be
unwise for the U.S. to further provoke China in the disputed area, since
[[China's willingness to defend its interests,]{.mark} reputation and
deterrence credibility [could easily escalate the conflict into a
military confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline} that would ultimately harm
U.S. interests, according to the professor.

**NATO is taking steps toward combating Chinese aggression**

**AL JAZEERA** (al jazeera is an international news agency). "NATO
declares China a security challenge for the first time" 30 June **2022**
<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/30/nato-names-china-a-strategic-priority-for-the-first-time>

"[[One of the things that \[China's\] doing is seeking to undermine the
rules-based international order that we adhere to]{.underline}]{.mark},
that we believe in, that we helped build," said US Secretary of State
Antony Blinken. "And if China's challenging it in one way or another, we
will stand up to that." Western leaders are concerned that Russia's
aggression in Ukraine, which China is yet to condemn, could embolden
Beijing to be more assertive over Taiwan. China considers Taiwan a part
of its territory with no right to independent recognition as a state or
representation on the world stage. Speaking at an event in Madrid that
was not part of the NATO summit, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss
said [[that unless China is checked "there is a real risk that they draw
the wrong idea which results in a catastrophic miscalculation such as
invading Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}," referring to the self-governing
island that China claims as a province. Marcin Jerzewski, head of the
Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, told Al
Jazeera that [[NATO members may also be concerned about Chinese-Russian
military cooperation on Russia's oft-forgotten Pacific
coast]{.underline}]{.mark}. Before the war in Ukraine, Putin began
pursuing his own "pivot to the east" by ramping up economic development
and his military presence on the Pacific Coast. "[[This is an important
step for NATO and in a way a sign that NATO is waking up to a new
geopolitical reality, which is largely defined by the growing confluence
of Russian and Chinese strategic interests]{.underline}]{.mark},"
Jerzewski said. "Russia has been viewed mainly as a source of threats in
the European theatre, but that view ignores Russia's physical presence
on the shores of the Pacific." Highlighting NATO's new focus on China,
the gathering of world leaders in Madrid, both inside the bloc's summit
and on its sidelines, included many from Asian nations. It was the first
time that the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand
were invited to a NATO summit. They participated in a NATO session on
new global challenges after holding a side meeting outside of the
summit.

### Europe Mod

#### NATO prevents intra-European wars 

**Katz 15** \[Mark N. Katz, Professor of Govt & Politics at GMU, "Why
Russia Shouldn\'t Fear NATO," The National Interest, 2015,
[www.nationalinterest.org/feature/why-russia-shouldnt-fear-nato-13243](http://www.nationalinterest.org/feature/why-russia-shouldnt-fear-nato-13243)\]

[The corollary of Moscow belief that the expansion of NATO is a threat
to Russia is that the]{.underline} retraction,
**[incapacitation]{.underline}**, or dissolution [**of NATO** would make
Russia safer]{.underline}. Indeed, [Putin]{.underline}'s support for
anti-NATO and anti--EU political parties throughout Europe indicates
that he [does indeed aim at undermining these]{.underline} two
[institutions. Nor does Putin necessarily need to bring about their
**dissolution** in order to **undermine** them. Since NATO]{.underline}
and the EU both tend to [operate on the basis of consensus]{.underline},
the fact that the current political leaders of Hungary and Greece are
hostile to the existing European order and are quite friendly with
Moscow may go a long way toward furthering Putin's goal of rendering
NATO inoperable. And [if]{.underline} any more such leaders are elected
to power, [NATO]{.underline} might indeed [become unable to respond
effectively to actions taken by Putin to "protect" Russian
speakers]{.underline} elsewhere in Ukraine or even [in the Baltic
states]{.underline}. This clearly would not benefit the West. [But it
would not benefit Russia]{.underline} either. [For [the decline of NATO
is]{.mark} less [likely to lead to]{.mark} the unopposed rise of Russian
influence than to the **re-emergence of [conflicts that]{.mark} common
membership in [NATO has suppressed]{.mark}** or (**in the case of Greece
and Turkey) kept under control**. Putin has had relatively cooperative
relations with the often anti-Western Erdogan government in Turkey. He
also has good relations with Greece's new leftist
leadership]{.underline} that is [at odds with the EU. But
**[if]{.mark}**]{.underline} (whether as a result of Putin's actions or
not) [**[NATO becomes inoperable]{.mark}**, the **[Greek-Turkish
animosity]{.mark} that NATO helped keep from escalating** after Turkey's
1974 intervention in Cyprus [might]{.mark} **soon
[re-emerge]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} And **[if it does, it is]{.mark} highly
[doubtful]{.mark} that [Russia will be able to calm it
down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moscow may then be faced with the choice of
alienating one party because it sides with the other, or alienating both
because it sides with neither or (as Putin has attempted elsewhere)
tries to side with both simultaneously. [Despite Turkey's troubled
relations with the West recently, [Turkey may regard]{.mark} Russian
support for [Greece]{.mark} against it [as a]{.mark}n **existential
[threat]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **thus go all out to [support Chechen
and]{.mark} other Muslim [opponents]{.mark} of Moscow's rule in the
North Caucasus and other Muslim regions of Russia**. The
[decline]{.mark} of NATO [might]{.mark} also **[embolden]{.mark} an
increasingly nationalist**]{.underline} and pro-Russian [[**Hungary**
to]{.mark} **revive its [claim]{.mark} to "lost
territories**]{.underline}." Moscow might not mind if Budapest does this
[with]{.underline} pro-Western [Ukraine or Romania]{.underline} (with
which Russia also has difficult relations), but would not be pleased if
Hungary sought the return of territory that is now [[part
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [pro-Russian [Serbia or
Slovakia]{.mark}]{.underline} (where Moscow has also sought to cultivate
illiberal tendencies). Another problem for Moscow is that for every
anti-Western government elected to office anywhere in Europe, one or
more of its neighbors are likely to feel threatened by it and so turn to
America for support. Further, while German public opinion may care
little about what Russia is doing in faraway Crimea or Eastern Ukraine,
[**[Berlin is likely to]{.mark} take more active measures** to
[thwart]{.mark} Moscow's efforts to expand [Russian influence]{.mark} in
countries closer to it. Finally, [the more]{.mark} that Western [states
see Russian actions as]{.mark} directly [harming their security]{.mark},
[the **more incentive they will** ]{.mark}**have [to respond by arming
Ukraine]{.mark} or others** actively resisting Russia. In other words,
the **decline of the pax Americana in Europe** resulting from a weakened
[NATO is]{.mark} less likely to be [replaced by]{.mark} a pax Russica
there, but by [a **chaotic situation**]{.mark} **[in]{.mark}
[Europe]{.mark}** [that **Russia will be unable to control**]{.mark} or
prevent from negatively impacting not just Russia's external ambitions,
but **its internal security as well**]{.underline}. [Ironically, Russia
could **avoid all this** **if NATO remained strong and
intact**]{.underline}. Far from threatening Russia, [a strong NATO has a
**much greater incentive to act with self-restraint** toward Russia
**than individual countries** (both members and non-members) being
undermined by Russian actions]{.underline}. Indeed, offering NATO
membership to what remains of Ukraine may be the surest means of
inducing Kiev and the West as a whole to acquiesce to (though not
formally accept) the loss of Crimea and eastern Ukraine to Russia. In
other words, [Moscow is better off with a strong NATO that keeps America
in, Europe peaceful, and Russia by itself]{.underline} (if that's what
it wants) [than a weak NATO (or no NATO at all) [that keeps America,
Europe, and Russia]{.mark} **all [embroiled]{.mark} in needless
[conflic]{.mark}t**]{.underline} and tension

However, although the lack of an imminent Soviet threat eliminates the
most obvious danger, [[U.S. security has not been entirely separated
from the future of]{.underline}]{.mark} Western [[Europe]{.underline}.
[The ending of the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark} has brought many
benefits, but [[has not eliminated the possibility of a major power
war]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially since [[such a war could grow out
of a smaller conflict]{.mark} in the East]{.underline}. And, although
nuclear weapons have greatly reduced the threat that a European hegemon
would pose to U.S. security, a sound case nevertheless remains that [[a
major European war could threaten U.S. security. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [could be drawn into such a
war]{.underline},]{.mark} even if strict security considerations suggest
it should stay out. [[A major power war could escalate to a nuclear war
that]{.underline},]{.mark} especially if the United States joins,
[[could include attacks against the American
homeland]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, the United States should not be
unconcerned about Europe's future.

### Europe Mod -- Extension

#### NATO collapse causes European countries to turn inward and [re-invest]{.underline} into [domestic]{.underline} arms 

**Trofimov 19** - Columnist and Senior Correspondent, The Wall Street
Journal \[Yaroslav, Jan 4^th^, *Wall Street Journal,* "Is Europe Ready
to Defend Itself?",
<https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417>\]

The new Republican administration in Washington issued a blunt warning:
Unless Europe quickly set up its own unified army, the U.S. would be
compelled to undertake an "agonizing reappraisal" of its commitment to
defend its European allies.

The year was 1953, and the main target of American ire was France, whose
delay in ratifying the European Defense Community treaty, signed the
previous year, meant that preparations for a federal European army had
to be paused. But the pressure applied by the Eisenhower administration
backfired spectacularly: A joyous choir of French lawmakers broke into
the "Marseillaise" when France's parliament finally rejected the treaty
in August 1954. The idea of a joint European defense policy was shelved
for decades.

[Today]{.underline}, [the push for **European autonomy**]{.underline} in
defense---[and]{.underline} even for [a common]{.underline} European
Union [army]{.underline}---**[is gathering momentum
again]{.underline}**, in part [because of]{.underline} [**doubts** in
many European capitals about]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's
**willingness to defend** the continent against]{.underline} a renewed
threat from [Russia]{.underline}. Mr. Trump's abrupt decision to
withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, which prompted Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis to resign, has added new urgency to the drive.

This time around, the [revival]{.underline} of European defense
integration [is championed by]{.underline} French President Emmanuel
**[Macron and]{.underline}** German Chancellor Angela
**[Merkel]{.underline}**, while the American president keeps lobbing
angry tweets at the very idea. And inside Europe, the skeptics today
aren't in Paris but in the former Soviet vassal-states in the east that,
despite all their misgivings, still view the U.S. as the only credible
guarantor of their survival as independent nations.

[A historic swing in]{.underline} Europe's [public opinion]{.underline},
particularly in Germany---**[the EU's most powerful state]{.underline}**
and one where trans-Atlantic cooperation was the bedrock of the
political consensus since the end of World War II---[has fueled this
change]{.underline}.

Mr. Trump has described the EU as a "foe" and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization as "obsolete," and he has publicly questioned why American
soldiers should die for a NATO ally like Montenegro. One recent opinion
poll showed that [Germans]{.underline} now [rank]{.underline} Mr.
[Trump]{.underline} **[as the greatest threat]{.underline}** to their
country. In another, 73% of Germans described their relationship with
the U.S. as "bad," and [72% wanted]{.underline} [a foreign policy **more
independent**]{.underline} [from Washington's]{.underline}.

"[The shift in public opinion is due to]{.underline} a mix of
disappointment and fear," said Volker Perthes, director of the German
Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank that
advises the German government and parliament. "There is a [fear that the
U.S. will be **less interested** in Europe, and that the security
commitments of the U.S. will **no longer be reliable**]{.underline}."

It was in this political environment that Ms. Merkel told the European
Parliament in a landmark speech in November: "The times when we could
fully rely on others have ended....If we Europeans want to survive as a
community, we must make a greater effort to take our destiny into our
own hands."

Achieving such "strategic autonomy" became the EU's official policy in
2016. [Though calls by]{.underline} Mr. [Macron and]{.underline} Ms.
[Merkel]{.underline} for a European army **[are largely
rhetorical]{.underline}** so far, several [**concrete initiatives** to
achieve that goal have been launched]{.underline} since then. Probably
most significant is [the]{.underline} \$15 billion [European Defense
Fund]{.underline}, which aims to spur Europe's military industry and
could limit the influence of American weapons manufacturers. Another new
initiative is the so-called [Permanent Structured Cooperation
system]{.underline}, under which European armies seek to remove the
barriers to joint action that stem from fielding so many different---and
often incompatible---types of weapons. Addressing a frequently voiced
demand of Mr. Trump, European governments have also raised their defense
spending to get closer to the NATO target of 2% of each country's GDP.

On the face of it, there is no reason why an economic giant like the EU
shouldn't be able to protect itself against Russia even without American
help. Setting aside Britain (which seeks to continue to cooperate with
the EU on security and defense even after leaving the bloc), the
remaining EU's population and defense budgets are roughly three times
Russia's size. France, the EU's military powerhouse, spends almost as
much as Russia on defense just by itself and operates an independent
nuclear arsenal. All those sums, of course, are dwarfed by the U.S.,
whose military budget is nearly double the defense spending of the EU
(minus the departing U.K.) and Russia combined.

"Europe is addicted to the American security umbrella," said Bruno
Tertrais, deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a
think tank that advises the French government. "But if the U.S. weren't
there, Europe would have found a way to defend itself."

Yet there is a Catch-22 that makes these aspirations risky. [Building
up]{.underline} European defenses **[after seven decades]{.underline}**
[of American protection]{.underline} **[would take time]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, every move that Europe attempts in this direction spurs an
American backlash, further undermining NATO's cohesion---and its
deterrent capacity against a rapidly militarizing Russia.

"We have to hedge. But it is a very tricky situation: When does the
hedge become a wedge?" said François Heisbourg, a veteran French expert
who advised Mr. Macron's presidential campaign on security and defense.

"[Trump doesn't believe in alliances]{.underline} and doesn't understand
what an alliance is," he added. "So [if we discover that Plan
A]{.underline}---what has happened over the last 70 years---**[is no
longer on offer]{.underline}**, [**we would have been remiss** if we had
not worked on Plan B]{.underline}. But of course, we do not want to
precipitate the end of Plan A by getting Plan B wrong. This is the
challenge for every country that is allied with the U.S."

It is a particularly urgent challenge for NATO countries in Eastern and
Central Europe. Officials there fret about loose talk of a European army
and dislike the very concept of EU "strategic autonomy," fearing that it
may needlessly alienate the U.S. After all, if you border on Russia,
what you want is more Americans in your neighborhood now, not a pretext
for cost-conscious Washington to pull the plug. "Autonomy means autonomy
from someone---it's better to use another term, such as a European push
forward or European structural strengthening," said Lithuania's defense
minister, Raimundas Karoblis.

Poland, another neighbor of Russia, has even offered to pay more than
\$2 billion to set up a permanent U.S. base on its soil, proposing to
call it Fort Trump in a not-so-subtle appeal to the president's vanity.
(Washington is still evaluating the proposal, while German officials are
lobbying against it, fearing that it would further antagonize Russia.)

"We believe that the [United States is indispensable in European
security]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Bartosz Cichocki, [Poland's
deputy foreign minister]{.underline} for security affairs. He held up
the November 2018 incident in the Black Sea, where Russia attacked and
seized three Ukrainian navy ships, as a sobering example of just how
hollow the EU's role in defending the region's security remains. "Where
was Europe? Nowhere. Those who advocate a European army, European
self-sufficiency, had a great opportunity to take the lead, to show us
the way of how to de-escalate and how to stop Russia," he scoffed.

Such [divisions within Europe on security matters make it a much
**weaker adversary for Russia**]{.underline}, which has spent the past
decade upgrading its military and is now fielding an entire new tank
army on the EU's eastern flank.

The EU is likely dealing with a lasting change in the global security
architecture.

"In defense and defense industry, it is not Europe, it is 28 European
states," said Christian Mölling, [deputy director of Germany's
DGAP]{.underline} research institute, who co-[wrote]{.underline} a
recent report outlining the shortfalls in the EU's military muscle. "If
you take trade, we are acting as one with a central and single policy,
which makes us the biggest trading bloc in the world. But in defense,
**[we are not able to act as a huge force."]{.underline}**

[Trump's NATO-bashing surprised no one]{.underline}. He has repeatedly
suggested the United States' postwar security architecture is a "bad
deal," one negotiated by weak and foolish "incompetents." [Foreign
policy, in his view, is a zero-sum game]{.underline}; any benefit to
another nation must of necessity be a loss for the United States. "NATO
countries," he declared on Twitter, "must pay MORE, the United States
must pay LESS. Very Unfair!" Unfair? A world that revolves around
American military, economic and cultural power, and uses the U.S. dollar
as its reserve currency? [What Trump fails to understand is
that]{.underline} the disparity in spending, with [the U.S. paying more
than its allies, is not a bug of the system. It **is a
feature**]{.underline}. [This is how]{.underline} the
[great]{.underline} postwar [states]{.underline}men [designed it, and
this immensely foresighted strategy has ensured the absence of great
power conflict]{.underline}---[and nuclear war]{.underline}---[for
three-quarters of a century]{.underline}. [The open, liberal world order
we know today]{.underline} was built in the wake of World War II and
expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it [is led
by the United States; by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military
hegemony over Eurasia while uniting Europe under the U.S.'
protection]{.underline}. The goal of this American grand strategy is to
prevent any single power from dominating the region and turning on the
United States and its allies. [American hegemony serves]{.underline},
too, [to quell previously intractable regional rivalries,
preventing]{.underline} further [world wars]{.underline}. Dean Acheson,
George Marshall and the other great statesmen of their generation
pursued this strategy because they had learned, at unimaginable cost,
that the eternal American fantasy of forever being free of
Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in other words---was just
that: a fantasy. Four hundred thousand American men lost their lives in
the European theaters of the First and Second World Wars. (American
fatalities in all of the other 20th-century conflicts---including
Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total one-quarter of that
number.) Our postwar statesmen were neither weak nor incompetent. They
were the architects of the greatest foreign policy triumph in U.S.
history. [So successful was this policy that Americans
now]{.underline}---most of whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of
these wars---[see peace, unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's
natural state]{.underline}. **[This is an illusion]{.underline}**. For
centuries, Europe was the fulcrum of global violence. With the age of
global exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of violence,
the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every century with
improvements in technology for violence. The Scramble for Africa, the
division and colonization of that continent by Europe, is a case in
point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, which assembled the
representatives of 13 European powers to settle their colonial claims to
Africa by diplomacy in place of arms, did lead to peace in Europe for
several years. Africans, however, would not recall these years for their
exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King Léopold
II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property. Ten
million Congolese souls perished under his ministrations. In recognizing
this history of blood, however, we must recognize something equally
true: In the wake of World War II, liberal democracy saw its fullest
realization in the West. This flourishing of peace and human rights
cannot be explained by a sudden outbreak of European pacifism. (Consider
the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an infuriated President Dwight
Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) It happened because
during World War II, Europe destroyed itself, leaving the United States
overwhelmingly powerful by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union.
Through the application of economic, diplomatic and military force
majeure, the United States suppressed Europe's internal security
competition. This is why postwar Europe ceased to be the world's leading
exporter of violence and became, instead, the world's leading exporter
of luxury sedans. [Only America, and massive power as the U.S. exercised
it, could have pacified and unified Europe]{.underline} under its aegis.
No other continental country possessed half the world's GDP. No other
country had enough distance from Europe to be trusted, to a large
extent, by all parties and indifferent to its regional jealousies. No
other country had a strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe that
its inhabitants could be persuaded gladly to share. Indeed, Europeans
cooperated with the U.S. program because it created conditions under
which both the United States and Europe flourished. The United States
assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13 billion of aid in
the form of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars, roughly \$113
billion.) It midwifed the groupings and treaties that would become the
European Union. It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella with
the NATO treaty. Article V of the treaty, its most important element,
declares that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all
members. These policies were intended not only to counter the Soviet
Union, but to condition Europe's prosperity upon its integration into a
single market, with free movement of goods, capital and labor. The
founders of these institutions fully intended them to be the foundations
of a United States of Europe, much like the United States of America.
Profound economic interdependence, they believed, would make further
European wars impossible. At the same time, [the United States built an
open, global order upon an architecture of specific
institutions]{.underline}: the United Nations, the International
Monetary Fund and the International Court of Justice. [This order is in
many respects an empire]{.underline}---a Pax Americana---[but it is more
humane than any empire that preceded it]{.underline}, with institutions
that are intended to benefit all parties. Postwar U.S. statesmen
believed that prosperous, [liberal democracies that traded
freely]{.underline} with each other would [neither go to war with each
other nor the United States]{.underline}. They ascribed, in other words,
to the so-called Democratic Peace theory---a theory with overwhelming
empirical support. The U.S. military was always an integral part of the
plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War II,
U.S. troops have been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot
be dominated by a single power capable of monopolizing its resources and
turning them against the U.S. The United States has built overwhelmingly
massive military assets there to deter local arms races before they
begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S. protection
that there is no need to begin local arms races, for their safety is
guaranteed. American grand strategy rests upon the credibility of its
promise to protect American allies; this credibility rests, in turn,
upon U.S. willingness to display its commitment. (The Berlin Airlift,
when U.S. troops airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade,
was precisely such a display.) In return for the United States'
commitment, U.S. allies have accepted America's dominant role in the
international system. In the postwar era, just as now, the enemies of
liberal democracy sought to undermine the order the U.S. was building.
Precisely because the Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West
under the United States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda
organs cranked into overdrive to denounce it. A cartoon, for example,
published in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's
administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on destroying the
sovereignty of European nations. The French paper L\'Humanité, which
reliably parroted Moscow's line, wrote, "After disorganizing the
national economies of the countries which are under the American yoke,
American leaders now intend conclusively to subjugate the economy of
these countries to their own interests." The Soviet Union's criticism of
the Marshall Plan and other American involvement in Europe was eerily
similar to the language Russia's now uses in its campaign to undermine
NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and tropes of Russian propaganda are
widely echoed, wittingly or unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and
other antiliberal politicians, parties and movements throughout the
West. With the men who built the postwar world order now in their
graves, and the memory of carnage and horror buried with them, a very
sizable constituency of Americans has forgotten that their country built
this system for a reason---that [the United States does not maintain its
alliances as an act of foolish largesse]{.underline}. The loudest
exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the European
Union was "created to destroy us," and that multilateral institutions
such as the World Trade Organization assault the "sovereignty" of the
nations concerned is, unfortunately, the president of the United States.
It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are.
[History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is
never so cooperative]{.underline}. [Global free trade sustains modern
economic life. An interruption to this trade]{.underline}---carried out
chiefly on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S.
military---[would bring modern life to an end]{.underline}. The Second
World War proved not only that isolationism and American-Firstism were
fantasies, but exceptionally childish and dangerous ones, at that. In
the age of hyperglobalized trade, international air travel, the
internet, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, these
fantasies are even more childish and dangerous. The U.S. may be on
another continent, but it is not on another planet. It is true that the
U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was always part of
the deal. The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight a war anywhere
in the world, invade any country at will, and (at least in theory) fight
multiple simultaneous major wars---even in space. Of course this costs
more. It is in America's advantage to be the only power on the planet
that can do this. Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage
for other countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do.
Europe is America's biggest export market, as designed. We want
Europeans to spend their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not
razing Flanders to the ground yet again. [Yet Trump's refusal
to]{.underline} deter our shared enemies and [protect our allies risks
provoking a regional European **arms race**]{.underline}---exactly what
the U.S. has sought to avoid for 74 years[. It is an invitation to
adventurism from Putin]{.underline}. Trump's refusal to adopt the
encouraging language of past presidents toward European integration,
language that until now has been transformed into policy by professional
and experienced State Department employees, puts further strain on an
already-weakened Europe. Above all, Trump's overt support for sordid,
Kremlin-backed actors who seek to undermine Europe's unity is
unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's interest, or in ours, for the
American president to lend the United States' prestige and support to
Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal Marxists, populists,
authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists, particularly since all of them
are ideologically hostile to the United States? The damage
[Trump]{.underline} has deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability
[comes at a uniquely dangerous time]{.underline}. Democracy's so-called
third wave---the global blossoming of open political systems after the
Cold War---has long since receded. [A threat to liberal
democracy]{.underline}, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology---illiberal democracy---[is ascendant]{.underline}. We see it
today in Russia and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and
hollow form of democracy that spreads and consolidates itself through
the new technologies of the 21st century. The global order the U.S.
built was based on the principle that [only a world of liberal
democracies can be peaceful and prosperous.]{.underline} That principle
is correct. [Should the unraveling of the order the U.S. built
proceed]{.underline} at this pace, [the world will soon be neither
peaceful nor prosperous]{.underline}. [Nor will the effects be confined
to regions distant from the United States. America will feel
them]{.underline} gradually, and then, probably, overnight---[in the
form of a devastating, sudden shock]{.underline}. Charles de Gaulle
believed the Anglophone world could not, in the long term, be trusted
with French security. It led him to withdraw France from NATO's military
integrated command and launch an independent nuclear development
program. The independent nuclear program was real, but the withdrawal
from NATO wasn't---a secret agreement kept France in NATO anyway. But,
today, with other NATO members obliged to consider the costs and
benefits of an independent accommodation with Russia and the risks and
rewards of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, de Gaulle is
saying from the grave, I told you so. [The American-led world
order]{.underline}, undergirded by the ideal of liberal democracy, has
been highly imperfect. But it [has been the closest thing to Utopia our
fallen and benighted species has ever seen. Its benefits are not just
economic, although those benefits are immense]{.underline}. [Its
benefits must be measured in wars not fought, lives not
squandered]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline} many [Americans have turned
their backs]{.underline} on history and reality alike. [Let us hope
pride does not prevent them from realizing this mistake before it's far
too late]{.underline}

#### NATO vital to European stability

Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University's School

Survive
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-west-must-move-east-for-nato-to-survive/2022/06/29/35087340-f779-11ec-81db-ac07a394a86b_story.html

The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are in
Madrid for the alliance's most consequential summit in a generation.
NATO appears to have overcome Turkish diplomatic blackmail to bring in
two new members, Sweden and Finland. It must approve a new concept for
transatlantic security amid Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine.

Not least, the alliance --- and the US --- will confront an inconvenient
reality: Even if the Ukraine war takes a heavy toll on Russia, [[NATO
will need a stronger presence in Eastern Europe than it possessed before
the conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Since Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, NATO has had a
tripwire strategy for defending its easternmost members. The alliance
sprinkled a few thousand troops across Poland and the Baltic States. And
it chose to rotate those forces in and out rather than stationing them
there permanently, in part due to cost and in part out of respect for a
1997 agreement with Russia that Moscow had already egregiously violated.

Such a modest force could not withstand a major Russian attack. It
could, however, ensure that U.S. and other NATO troops would be killed,
thereby setting off a larger, decisive Western response.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, the Pentagon has sent
additional forces into Eastern Europe: It now has roughly 10,000 troops
in Poland, 2,500 in Romania and 2,000 in the Baltic States. The larger
US contingent in Germany has also been reinforced, now at roughly 40,000
personnel. The goal was to ensure that Russia, perhaps emboldened by
what many analysts thought would be an easy subjugation of Ukraine, was
not tempted to take its aggression into NATO territory.

Yet Russia stumbled into a bloody mess, suffering massive losses of
infantry, armor, special operations forces and other capabilities. The
Kremlin's bungling of the invasion also raised questions about how
highly to rate those troops that remain.

Russia's blunders have led some NATO members, such as France and Italy,
to argue that greater forward presence in the east is now unnecessary.
And with European countries ramping up defense spending, one also hears
arguments that the US should leave any additional security measures in
Europe to the Europeans and consummate its perpetually postponed "pivot
to Asia" instead.

Those are bad ideas. The outcome in Ukraine is still in doubt, thanks to
Moscow's gains in the east and the south and to its severe attrition of
Kyiv's armed forces. Russia may still achieve a pared-down goal of
seizing much of the Donbas and a "land bridge" to Crimea; one way or
another, President Vladimir Putin has shown he can inflict terrible
damage even with a terribly damaged military.

Well-informed analysts have also cautioned that Russia might do better
in a conflict with NATO --- the war it has trained and motived its
forces to fight --- than it has done in Ukraine.

The current conflict has reminded us, moreover, that we still really
don't know Putin's mind. For years, his risk-taking has caught even the
smartest Kremlin-watchers by surprise.

Most important, [[Ukraine has shown why a tripwire defense of Eastern
Europe isn't enough:]{.underline}]{.mark} It requires frontline states
to see key portions of their territory conquered and then wait patiently
for liberation.

That has always been a nasty scenario, because it could allow Russia to
grab a chunk of land and then use nuclear threats to deter NATO from
fighting back. It looks even uglier now that the world knows exactly
what crimes Russian forces perpetrate --- rape, murder, torture and
other horrific abuses. The problem with a tripwire strategy, Estonian
Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said last week, is that being attacked by
Russia means "complete destruction of countries and our culture."

All the talk about enhanced European defense notwithstanding, [[there's
no good alternative to the US taking the
initiative]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Ukraine war has been an object
lesson in the value of American leadership: In the months prior to
February 24, Washington repeatedly warned, on the basis of its unmatched
intelligence capabilities, that Putin was deadly serious about invading
--- yet many European leaders were skeptical.

[[If the US were to decide that Europe can now look after itself, the
result would be a weaker NATO riven by disputes between frontline states
that rightly fear Putin and Western European states, such as France,
that still hope for some diplomatic accommodation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

At the heart of the second pillar, the development of capabilities, is
**[[NATO's]{.mark} "defense against [terrorism program]{.mark} of
work"]{.underline}** (NATO, April 9, 2015). Its aim **[is to [develop
innovative tech]{.mark}nologies [to]{.mark} help [prevent
attacks]{.mark} and better protect troops and civilian
infrastructure]{.underline}**. Under three umbrellas --- **[[incident
management, force protection]{.mark} and [survivability]{.mark}, and
network [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[the program
[covers]{.mark} a wide variety of areas such as]{.underline}**:
protecting against man-portable air defense systems (MANPADs) or
**[[CBRN]{.underline}]{.mark}** (chemical, biological, radiological and

explosive devices (IED); biometric identification; protection of ports
and harbors; and experimenting with non-lethal weapons. The program is
run on the basis of common funding by all allies, and projects are led
by individual NATO countries, with support and contributions from other
member states. **[The third pillar of NATO's counter-terrorism
activities is intended to contribute to regional stability through
capacity building in partner countries.]{.underline}** As Secretary
General Stoltenberg put it at the latest foreign ministerial meeting,
"in the long run, it is much better to fight terrorism and project
stability by training local forces, building local security
institutions, instead of NATO deploying large numbers of our own combat
troops in combat operations." \[2\] It was in this spirit that in
February 2017 the Alliance launched an in-country training program
teaching Iraqi security forces to counter IEDs, while also continuing to
train hundreds of Iraqi officers in Jordan (al-Arabiya, January 24).
Furthermore, in 2016 mobile counter-terrorism training courses were
provided to Egypt, and training in counter-insurgency was provided to
Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. According to Secretary General
Stoltenberg, "the possible use of NATO's mobile training teams and
special operation forces headquarters is one of the different options
\[**[NATO is\] looking into \[when it comes to deciding\] what more we
can do in general to fight terrorism"]{.underline}** (NATO, March 31).
Beyond the three main areas identified by the 2012 Policy Guidelines,
**[[NATO's involvement]{.mark} in the fight [against terrorism]{.mark}
sometimes [occurs in a]{.mark} more [directly operational
context]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In fact, following the 9/11 attacks on
the United States, the Alliance invoked Article 5 --- NATO's collective
defense clause --- for the first time in its history.

The studies of a few cases of earlier CBRN actions have led experts to
identify the key characteristics of terrorist groups that could
potentially have an interest to use these weapons. It is thought that
conservatism is inherent in terrorist organizations, but it must not be
forgotten that [some terrorists are inclined to innovations in weapons
and tactics, as well as to taking risks in actions or in the choice of
weapons]{.underline}. Many experts agree that most terrorist
organizations want to use proven methods to achieve desired effects.
Innovations, especially in the field of CBRN weapons, often indicate
terrorists are likely to be led by other factors rather than by pure
curiosity and desire to experiment. For some individuals, repression and
democratic and strong rule of law are positive determinants of the
emergence of CBRN actions which points to a new and more complex global
security environment with an increasing risk of terrorists trying to
perform a CBRN attack. It is a frightening fact that [[a **single
terrorist**]{.mark} or isolated terrorist group [could improvise a
**biological weapon**]{.mark} or use other ways to spread anthrax,
smallpox or other biological agents and thereby cause mass casualties
and destroy the health care system of a state.]{.underline} CBRN weapons
are secretly shipped to terrorists or hostile governments and represent
a significant and growing threat to many countries. Although the threat
of CBRN attacks is widely recognized as the central issue of national
security, most analysts assume that the primary danger is a threat of
the military use of these weapons in conventional wars with tra-ditional
military means while [the **threat** of covert attacks, which include
terrorism, is rashly and **unfairly neglected.**]{.underline} [Covert
attacks are difficult to deter or prevent and **[CBRN weapons]{.mark}
suitable for this type of attack [are available to a growing number of
enemy]{.mark} states and [groups]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same
time, restrictions on their use appear to be diminishing, and so-called
new terrorists do not always escalate and become apparent only by using
unconventional weapons. These weapons are easily spread or transmitted
from person to person, have a high mortality rate and a potential impact
on public health, causing mass casualties that can crush health systems
and cause public panic and social disruption, thus requiring special
efforts to suppress them. When assessing the threat of CBRN weapons, we
should take into account the change in capacity to carry out terrorist
attacks that are on the rise among countries and non-government
elements. Analysts believe that the fear of chemical and biological
terrorist attacks is excessive, they point out that, in the past, very
few attacks involved these weapons, and even those few attempts that
have occurred were mostly thwarted by the authorities. A relative ease
with which biological weapons can be obtained, along with other current
changes and turbulences in the world, sets the stage for another type of
warfare in the 21st century. The potential for CBRN terrorism has widely
grown since 11 September, when some of these materials were used. The
danger of terrorist use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction represents a very serious threat for many countries; if a
terrorist group could gain access to this weapon, it is highly likely it
would use it, or threaten to use it. Although there is very little
information on terrorists and their ability to come into possession of
nuclear weapons or on their intentions to get them, the risk of CBRN
weapons has certainly increased since the terrorists started to become
more familiar with these agents and their harmful consequences.
Discovering the nature of the threat of biological weapons, as well as
the appropriate response to them requires an emphasis on the biological
characteristics of these instruments of war and terror. Preparing for a
terrorist attack may seem daunting and there are a small number of
people with practical experience and a good knowledge of CBRN weapons,
because until recently there was no need to own them. In the past, most
of the planning regarding emergency response to terrorism concentrated
on the concerns of open attacks (bombing). However, the threats of CBRN
weapons are taken seriously, especially in the USA, where media,
fascinated by new weapons of mass destruction, encourage a growing fear
for public safety. Terrorists who have significant human and material
resources are much more likely to realize their intentions than lone
perpetrators or small terrorist groups. A CBRN terrorism threat is
certainly a matter of concern; however, terrorists will face many
obstacles in the implementation of an attack of this kind. This includes
the acquisition of materials and preparation for spreading them as well
as a selection and a survey of a chosen objective and a correct dose
required to achieve a desired effect. The growing threat of CBRN
terrorism Terrorism can be defined as a deliberate act of violence
intended to cause damage, but also to create an appropriate political
and ideological situation, so that the use of these non-traditional
weapons of terror outside the context is obvious, and the goals will not
be military, but civilian ones (Bioterrorism, chemical weapons, and
radiation terrorism, nd). Toxic substances, regardless of whether they
are of animal, vegetable or mineral origin, were used throughout the
history for political assassinations and sabotage; despite the risk of
severe penalties, the prospects for success favoured the use of toxic
substances. Such use has always been reduced, however, since only a
small number of people had access to substances and possessed the
ability of learn how to use them (Pascal, 1999). CBRN weapons are
rightly viewed with a special sense of horror, their effects can be
devastating and indiscriminating, and they take the most stringent toll
among the most vulnerable population, non-combatants (e.g. a biological
attack cannot be detected sufficiently fast after the disease spreads
through the population). Moreover, chemical and biological weapons are a
particularly attractive alternative for groups that do not have the
ability to produce nuclear weapons, and this risk raises complex but
important ethical issues (London, 2003). The common name for CBRN
terrorism which causes the death of a large number of people, large
scale damage and a strong echo worldwide is post-industrial or
hyper-terrorism. This means that non-state elements possess and dispose
of assets that were previously held only by states, but unlike them,
which often fear reprisals after WMD attacks, terrorists, having no
geographical location, are ready to use WMD with much less
scrupulousness and fear (Kurmnik, Ribnikar, 2003). Some authors have
described the factors that make chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear terrorist attacks in many ways unique and demanding, such as an
element of surprise, invisible agents, ordnance, the risk of repetition
and new types of risks (Ruggiero, Voss, 2015). In the past 30 years, the
use of CBRN weapons has become a major concern for many nations around
the world. The public has become insensitive to traditional terrorist
attacks that seem to be a less efficient way for terrorist organizations
to achieve their goals. What causes shock and fear is actually
presenting the properties of weapons which can be used by terrorist
organizations to enhance their efforts and the effectiveness of attacks.
CBRN terrorism is often a synonym for weapons of mass destruction,
although this form of terrorism and related incidents do not require
attacks and inflicting harm to large numbers of people - they do not
even require deadly attacks at all. The number of studies on this type
of terrorism is limited due to the lack of available data on this
terrorism type. There is a very small number of databases of CBRN
incidents, and even the existing ones have relatively little to do with
them and they are compared to conventional terrorism (Jesse, 2012). Some
experts emphasize the factors that promote such attacks and these
factors include the availability of information and expertise, increased
frustration of terrorists, demonization of the target population, as
well as a millennial, apocalyptic or messianic vision. Experts also
differ in opinion when it comes to possible perpetrators of CBRN
incidents, and include religious fundamentalists and cults1 as possible
perpetrators of such attacks, especially when these groups address to
ethereal audience, emphasizing the hatred of unbelievers (Ivanova,
Sandler, 2007). Concerns about super terrorism which involves the use of
CBRN weapons are mainly focused on what terrorists can do in the context
of our social reality, with an emphasis on terrorist motivations,
initiatives and limitations. When considering which terrorist groups may
be inclined to commit CBRN terrorism, it is important to recognize the
spectrum of these acts, as well as to analyze the following
categorization: (a) massive casualty events produced by conventional
weapons; (b) CBRN scams; (c) conventional attack on a nuclear facility;
(d) limited-scale chemical or biological attack or a radiological
dispersion; (e) large scale chemical or biological attack or a
radiological dispersion; and (f) CBRN strikes (super terrorism) that can
lead to thousands of victims. In addition to the motivation and
willingness to inflict mass casualties in any way, terrorists must have
technical and financial capabilities to come into possession of material
and acquire skills for these types of weapons and materials and carry
out a successful attack. Chemical and biological weapons can pose a risk
to terrorists thus deterring them from using such weapons (Post, 2005,
pp.148-151). The possibility that terrorists use chemical or biological
substances may increase over the next decade, according to US
intelligence agencies. According to CIA2 , an interest among non-state
actors, including terrorists, for biological and chemical materials is
real and growing, and the number of potential perpetrators is
increasing. The agency also noted that many of these groups had
developed an international network and did not need to rely on state
sponsors for financial and technical support. However, it is believed
that it is less likely that terrorists would choose chemical and
biological weapons over conventional explosives, because these weapons
are difficult to control and their results are unpredictable (Condesman,
Burke, 2001). The risk of CBRN weapons is growing since terrorists are
better acquainted with these agents and their potential for causing
harm3 . These agents possess desirable characteristics as weapons of
terror; they are biologically invisible to the naked eye, odorless and
potentially lethal in the form of particles; natural organisms are so
readily available, and can be \"camouflaged\" in natural disasters and
used to spread fear and various diseases. Chemical agents quickly attack
the critical physiological centers of the body, disabling or killing the
victim. Biological and chemical weapons require the application of huge
amounts of resources and result in different effects, causing fear and
panic in the contaminated areas. Often referred to as \"weapons of mass
destruction\", but, in medical terms, they are weapons of potential mass
casualties because they can lead to massive death toll in the absence of
preventive measures and timely response (Meyer, Spinella, 2014,
pp.645-656). \"Bioterrorism is the intentional use of microorganisms or
toxins derived from living organisms used for hostile purposes intended
to cause disease or death in man, animals and plants, on which they
depend\". The threat of bioterrorist attacks is real, and each
individual is a potential terrorist, when terrorists are \"invisible\"
prior to an attack which also can be \"invisible\" in the form of
causing infectious disea-ses or epidemics. Citizens who are not aware
they are infected are potential safety hazard and so-called dangerous
bodies (Mijalković, 2011). In the last ten years, the issue of CBRN
weapons has attracted the attention of experts, but a list of priorities
by the heads of states has never been established. Biological weapons
almost became forgotten after they had been banned by the 1972
Convention on Biological Weapons. A significant attention was paid to
them during the 90s of the last century. The important thing is that
biological weapons attract much less attention than other similar
weapons, but probably represent the greatest danger, and in addition to
their use in war, they are available as instruments of terror in peace.
Some countries showed willingness to use such weapons against
defenseless populations to achieve strategic objectives, and in this
regard, some analysts believe that those who attacked the World Trade
Center in 1993 applied cyanide on their bombs (this was not confirmed,
but a large amount of cyanide was found in possession of the
perpetrators). Such a group will prove to be less inefficient, because
if terrorists decide to shock and surprise the government by inflicting
enormous damage, CBRN weapons will become more attractive and more
accessible (Bettis, 1998). Motives and forms of behavior of individuals
and groups who acquired or used CBRN weapons have existed since long ago
and there is no doubt that modern society is vulnerable to such attacks
(Tucker, 2000). Fear of biological terrorism is certainly greater than
the fear of the conventional forms of terrorism; some of these fears are
justified and some are often exaggerated. Some agents are really very
contagious and deadly, and if used properly, have a potential to result
in casualties similar to those in a nuclear attack. Perhaps the scariest
aspect of biological weapons is that the body is attacked without
warning, people are afraid of the threat as it is invisible, and cannot
be heard or felt. The history of warfare, terrorism and crime involving
biological agents in the last century is considerably less dangerous and
more deadly than the history of conventional warfare (Parachini, 2001).
[Today, some states and some terrorist [groups]{.mark} can more
**[easily overcome]{.mark}** technological [**barriers** due to]{.mark}
the increased flow of **[info]{.mark}**rmation [and]{.mark} **access**
to previously unavailable **[tech]{.mark}**nologies.]{.underline}
**[Along with nuclear and chemical weapons, biological weapons are part
of an unholy trinity of weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}**
(Davis, Johnson-Winegar, 2000, pp.15-28). [The **[society is]{.mark} now
[faced with]{.mark} the threat of [an apocalyptic]{.mark} and asymmetric
[war]{.mark} scenario** in which kamikaze attackers are able to arm
themselves with WMD4]{.underline} without even having to have a
\"physical\" weapon to create fear; they probably still prefer simple,
proven methods: a stampede in an enclosed place, or just an explosive
device, which will kill many people5 (Palmer, 2004, pp.3-9). Early
detection and response to biological or chemical terrorism are crucial
to solving this problem (U.S. Congress House, 2003, p.117).

report: "NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis." [Nearly all viewed
Trump as NATO's most urgent and difficult problem.]{.underline}

Never before has NATO had a U.S. leader who didn't appear to believe
deeply in NATO itself. During his first two years in office,
[[Trump]{.mark} has [questioned NATO's]{.mark} core
[commitment]{.mark}]{.underline} embedded in Article 5 of the alliance's
founding treaty --- that an attack on one of the allies will be
considered an attack on all. He has been weak and reactive in defending
NATO against its most aggressive adversary, Russian President Vladimir
Putin.

Trump has also been a consistent critic of European democratic leaders
such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while publicly supporting
anti-democratic populists such as Hungarian President Viktor Orban.
Trump is the first president to call the European Union a "foe," rather
than a partner, of the United States.

Fortunately, the vast majority of Republican and Democratic leaders in
Congress disagree with Trump on NATO's value to the United States. They
should vote to approve the bills working their way through committees
that would reaffirm the United States' commitment to Article 5 and to
require congressional approval should Trump try to diminish our
commitment to NATO --- or to pull the United States out altogether.
Congress would be acting in unison with the public's strong support for
NATO, according to a 2018 poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

Critics who agree with Trump present three main arguments for why he is
right to question NATO. First, they say NATO's core job was finished
with the end of the Cold War. That ignores, however, Russia's campaign
to destabilize NATO members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. It
also ignores Putin's attacks on the U.S. and European elections in
2016-2018, designed to weaken our democracies from within. Containing
Russian power until Putin's Soviet-trained generation passes from the
scene remains a core NATO aim. And, as our report shows, there are new
challenges beyond Russia confronting the alliance.

Second, Trump has claimed the allies are "taking advantage of us." Low
European defense spending is indeed a problem for NATO's future.
Germany, in particular, must do much more. But NATO allies have produced
real growth in defense spending for four consecutive years, starting
with Putin's annexation of Crimea --- a collective increase of \$87
billion. On this issue, Trump would be smart to continue to push but
while doing so strive to transform himself from chief critic into the
unifying leader NATO desperately needs.

A third criticism is that NATO no longer contributes significantly to
U.S. security in the world. Consider the facts: Canada and the European
allies came to our defense on 9/11 and invoked the Article 5
mutual-defense clause of the treaty. They viewed Osama bin Laden's
attack on the United States as an attack on them as well. NATO allies
went into Afghanistan with us where they and partner nations have
suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths. Most of those countries remain
on the ground with our soldiers to this day.

NATO allies have also fought with us in the s[uccessful campaign to
defeat the Islamic State caliphate in Syria and Iraq]{.underline}. They
conduct c[[ounterterror operations with us in
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. The European allies have assumed full
responsibility for peacekeeping in Bosnia and the bulk of the burden in
Kosovo.

[U.S. air and naval [bases]{.mark} in allied countries]{.underline} also
[[bring the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [a continent closer
to]{.mark}]{.underline} contain Russia in Eastern Europe and [[confront
**terrorist threats** in the **Mid**]{.mark}dle [**East** and]{.mark}
**South [Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This is a **decisive
advantage**]{.mark} for the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. The
reality is that NATO is a net plus for the United States in political,
economic and military terms.

[[In the decade ahead, the]{.mark} **U**nited [**S**tates will fight
**two battles** with]{.mark} authoritarian powers **[China and
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The first]{.underline}]{.mark} [is a

growing [confidence in]{.mark} the [superiority of their]{.mark} own

While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) [was [founded on]{.mark} the idea of
[collective defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, the nature of
[[security]{.mark} threats has [changed]{.mark} since its
inception]{.underline}. [The Cold War-era alliance is [struggling to
adapt to]{.mark} evolving [technology]{.mark} and the altered nature of
warfare]{.underline}. [Nowhere is this [more true]{.mark} than
[in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} realm.]{.underline} **[NATO
[policymakers]{.mark} have [acknowledged
cyberwarfare]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}as a distinct sphere of
conflict, **[but they [have not yet tailored]{.mark} nuclear-era
concepts of]{.underline}** [**[deterrence]{.underline}**]{.mark} and
response to this new domain. As cyberattacks increase in destructive
potential and remain difficult to attribute, the alliance face the
dilemma of whether and how to adapt their policy of strategic ambiguity
to a new era of cyberwarfare. At their annual summit last month, [the
twenty-nine allies [reaffirmed the integral
role](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_156624.htm)
cybersecurity plays in NATO]{.underline}, [creating a Cyberspace
Operations Center]{.underline} to supplement existing cyber defense
facilities and reaffirming the need for an offensive capability "to
deter, defend against, and to counter the full spectrum of cyber
threats." [[Missing from the communique]{.mark}, however]{.underline},
were any [[rules of engagement]{.mark} for the cyber
sphere]{.underline}. This raises the question: [**[How would NATO
respond]{.underline}**]{.mark} if a member state were to invoke
[[Article V of the North Atlantic
Treaty]{.underline}](https://www.nato.int/cps/ua/natohq/topics_110496.htm)
**[[following]{.mark} a [cyberattack]{.mark}?]{.underline}** The
[NATO]{.underline} alliance [has long maintained a policy of strategic
ambiguity]{.underline} when it comes [to nuclear policy]{.underline},
leaving open the possibility that a conventional attack might be met
with a nuclear response. (By contrast, China and India have adopted
"no--first use" policy for nuclear weapons.) [NATO's nascent
cyber]{.underline} [policy exhibits a similar ambiguity]{.underline},
intentionally leaving unclear how the alliance would react to a
cyberattack. Rather than responding in kind, NATO might instead conduct
conventional attacks, such as missile strikes, allowing for rapid
escalation. [[Early cyberattacks were]{.mark} largely seen as
[low-stakes]{.mark} events]{.underline}: an inconvenience for the
financial sector and dangerous for personal data, but not a threat to
national security or justification for a military response. [This is [no
longer]{.mark} necessarily [the case]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
[coordinated [Russian cyberattack]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[[against a nuclear power
plant]{.underline}](http://www.nti.org/analysis/atomic-pulse/cyberattacks-nuclear-power-plants-how-worried-should-we-be/)
in Europe and the United States [[could have devastating
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}, were it to result in major radiation
leaks. An [[attack on a country's electric
grid]{.underline}](https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2017/03/ContingencyPlanningMemo31_Knake.pdf),
a softer target, could in theory cause hundreds of billions of dollars
in damage and put lives at risk as traffic lights stop working,
hospitals lose power, and unrest erupts. Given these stakes, **[[NATO
has]{.mark} an obvious [incentive to strengthen]{.mark} its [capacity to
deter and punish cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including through
conventional retaliation. A U.S. [[Department of Defense
memorandum]{.underline}](https://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2010s/DSB-cyberDeterrenceReport_02-28-17_Final.pdf)
published in early 2017 stated that at least for the next decade,
**[[offensive cyber]{.mark} capabilities are likely to [outpace cyber
defense]{.mark}, [making deterrence]{.mark} the most [viable
option]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Both the [[United
States]{.underline}](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304563104576355623135782718)
and
[[NATO]{.underline}](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/28/nato-assisting-ukrainian-cyber-defences-ransom-ware-attack-cripples/)
also recognize that a devastating [[cyberattack]{.mark} could quickly
[escalate]{.mark} to violent conflict by triggering a conventional
response]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the alliance's policy of strategic
ambiguity falls short. By failing to define the rules of engagement for
retaliation, the alliance leaves open the potential for chaos in
determining an appropriate response to cyberattacks. In doing so, it
invites adversaries to test the waters. [[Cyber deterrence]{.mark} is
inherently [more challenging than nuclear]{.mark} or
conventional]{.underline} deterrence because such attacks are difficult
to definitively attribute to a particular actor. For example, it is
easier to mask the source of a cyberattack on a power grid than it would
have been for the Warsaw Pact to conceal a massive incursion into West
Germany. This attribution problem could complicate NATO's capacity to
conclusively determine the source of a cyberattack and justify and
conduct a timely conventional response, particularly if member states
diverge in their perceptions. This dilemma could strain the foundations
of collective defense and undermine any unified front against
cyberattacks. For NATO to commit to military action, [all of its
[members would need certainty]{.mark}]{.underline}, beyond a reasonable
doubt, about the identity of the perpetrator. This is [particularly true
[in the case of Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}---a known sponsor of
cyberattacks. Without conclusive proof, it might be a challenge to
convince a distant country like Portugal or a dangerously close one like
Estonia to join in a counterattack. Complicating matters, such
post-attack decisions would need to be made quickly, given Russia's
[[precedent of using
cyberwarfare]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html)
as a precursor to kinetic invasion. The need for speed leaves little
room for philosophical debates over what constitutes an act of war. To
be sure, NATO's strategic ambiguity is not without its benefits.
Uncertainty about the threshold for a military response could persuade
an adversary not to push the envelope with an audacious attack. But that
same ambiguity could lead an adversary to miscalculate. Moreover, the
doctrine also leaves open the possibility of discord in the ranks of
NATO member states regarding how to deal with any such attack. **[NATO's
policy of [strategic ambiguity served it well during]{.mark} the long
[Cold War]{.mark} nuclear confrontation]{.underline}**.
**[But]{.underline}** it **[[may be less appropriate to]{.mark} the era
of]{.underline}** **[[cyberwarfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly
given the problem of attribution and the potential for inter-allied
disagreement on the appropriate response to any particular incident.
[NATO [policymakers need to resolve this dilemma]{.mark} by formulating
a more explicit cyberwarfare doctrine]{.underline} to which all of its
member states can adhere. This should include updating their mutual
understanding of what constitutes an act of aggression under NATO's
collective defense provisions, making explicit to potential adversaries
just what its red lines are, and establishing clear procedures and
channels for robust allied response to cyberattacks. Unless NATO
clarifies current ambiguities, Russian aggression in the cyber realm
could go unchecked.

[Yet another pathway to [escalation]{.mark} could [arise from]{.mark} a
[cascading]{.mark} series of [cyberstrikes]{.mark} and counterstrikes
[against]{.mark} vital national [infrastructure]{.mark} rather than on
military targets. [All]{.mark} major [powers, along with Iran

cyber[weapons]{.mark} designed to disrupt and destroy major elements of
an adversary's key economic systems, such as power grids, financial
systems, and transportation networks. As noted, Russia has infiltrated
the U.S. electrical grid, and it is widely believed that the United
States has done the same in
Russia.]{.underline}[12](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote12)
The Pentagon has also devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus," intended to
immobilize the entire Iranian economy and so force it to capitulate to
U.S. demands or, if that approach failed, to pave the way for a
crippling air and missile
attack.[13](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote12)
[The danger here is that economic [attacks]{.mark} of this sort, if

an [escalating]{.mark} series of [tit-for-tat]{.mark} attacks
[against]{.mark} ever more [vital]{.mark} elements of an adversary's

example, [a [Russian]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark} on the U.S. power grid
could trigger U.S. attacks on Russian energy and financial systems,

war.]{.mark}"]{.underline}[14](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote14)
These are by no means the only pathways to escalation resulting from the
offensive use of cyberweapons. [Others include efforts by third parties,
such as proxy states [or terrorist organizations]{.mark}, to [provoke a
global]{.mark} nuclear [crisis by causing]{.mark} early-warning systems
to generate [false readings]{.mark} ("spoofing") [of missile

[NATO's climate security agenda]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} has long been [[known as a threat
multiplier]{.underline}]{.mark} and is increasingly recognised as a
"shaping threat" that [dramatically alters the environments in which
Allied militaries will have to operate in the coming
decades]{.underline}. From higher frequency and intensity of storms,
through extreme heat and cold, to reduced supplies of drinking water and
faster wear and tear of military equipment, [[climate change has
significant implications for NATO on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[tactical, operational and strategic levels]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
addition to **[[climate-related risks to military infrastructure and
force readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, more **[[extreme weather
events]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[increase conflict and
migration potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** in and beyond NATO's
immediate neighbourhood. Born of the Cold War and designed to defend its
members against any external aggression, [[NATO is evolving to reflect
the new security reality]{.underline}]{.mark} of actorless threats,
**[[such as pandemics, biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a security organisation, NATO cannot
be indifferent to these challenges. For NATO to be able to fulfil its
core mission of keeping the Euro-Atlantic space safe, building
resilience to the impacts of a changing climate and integrating
sustainable practices into military planning and capability development
is a necessity, not a choice. Evolving consensus The good news is that
**[[the Alliance is not starting from scratch]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For over 50 years now, [NATO has been paying attention to environmental
challenges]{.underline}, mostly through a wide range of scientific
research activities. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[developed six environmental protection
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} (STANAGs) that concern military camps,
management of waste, and sustainability of military training areas.
Climate change was written into the 2010 Strategic Concept and has been
factored into summit declarations since then. In 2014, NATO adopted a
Green Defence Framework and integrated energy efficiency and other
environmental considerations into the design of the current NATO
headquarters, which was completed in 2018. **[[The building blocks for a
more ambitious and visible role with respect to climate security are
already there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, [[NATO]{.mark} as an
alliance of 30 countries [works by consensus]{.mark}, which is always
evolving]{.underline}. As a former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change,
Jens Stoltenberg began [[advocating for NATO to take greater
climate-related]{.underline}]{.mark} [[action]{.underline}]{.mark} many
years ago, but [[his efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} may have been
[[stymied during the previous U.S. administration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The growing number of climate and weather related disasters, which
continue to impact lives and livelihoods both within and outside of
NATO's borders, has marked an evident shift in awareness and acceptance
of climate change as an issue of national security across the Alliance.
[[In view of increasing societal pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
current political momentum, [[which includes the renewed U.S. leadership
on climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[NATO]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} now **[[poised to push a more ambitious climate
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In 2016, the World Economic Forum survey of the most impactful risks for
the years ahead elevated the failure of climate change mitigation and
adaptation to the top of the list, ahead of weapons of mass destruction,
ranking second, and water crises, ranking third. By 2018, following a
year characterised by high-impact hurricanes and extreme temperatures,
extreme-weather events were seen as the single most prominent risk. As
the survey noted: "[We have been **pushing our planet to the brink** and
the damage is becoming **increasingly clear**]{.underline}."^29^
[[Climate change is an **existential risk**]{.mark} to **human
civilisation**]{.underline}: that is, [an adverse outcome that
would]{.underline} either **[annihilate intelligent life]{.underline}**
or permanently and drastically curtail its potential. [Temperature
rises]{.underline} that are now in prospect, **[after]{.underline}** the
**[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement, [are in the range of
**3--5°C**.]{.underline} At present, the Paris Agreement voluntary
emission reduction commitments, if implemented, would result in
planetary warming of 3.4°C by 2100,^30^ without taking into account
"long-term" carbon cycle feedbacks. With a higher climate sensitivity
figure of 4.5°C, for example, which would account for such feedbacks,
the Paris path would result in around 5°C of warming, according to a MIT
study.31 A study by Schroder Investment Management published in June
2017 found -- after taking into account indicators across a wide range
of the political, financial, energy and regulatory sectors -- the
average temperature increase implied for the Paris Agreement across all
sectors was 4.1°C.^32^ Yet [3°C of warming **already constitutes** an
**existential risk.**]{.underline} A 2007 study by two US national

"**outright [chaos]{.mark}**" [and]{.mark} "**[nuclear war]{.mark}** is
**possible**",]{.underline} emphasising how "massive non-linear [events
in the **global environment** give rise to **massive nonlinear societal
events**]{.underline}".^33^ The Global Challenges Foundation (GCF)
explains what could happen: "[If climate change was to reach 3°C, most
of [**Bangladesh** and **Florida** would **drown**]{.mark}, while
**major [coastal cities]{.mark}** -- Shanghai, Lagos, Mumbai -- [would
be **swamped**]{.mark}]{.underline}, likely [[creating]{.mark} **large

not take into account the considerable risk that [**self-reinforcing

is reached, leading to an **ever increasing rise** in
temperature]{.underline}. [Potential [thresholds include]{.mark} the

**[[Climate change can't be deterred]{.mark}]{.underline}** or defeated
by military action, [[but militaries can be part of the
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[NATO's new]{.mark}]{.underline}
forward-looking [[report]{.underline}]{.mark}, NATO 2030: United for a
New Era, **[[recognizes the role that the transatlantic alliance can
play in slowing ecological breakdown]{.underline}]{.mark}** and offers a
series of proposals to help address the crisis. The 138 recommendations
that fill out this new strategic framework could bury its reaffirmation
of climate change as a driver of the global security environment. But it
shouldn't. Against a backdrop of resurgent great power competition and
technological disruption, the threat posed by the warming planet stands
alone in scope and scale. [NATO Secretary]{.underline}-General Jens
Stoltenberg---a former Deputy Environment Manager of Norway and UN
Special Envoy on Climate Change---[has repeatedly acknowledged that
"climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our
time]{.underline}." Global warming has made extreme weather more intense
and more frequent; displaced millions; aggrevated tensions around food,
water and energy security; and added complexity and contention to
geopolitics. [[For NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[this means increased
demands for humanitarian assistance and disaster
response]{.underline}]{.mark}, more of the volatility that extremist
ideologies depend upon, and a broader, messier threat landscape.
Flooding, droughts, and wildfires have also impacted military readiness
around the world. The NATO 2030 report recommends the creation of a
Centre for Excellence on Climate and Security, which would monitor and
assess the security implications of climate change. This enhanced
situational awareness would enable NATO to anticipate, adapt, and act to
meet the challenges posed by climate change. Collecting and sharing
climate intelligence will be central to predicting future threats to
safety and security. The report also highlights the strategic
significance of the High North and the Arctic, where melting ice has
made waters more accessible, more vulnerable to exploitation, and more
contested. With geopolitical tensions filling the space left open by
retreating cold and ice, the report stresses the need to develop a
strategy of deterrence and defense in these waters to ensure freedom of
navigation is upheld and aggressive moves by state actors are checked.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the report emphasizes the need to
implement better green technology and smart energy. This is critical.
The carbon footprints of NATO militaries are massive. The U.S. military
alone releases more greenhouses gas than 140 countries, emitting more
than 25,000 kilotons of carbon dioxide a year. The **[[current push for
increased military spending]{.underline}]{.mark}** and burden-sharing
[[must be coupled with a commitment to reduce dependency on fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}. Purchasing military equipment for security
that accelerates climate change is self-sabotage at an existential
level. Stoltenberg has also noted that a shift to renewable energy, such
as solar and wind, will increase NATO's self-sufficiency and in turn its
operational independence and flexibility. **[[NATO's success rests on
its members' credible commitments to act collectively]{.mark} [against
shared threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Climate change cuts to the core
of this mission. Flooding, fire, disease, famine, increased migrant
flows, economic disruption, political and social instability, and new
arenas of great power competition all stem from the same threat. NATO
must adapt and do everything within its mandate to meet this reality.

‌Little by little, the scope of [[the confrontation between Russia
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO)
is expanding to]{.underline}]{.mark} reach the various spheres of
influence and lines of contact between them in the world, even those
remote and dormant, as is the case in [[the Arctic
region]{.underline}]{.mark}, which does not seem to be immune from the
fires of the Ukraine war. The resource-rich Arctic region is also a
point of contact between Russia, a number of NATO members, and two of
the alliance\'s most important friends, Finland and Sweden, which are
now openly expressing their desire to join NATO, according to sources
quoted by The Times a few days ago. On the other hand, the new Russian
threats to resort to a policy of nuclear deterrence have raised the
world\'s fears that [[Moscow might take a reckless
step]{.underline}]{.mark} that seemed likely over the past weeks. At a
time when tension is escalating between Russia and NATO against the
backdrop of the Ukrainian-Russian war and the request of Sweden and
Finland to join the alliance, Moscow is increasingly concerned about the
latter\'s involvement of non-Arctic members in its military activities
near Russia\'s borders. As a result, [[Russia has warned of the risks of

Foreign Ministry, Nikolay Korchunov, who chairs the Committee of Senior
Officials of the Arctic Council, expressed in a statement to the Russian
TASS Agency on April 17, 2022, Moscow\'s concern about NATO\'s
involvement of its members from outside the Arctic region in its
military activities there. "Another large-scale military exercise has
recently taken place in northern Norway, which may lead to an increased
risk of unintended accidents that would cause significant damage to the
Arctic ecosystem, in addition to the security risks it brings," he
added. The Russian official explained that "if Sweden and Finland join
NATO, this will harm security in the Arctic," noting that "the long-term
commitment of Stockholm and Helsinki during the past decades to the
policy of non-alignment of military alliances was an important factor in
stability and security in the northern European region and on the
European continent as a whole." Last March, Finland, and Sweden, both of
which are considering joining the US-led Western military alliance, held
joint military exercises with the alliance, as those exercises had been
scheduled for a long time, but Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February
24 made them more important. '[The]{.mark} Cold Response [2022]{.mark}
exercise' [is]{.mark} considered [the largest exercise by NATO]{.mark}
[in the \[Artic\] region in the last thirty years.]{.mark} About
[30,000]{.mark} soldiers [from 27 countries]{.mark}, including NATO
partners Finland and Sweden, [participated]{.mark} in it, in addition to
about 220 aircraft and more than 50 warships. [The]{.mark} stated [goal
was]{.mark} that NATO wants [to]{.mark} [make]{.mark} its
[soldiers]{.mark} more [solid in fighting in the bitter cold]{.mark} on
land, sea, and air, including in the [Arctic]{.mark}. Russia\'s conflict
against its counterparts in the Arctic was not a product of the moment,
but rather has become a backyard for global conflicts, NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said that NATO cannot allow a
security vacuum to occur in the Arctic. "[The lack of the alliance\'s
presence in the Arctic fuels Russian ambitions, exposes NATO, and leads
to miscalculation and misunderstanding," he considered]{.mark}. It is
noteworthy that the Arctic Council is an intergovernmental organization
of the Arctic countries, namely Denmark, Greenland, the Faroe Islands,
Iceland, Canada, Norway, the United States, Finland, Sweden, and Russia.
In 2021, when the Council celebrated its 25th anniversary, its
presidency passed to Russia for two years. Over the past weeks, all
countries of the Arctic Council except for Russia issued a written
statement refusing to participate in any Council meetings chaired by
Russia or on Russian soil due to the Ukraine war.

According to a report released in late 2021 by **[Reclaim
Finance]{.underline}**, a non-governmental organization, [[there]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} currently [599 oil]{.mark} and gas [fields]{.mark} in
production, under appraisal, field development, or in the discovery
phase with[in the Arctic region]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Gazprom, [the
largest Russian energy company, has 74% of its reserves in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and ranks first in the list of companies in
the Arctic, which also includes many American, French, British and
Norwegian companies. According to a **[US Geological
Survey]{.underline}** report, [a fifth of the world\'s undiscovered oil
and natural gas lie under the Arctic ice sheet]{.underline}, [along with
significant reserves of diamonds, gold, platinum, nickel, and
lead.]{.underline} The report added, "there are up to 90 billion barrels
of oil in that region, which is the amount that the American needs for
12 years, and is almost equal to the UAE\'s oil reserves." The Arctic
also has, according to the American report, more than fifty trillion
cubic meters of natural gas, which has led to the growing interest of
the great powers in the Arctic, despite international treaties that
stipulate that no one owns this pole. However, each country extends its
borders to claim new lands in the hope of benefiting from the wealth of
the Arctic, which has a population of two million people. In turn, the
researcher in international relations Mahmoud Alloush stressed in a
statement to [Al-Estiklal]{.underline} that "[[there is Russian concern
about the increase in Western military activity in the Arctic,]{.mark}
because of the importance of the Arctic in terms of energy resources,
minerals and fish reserves, and the shorter shipping routes between Asia
and Europe."]{.underline} "The Arctic could be home to the largest
undiscovered oil and gas reserves on Earth, storing billions of barrels
of untapped energy resources, all while fuel shortages caused by
sanctions against Russia," he continued. ["[International interest in
the wealth of the Arctic]{.mark} is likely to increase in the coming
period in conjunction with climate change and melting ice, which [will
force Russia to play a more dominant role in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}," he added. There are agreements concluded
between Arctic countries on maritime law, environmental balance, and
security needs, but the participation of most of these countries in
arming Ukraine would jeopardize these agreements with Russia, according
to Alloush. The researcher noted that "[the militarization of the
situation in the Arctic in recent years can clearly be observed, [Russia
is increasing its military presence]{.mark} on the Russian Kola
Peninsula, [bordering the Arctic]{.mark}, where the most powerful fleet
in the Russian Navy is located, as Russia also has the largest share of
strategic submarines and other important non-nuclear
capabilitie]{.underline}s." As for the motives for turning the Arctic
into a battleground for influence between Moscow and the West, Alloush
explained that "[the [Ukraine war changed the rules of the game in the
Arctic,]{.mark} although Russia was generally cooperative with Western
countries in the Arctic, [NATO has become more concerned about its
military expansion in this particular region."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Regarding the possibility of Sweden and Finland joining NATO, Alloush
indicated that "if this happened, all Arctic countries except Russia
would be part of NATO, which Russia views as a threat to encircle its
activities in the Arctic." [However, he said, "Russia\'s military
presence in this region is stronger than the presence of other
countries," adding: "At the moment, [NATO is studying how to expand its
activity in the Arctic to balance Russia."]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Where [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} was \[historically\] reserved
for the Arctic states, now it's very much seen as an international area
of interest, and I [[don\'t see]{.underline}]{.mark} that as [[being a
problem]{.underline}]{.mark} as long as it's well-handled," said Mann,
who took on his current role on April 1. A senior State Department
official in a briefing late last month characterized this era as the
"the return of geopolitics" in the Arctic, and warned "we can expect
\... the rapidly changing Arctic system to create greater incentives for
the Kremlin and the \[People's Republic of China\] to pursue agendas
that clash with the interests of the United States and our allies and
partners." Russia and the EU have their differences, which is "clear" to
Mann, though it\'s [[historically been a place
where]{.underline}]{.mark} the two [[entities have
cooperated]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said. "I think one should [[avoid
looking for flare-ups and tension where they don't
exist.]{.underline}]{.mark} That's not to say that there won't be in the
future, but at the moment, [[things are running
smoothly]{.underline}]{.mark} in my opinion." The EU's Arctic chief
cited the [[Northern Dimension policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, a joint
framework between EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland that [[promotes
cooperation, economic competitiveness and sustainable
development]{.underline}]{.mark} in Northern Europe as an example. Also,
a [[new international fisheries agreement]{.mark}, ratified by Norway on
Sunday, is an "absolutely amazing achievement" that's a "sign that
[people are able to agree on things]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. Mann
noted that Russia and the EU are both part of the Barents-Euro Arctic
Council, a forum to discuss issues in the Barents region --- the stretch
of land that runs along the Barents Sea. Many [[non-Arctic
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} in the EU, and elsewhere, are now
[[shifting]{.mark}]{.underline} to design their own Arctic
[[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}, something he said
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[welcome]{.underline}]{.mark} move. Arctic
policy has normally been left solely to the Arctic nations to hash out.
["New players are playing a very serious role in the Arctic now, well at
least [China]{.mark}. That wasn't the case perhaps four years
ago]{.underline}," Mann explained. The concern about new Arctic
activities "depends on the country," but he did not point out a specific
area of unrest. U.S. and British warships sailed to the Barents Sea this
month for the first time since the 1980s, sparking buzz about what the
operations meant in a militarized Arctic. However, a Navy spokesperson
said in a statement the operations were routine and are "the latest in a
series of ships operating in the Arctic Circle in recent years." [Mann
stressed that "it's worth [underlin]{.mark}ing that [the Arctic]{.mark}
has been, and currently [is, a place of peaceful cooperation]{.mark}
\...]{.underline} \[which\] has been rather good. [One of the EU's main
goals in Arctic policy is to promote multilateral cooperation and
keeping it an area of peace."]{.underline} [New commercial
opportunities]{.underline} that arise alongside the Arctic's sea ice
melting is a main driver of growing interest in the region, but the
northern sea lanes and how much new traffic there is increasing are
"[being slightly overplayed,]{.underline}" he said. The apparent rise in
tensions has led international officials to call for a body or forum for
nations to discuss security issues, which Mann agrees may not be a bad
idea. [[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, composed of the eight
Arctic states, [is a forum for discussion on cooperation in the
Arctic,]{.underline} though it's not required to discuss security
matters and instead focuses on work in environmental and sustainable
development, and support for indigenous communities. "Any [[forum that
comes together]{.underline}]{.mark} where dialogue is possible, is
[[going to be a good thing]{.underline}]{.mark}. I can't tell you now
what form that should be," he said.

#### Engagement with Turkey is the best chance to prevent human rights abuses

NATO leaders will gather this week in London to celebrate the 70th
anniversary of the alliance; reflect on past accomplishments; implement
the remaining deterrence and defense measures agreed at the 2014 Warsaw
Summit; and lay the groundwork for future cooperation in new areas, such
as emerging technologies and space. And while the military machinery
that is the core of NATO continues to run smoothly---generating levels
of interoperability, integrated operational planning, and force
generation that are unmatched---[[NATO's political cohesion is being
challenged]{.underline}]{.mark} by both internal divisions among members
and by external actors who seek to exploit these differences to their
own advantage. Perhaps [[the most pronounced case of this fractured
political cohesion is the Turkey-NATO relationship]{.underline}]{.mark},
where internal challenges and pressure from external actors uniquely
intersect. Internally, [[allies are alarmed by President Erdogan's
walking back of democracy, press freedom, and civic society in Turkey;
Turkey's repeated unilateral incursions into northern Syria; and its
willingness to hold the NATO agenda hostage to domestic
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, Turkey's current hold on
approving the Graduated Response Plan for the Baltic States and Poland
pending NATO recognition of the threat posed to Turkey by the Kurdish
People's Protection Units (YPG). Conversely,
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark} (and many other southern flank allies for
that matter) [[believes that NATO does not fully recognize or address
its legitimate security concerns, in particular migration and
terrorism.]{.underline}]{.mark} Externally,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} quickly [[capitalized on the fissures
between Turkey and NATO, offering to assist Turkey in managing the
YPG]{.underline}]{.mark} [[along the Turkey-Syria
border]{.underline}]{.mark} and to sell it Russian equipment, such as
the S-400 surface-to-air missile system, which would compromise NATO
capabilities and has led to a halt in delivery of F-35 aircraft to
Turkey. Turkey's subsequent decisions to [fly its F-16 against the
S-400 ](https://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-tests-f-16s-with-russian-air-defense-system-s400-2019-11)over
Ankara and to [enter negotiations with Russian on purchasing the Russian
Su-35 ](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2019/10/28/turkey-russia-in-advanced-talks-on-potential-su-35-jet-deal/)fighter
aircraft have reinforced concerns that Turkey has little interest in
maintaining or rebuilding its relationship with NATO as instead plans to
continue to test its boundaries. The EU-Turkey relationship is not
faring much better, with accession negotiations (initiated in 2005)
frozen since June 2018 due to Turkey's backsliding on democracy, rule of
law, and fundamental rights. The 2016 EU-Turkey refugee agreement,
whereby Turkey receives EU financial assistance in exchange for
continuing to host some 3 million refugees, is creating further tension,
with both sides accusing the other of not living up to the terms of the
agreement. What's next? Presently, [[mutual mistrust is so high that
many allies are questioning whether Turkey still shares NATO's interests
and values,]{.underline}]{.mark} and many in Turkey are struggling to
see the benefits of NATO membership or a renewed EU accession process.
Both sides seem to have forgotten [the historical ties and shared
interests that led Turkey to join
NATO ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/experts-react-turkeys-intervention-us-diplomacy-and-crisis-syria#Rachel)in
1952, such as countering Russian (then Soviet) influence in Central Asia
and the Middle East and maintaining stability in the Middle East. Yet
these foundational factors remain valid: Turkey's geopolitical position
at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa still provides NATO with
needed political and operational reach, and Turkey continues to benefit
from the collective military power of NATO. With the relationship close
to (if not at) its nadir, Turkey and NATO, with the support of the EU,
need to take active measures to anchor it for the future, while avoiding
steps that could destroy the relationship entirely. Active measures
Assuming that Turkey is in fact interested in rebuilding the
relationship with its NATO allies, there are several active measures
NATO and Turkey can take now to create a foothold for the future**[[.

America's presence in the Black Sea is important to check Russian
expansionism, but a more effective strategy calls for a coordinated
response from regional allies such as Turkey. [[Turkey's relationship
with NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the U.S. in particular [[has been
rocky]{.underline}]{.mark} of late. Ignoring warnings from NATO and the
threat of sanctions from the U..S, [[Turkey went ahead with its purchase
of the Russian S-400 air defense system]{.underline}]{.mark}, taking
delivery of the first shipment in mid-2019. But [[despite its growing
defense partnership]{.underline}]{.mark} with Moscow, **[[Ankara is
equally uneasy about the growing Russian military presence in a region
where Turkey once had the edge]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[2016]{.underline}]{.mark} plea to Turkey's
NATO allies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip [[Erdoğan said the Black Sea
had become a "Russian lake" and called for a greater NATO
presence]{.underline}]{.mark}, reversing a decades-old Turkish policy of
keeping the alliance out. Turkey has developed a multi-pronged strategy
to counter Russian influence in the Black Sea. One important leg of that
strategy is on the home front, where [[Turkey is strengthening its
navy]{.underline}]{.mark}. A project called MILGEM, a contraction of the
Turkish for "national ship" (milli gemi), was launched to design and
construct naval vessels in-country, including ADA class corvettes. In
2018, the [Pakistani Navy signed a
contract](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1178795282798202880?s=20) to
acquire four of these ships from Turkey's state-run defense contractor
ASFAT, the first successful export of these vessels. [[Turkey has also
been building up its anti-access/area denial]{.underline}]{.mark}
(A2/AD) [[capabilities to counter Russia's growing]{.mark}]{.underline}
A2/AD [[assets in the Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} by ordering four
new frigates, called both Istanbul and MILGEM II. The frigates are based
on the ADA class corvette design but extended by 14 meters to enable the
inclusion of a vertical launching system for surface to air missiles.
The naval version of the
army's[ Korkut](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/970694646216249345?s=20) low-altitude
air defense system, Gökdeniz, will be added to the inventory for the
first time with the frigate. The
national [Atmaca](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1191311364343681024?s=20) anti-ship
missile will also be integrated into the first unit of the class, TCG
Istanbul, which is forecast for entry into service later this year.
[[Turkey is taking steps on the foreign policy front as well, stepping
up its cooperation with Ukraine, Georgia, and
Azerbaijan]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Ankara views these countries as
instrumental in its efforts to balance the Russian military presence in
the Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} and South Caucasus. Since Russia's
annexation of Crimea, Turkish-Ukrainian relations have expanded
significantly. Last year, Erdoğan unveiled a \$36 million military aid
package for Ukraine. The two countries agreed to cooperate on the design
and manufacture of aircraft engines, radar
units, [drones](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1108309446034423808?s=20),
and navigation systems and consider collaboration on advanced technology
projects, such as ballistic missile systems. Turkey also plans to sell
its ships to Ukraine as part of a much bigger defense deal, which, if it
comes to fruition, could change the balance of power in the Black Sea.
Besides cooperation in defense industries, the Ukrainian and Turkish
navies
also [conduct](https://www.newsweek.com/estranged-russia-turkey-and-ukraine-join-forces-447473) joint
training in the Black Sea to showcase their ability to operate \"in
accordance with NATO standards.\" Turkey has also invested in shoring up
the defenses of Georgia, another Black Sea country threatened by
Russia's growing influence in the region. Turkey
has [allocated](https://turkeyanalyst.org/publications/turkey-analyst-articles/item/652-turkey%E2%80%99s-commitment-to-azerbaijan%E2%80%99s-defense-shows-the-limits-of-ankara%E2%80%99s-tilt-to-moscow.html) millions
of dollars to the Georgian Ministry of Defense to reform the country's
military logistics and transfer defense capabilities to its northeastern
neighbor while advocating for the extension of NATO membership to
Georgia, a move Russia opposes. Turkey's defense cooperation with
Azerbaijan has been growing as well, which was on full display in the
fighting in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh late last year,
when Ankara threw its full military support behind Baku. Turkish drones
provided Azerbaijan a huge advantage in the conflict, which ended with
Azerbaijan capturing significant swathes of territory from Armenian
forces. Turkey's military exports to Azerbaijan rose six-fold in 2020,
with Azerbaijan jumping to the top of the list of Turkish arms buyers in
September. NATO and the Black Sea NATO should support these Turkish
efforts. It should also establish a permanent "Black Sea Maritime
Patrol" group modeled on the successful Operation Sea Guardian in the
Mediterranean. Operation Sea Guardian is a flexible effort that can
potentially cover the full range of NATO's maritime security needs. In
accordance with NATO's "framework nation" concept, Turkey can be
assigned the leading nation role in the Black Sea and smaller members
can integrate their own, more limited capabilities into an
organizational structure provided by Ankara. Mirroring other NATO
missions in the Baltic or Mediterranean[[, Turkey can play a
coordinating role to bring in other NATO allies willing to participate
and provide support]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such a force would require
NATO's coordination and political pressure among non-Black Sea members
to commit in advance to a regular and rotational maritime presence in
the Black Sea, in line with the 1936 Montreux Convention, which limits
the presence of warships from non-littoral states to a maximum of 21
days. Although the development of such a multinational unit would
require a sustained diplomatic effort, once active, it would boost
NATO's deterrence in a strategic region that has become a springboard
for Russia to project power from Georgia all the way to Syria and Libya.

### A2 ILO

#### No impact to the liberal order

G. John **Ikenberry 18**, professor of Politics and International
Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs
at Princeton University, "Why the Liberal World Order Will Survive",
Carnegie Ethics and International Affairs,
<https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/gji3/files/why_the_liberal_world_order_will_survive.pdf>

In this essay I look at the evolving encounters between rising states
and the post-war Western international order. My starting point is the
classic "power transition" perspective[. Power transition theories see a
tight link between international order---]{.underline}its emergence,
stability, and decline---[and the rise and fall of great
powers.]{.underline} It is a perspective that sees history as a sequence
of cycles in which powerful or hegemonic states rise up and build order
and dominate the global system until their power declines, leading to a
new cycle of crisis and order building. In contrast, I offer a more
evolutionary perspective, emphasizing the lineages and continuities in
modern international order. More specifically, I argue that
[[although]{.mark} America's [hegemonic position may be
declining]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[the liberal international
characteristics of order]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[---openness, rules,
multilateral cooperation---[are deeply rooted and likely to
persist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [This is true [ev**en though**]{.mark}
**the orientation and actions of the [Trump]{.mark} administration**
have [raised]{.mark} serious [questions]{.mark} about the U.S.
commitment to liberal internationalism. Just as importantly, [rising
states]{.mark} (led by **China**) **[are not engaged in a frontal
attack]{.mark}** on the American-led order.]{.underline} [While
struggles do exist over orientations, agendas, and leadership, **the
non-Western developing countries remain tied** to the architecture and
principles of a liberal-oriented global orde]{.underline}r. And [even as
China seeks in various ways to build rival regional institutions,
**there are stubborn limits on what it can do.**]{.underline} Power
Transitions and International Order There is wide agreement that the
world is witnessing a long-term global power transition. [Wealth and
power is diffusing, spreading outward and away from Europe and the
United States.]{.underline} [The rapid growth that marked the
non-Western rising states in the last decade may have ended, and even
China's rapid economic ascendency has slowed]{.underline}. But [the
overall pattern of change remains: the "rest" are gaining ground on the
"West."]{.underline} While there is wide agreement that the world is
witnessing a global power transition, there is less agreement on the
consequences of power shifts for international order. The classic view
is advanced by realist scholars, such as E. H. Carr, Robert Gilpin, Paul
Kennedy, and William Wohlforth, who make sweeping arguments about power
and order. These [hegemonic realists argue that international order is
a by-product of the concentration of power]{.underline}. Order is
created by a powerful state, and when that state declines and power
diffuses, international order weakens or breaks apart. Out of these
dynamic circumstances, a rising state emerges as the new dominant state,
and it seeks to reorganize the international system to suit its own
purposes. In this view, world politics from ancient times to the modern
era can be seen as a series of repeated cycles of rise and decline. War,
protectionism, depression, political upheaval---various sorts of crises
and disruptions may push the cycle forward. This narrative of hegemonic
rise and decline draws on the European and, more broadly, Western
experience. Since the early modern era, Europe has been organized and
reorganized by a succession of leading states and would-be hegemons: the
Spanish Hapsburgs, France of Louis XIV and Napoleon, and post-Bismarck
Germany. [The logic of hegemonic order comes even more clearly into view
with Pax Britannica]{.underline}, the nineteenth-century hegemonic order
based on British naval and mercantile dominance. The decline of Britain
was followed by decades of war and economic instability, which ended
only with the rise of Pax Americana. [For hegemonic realists, the debate
today is about where the world is along this cyclical pathway of rise
and decline. Has the United States finally lost the ability or
willingness to underwrite and lead the post-war order?]{.underline} Are
we in the midst of a hegemonic crisis and the breakdown of the old
order? And are rising states, led by China, beginning to step forward in
efforts to establish their own hegemonic dominance of their regions and
the world? These are the lurking questions of the power transition
perspective. **[But does this vision of power transition truly
illuminate the struggles going on today over international
order?]{.underline}** [Some might argue no---that the United States is
still in a position, despite its travails, to provide hegemonic
leadership]{.underline}. Here one would note that [there is a durable
infrastructure (or what Susan Strange has called "structural power")
that undergirds the existing American-led order]{.underline}.
[Far-flung security alliances, market relations, liberal democratic
solidarity, deeply rooted geopolitical alignments---there are many
possible sources of American hegemonic power that remain
intact]{.underline}. **[But [there may]{.mark} [be]{.mark} even
[deeper]{.mark} sources of [continuity]{.mark} in the existing
system.]{.underline}** This would be true if the existence of a
liberal-oriented international order does not in fact require hegemonic
domination. It might be that the **[[power transition theory is wrong:
the stability and persistence of the existing]{.mark} post-war
international [order does not depend on]{.mark} the concentration of
[American power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In fact, [international order is
not simply an artifact of concentrations of power]{.underline}. The
**[[rules and institutions]{.mark} that make up international order
[have a more complex and contingent relationship]{.mark} with the rise
and fall of state power]{.underline}**. This is true in two respects.
First, [international order itself is complex: multilayered,
multifaceted, and not simply a political formation imposed by the
leading state]{.underline}. [International order is not "one thing" that
states either join or resist. It is an aggregation of various sorts of
ordering rules and institutions]{.underline}. **[There are the deep
rules and norms of sovereignty. There are [governing
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, starting with the United Nations.
**[There is a sprawling array of international institutions,
[regimes]{.mark}, treaties, agreements, protocols, [and so
forth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These governing arrangements cut across
diverse realms, including security and arms control, the world economy,
the environment and global commons, human rights, and political
relations. [Some of these domains of governance may have rules and
institutions that narrowly reflect the interests of the hegemonic state,
but most reflect negotiated outcomes based on a much broader set of
interests. As rising states continue to rise]{.underline}, they do not
simply confront an American-led order; [they face a wider conglomeration
of ordering rules, institutions, and arrangements; many of which they
have long embraced**. By [separat]{.mark}ing "American
[hegemony]{.mark}" [from]{.mark} "the existing international order," we
can see a more complex set of [relationships]{.mark}.** The United
States **does not embody the international order;** it has a
relationship with it, as do rising states]{.underline}. [The United
States embraces many of the core global rules and
institutions]{.underline}, such as the United Nations, International
Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. [But it
also has resisted ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention and the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (it being the only country not to
have ratified the latter) as well as various arms control and
disarmament agreements.]{.underline} [China also embraces many of the
same global rules and institutions, and resists ratification of
others]{.underline}. Generally speaking, the more fundamental or core
the norms and institutions are---beginning with the Westphalian norms of
sovereignty and the United Nations system---the more agreement there is
between the United States and China as well as other states.
Disagreements are most salient where human rights and political
principles are in play, such as in the Responsibility to Protect.
[Second, there is also diversity in what rising states "want" from the
international order. T]{.underline}he struggles over international order
take many different forms. In some instances, what rising states want is
more influence and control of territory and geopolitical space beyond
their borders. One can see this in China's efforts to expand its
maritime and political influence in the South China Sea and other
neighboring areas. This is an age-old type of struggle captured in
realist accounts of security competition and geopolitical rivalry.
Another type of struggle is over the norms and values that are enshrined
in global governance rules and institutions. These may be about how open
and rule-based the system should be. They may also be about the way
human rights and political principles are defined and brought to bear in
relations among states. Finally, the struggles over international order
may be focused on the distribution of authority. That is, rising states
may seek a greater role in the governance of existing institutions. This
is a struggle over the position of states within the global political
hierarchy: voting shares, leadership rights, and authority relations.
[These observations cut against the realist hegemonic perspective and
cyclical theories of power transition]{.underline}. **[Rising states do
not confront a single, coherent, hegemonic order.]{.underline}** [The
international order offers a buffet of options and choices. They can
embrace some rules and institutions and not others]{.underline}.
Moreover, stepping back, [the international orders that rising states
have faced in different historical eras have not all been the same
order]{.underline}. The British-led order that Germany faced at the turn
of the twentieth century is different from the international order that
China faces today. [The contemporary international order is much more
complex and wide-ranging than past orders]{.underline}. **[It has a much
denser array of rules, institutions, and governance
realms]{.underline}**. There are also both regional and global domains
of governance. **[This makes it hard to imagine an epic moment when the
international order goes into crisis and rising states step
forward---either China alone or rising states as a bloc---to reorganize
and reshape its rules and institutions]{.underline}**. Rather than a
cyclical dynamic of rise and decline, [change in the existing
American-led order might best be captured by terms such as continuity,
evolution, adaptation, and negotiation. **The struggles over
international order today are growing, but it is not a drama best told
in terms of the rise and decline of American hegemony.**]{.underline}

#### International law fails---it lacks properties required for a legitimate system

**Steinberg 5** (Gerald M., Academic and political scientist, PhD in
government from Cornell University, "The Myth of International Law"
October 15, 2005,
http://www.zionismontheweb.org/myth_of_international_law.htm)

In this reality[, [the principles that are said to constitute
"international law" lack the two central properties required for any
legitimate legal system: the consent of the governed, and uniform and
unprejudiced application]{.underline}]{.mark}[. International law and
the claims made in its name fit neither criteria. In a democratic
framework, the legal system gains legitimacy through the consent of the
citizens, and accountable to democratic procedures.]{.underline} We
accept the limitations placed on us by the system of laws and the role
of the police in enforcing these laws as part of the requirements for
justice and order in any functioning society. But we do not accept
limitations imposed from the outside, without our consent. Thus, the
claims [of the UN, the [International Court]{.mark} of Justice, the
International Criminal Court]{.underline}, and campaigns run by obsessed
extremists in Europe, [l[ack any legitimate moral foundation or standing
in democratic societies with their own legal
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similarly, when judges sitting on the
Israeli High Court base decisions on international law, they are
attempting to impose an external framework which lacks the legitimacy
provided by the consent of the governed. [THE OTHER problem with the use
of international law is the absence of equitable implementation. No
legal system that focuses its attention selectively can be considered
legitimate.]{.underline} [Thus]{.underline}, [the routine
condemnations]{.underline} of Israeli or American policy by the UN, the
ICJ, and accompanying NGOs [have no moral or legal validity when the
principles are not applied uniformly.]{.underline} In contrast to these
destructive polemics[, in order to promote a meaningful universal moral
code, it is necessary to recognize the need for the consent of the
governed and for consistent and universal enforcement]{.underline}.
[[International law]{.mark} based on]{.underline} justice, and not
[ideology]{.underline}, remains a worthy objective. But the substitution
of political rhetoric that invokes the myths and rhetoric for the real
thing [[is entirely counterproductive]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Arctic Mod

#### NATO destabilizes Arctic -- tensions cause nuclear war -- extinction

6/30/2020

In early March, an estimated 7,500 [American combat troops will travel
to Norway to join thousands of soldiers from other NATO]{.underline}
countries in a massive mock battle with imagined invading forces from
Russia. In this futuristic simulated engagement---it goes by the name of
Exercise [Cold Response]{.underline} 2020---allied forces will "conduct
multinational joint exercises with a high-intensity combat scenario in
demanding winter conditions," or so claims the Norwegian military
anyway. At first glance, this may look like any other NATO training
exercise, but think again. There's nothing ordinary about Cold Response
2020. As a start, it's being staged [[above the Arctic
Circle]{.underline}]{.mark}, far from any previous traditional NATO
battlefield, and it [[raises]{.mark}]{.underline} to a new level the
[[possibility of a great-power]{.underline}]{.mark} conflict that might
end in a [[nuclear exchange and mutual
annihilation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Welcome, in other words, to World War
III's newest battlefield. For the soldiers participating in the
exercise, the potentially thermonuclear dimensions of Cold Response 2020
may not be obvious. At its start, Marines from the United States and the
United Kingdom will practice massive [amphibious landings along Norway's
coastline]{.underline}, much as they do in similar exercises elsewhere
in the world. Once ashore, however, the scenario becomes ever more
distinctive. After collecting tanks and other heavy weaponry
"prepositioned" in caves in Norway's interior, the Marines will proceed
toward the country's far-northern Finnmark region to help Norwegian
forces stave off Russian forces supposedly pouring across the border.
From then on, the two sides will engage in---to use current Pentagon
terminology---high-intensity combat operations under Arctic conditions
(a type of warfare [not seen on]{.underline} such a [scale since World
War II]{.underline}). And that's just the beginning. Unbeknownst
[to]{.underline} most Americans, the [Finnmark]{.underline} region of
Norway and adjacent Russian territory have [become one of
the]{.underline} **[[most likely battlegrounds for the first use of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** in any future NATO-Russian
conflict. [[Because Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[concentrated]{.underline}]{.mark} a significant part of its
**[[nuclear retaliatory capability on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[Kola]{.underline}]{.mark}** Peninsula, a remote stretch of land
abutting northern Norway---any US-NATO success in actual combat with
Russian forces near that territory [[would]{.mark}]{.underline} endanger
a significant part of Russia's nuclear arsenal and so might
[[precipitate]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[early use]{.underline}]{.mark}
of such munitions. Even a simulated victory---the predictable result of
Cold Response 2020---will undoubtedly set Russia's nuclear controllers
on edge. To appreciate just how risky any NATO-Russian clash in Norway's
far north would be, consider the region's geography and the strategic
factors that have led Russia to concentrate so much military power
there. And all of this, by the way, will be playing out in the context
of another existential danger: climate change. The melting of the Arctic
ice cap and the accelerated exploitation of Arctic resources are lending
this area ever greater strategic significance. ENERGY EXTRACTION IN THE
FAR NORTH Look at any map of Europe and you'll note that Scandinavia
widens as it heads southward into the most heavily populated parts of
Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. As you head north, however, it
narrows and becomes ever less populated. At its extreme northern
reaches, only a thin band of Norway juts east to touch Russia's Kola
Peninsula. To the north, the Barents Sea, an offshoot of the Arctic
Ocean, bounds them both. This remote region---approximately 800 miles
from Oslo and 900 miles from Moscow---has, in recent years, become a
vortex of economic and military activity. Once prized as a source of
vital minerals, especially nickel, iron ore, and phosphates, this remote
area is now the center of extensive oil and natural gas extraction. With
temperatures rising in the Arctic twice as fast as anywhere else on the
planet and sea ice retreating ever farther north every year, offshore
fossil-fuel exploration has become increasingly viable. As a result,
large reserves of oil and natural gas---the very fuels whose combustion
is responsible for those rising temperatures---have been discovered
beneath the Barents Sea and both [[countries are seeking to
exploit]{.mark} those [deposits]{.mark}]{.underline}. Norway has taken
the lead, establishing at Hammerfest in Finnmark the world's first plant
above the Arctic Circle to export liquified natural gas. In a similar
fashion, Russia has initiated efforts to exploit the mammoth Shtokman
gas field in its sector of the Barents Sea, though it has yet to bring
such plans to fruition. For Russia, even more significant oil and gas
prospects lie further east in the Kara and Pechora Seas and on the Yamal
Peninsula, a slender extension of Siberia. Its energy companies have, in
fact, already begun producing oil at the Prirazlomnoye field in the
Pechora Sea and the Novoportovskoye field on that peninsula (and natural
gas there as well). Such fields hold great promise for Russia, which
exhibits all the characteristics of a petro-state, but there's one huge
problem: The only practical way to get that output to market is via
specially designed icebreaker-tankers sent through the Barents Sea past
northern Norway. The exploitation of Arctic oil and gas resources and
their transport to markets in Europe and Asia has become a major
economic priority for Moscow as its hydrocarbon reserves below the
Arctic Circle begin to dry up. Despite calls at home for greater
economic diversity, President Vladimir Putin's regime continues to
insist on the centrality of hydrocarbon production to the country's
economic future. In that context, production in the Arctic has become an
essential national objective, which, in turn, requires assured access to
the Atlantic Ocean via the Barents Sea and Norway's offshore waters.
Think of that waterway as vital to Russia's energy economy in the way
the Strait of Hormuz, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean,
is to the Saudis and other regional fossil-fuel producers. THE MILITARY
DIMENSION No less than Russia's giant energy firms, its navy must be
able to enter the Atlantic [[via]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Barents]{.underline}]{.mark} Sea and northern Norway. Aside from its
Baltic and Black Sea ports, accessible to the Atlantic only via
[[passageways easily obstructed by NATO, the sole Russian
harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} with unfettered access to the Atlantic Ocean
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} at Murmansk [[on the Kola
Peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not surprisingly then, that port is also
the headquarters for Russia's Northern Fleet---its most powerful---and
the site of numerous air, infantry, missile, and radar bases along with
naval shipyards and nuclear reactors. In other words, [**[it's]{.mark}
among [the most sensitive military regions in Russia
today.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Given all this, President Putin has
substantially rebuilt that very fleet, which fell into disrepair after
the collapse of the Soviet Union, equipping it with some of the
country's most advanced warships. In 2018, according to The Military
Balance, a publication of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies, it already possessed the largest number of modern cruisers and
destroyers (10) of any Russian fleet, along with 22 attack submarines
and numerous support vessels. Also in the Murmansk area are dozens of
advanced MiG fighter planes and a wide assortment of anti-aircraft
defense systems. Finally, as 2019 ended, Russian military officials
indicated for the first time that they had deployed to the Arctic the
Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, a weapon capable of hypersonic
velocities (more than five times the speed of sound), again presumably
to a base in the Murmansk region just 125 miles from Norway's Finnmark,
the site of the upcoming NATO exercise. More significant yet is the way
Moscow has been strengthening its nuclear forces in the region. Like the
United States, Russia maintains a "triad" of nuclear delivery systems,
including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range
"heavy" bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).
Under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START),
signed by the two countries in 2010, the Russians can deploy no more
than 700 delivery systems capable of carrying no more than 1,550
warheads. (That pact will, however, expire in February 2021 unless the
two sides agree to an extension, which appears increasingly unlikely in
the age of Trump.) According to the Arms Control Association, the
Russians are currently believed to be deploying the warheads they are
allowed under New START on 66 heavy bombers, 286 ICBMs, and 12
submarines with 160 SLBMs. Eight of those nuclear-armed subs are, in
fact, assigned to the Northern Fleet, which means about 110 missiles
with as many as 500 warheads---the exact numbers remain shrouded in
secrecy---are deployed in the Murmansk area. For Russian nuclear
strategists, such nuclear-armed submarines are considered the most
"survivable" of the country's retaliatory systems. In the event of a
nuclear exchange with the United States, the country's heavy bombers and
ICBMs could prove relatively vulnerable to pre-emptive strikes as their
locations are known and can be targeted by American bombs and missiles
with near-pinpoint accuracy. Those subs, however, can leave Murmansk and
disappear into the wide Atlantic Ocean at the onset of any crisis and so
presumably remain hidden from US spying eyes. To do so, however,
requires that they pass through the Barents Sea, avoiding the NATO
forces lurking nearby. For Moscow, in other words, the very possibility
of deterring a US nuclear strike hinges on its ability to defend its
naval stronghold in Murmansk, while maneuvering its submarines past
Norway's Finnmark region. No wonder, then, that this area has assumed
enormous strategic importance for Russian military planners---and the
upcoming Cold Response 2020 is sure to prove challenging to them.
WASHINGTON'S ARCTIC BUILDUP During the Cold War era, Washington viewed
the Arctic as a significant strategic arena and constructed a string of
military bases across the region. Their main aim: to intercept Soviet
bombers and missiles crossing the North Pole on their way to targets in
North America. After the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, Washington
abandoned many of those bases. Now, however, with the Pentagon once
again identifying "great power competition" with Russia and China as the
defining characteristic of the present strategic environment, many of
those bases are being reoccupied and new ones established. Once again,
the Arctic is being viewed as a potential site of conflict with Russia
and, as a result, US forces are being readied for possible combat there.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was the first official to explain this
new strategic outlook at the Arctic Forum in Finland last May. In his
address, a kind of "[[Pompeo]{.underline}]{.mark} Doctrine," he
indicated that the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates was
[[shifting from benign neglect]{.underline}]{.mark} of the region [[to
aggressive]{.mark} involvement and [militarization.]{.mark}]{.underline}
"We're entering a new age of strategic engagement in the Arctic," he
insisted, "complete with new threats to the Arctic and its real estate,
and to all of our interests in that region." To better protect those
interests against Russia's military buildup there, "we are fortifying
America's security and diplomatic presence in the area...hosting
military exercises, strengthening our force presence, rebuilding our
icebreaker fleet, expanding Coast Guard funding, and creating a new
senior military post for Arctic Affairs inside of our own military." The
Pentagon has been unwilling to provide many details, but a close reading
of the military press suggests that this activity has been particularly
focused on northern Norway and adjacent waters. To begin with, the
Marine Corps has established a permanent presence in that country, the
first time foreign forces have been stationed there since German troops
occupied it during World War II. A detachment of about 330 Marines were
initially deployed near the port of Trondheim in 2017, presumably to
help guard nearby caves that contain hundreds of US tanks and combat
vehicles. Two years later, a similarly sized group was then dispatched
to the Troms region above the Arctic Circle and far closer to the
Russian border. From the Russian perspective, even more threatening is
the construction of a US radar station on the Norwegian island of Vardø
about 40 miles from the Kola Peninsula. To be operated in conjunction
with the Norwegian intelligence service, the focus of the facility will
evidently be to snoop on those Russian missile-carrying submarines,
assumedly in order to target them and take them out in the earliest
stages of any conflict. That Moscow fears just such an outcome is
evident from the mock attack it staged on the Vardø facility in 2018,
sending 11 Su-24 supersonic bombers on a direct path toward the island.
(They turned aside at the last moment.) It has also moved a
surface-to-surface missile battery to a spot just 40 miles from Vardø.
In addition, in August 2018, the US Navy decided to reactivate the
previously decommissioned Second Fleet in the North Atlantic. "A new
Second Fleet increases our strategic flexibility to respond---from the
Eastern Seaboard to the Barents Sea," said Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson at the time. As last year ended, that fleet was declared
fully operational. DECIPHERING COLD RESPONSE 2020 Exercise Cold Response
2020 must be viewed in the context of all these developments. Few
details about the thinking behind the upcoming war games have been made
public, but it's not hard to imagine what at least part of the scenario
might be like: a US-Russian clash of some sort leading to Russian
attacks aimed at seizing that radar station at Vardø and Norway's
defense headquarters at Bodø on the country's northwestern coast. The
invading troops will be slowed but not stopped by Norwegian forces (and
those US Marines stationed in the area), while thousands of
reinforcements from NATO bases elsewhere in Europe begin to pour in.
Eventually, of course, the tide will turn and the Russians will be
forced back. No matter what the official scenario is like, however, for
Pentagon planners the situation will go far beyond this. Any [**[Russian
assault on]{.underline}**]{.mark} critical [[Norwegian]{.mark} military
[facilities would]{.mark}]{.underline} presumably be preceded by intense
air and missile bombardment and the forward deployment of major naval
vessels. This, in turn, [[would prompt comparable moves by]{.mark} the
United States and [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, probably resulting in
violent encounters and the loss of major assets on all sides. In the
process, [[Russia's key nuclear retaliatory forces would]{.mark}
be]{.underline} at risk and quickly placed on high alert with senior
officers operating [in [hair-trigger]{.mark}]{.underline} mode. Any
misstep might then lead [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} what humanity has
feared since August 1945: [[a nuclear apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark} on
Planet Earth. There is no way to know to what degree such considerations
are incorporated into the classified versions of the Cold Response 2020
scenario, but it's unlikely that they're missing. Indeed, a 2016 version
of the exercise involved the participation of three B-52 nuclear bombers
from the US [Strategic Air Command]{.underline}, \[[SAC]{.underline}\]
indicating that the American military [is keenly aware of the
**escalatory risks** of any large-scale US-Russian encounter in the
Arctic]{.underline}. In short, what might otherwise seem like a
[[routine training]{.underline}]{.mark} exercise in a distant part of
the world is actually part of an emerging US strategy **[[to overpower
Russia in a critical defensive zone]{.underline}]{.mark}**, an approach
that **[[could easily result in]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear war. The
Russians are, of course, well aware of this and so will undoubtedly be
watching Cold Response 2020 with genuine trepidation. Their fears are
understandable---but we should all be concerned about a strategy that
seemingly embodies such a high risk of future escalation. Ever since the
Soviets acquired nuclear weapons of their own in 1949, strategists have
wondered how and where an [[all-out nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}
war---World War III---would break out. At one time, that incendiary
scenario was believed most likely to involve a clash over the divided
city of Berlin or along the East-West border in Germany. After the Cold
War, however, fears of such a deadly encounter evaporated and few gave
much thought to such possibilities. Looking forward today, however, the
prospect of a catastrophic World War III is again becoming all too
imaginable and this time, it appears, an incident in the
[Arctic]{.underline} could prove the [spark for
[Armageddon.]{.mark}]{.underline}

One outstanding question is the degree to which devastating economic
sanctions imposed on Russia will halt its military innovation projects.
Nuclear-powered icebreakers currently under construction, for example,

other Arctic competitors by orders of magnitude, and this trend holds
true for most other Arctic military assets as well. Despite the impact
of sanctions, NATO states---possibly including Finland and Sweden---will
be left playing catch up to the capabilities of an increasingly militant
Russia. Foreign policy is fundamentally a game of
trade-offs---prioritizing certain threats and opportunities over others.
[[Finland]{.mark} and [Sweden's desire to join NATO is]{.mark} driven by
a self-interested
[calculation](https://www.csis.org/analysis/will-finland-and-sweden-join-nato)
of Russian aggression. The alliance's enthusiasm to embrace these Nordic
members, however, is seen as an opportunity to check Russia's actions in
Ukraine and deliver a message of trans-Atlantic solidarity. This may
well be a beneficial move for NATO member states, but it is [not
without]{.mark} its [consequences]{.mark}. [Bringing Sweden and Finland

Russia,\" RT International,
<https://www.rt.com/op-ed/488679-arctic-military-russia-us/>, Xoxo
7/28/2020

The US [Navy is on the cusp of]{.underline} conducting confrontational
freedom of navigation operations in the [Arctic]{.underline} that
threaten Russian economic and national security interests. The recent
resumption by the US Navy of a Barents Sea Patrol represents
[muscle-flexing]{.underline} on the part [of]{.underline} Washington and
its [NATO]{.underline} allies [unseen since the end of the Cold
War.]{.underline} Three American destroyers and a British frigate,
accompanied by a supply ship, ventured into the Arctic body of water
last week. The reestablishment of the patrol is part of a larger
refocusing of attention by the US and NATO on the Arctic, where warming
waters and melting ice have created the possibility of faster sea
transits between Europe and Asia and access to natural resources which
were previously viewed as cost-prohibitive due to heavy ice conditions.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[views]{.underline}]{.mark} most
of the [[Barents]{.underline}]{.mark} Sea [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} part
of its [[territorial waters]{.underline}]{.mark}, has made it clear to
the US and the international community that it will protect its core
national economic and security interests using all means available.
Given the stakes involved, **[[the potential for conflict is real should
the US]{.underline}]{.mark}** seek to [[**expand** its military posture
more aggressively in **the Arctic.**]{.mark}]{.underline} This is
precisely what some in the US defense establishment are arguing for. In
order to prevent what American [[defense hawks]{.underline}]{.mark} have
called a potential maritime "Iron Curtain" from being pulled down over
the Arctic by Russia, [[call]{.underline}]{.mark}s are being made [[for
a more aggressive]{.mark} US naval [posture]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
region, expanding the Barents Sea Patrol [[to
incorporate]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called Freedom of Navigation
Operations ([[FONOPs]{.underline}]{.mark}) as standard practice
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} US and [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} naval
[[operations in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} north. The US has
regularly asserted its right to navigate international waters consistent
with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),
despite not having signed the agreement (the US sidesteps this
inconvenient fact by viewing the provisions of UNCLOS it finds
acceptable to operate as common law.) Since 1983, the US Navy has
conducted more than 400 FONOPs designed to challenge what it views as
excessive maritime claims. The proponents of expanded FONOPs in the
Arctic view such exercises as a prerequisite for countering perceived
Russian domination of the Arctic region. One of the guiding principles
of any US/NATO FONOPs conducted in the Arctic Sea will be to push back
on what these nations view as excessively restrictive Russian national
legislation based on UNCLOS' Article 234 governing operations in Arctic
waters. As things currently stand, Russia views the Northeast Passage
(called the Northern Sea Route in Russia) as being exclusively within
Russian territorial waters, and as such traditional freedom of
navigation rights do not apply. Instead, Russia has implemented a series
of laws which, by placing restrictions on building construction, ship
navigation capabilities, and permit requirements, all but precludes
freedom of navigation. It should be noted that Russian laws mirror in
many respects those of Canada, which -- like Russia -- uses Article 234
as the basis of its restrictive domestic legislation governing the
transit of ships in its territorial Arctic waters. Russian and Canadian
interpretation of the rights afforded them under Article 234 are coming
under legal challenge by nations such as the US, which want access to
the economic potential of the Arctic which are emerging as the ice sheet
is pushed back by the effects of global warming. Protecting Russian
vested interests in the economic benefits that can be accrued (President
Vladimir Putin has assessed the value of the mineral deposits in
Russia's Arctic region as approximately \$30 trillion) by exploiting the
reduced ice exposure of the Arctic region are a major reason behind
Russia's forward-leaning posture in the region. But there is another
critical factor at play, which changes the dynamics of any FONOP-type
operation. "Innocent passage" is a critical concept behind any viable
FONOP exercise---military vessels must be engaged in non-hostile transit
activity. However, US and **[[NATO vessels that]{.underline}]{.mark}**
would conduct future FONOPs [in the Arctic]{.underline} Sea **[[are
armed with Aegis]{.underline}]{.mark}** surface-to-air missiles and
sea-launched cruise missiles [[that would threaten Russian
strategic]{.mark}]{.underline} rocket [[forces]{.underline}]{.mark}
stationed [[in Siberia]{.mark}.]{.underline} The US is in the process of
developing advanced SM-3 [[Block IIA]{.underline}]{.mark} surface-to-air
[[missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be
launched from the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) employed on
Aegis-capable ships. These new [[intercept]{.underline}]{.mark}ors are
capable of intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and
will be tested in this configuration in the third quarter of 2020. Given
the fact that the vast majority of [[Russia's]{.mark} strategic
[nuc]{.mark}lear [force]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially those elements
of which are stationed in Siberia---are configured to fly over the
Arctic Sea region before reaching their targets in the United States,
any US naval deployment in the Arctic Sea armed with these weapons
**[[could not be seen as innocent]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [[Mark
41]{.underline}]{.mark} VLS is also [[configured to
launch]{.underline}]{.mark} sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs). As
part of the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, the US Navy is developing a new
nuclear capable SLCM, known as the SLCM-N, which will be armed with a
W-80-4 thermonuclear warhead with a variable yield of 5-150 kilotons.
Any ship armed with [[SLCM-N]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons that is
operating [[in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} Sea region [[will possess
an inherent first-strike]{.mark}]{.underline} interdiction
[[capability]{.mark}]{.underline} against Russia's strategic nuclear
forces---again, a capability which makes the transit of such vessels
anything but innocent. Russia currently has six military bases in the
north, along with 10 airfields, numerous anti-aircraft missile system
positions and military ports operating under the umbrella of the
Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command, better known simply as the
Arctic forces. The anti-aircraft defenses include the Tor-M2DT, a
modernized variant of the Soviet-era SA-15 system, and the newer
Pantsir-SA system, both of which have been adapted to operating in the
harsh environment of the Arctic north. These systems are designed to
defend against cruise missile attacks, and are on 24-hour alert, 365
days per year. Seen in this light, the [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n
[[militarization]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic [[is]{.mark} more
[**defensive**]{.mark} than offensive]{.underline} and [[intended to
protect]{.underline}]{.mark} the vital national security interests of
Moscow [[from threats]{.underline}]{.mark} such as those that would be
[[presented through any aggressive US/NATO FONOPs in the Arctic
Sea.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, Russia has a history, dating back to
Soviet times, of aggressively defending its national security interests
from what it believes to be the encroachment on its territorial waters
by FONOPs which violate the requirement of innocent passage. Perhaps the
most relevant example of this is found in the ramming incident that
transpired off the coast of the [Crimean]{.underline} Peninsula on
February 12, [1988]{.underline}. The US Navy had dispatched a two-ship
task force, consisting of the cruiser USS Yorktown and the destroyer USS
Caron, to conduct [FONOPs]{.underline} outside of traditional sea lanes.
The US claimed it had every right to operate outside these sea lanes,
citing innocent passage. The Soviets, however, viewed the presence of
two modern warships, more heavily armed than any previous FONOP
exercise, as anything but innocent, and dispatched two frigates to
challenge the US naval presence. After warning both the Yorktown and
Caron to depart, and [having]{.underline} these [warnings]{.underline}
ignored, the Soviet ships proceeded [to **ram**]{.underline} the US navy
[ships]{.underline} to compel their departure. There can be little doubt
that the Russian navy [would employ similar tactics]{.underline}---or
more---to protect its interests [in the **Arctic**]{.underline} Sea it
felt threatened by US/NATO FONOPs that did not meet the criterion of
innocent passage. If the US decides to beef up its naval presence in the
Arctic region, [expanding]{.underline} the current Barents Sea Patrol
[to incorporate]{.underline} more [aggressive FONOPs along Russia's
**[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**oute]{.underline},
one [can [anticipate]{.mark}]{.underline} that Russia will respond in
kind, creating the potential for a repeat of the Yorktown/Caron incident
in the frigid waters of the Arctic north. In this day and age of
[[renewed **Cold War**]{.mark}-like]{.underline} tensions between the
US/NATO and Russia, the last thing either side needs is a new point of
potential [force-on-force **friction**.]{.underline}

#### NATO causes Russian militarization in the Arctic

Arctic." The National Interest. May 15, 2022.

The language of the multilateral boycott of the Arctic Council[ leaves
open](https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-arctic-council-cooperation-following-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/) the
prospect of future re-engagement, "pending consideration of the
necessary modalities that can allow us to continue the Council's
important work in view of the current circumstances." However, there are
no indications thus far of a return to normal operations. [If Sweden and
Finland are admitted to NATO, it is unlikely that Arctic governance will
ever again effectively incorporate Russia. The border between Finland
and Russia would likely become a militarized zone [in the
Arctic]{.mark}/sub-Arctic region, as Russian president Vladimir [Putin
has]{.mark} [threatened
to [deploy](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10710541/Russia-moves-military-equipment-Finnish-border-warning-Finland-not-join-NATO.html) heavy
artillery to the border]{.mark}. It would also leave Russia as the sole
Arctic state not part of NATO, eviscerating the balance of interests
that has ens]{.underline}ured stability in the region in recent decades.

[[If Russia perceives its fellow Arctic states to be united in an
anti-Russian coalition, we should expect the future of Arctic
geopolitics to be dominated by militarization. This]{.mark} trend
[is]{.mark} [already being seen]{.mark}. Russia has been steadily
expanding its military capabilities in the Arctic since 2014. This has
included technological advances, such
as[ modernizing](https://www.cna.org/archive/CNA_Files/pdf/iop-2020-u-027998-final.pdf) strategic
nuclear submarines in the North Sea
or [developing](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-and-security-part-two/) the
ZALA series of weather-resistant drones]{.underline}. Russia's Arctic
build-up has also prioritized human capital, with Moscow
permanently [stationing](https://www.cna.org/archive/CNA_Files/pdf/iop-2020-u-027998-final.pdf) military
forces along Russia's northern coast and running specialized training
exercises to improve force operations in the region. [In addition to the
promised militarization of the Russia-Finland border, [the perception of
a NATO threat in the region introduces an incentive for escalated
Russian security measures.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[NATO expansion will]{.mark} also likely [change Russia's narrative on
its Arctic posture]{.mark}. Thus far, Moscow has claimed that its
military activities in the region are non-threatening. Officials have
cited search and rescue operations or shipping lane protection as the
rationale underpinning military buildup. In 2021, Nikolai Korchunov, a
senior Russian official for the Arctic, emphasized these motivations at
an Arctic Council
meeting, [saying](https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/2021/05/russia-will-not-address-militarization-during-its-chairmanship-arctic-council),
"The military activities of Russia in the Arctic do not violate any
international obligations, are not aimed at any of the countries in the
Arctic region and do not pose any threat to their national security."
But [Sweden](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/time-swedish-ambiguity-russia-has-passed-200748) and[ Finland\'s](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/finland-close-decision-whether-join-nato-202339) admission
to NATO would remove any need for such soothing justifications. [Russia
has
publicly [declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/world/europe/finland-sweden-nato-russia-ukraine.html) that
it would treat Nordic NATO expansion as a provocation and would be
prepared to ]{.mark}]{.underline}[re[taliate]{.underline}]{.mark}[.
Kremlin leadership has long painted NATO's growth as a threat to
European sec]{.underline}ur[ity,
including [citing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/12/finland-nato-membership-russia-ukraine/) mid-2000s
expansionism as the impetus for Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. [Finland and Sweden's accession to the alliance
would represent a compelling domestic narrative of NATO encroachment in
the Arctic as justification for additional Russian defenses in the
region.]{.underline}

### Russia-China Alliance Mod

#### US-NATO engagement spurs a Russia-China alliance

The alliance has spurned the Cold War strategy that made sure Washington
was closer to Moscow and Beijing than Moscow and Beijing were to each
other. [[U.S. and NATO antagonism have turned Russia and China into
close allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia, rich in natural resources,
including energy, minerals and grains, and China, a manufacturing and
technological behemoth, are a potent combination. [[NATO no longer
distinguishes between the two,]{.mark}]{.underline} announcing in its
most recent mission statement that [[the \"deepening strategic
partnership\" between Russian and China has resulted in \"mutually
reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international
order]{.underline}]{.mark} that run counter to our values and
interests.\" On July 6, Christopher Wray, director of the FBI, and Ken
McCallum, director general of Britain\'s MI5, held a joint news
conference in London to announce that China was the \"biggest long-term
threat to our economic and national security.\" They accused China, like
Russia, of interfering in U.S. and U.K. elections. Wray warned the
business leaders they addressed that the Chinese government was \"set on
stealing your technology, whatever it is that makes your industry tick,
and using it to undercut your business and dominate your market.\" This
[[inflammatory rhetoric presages an ominous future]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[If China, Russia, Iran, India and other nations free themselves from

expenditures,]{.underline}]{.mark} which have driven the U.S. debt
to [\$30 trillion](https://www.usdebtclock.org/), \$6 trillion more than
the entire U.S. GDP, [[will become untenable]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Servicing this debt costs \$300 billion a year. We spent more on the
military in 2021 --- \$801 billion, which amounted to 38 percent of
total world expenditure on the military --- than the next nine
countries, including China and Russia, combined. [[The loss of the
dollar as the world\'s reserve currency will force the U.S. to slash
spending, shutter many of its 800 military bases overseas and cope with
the inevitable social and political upheavals triggered by economic
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is darkly ironic that [[NATO has
accelerated this possibility.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Hegemony is empirically the most stable system and deters all conflict -- decline causes transition wars

Robert **Kagan, 17**, 2-7-2017, Backing Into World War III,

[Think of two significant trend lines in the world today. One is the
increasing ambition and activism of the two great **revisionist powers,
Russia and China**. The other is the declining confidence, capacity, and
will of the democratic world, and especially of the United States, to
maintain the dominant position it has held in the international system
since 1945]{.underline}. As those two lines move closer, [[as the
declining]{.mark} will and [capacity of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies to maintain the present world order
meet]{.mark} the increasing desire and capacity of the [revisionist
powers]{.mark} to change it, we will reach the moment at which [the
existing order collapses]{.mark} and the world descends [into]{.mark} a
phase of **[brutal anarchy]{.mark}**, as it has three times in the past
two centuries. The cost of that descent, in lives and treasure, in lost
freedoms and lost hope, will be staggering.]{.underline} Americans tend
to take the fundamental stability of the international order for
granted, even while complaining about the burden the United States
carries in preserving that stability. History shows that [[world orders
do collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, and [when they do [it
is]{.mark} often **[unexpected, rapid, and
violent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The late 18th century was the high point
of the Enlightenment in Europe, before the continent fell suddenly into
the abyss of the Napoleonic Wars. [[In the first decade of the 20th
century]{.mark}, [**the world's smartest minds predicted an end** to
great-power conflict]{.mark} as revolutions in communication and
transportation knit economies and people closer together. [The most
devastating war]{.mark} in history [came four years
later]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The apparent calm of the postwar
1920s became the crisis-ridden 1930s and then another world war. Where
exactly we are in this classic scenario today, how close the trend lines
are to that intersection point is, as always, impossible to know. Are we
three years away from a global crisis, or 15? [That [we are]{.mark}
somewhere [on that path]{.mark}, however, is unmistakable.]{.underline}
And while it is too soon to know what effect Donald Trump's presidency
will have on these trends, early signs suggest that the new
administration is more likely to hasten us toward crisis than slow or
reverse these trends. The further accommodation of Russia can only
embolden Vladimir Putin, and the tough talk with China will likely lead
Beijing to test the new administration's resolve militarily. Whether the
president is ready for such a confrontation is entirely unclear. For the
moment, he seems not to have thought much about the future ramifications
of his rhetoric and his actions. [[China and Russia are **classic
revisionist powers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although both have never
enjoyed greater security from foreign powers than they do today ---
Russia from its traditional enemies to the west, China from its
traditional enemy in the east --- [they are [dissatisfied with
the]{.mark} current [global configuration of power. Both seek to
restore]{.mark} the [hegemonic dominance]{.mark} they once enjoyed in
their respective regions. [For]{.mark} [China, that means **dominance of
East Asia**]{.mark}, with countries like [Japan, South Korea]{.mark},
and the nations of Southeast Asia both acquiescing to Beijing's will and
acting in conformity with China's strategic, economic, and political
preferences.]{.underline} That includes American influence withdrawn to
the eastern Pacific, behind the Hawaiian Islands. [[For Russia, it
means]{.mark} **hegemonic influence in [Central and Eastern
Europe]{.mark}** and Central Asia, which Moscow has traditionally
regarded as either part of its empire or part of its sphere of
influence. Both Beijing and Moscow seek to redress what they regard as
an unfair distribution of power]{.underline}, influence, and honor [in
the U.S.-led postwar global order.]{.underline} As autocracies, [both
feel threatened by the dominant democratic powers in the international
system]{.underline} and by the democracies on their borders. Both regard
the United States as the principal obstacle to their ambitions, and
therefore [b[oth **seek to weaken** the American-led]{.mark}
international security [order]{.mark} that stands in the way of their
achieving what they regard as their rightful destinies.]{.underline} It
was good while it lasted [Until fairly recently, Russia and China have
faced considerable, almost insuperable, obstacles in achieving their
objectives. The chief obstacle has been the power and coherence of the
international order itself and its principal promoter and defender. The
American-led system of political and military alliances, especially in
the two critical regions of Europe and East Asia, has presented China
and Russia with what Dean Acheson once referred to as "situations of
strength" that have required them to pursue their ambitions cautiously
and, since the end of the Cold War, to defer serious efforts to disrupt
the international system. [The system has checked their
ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline} in both positive and negative ways.
[[During]{.mark} the era of [American primacy, China and Russia
have]{.mark} [participated in and]{.mark} for the most part [been
beneficiaries of the open **international economic system** the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [created]{.mark} and helps sustain; [so
long as that system functions, **they have**]{.mark} **had [more to gain
by playing in it ]{.mark}**[than by]{.mark} challenging and [overturning
it.]{.mark}]{.underline} The political and strategic aspects of the
order, however, have worked to their detriment. The growth and vibrancy
of democratic government in the two decades following the collapse of
Soviet communism posed a continual threat to the ability of rulers in
Beijing and Moscow to maintain control, and since the end of the Cold
War they have regarded every advance of democratic institutions ---
especially the geographical advance of liberal democracies close to
their borders --- as an existential threat. That's for good reason:
Autocratic powers since the days of Klemens von Metternich have always
feared the contagion of liberalism. The mere existence of democracies on
their borders, the global free flow of information they cannot control,
the dangerous connection between free market capitalism and political
freedom --- all pose a threat to rulers who depend on keeping restive
forces in their own countries in check. The continual challenge to the
legitimacy of their rule posed by the U.S.-supported democratic order
has therefore naturally made them hostile both to that order and to the
United States. But, until recently[, a preponderance of domestic and
international forces has dissuaded them from confronting the order
directly. Chinese rulers have had to worry about what an unsuccessful
confrontation with the United States might do to their legitimacy at
home]{.underline}. Even [Putin has pushed only against open doors, as in
Syria, where the United States responded passively to his probes. He has
been more cautious when confronted by even marginal U.S. and European
opposition, as in Ukraine. [The greatest check]{.mark} on Chinese and
Russian ambitions [has been]{.mark} the [military and **economic power**
of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies in Europe and Asia.
[China]{.mark}, although increasingly powerful, [has had to contemplate
facing the]{.mark} combined [military and economic strength of]{.mark}
[the world's superpower]{.mark} and some very formidable regional powers
linked by alliance or common strategic interest --- including Japan,
India, and South Korea]{.underline}, as well as smaller but still potent
nations like Vietnam and Australia. [Russia has had to face the United
States and its NATO allies. When united, these U.S.-led alliances
present a daunting challenge to a revisionist power that can call on few
allies of its own for assistance]{.underline}. Even [were the Chinese to
score an early victory in a conflict, such as the military subjection of
Taiwan or a naval battle in the South or East China Sea, [they would
have to contend]{.mark} over time [with the]{.mark} **combined
industrial productive capacities** of some of the world's **[richest and
most technologically advanced nations]{.mark}** and the likely cutoff of
access to foreign markets on which their own economy
depends.]{.underline} A weaker Russia, with its depleted population and
oil- and gas-dependent economy, would face an even greater challenge.
For decades, [[the strong global position enjoyed by the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies has **discouraged any serious
challenge**]{.mark}. So long as the United States was perceived as a
dependable ally, [Chinese and Russian leaders feared that aggressive
moves would backfire]{.mark} and possibly bring their regimes
down.]{.underline} This is what the political scientist William
Wohlforth once described as the inherent stability of the unipolar
order: As [dissatisfied regional powers sought to challenge the status
quo, their alarmed neighbors turned to the distant American superpower
to contain their ambitions. And it worked. The United States stepped up,
and Russia and China largely backed down]{.underline} --- or were
preempted before acting at all. Faced with these obstacles, [the best
option for the two revisionist great powers has always been to hope for
or, if possible, engineer a weakening of the U.S.-supported world order
from within, either by separating the United States from its allies or
by raising doubts about the U.S. commitment]{.underline} and thereby
encouraging would-be allies and partners to forgo the strategic
protection of the liberal world order and seek accommodation with its
challengers. [[The present system has]{.mark} therefore
[depended]{.mark} **not only [on American power]{.mark} but on
[coherence and unity]{.mark}** at the heart of the democratic world.
[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has had to play its part as the
principal guarantor of the order]{.mark}, especially in the military and
strategic realm, but [the order's]{.mark} ideological and **[economic
core]{.mark}** --- the democracies of Europe and East Asia and the
Pacific --- [has]{.mark} also [had to remain]{.mark} relatively
[healthy]{.mark} and confident.]{.underline}

### Russia-China - Extension

#### Russia-China alliance will bring in other players -- including Iran and Saudi Arabia

Finland and Sweden\'s green light to join
[[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato) is
set to bring about the U.S.-led Western military alliance\'s largest
expansion in decades. Meanwhile, the G7, consisting of NATO states and
fellow U.S. ally Japan, [[has adopted a tougher line against Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the East, however, security and
economy-focused blocs led by [[Beijing and Moscow are looking to take on
new members]{.underline}]{.mark} of their own, [[including Iran and
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, two influential Middle Eastern rivals
whose interest in shoring up cooperation on this new front could have a
significant impact on global geopolitical balance. The two bodies in
question are the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS. The
former was established in 2001 as a six-member political, economic and
military coalition including China, Russia and the Central Asian states
of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan before recruiting South Asian
nemeses India and Pakistan in 2017, while the latter is a grouping of
emerging economic powers originally consisting of Brazil, Russia, India
and China (BRIC) upon its inception 2006, and including South Africa in
2010. \"The BRICS and the SCO share one important ideological quality:
they are both focused on multipolarity, and their summits have even been
held back to back with one another at times,\" Matthew Neapole, an
international affairs expert and contributor to the Macdonald-Laurier
Institute in Canada, told Newsweek. \"Both are angling to act as force
multipliers for this drive for multipolarity, to help along with
alternatives \[i.e, in currency or banking\],\" he added. \"[[It could,
in theory, facilitate economic linkages and step into gaps that U.S.
institutions are not filling due to sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, such
as those laid on Russia.\" Iran, already an SCO observer, began its
formal [membership ascension
process](https://www.newsweek.com/afghanistans-fall-china-russias-chance-asia-iran-wants-join-1620873)
amid the latest leaders\' summit in September. On Monday, [[the Iranian
Foreign Ministry announced the Islamic Republic would also seek to join
BRICS]{.underline}]{.mark}. Across the Persian Gulf, [[Saudi Arabia has
also reportedly considered applying for BRICS
membership]{.underline}]{.mark}, as revealed by Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov during his visit to the kingdom in late May. The
announcement followed Saudi Arabia joining Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Senegal, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates at
China\'s invitation for a \"BRICS+\" discussion, after which Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced members had
\"reached consensus on the BRICS expansion process.\"

https://www.newsweek.com/nato-grows-china-russia-seek-bring-iran-saudi-arabia-fold-1720780

The energy problem plays into two key reasons having both [[Iran and
Saudi Arabia on board for BRICS would be a \"major gain\" for the
organization]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Akhil Ramesh, a fellow
at the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum. \"For countries like China and to an
extent India, import dependency for oil has been a major headache, both
from an economic standpoint of trade deficits and from a geopolitical
standpoint of having to make security and strategic sacrifices for the
sake of oil imports,\" Ramesh said. [[\"Having three large oil producers
in the grouping \[Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia\] could possibly give
these countries the option of securing oil]{.mark}]{.underline} at
discounted rates or through alternative arrangements \[barter\].\"
[[Tehran and Riyadh\'s oil reserves would also lend BRICS a stronger
hand in taking on the U.S. dollar\'s hegemony over the world financial
system]{.underline}]{.mark} as Ramesh argued that, \"in order [[to
replace the USD as the global reserve currency]{.mark}]{.underline} you
would need to have more commodity-exporting countries, especially oil
exporting ones buying into the idea.\"

### Turkey 

#### NATO provides Turkey with a political cover to abuse the Kurdish ethnic minority.

In April, [[as the world was occupied with Vladimir]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Putin's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, a NATO
member [launched an
attack](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/18/turkey-launches-new-offensive-against-kurdish-rebels-in-iraq) on
two of its neighboring territories. In a bombing campaign, [[Turkey
targeted the camps of Kurdish militants in Iraq and
Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}, inflicting damage on shelters, ammunition
depots and bases. [[The irony went largely
unnoticed]{.underline}]{.mark}. That's hardly a surprise: [[For a long
time, the Western world has turned a blind eye to
Turkey's]{.underline}]{.mark} heavy-handed [[treatment of the
Kurds]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Across decades, the Turkish state has
persecuted the Kurdish minority]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[about 18
percent of the population]{.underline}]{.mark} --- with devastating
zeal. [[Thousands have perished and around a [million have been

a campaign of severe internal repression. But Western nations, except
for a brief spell when Kurdish resistance was holding back an ascendant
Islamic State, have rarely seemed to care. Turkey's treatment of the

four hours of talks just before a NATO summit began in Madrid, and
allows the gathering of 30 leaders in the Spanish capital to show a
united front against Moscow, and start the process of Finland and
Sweden's inclusion in the alliance in earnest. The announcement of an
agreement cements the biggest shift in European security in decades, as
the Nordic countries abandon their decades-long neutrality to enter the
military alliance. Here's a look at why Turkey initially opposed Finland
and Sweden's NATO bid, and why it now backs their membership: [[Turkey
surprised its NATO allies when it initially opposed Finland and Sweden's
bid]{.underline}]{.mark} to join the alliance. [[Ankara demanded that
the Nordic countries **stop supporting Kurdish armed
groups**]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the PKK, and lift their bans on

which Stockholm denied. NATO operates by consensus, which means that
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan could have blocked the accession
of Finland and Sweden to the 30-nation alliance unless his demands were
met, which he had threatened to do. The PKK, a designated "terrorist"
group in Turkey, the European Union, and the United States, took up arms
against the Turkish state in 1984. Tens of thousands of people have died
in Turkey as a result of the conflict between the Turkish state and the
PKK, with the PKK and its offshoots carrying out numerous attacks on
military, security forces and civilians, and Turkey conducting
operations in southeastern parts of the country with the aim of forcing
the PKK out. Turkey considers any support for the Syrian YPG, which it
views as an offshoot of the PKK, akin to support for the PKK. The YPG
has been backed by many Western nations in the fight against ISIL
(ISIS). Turkey has conducted several military operations in both Syria
and Iraq over the past few years, targeting the PKK and the YPG.
**[[NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the terms of the deal

Turkey has opposed Sweden and Finland\'s membership of NATO, accusing
them of harbouring individuals linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party
militant group (PKK) and followers of a cleric Turkey accuses of
orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016.

What are these groups?

[[THE PKK]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The Kurds are a minority living in a region straddling the borders of
Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey and Armenia]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Turkey,
they make up about 20% of the population. [[The PKK]{.underline}]{.mark}
was founded in 1978 with the aim of creating an ethnic homeland in
southeast Turkey. It [[took up arms against Turkey in
1984,]{.underline}]{.mark} a conflict in which more than 40,000 people
have been killed. Western governments including the United States and
European Union designate the PKK as a terrorist organisation. The
conflict extends into northern Iraq, where Turkey regularly attacks what
it says are PKK camps and ammunition stores. It also spread into Syria
as that country descended into war from 2011, and a group inspired by
the ideology of PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan - the YPG - emerged as an
armed faction.

THE YPG [[The YPG, or People\'s Protection Units, established a foothold
in northern Syria at the Turkish frontier early in Syria\'s conflict.
The group joined a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, becoming
the spearhead of a wider militia,]{.mark} t]{.underline}he Syrian
Democratic Forces, which enjoys U.S. support.

Turkey says the YPG and PKK are one and the same, and views their Syrian
foothold as a national security threat. [[While Turkey brands the YPG as
a terrorist group, Western governments do not]{.underline}]{.mark}. U.S.
ties to the SDF have annoyed Ankara and been a source of tension for
years, with Turkey particularly angered by Washington\'s supply of
weapons to the group. Turkey has launched several incursions into
northern Syria. One such incursion, in 2019, prompted Finland and Sweden
to ban some arms sales to Turkey. Lifting this is one of Ankara\'s
demands. Turkey says Helsinki and Stockholm failed to agree to Ankara\'s
requests to extradite \"dozens of terrorists\" over the last five years,
including individuals linked to both the PKK and Gulen[[. Turkey has
said it will not look positively on the Nordic states\' NATO membership
unless they clearly show cooperation on the fight against
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} and other issues, and lift the arms
embargo. Erdogan spoke to both countries\' leaders on Saturday, telling
Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson that Ankara expected concrete
steps to address its concerns, and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto that
failing to deal with terrorist organisations posing a threat to a NATO
ally would not suit the spirit of alliance. [read

Many analysts have said Erdogan may be aiming to use this moment to
press Washington over some long-standing issues that have weighed on
ties, including support for the YPG. [read

WHAT DO FINLAND AND SWEDEN SAY? In her call with Erdogan, Andersson said
she emphasised that Sweden welcomed the possibility of cooperation in
the fight against international terrorism. Sweden supports the fight
against terrorism and agrees with the PKK\'s terrorist listing. Finland
has said it condemns terrorism in all its forms and is open to
discussing Turkey\'s concerns. Niinisto said he held \"open and direct\"
talks with Erdogan and agreed to continue close dialogue

#### NATO undermines the international liberal order and the credibility of the UN

[[NATO creates an unequal world and undermines the credibility of the
UN]{.mark}. If other countries start emulating the example of NATO and
create their own separate military alliances, this would be an end to
the existence of the UN. [This would also create a fertile ground for
tension all across the globe.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Russian military
intervention in Ukraine has exposed the world's inability to control the
situation if a powerful State decides to use its military power to set
things right with its immediate neighbouring countries. The prime reason
for this massive failure is the absence of a moral and righteous world
body that has the mechanism to implement dharma-based order. [NATO
clearly does not fit the bill.The only organisation that could do this
is the United Nations but it has got weakened due to shadow boxing by
major world powers---the Big Five that includes the US, the UK, France,
China and Russia.]{.underline} They trust their own military strength
and have no reason to strengthen the UN. The veto enjoyed by them
ensures that this body remains defunct to prevent any major crisis
involving any of these players. All these five have developed
sophisticated weaponry and are major suppliers of arms across the world.
[NATO cannot replace the UN since it is a group of countries having a
vested interest to empower itself and maintain superiority vis-a-vis
other countries. **[The world does not matter to NATO countries if they
are not involved in acts of war with non-NATO
countries]{.mark}.**]{.underline} And if push comes to shove NATO can
fight any country or grouping in the world based on its combined
military strength and economic might. At least NATO would like to
believe this.The fact that three permanent members of the UN Security
with veto are members of the NATO---France, the UK and the US---makes it
evident that the organisation seeks to be happy with its own enclave
where they would enjoy liberty, freedom and democracy and will also have
the wherewithal to fight others if these are hurt. [Even in the vastly
interdependent and integrated world, NATO believes that it can live
peacefully even if other countries suffer.]{.underline} The UN has 193
members which means that 163 countries are outside the NATO framework.
Becoming a member of NATO brings in security plus economic empowerment.
Actually, [the strategy of the British Empire where the military back-up
by the Crown was used to further business interests has been emulated by
NATO. NATO would intervene if its economic interest is hurt or if it
concludes that certain actions of any country are hurting its core held
principles.]{.underline} The massive airpower would ensure that NATO
troops would not even need to be on the ground if it desires to punish a
country. [The control over English media by NATO countries both in terms
of finance, governmental control and ideology would ensure that a larger
legitimacy is provided to its actions. The US intervention in
Afghanistan was justified as much as its withdrawal that happened after
two decades. The US intervened in Iraq to destroy weapons of mass
destruction but when it did not find any, it blamed intelligence
failure.]{.underline} The UN has been relegated to providing legitimacy
to the course of action decided by NATO. These NATO countries have
enough clout because of their influence and are able to lobby
successfully at the UN and get the support of smaller countries to add
to their legitimacy. [One wonders why was NATO not disbanded with the
collapse of the Warsaw Pact]{.underline}---a military alliance of former
communist countries with the erstwhile USSR as the fulcrum. Both the
Warsaw Pact and the NATO were offshoots of the Cold war and hence when
the Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991, NATO should have followed the
same course. On the contrary, NATO expanded by inducting former Soviets
into it. [[NATO creates an unequal world and undermines the credibility
of the UN.]{.mark} If other countries start emulating the example of
NATO and create their own separate military alliances, this would be an
end to the existence of the UN. This would also create fertile ground
for tension all across the globe. [The world would be divided into
exclusive economic and military blocs]{.mark}. Ukraine should serve as a
lesson to NATO that it cannot do anything in a war-like situation with a
powerful country. Some members of NATO are now realising that economic
sanctions are going to hurt their own interests more than the interest
of Russia. Had NATO not given false confidence to Ukraine and provoked
it to seek NATO membership, the present crisis could have been
avoided.]{.underline} You can appreciate the security concerns of other
countries only when you understand the vulnerabilities. If you are
strongly protected by the umbrella of a powerful security alliance you
would not feel the pinch. Ukraine was the best as a buffer country
between Russia and Western Europe. When Ukraine was forced to abandon
its nuclear arsenals all the powers had ensured that it would stay safe
and secure and the world would stand guarantee to its neutrality.
Sending arms to that country and trying to influence it to become a
member of the European Union and then NATO was a violation of that
charter. Russian intervention in Ukraine cannot be justified in today's
world and any issue of provocation must be resolved through dialogues.
But [when unbiased history would be written about this crisis, one would
not be able to ignore the fact that Russian overtures to talks were
spurned by an overconfident NATO led by the US.]{.underline} Was it not
provoked to use its military might to set things right from Russia's
perspective? NATO must ponder over this. [The high-sounding words trying
to bulldoze Russian President Vladimir Putin have proved to be hollow.
NATO cannot get into direct war with Russia since the threat of nuclear
weapons poses threat to the entire humanity.]{.underline} [The need for
a stronger UN was never felt more acutely than it is today.]{.underline}
Panic gripped the world when on 4 March, the Russian military fired at
the power units of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant---the largest
nuclear facility in Europe. Energoatom which operates nuclear plants in
Ukraine appealed to the world community saying that heavy shelling at
the nuclear plants was "a severe violation of nuclear and radiation
safety which can lead to hard and tragic consequences for the whole
world!" The world had woken up to the warning that it could witness a
tragedy worst than that of Chernobyl. Those who may have forgotten must
know what Chernobyl disaster a nuclear accident that happened on 26
April 1984 during a routine checking at one of the nuclear plants at
Chernobyl. This generated more radioactive radiation than the two bombs
that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Chernobyl and areas around
it were evacuated and largescale relocation of the population took place
in affected areas. The radiation led to people getting various diseases,
particularly thyroid cancer. An area of 30 sq km around the plant is now
made an exclusion zone where people cannot visit. Close to 150,000 Sq
Kms of land area in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine were supposed to have
been contaminated. Has the world evolved any mechanism to take care of
such eventualities? You can blame one country or the other for the
tragedy but who will be responsible for the largescale death and
devastation resulting from this no gain blame game. [Who is responsible
for the death and destruction in Ukraine? The US, NATO or Russia? Or is
it the entire world that failed to take corrective action in
time?]{.underline} [Whether a war or economic sanctions, the result is
the same. The common people who have no role suffer the most. [If we
call ourselves civilised why can't we evolve a strong mechanism for
peaceful resolution of disputes? There are few hotspots of the world and
immediate attention must be given to them so that rival territorial
claims do not become a reason for military conquest.]{.mark} The UN is
the only institution that promises hope.]{.underline} A larger role to
the UN means that all military alliances or such pacts between countries
must be dismantled. The UN must be strengthened to use force too if and
when needed---not only for peacekeeping but also for bringing an errant
country to sense. One factor that has made the UN almost non-functional
in matters of such conflict is the power of the veto. Why should any
country have a veto?

#### LIO prevents great power war and key to solve all global problems\-\--creates norms of restraint and cooperation

[There is no]{.underline} longer any [question: **[wealth and power are
moving from]{.mark} the [North]{.mark} and the [West to]{.mark} the
[East and]{.mark} the [South]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and the old order
dominated by the United States and Europe is giving way to one
increasingly shared with non-Western rising states. But if the great
wheel of power is turning, what kind of global political order will
emerge in the aftermath? Some anxious observers argue that the world
will not just look less American \-- it will also look less liberal. Not
only is the United States\' preeminence passing away, they say, but so,
too, is the open and rule-based international order that the country has
championed since the 1940s. In this view, newly powerful states are
beginning to advance their own ideas and agendas for global order, and a
weakened United States will find it harder to defend the old system.
**[[The hallmarks of liberal internationalism]{.mark} \-- openness and
[rule-based relations enshrined in institutions]{.mark} such as
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited Nations [[and]{.mark} norms such
as [multilateralism]{.mark} \-- [could give way to a]{.mark} more
[contested and fragmented system of blocs]{.mark}]{.underline}, spheres
of influence, mercantilist networks, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} regional
[[rivalries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The fact that today\'s rising states
are mostly large non-Western developing countries gives force to this
narrative. The old liberal international order was designed and built in
the West. Brazil, China, India, and other fast-emerging states have a
different set of cultural, political, and economic experiences, and they
see the world through their anti-imperial and anticolonial pasts. Still
grappling with basic problems of development, they do not share the
concerns of the advanced capitalist societies. The recent global
economic slowdown has also bolstered this narrative of liberal
international decline. Beginning in the United States, the crisis has
tarnished the American model of liberal capitalism and raised new doubts
about the ability of the United States to act as the global economic
leader. For all these reasons, many observers have concluded that world
politics is experiencing not just a changing of the guard but also a
transition in the ideas and principles that underlie the global order.
The journalist Gideon Rachman, for example, says that a cluster of
liberal internationalist ideas \-- such as faith in democratization,
confidence in free markets, and the acceptability of U.S. military power
\-- are all being called into question. According to this worldview, the
future of international order will be shaped above all by China, which
will use its growing power and wealth to push world politics in an
illiberal direction. Pointing out that China and other non-Western
states have weathered the recent financial crisis better than their
Western counterparts, pessimists argue that an authoritarian capitalist
alternative to Western neoliberal ideas has already emerged. According
to the scholar Stefan Halper, emerging-market states \"are learning to
combine market economics with traditional autocratic or semiautocratic
politics in a process that signals an intellectual rejection of the
Western economic model.\" But this panicked narrative misses a deeper
reality: **[[although the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates\' [[position]{.mark} in the global system
[is changing, the liberal international order is alive and
well]{.mark}]{.underline}. The struggle over international order today
is not about fundamental principles. [[China and other emerging]{.mark}
great [powers do not want to contest the basic rules
]{.mark}]{.underline}and principles [of the liberal international order;
[they wish to gain more]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}authority and
[leadership [within it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}Indeed, today\'s
power transition represents not the defeat of the liberal order but its
ultimate ascendance. Brazil, China, and India have all become more
prosperous and capable by operating inside the existing international
order \-- benefiting from its rules, practices, and institutions,
including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the newly organized
G-20. [**[Their]{.mark} economic [success]{.mark} and growing influence
[are tied to]{.mark} the [liberal internationalist organization]{.mark}
of world politics, [and they have deep interests in preserving that
system]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the meantime, alternatives to an open
and rule-based order have yet to crystallize. Even though the last
decade has brought remarkable upheavals in the global system \-- the
emergence of new powers, bitter disputes among Western allies over the
United States\' unipolar ambitions, and a global financial crisis and
recession \-- the liberal international order has no competitors. On the
contrary, the rise of non-Western powers and the growth of economic and
security interdependence are creating new constituencies for it. To be
sure, as wealth and power become less concentrated in the United
States\' hands, the country will be less able to shape world politics.
But the underlying foundations of the liberal international order will
survive and thrive. Indeed, now may be the best time for the United
States and its democratic partners to update the liberal order for a new
era, ensuring that it continues to provide the benefits of security and
prosperity that it has provided since the middle of the twentieth
century. THE LIBERAL ASCENDANCY China and the other emerging powers do
not face simply an American-led order or a Western system. They face a
broader international order that is the product of centuries of struggle
and innovation. It is highly developed, expansive, integrated,
institutionalized, and deeply rooted in the societies and economies of
both advanced capitalist states and developing states. And over the last
half century, [**[this order has been unusually capable of assimilating
rising powers]{.mark}** and reconciling political]{.underline} and
cultural [diversity]{.underline}. Today\'s international order is the
product of two order-building projects that began centuries ago. One is
the creation and expansion of the modern state system, a project dating
back to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. In the years since then, the
project has promulgated rules and principles associated with state
sovereignty and norms of great-power conduct. The other project is the
construction of the liberal order, which over the last two centuries was
led by the United Kingdom and the United States and which in the
twentieth century was aided by the rise of liberal democratic states.
The two projects have worked together. The Westphalian project has
focused on solving the \"realist\" problems of creating stable and
cooperative interstate relations under conditions of anarchy, and the
liberal-order-building project has been possible only when relations
between the great powers have been stabilized. The \"problems of
Hobbes,\" that is, anarchy and power insecurities, have had to be solved
in order to take advantage of the \"opportunities of Locke,\" that is,
the construction of open and rule-based relations. At the heart of the
Westphalian project is the notion of state sovereignty and great-power
relations. The original principles of the Westphalian system \--
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and nonintervention \-- reflected an
emerging consensus that states were the rightful political units for the
establishment of legitimate rule. Founded in western Europe, the
Westphalian system has expanded outward to encompass the entire globe.
New norms and principles \-- such as self-determination and mutual
recognition among sovereign states \-- have evolved within it, further
reinforcing the primacy of states and state authority. Under the banners
of sovereignty and self-determination, political movements for
decolonization and independence were set in motion in the non-Western
developing world, coming to fruition in the decades after World War II.
Westphalian norms have been violated and ignored, but they have,
nonetheless, been the most salient and agreed-on parts of the
international order. A succession of postwar settlements \-- Vienna in
1815, Versailles in 1919, Yalta and Potsdam in 1945, and the U.S.,
Soviet, and European negotiations that ended the Cold War and reunified
Germany in the early 1990s \-- allowed the great powers to update the
principles and practices of their relations. Through war and settlement,
the great powers learned how to operate within a multipolar
balance-of-power system. Over time, the order has remained a
decentralized system in which major states compete and balance against
one another. But it has also evolved. [[**The great powers**]{.mark}
have **[developed]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}principles and
[[**practices of restraint and accommodation**]{.mark} that have served
their interests.]{.underline} The Congress of Vienna in 1815, where
post-Napoleonic France was returned to the great-power club and a
congress system was established to manage conflicts, and [the UN
Security Council today, which has provided a site for great-power
consultations, are emblematic of these efforts to create **[rules and
mechanisms]{.mark}** that **[reinforce restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}and accommodation. The project of constructing a liberal order
built on this evolving system of Westphalian relations. In the
nineteenth century, liberal internationalism was manifest in the United
Kingdom\'s championing of free trade and the freedom of the seas, but it
was limited and coexisted with imperialism and colonialism. In the
twentieth century, the United States advanced the liberal order in
several phases. After World War I, President Woodrow Wilson and other
liberals pushed for an international order organized around a global
collective-security body, the League of Nations, in which states would
act together to uphold a system of territorial peace. Open trade,
national self-determination, and a belief in progressive global change
also undergirded the Wilsonian worldview \-- a \"one world\" vision of
nation-states that would trade and interact in a multilateral system of
laws. But in the interwar period of closed economic systems and imperial
blocs, this experiment in liberal order collapsed. After World War II,
President Franklin Roosevelt\'s administration tried to construct a
liberal order again, embracing a vision of an open trading system and a
global organization in which the great powers would cooperate to keep
the peace \-- the United Nations. Drawing lessons from Wilson\'s failure
and incorporating ideas from the New Deal, American architects of the
postwar order also advanced more ambitious ideas about economic and
political cooperation, which were embodied in the Bretton Woods
institutions. This vision was originally global in spirit and scope, but
it evolved into a more American-led and Western-centered system as a
result of the weakness of postwar Europe and rising tensions with the
Soviet Union. As the Cold War unfolded, the United States took command
of the system, adopting new commitments and functional roles in both
security and economics. Its own economic and political system became, in
effect, the central component of the larger liberal hegemonic order.
Another development of liberal internationalism was quietly launched
after World War II, although it took root more slowly and competed with
aspects of the Westphalian system. This was the elaboration of the
universal rights of man, enshrined in the UN and its Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. A steady stream of conventions and treaties
followed that together constitute an extraordinary vision of rights,
individuals, sovereignty, and global order. In the decades since the end
of the Cold War, notions of \"the responsibility to protect\" have given
the international community legal rights and obligations to intervene in
the affairs of sovereign states. Seen in this light, the modern
international order is not really American or Western \-- even if, for
historical reasons, it initially appeared that way. It is something much
wider. In the decades after World War II, the United States stepped
forward as the hegemonic leader, taking on the privileges and
responsibilities of organizing and running the system. It presided over
a far-flung international order organized around multilateral
institutions, alliances, special relationships, and client states \-- a
hierarchical order with liberal characteristics. But now, as this
hegemonic organization of the liberal international order starts to
change, the hierarchical aspects are fading while the liberal aspects
persist. So [even as China and other rising states try to contest U.S.
leadership]{.underline} \-- and there is indeed a struggle over the
rights, privileges, and responsibilities of the leading states within
the system \-- [the deeper international order remains intact. **[Rising
powers are finding incentives]{.mark} and opportunities [to]{.mark}
engage and [integrate]{.mark} into this order, doing so [to advance
their own interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For these states, the road
to modernity runs through \-- not away from \-- the existing
international order. JOINING THE CLUB **[[The liberal international
order]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not just a collection of liberal
democratic states but an international mutual-aid society \-- a sort of
global political club **that [[provides]{.mark} members with tools for
economic and political advancement. Participants in the order gain
[trading]{.mark} opportunities, dispute-resolution mechanisms,
frameworks for collective action, regulatory agreements, allied
[security guarantees, and resources]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in times of
crisis]{.underline}. And just as there are a variety of reasons why
rising states will embrace the liberal international order, [there are
powerful obstacles to opponents who would seek to overturn
it.]{.underline} To begin with, [rising states have deep interests in an
open and rule-based system]{.underline}. Openness gives them access to
other societies \-- for trade, investment, and knowledge sharing.
Without the unrestricted investment from the United States and Europe of
the past several decades, for instance, China and the other rising
states would be on a much slower developmental path. As these countries
grow, they will encounter protectionist and discriminatory reactions
from slower-growing countries threatened with the loss of jobs and
markets. As a result, the rising states will find the rules and
institutions that uphold nondiscrimination and equal access to be
critical. The World Trade Organization \-- the most formal and developed
institution of the liberal international order \-- enshrines these rules
and norms, and rising states have been eager to join the WTO and gain
the rights and protections it affords. China is already deeply enmeshed
in the global trading system, with a remarkable 40 percent of its GNP
composed of exports \-- 25 percent of which go to the United States.
China could be drawn further into the liberal order through its desire
to have the yuan become an international currency rivaling the U.S.
dollar. Aside from conferring prestige, this feat could also stabilize
China\'s exchange rate and grant Chinese leaders autonomy in setting
macroeconomic policy. But if China wants to make the yuan a global
currency, it will need to loosen its currency controls and strengthen
its domestic financial rules and institutions. As Barry Eichengreen and
other economic historians have noted, the U.S. dollar assumed its
international role after World War II not only because the U.S. economy
was large but also because the United States had highly developed
financial markets and domestic institutions \-- economic and political
\-- that were stable, open, and grounded in the rule of law. China will
feel pressures to establish these same institutional preconditions if it
wants the benefits of a global currency. [Internationalist-oriented
elites in [Brazil, China, India,]{.mark} and elsewhere [are growing in
influence]{.mark}]{.underline} within their societies, creating an
expanding global constituency for an open and rule-based international
order. These elites were not party to the grand bargains that lay behind
the founding of the liberal order in the early postwar decades, and
[they are [seeking to renegotiate their]{.mark} countries\'
[positions]{.mark}]{.underline} within the system. [[But they are
nonetheless embracing]{.mark} the [rules and institutions]{.mark} of the
old order. They want the protections and rights that come from the
international order]{.underline}\'s Westphalian defense of sovereignty.
They care about great-power authority. They want the protections and
rights relating to trade and investment. [And they want to use the rules
and institutions of liberal internationalism as platforms
to]{.underline} project their influence and [acquire
legitimacy]{.underline} at home and abroad. The UN Security Council, the
G-20, the governing bodies of the Bretton Woods institutions \-- these
are all stages on which rising non-Western states can acquire
great-power authority and exercise global leadership. NO OTHER ORDER
Meanwhile, there is no competing global organizing logic to liberal
internationalism. An alternative, illiberal order \-- a \"Beijing
model\" \-- would presumably be organized around exclusive blocs,
spheres of influence, and mercantilist networks. It would be less open
and rule-based, and it would be dominated by an array of state-to-state
ties. But on a global scale, such a system would not advance the
interests of any of the major states, including China. The Beijing model
only works when one or a few states opportunistically exploit an open
system of markets. But if everyone does, it is no longer an open system
but a fragmented, mercantilist, and protectionist complex \-- and
everyone suffers. It is possible that China could nonetheless move in
this direction. This is a future in which China is not a full-blown
illiberal hegemon that reorganizes the global rules and institutions. It
is simply a spoiler. It attempts to operate both inside and outside the
liberal international order. In this case, China would be successful
enough with its authoritarian model of development to resist the
pressures to liberalize and democratize. But if the rest of the world
does not gravitate toward this model, China will find itself subjected
to pressure to play by the rules. This dynamic was on display in
February 2011, when Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff joined U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in expressing concern over China\'s
currency policy. China can free-ride on the liberal international order,
but it will pay the costs of doing so \-- and it will still not be able
to impose its illiberal vision on the world. In the background,
meanwhile, democracy and the rule of law are still the hallmarks of
modernity and the global standard for legitimate governance. Although it
is true that the spread of democracy has stalled in recent years and
that authoritarian China has performed well in the recent economic
crisis, there is little evidence that authoritarian states can become
truly advanced societies without moving in a liberal democratic
direction. The legitimacy of one-party rule within China rests more on
the state\'s ability to deliver economic growth and full employment than
on authoritarian \-- let alone communist \-- political principles.
Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean intellectual who has championed
China\'s rise, admits that \"China cannot succeed in its goal of
becoming a modern developed society until it can take the leap and allow
the Chinese people to choose their own rulers.\" No one knows how far or
fast democratic reforms will unfold in China, but a growing middle
class, business elites, and human rights groups will exert pressure for
them. The Chinese government certainly appears to worry about the
long-term preservation of one-party rule, and in the wake of the ongoing
revolts against Arab authoritarian regimes, it has tried harder to
prevent student gatherings and control foreign journalists. Outside
China, democracy has become a near-universal ideal. As the economist
Amartya Sen has noted, \"While democracy is not yet universally
practiced, nor indeed universally accepted, in the general climate of
world opinion democratic governance has achieved the status of being
taken to be generally right.\" All the leading institutions of the
global system enshrine democracy as the proper and just form of
governance \-- and no competing political ideals even lurk on the
sidelines. The recent global economic downturn was the first great
postwar economic upheaval that emerged from the United States, raising
doubts about an American-led world economy and Washington\'s particular
brand of economics. The doctrines of neoliberalism and market
fundamentalism have been discredited, particularly among the emerging
economies. But liberal internationalism is not the same as neoliberalism
or market fundamentalism. The liberal internationalism that the United
States articulated in the 1940s entailed a more holistic set of ideas
about markets, openness, and social stability. It was an attempt to
construct an open world economy and reconcile it with social welfare and
employment stability. Sustained domestic support for openness, postwar
leaders knew, would be possible only if countries also established
social protections and regulations that safeguarded economic stability.
Indeed, the notions of national security and economic security emerged
together in the 1940s, reflecting New Deal and World War II thinking
about how liberal democracies would be rendered safe and stable. The
Atlantic Charter, announced by Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in 1941,
and the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944 were early efforts to
articulate a vision of economic openness and social stability. The
United States would do well to try to reach back and rearticulate this
view. The world is not rejecting openness and markets; it is asking for
a more expansive notion of stability and economic security. REASON FOR
REASSURANCE Rising powers will discover another reason to embrace the
existing global rules and institutions: doing so will reassure their
neighbors as they grow more powerful. A stronger China will make
neighboring states potentially less secure, especially if it acts
aggressively and exhibits revisionist ambitions. Since this will trigger
a balancing backlash, Beijing has incentives to signal restraint. It
will find ways to do so by participating in various regional and global
institutions. If China hopes to convince its neighbors that it has
embarked on a \"peaceful rise,\" it will need to become more integrated
into the international order. China has already experienced a taste of
such a backlash. Last year, its military made a series of provocative
moves \-- including naval exercises \-- in the South China Sea, actions
taken to support the government\'s claims to sovereign rights over
contested islands and waters. Many of the countries disputing China\'s
claims joined with the United States at the Regional Forum of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July to reject Chinese
bullying and reaffirm open access to Asia\'s waters and respect for
international law. In September, a Chinese fishing trawler operating
near islands administered by Japan in the East China Sea rammed into two
Japanese coast guard ships. After Japanese authorities detained the
trawler\'s crew, China responded with what one Japanese journalist
described as a \"diplomatic \'shock and awe\' campaign,\" suspending
ministerial-level contacts, demanding an apology, detaining several
Japanese workers in China, and instituting a de facto ban on exports of
rare-earth minerals to Japan. These actions \-- seen as manifestations
of a more bellicose and aggressive foreign policy \-- pushed ASEAN,
Japan, and South Korea perceptibly closer to the United States. As
China\'s economic and military power grow, its neighbors will only
become more worried about Chinese aggressiveness, and so Beijing will
have reason to allay their fears. Of course, it might be that some
elites in China are not interested in practicing restraint. But to the
extent that China is interested in doing so, it will find itself needing
to signal peaceful intentions \-- redoubling its participation in
existing institutions, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East
Asia Summit, or working with the other great powers in the region to
build new ones. This is, of course, precisely what the United States did
in the decades after World War II. The country operated within layers of
regional and global economic, political, and security institutions and
constructed new ones \-- thereby making itself more predictable and
approachable and reducing the incentives for other states to undermine
it by building countervailing coalitions. More generally, given the
emerging problems of the twenty-first century, there will be growing
incentives among all the great powers to embrace an open, rule-based
international system. [**[In a world of rising]{.mark} economic and
security [interdependence, the costs of not following multilateral rules
and not forging cooperative ties go up]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
As the global economic system becomes more interdependent, all states
\-- even large, powerful ones \-- will find it harder to ensure
prosperity on their own. [Growing interdependence in]{.underline} the
realm of [security is]{.underline} also [creating a demand for
multilateral rules and institutions.]{.underline} Both the established
and the rising great **[[powers are threatened]{.underline}]{.mark} less
by mass armies marching across borders than [[by transnational dangers,
such as terror]{.underline}]{.mark}ism, [[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}
change, [[and pandemic disease. What goes on in one country]{.mark} \--
[radicalism, carbon]{.mark} emissions, [or public health failures \--
can increasingly harm another]{.mark}]{.underline}** country.
Intensifying economic and security interdependence are giving the United
States and other powerful countries reason to seek new and more
extensive forms of multilateral cooperation. Even now, as the United
States engages China and other rising states, the agenda includes
expanded cooperation in areas such as clean energy, environmental
protection, nonproliferation, and global economic governance. The old
and rising powers may disagree on how exactly this cooperation should
proceed, but they all have reasons to avoid a breakdown in the
multilateral order itself. So they will increasingly experiment with new
and more extensive forms of liberal internationalism. TIME FOR RENEWAL
Pronouncements of American decline miss the real transformation under
way today. What is occurring is not American decline but a dynamic
process in which other states are catching up and growing more
connected. In an open and rule-based international order, this is what
happens. If the architects of the postwar liberal order were alive to
see today\'s system, they would think that their vision had succeeded
beyond their wildest dreams. Markets and democracy have spread.
Societies outside the West are trading and growing. The United States
has more alliance partners today than it did during the Cold War. Rival
hegemonic states with revisionist and illiberal agendas have been pushed
off the global stage. It is difficult to read these world-historical
developments as a story of American decline and liberal unraveling. In a
way, however, the liberal international order has sown the seeds of its
own discontent, since, paradoxically, the challenges facing it now \--
the rise of non-Western states and new transnational threats \-- are
artifacts of its success. But the solutions to these problems \--
integrating rising powers and tackling problems cooperatively \-- will
lead the order\'s old guardians and new stakeholders to an agenda of
renewal. The coming divide in world politics will not be between the
United States (and the West) and the non-Western rising states. Rather,
[**[the struggle will be between those who want to]{.mark} renew and
[expand]{.mark} today\'s system of [multilateral governance arrangements
and those who want]{.mark} to move to [a less cooperative
order]{.mark}** []{.mark}built on spheres of influence.]{.underline}
These fault lines do not map onto geography, nor do they split the West
and the non-West. There are passionate champions of the UN, the WTO, and
a rule-based international order in Asia, and [**[there are]{.mark}
isolationist, protectionist, and [anti-internationalist factions in the
West]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The liberal international order has
succeeded over the decades because its rules and institutions have not
just enshrined open trade and free markets but also provided tools for
governments to manage economic and security interdependence. The agenda
for the renewal of the liberal international order should be driven by
this same imperative: to reinforce the capacities of national
governments to govern and achieve their economic and security goals. As
the hegemonic organization of the liberal international order slowly
gives way, more states will have authority and status. But this will
still be a world that the United States wants to inhabit. A wider array
of states will share the burdens of global economic and political
governance, and with its worldwide system of alliances, the United
States will remain at the center of the global system. Rising states do
not just grow more powerful on the global stage; they grow more powerful
within their regions, and this creates its own set of worries and
insecurities \-- which is why states will continue to look to Washington
for security and partnership. In this new age of international order,
the United States will not be able to rule. But it can still lead.

### A2 Europe

#### Internal issues gut NATO's effectivity -- further US action furthers Europe's dependence on faltering American support. Even popular plans can fail amid political chaos

Atlantic Council who writes extensively on international security and
American foreign policy. "Opinion \| Europe Has an America Problem." The

BRUSSELS --- President Biden is in Europe, and talk of unity fills the
air. At the Group of 7 meeting in Bavaria, Germany, leaders
congratulated themselves for their decisions over the past few months
and restated their support for Ukraine. They even took time for a
"family picture," the often awkward group shot of world leaders. At the
NATO summit in Madrid, which begins on Tuesday, we can expect more of
the same. The self-congratulatory atmosphere is quite new. Just three
years ago, NATO --- frayed by failed interventions in Libya and Iraq,
internally divided over its future and buffeted by Donald Trump's
derision --- was declared "brain-dead" by President Emmanuel Macron of
France. Now the picture is completely different. Four months after
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, NATO stands as a re-energized bulwark
against Russian aggression. European leaders across the continent,
determined to come together, speak confidently of common purpose. Yet
[for all the talk of European resolve]{.underline}, the past few months
have in fact underlined something else: [the continent's **dependence on
the United States to resolve its security problems.**]{.underline}
That's nothing new, of course. In many ways it's the role America has
played since the end of World War II, ensuring --- even after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 --- that Europe operated under
America's military umbrella. But [while this approach might save leaders
from politically difficult choices in the short term, it's ultimately a
losing proposition. America, embroiled in domestic problems and ever
more focused on the challenge from China, can't oversee Europe forever.
And Europe, facing a hostile and revisionist Russia, needs to look after
itself.]{.underline} These criticisms might sound counterintuitive.
After all, Europe has made some major strides on defense in recent
months. This is most visible in Germany, where the government has
pledged to spend 100 billion euros, or \$106 billion, more on defense
over the next few years --- a change so profound that the German press
has adopted Chancellor Olaf Scholz's description of it as a
"Zeitenwende," or turning point. Other countries, including Italy,
Romania and Norway, have also pledged to substantially increase
spending. These shifts strike at the common complaint that European
states, pusillanimous and miserly, are "free riders" relying on
America's military largess for protection. Yet if European states are
reducing their free-rider problem, [they have something perhaps more
intractable: a collective-action problem.]{.underline} Simply put, [the
individual interests and inclinations of the European Union's 27
members]{.underline}, whose countries encompass several thousand miles
of territory, [make it difficult to forge a common course of action.
That's true for many issues, among them economic reform and the role of
the judiciary, but **it's perhaps especially acute for military and
defense policy.**]{.underline} [That applies]{.underline} both [to
NATO]{.underline}, of which all but six E.U. countries are members, and
the European Union's own Common Security and Defense Policy. Indeed,
[one core disagreement revolves around whether a buildup in the E.U.'s
defense capabilities will actually undermine, rather than strengthen,
NATO.]{.underline} To head off such concerns, many favor a division of
labor --- either by geography or based on specific military
capabilities. Yet the precise relationship between the two remains an
open question. [More profoundly, there are major differences in the
perception and prioritization of threats.]{.underline} [Central and
Eastern European states closest to Russia logically view it as the
biggest threat. From farther away, other problems loom larger. Germany
and Northern European countries worry about terrorism, France focuses on
extremism and unrest]{.underline} in former African colonies like Mali,
[while Greece and Italy are preoccupied by refugee policy and maritime
security in the Mediterranean.]{.underline} One might think that a major
geopolitical shock like the war in Ukraine would have allowed for a
Europe-wide "Zeitenwende": a moment to reckon with these difficult
questions and hammer out concessions that would allow progress to be
made. And in the early weeks of the war in Ukraine, many of these
divisions were indeed blotted out by shock and horror, with states
largely united in their response to the war. In the months since,
however, these [divisions have re-emerged, making themselves felt in new
ways.]{.underline} [Some countries --- particularly France, Italy and
Germany --- are talking about ways to find a peace settlement in
Ukraine, even as they continue to send weapons and funds. Yet polling in
Poland suggests that it will not countenance peace until Russia is
properly punished.]{.underline} The European Union, slowed by the need
to reach a consensus, has struggled to keep up. Its [much-anticipated
Strategic Compass,]{.underline} a strategy paper released after the war
started, is a buzzword-filled document that promises a "quantum leap
forward" in defense --- but [does little to address these divisions in
practice.]{.underline} In the absence of continental consensus, [the
glue that continues to hold together European security is the United
States]{.underline}. Since February, the trans-Atlantic relationship has
slid back into a comfortable groove: The United States provides
significant personnel and high-tech weaponry, [forestalling the need for
other NATO members to commit substantial resources or make tough choices
about joint defense.]{.underline} Politically, America's presence
reassures NATO members in Eastern Europe --- who have become painfully
aware since February that Western European states aren't as willing to
take a hard line on Russia --- while allowing Germany to lead Europe
without bearing too great a financial and military cost. [The underlying
disagreements haven't gone away.]{.underline} But for as long as
American troops and hardware are on the continent, [European states can
have their cake and eat it, too.]{.underline} It's understandable that
European leaders don't want to engage in punishing political fights at a
difficult time. And it is perhaps easy to assume, with 100,000 American
troops in Europe, that the U.S. commitment to European security is
inviolable. [Yet the Trump years should not be so easily forgotten.
America's commitment to Europe's defense, overseen by Mr. Biden, may
seem secure today. But with growing threats in Asia and turmoil in
America's domestic politics, it is most likely a matter of time before
that changes.]{.underline} [Should he return to the presidency, Mr.
Trump may well follow through on his threats to withdraw the United
States from NATO. Even some of his less extreme compatriots are
questioning America's role in European defense]{.underline}; in May, 11
Republican senators voted against sending further military aid to
Ukraine. [There is also a growing consensus in Washington that the
United States is urgently needed in the Indo-Pacific to handle the
threat from China. Even the best-case scenario --- an administration in
Washington that remains committed to Europe --- carries the risk that a
crisis elsewhere could result in a hurried retreat, leaving European
states high and dry.]{.underline} American and European leaders may well
spend the next days lauding the miraculous recovery of the
trans-Atlantic alliance. Yet far from a panacea, [America's support
amounts to a Band-Aid covering Europe's biggest disagreements on
defense.]{.underline} To be truly united, European leaders should start
the hard work of resolving these differences and rip off the Band-Aid.

Introduction The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began as an
alliance during the Cold War to oppose the Soviet Union. Despite the
fall of the USSR in 1991, [NATO's continuity has led to much debate
among scholars as to its purpose and relevance today.]{.underline} An
organization that started with only 12 member states, has grown to a
become a strong network of 30 members, with more states acting as
important global partners. [While NATO represents some of the biggest
western powers, it is also marked by operational failures and internal
disparities.]{.underline} Now the question for this research essay is:
[has NATO truly been a success?]{.underline} This question is worth
exploring from different angles. To find an answer, one must look at the
military interventions and activities that NATO has carried out since
1991. This paper will primarily look at NATO's three most significant
interventions in Kosovo, Libya, and Afghanistan. While two of these have
been successes in the larger picture, the large opportunity costs are
often overlooked. And that is what this piece seeks to explore. NATO:
Origins and Objectives While countering Soviet expansion is its main
goal, NATO member states have also highlighted two other priorities: (1)
revival of nationalist militarism in Europe through a strong North
American presence on the continent and (2) encouraging European
political integration. Communism was becoming a threat in Europe as
governments like that of the Czech Republic were overthrown by rebels.
Considering many factors, it was time for a more integrated and
like-minded organization of nations to uphold democratic values. The
North Atlantic Treaty was enforced in 1949 and mainly laid the
foundation for military and political cooperation between its member
states. A fundamental aspect of the treaty lies in Article 5, which
states that an attack against one member is an attack against all . But
NATO has also shown the same level of support for nations expressing
their desire to become member states. For instance, the 2022
Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen strong participation by NATO members as
Ukraine aspired to join it. Moreover, the conflict threatened the
stability of Europe as a whole, thereby prompting a response from NATO.
NATO's Operations: A List Marked By Failures? NATO has a long list of
military interventions in other states with hits and misses. This
section will look at four major NATO interventions and their
consequences. [The Yugoslavian Bombing, (1999)]{.underline} The conflict
in the Balkans worsened as Serbia increased its embargos on Kosovan
separatists and Albanian civilians. NATO established the Kosovo Force
(KFOR) in 1999 as a part of UNSC Resolution 1244 which mandated
international presence in the region to mitigate the conflict. As the
Yugoslavians resisted, [NATO carried out a 78-day air
bombing]{.underline}, formalizing the KFOR's entry into the region. [The
biggest debate here is whether NATO's actions were humane]{.underline}.
Although it achieved its larger goal of stopping Milosevic and
separating Kosovo (de facto), [the air bombing caused more than 500
civilian deaths. There was an exodus of refugees and the fundamental
pillars of the Responsibility to Protect were broken because the people
did not receive complete protection.]{.underline} Determining whether
NATO's actions in Kosovo were truly a success or failure depends on what
an individual considers more important: the ends or the means. However,
[in the 21st century, when international organizations are seen as
important bodies that represent major interests at a global level,
concerns must be solved through dialogue, with force only being used as
a last resort.]{.underline} [In that sense. NATO's mistakes in Kosovo
seem to overshadow its successes.]{.underline} [The War in Afghanistan,
(2001-2021)]{.underline} The intervention in Afghanistan is arguably one
of NATO's most important ones. After the 9/11 attacks, the US sent
forces to Afghanistan to capture Osama Bin Laden and bring the nation
back to democracy after five years of Taliban rule. The US, along with
its NATO allies, sent forces to Afghanistan under a UN Security Council
mandate. Despite fulfilling both goals of overthrowing the Taliban
regime and killing Bin Laden, NATO (primarily US) troops continued to
stay in Afghanistan till 2021. Interestingly, the US government
published an official document of a Congress hearing on 'The U.S.
Lessons Learned in Afghanistan', which entailed a list of its
intelligence and political failures that led to withdrawal. [Despite its
fragility, the only reason that the Afghan government was able to
sustain itself was because of the support of NATO forces. Things took a
turn for the worse when then-president Donald Trump signed an agreement
with the Taliban in 2020 to withdraw troops by 2021.]{.underline} While
Donald Trump's actions may be justified from a 'US national interest'
perspective, [the larger interests of the Afghan people were
compromised. American and NATO soldiers had indeed been there for twenty
years, only to be brought back during the country's toughest time. The
withdrawal of troops led to an immediate fall in the Ghani government
which had to concede defeat instantly. Despite twenty long years, one of
the most powerful alliances was brought down, leading to its NATO
biggest and most shocking security failure.]{.underline} [The
Intervention of Libya, (2011)]{.underline} While there is much debate on
whether the NATO intervention in Libya was a success, it is important
not just to look at the conflict itself, but its aftermath as well.
Muammar Gadaffi's Libya was an epicentre of tyranny and human rights
violations. As a part of the Responsibility to Protect, the
international community had to act. Once again, the result was the
victory of NATO forces and the fall of the Gadaffi regime. But [the
US-led NATO which was supposed to be a 'beacon' of democratic values,
was not entirely true to its purpose of protecting the civilian
population of Libya. While NATO's main target was the Gadaffi regime, it
did not emphasize enough combating rebel groups which were equally
dangerous.]{.underline} [Libyan rebel groups were responsible for many
civilian murders, robberies, and war crimes. The rebels even killed
civilians who merely supported the Gadaffi regime but did no
crime.]{.underline} As per the first pillar of the R2P, [protection
applies to the 'population' of a nation, which includes every individual
residing in the nation. The UN and NATO forces failed to protect a large
section of the population.]{.underline} Therefore, while NATO managed to
protect those fighting against Gadaffi, it still failed in other areas,
[leading to another civil war despite an end to Gadaffi's
regime.]{.underline}

BRUSSELS [[--- European governments]{.underline}]{.mark} may believe
Iran is to blame for the attacks this week on fuel tankers in the Gulf

administration and its [[hawkish policy]{.underline}]{.mark} toward

and "maximum restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}." [[Mindful

in the Middle East, but they are concerned by what they see as the Trump
administration's policy of "maximum pressure" on Iran --- thus their use
of maximum restraint. Many critics believe Mr. Trump is succeeding only
in creating maximum pressure among hard-line factions in Iran to respond
with carefully calibrated attacks that send a message, like those
against tankers in a vital passageway for global oil supplies. [[Germany
wants a careful investigation]{.underline}]{.mark} of the attacks,
insisting that "a spiral of escalation must be avoided." [[The

#### NATO securitization against China is a self-fulfilling prophesy -- leads to US-China war and extinction

But [the most dangerous novelty at the Madrid summit consists of a major
qualitative extension of NATO's purpose.]{.underline} Originally founded
as a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union and its subordinate
states, NATO has mutated after 1991 into a "security
organization"---meaning that it has been involved in military actions
(NATO as such did not formally engage in any war in the USSR's
days)---and redefined its purpose in ostracizing post-Soviet Russia by
expanding toward its borders. The NATO-Russia Council created in 1997
was a meager consolation given to Moscow in lieu of inviting it to join
the alliance. Nobody was fooled. From tacit, NATO's hostility to Russia
became explicit after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.
[The]{.underline} forthcoming [Madrid summit is going to directly
involve NATO in open hostility to China, far beyond the alliance's
original area of relevance.]{.underline} This area is defined in the
1949 treaty constitutive of NATO as comprising "the territory of any of
the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of
France, on the territory of or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of
any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of
Cancer." NATO's post-1991 mutation led it to intervene beyond its
members' territory---first in the Balkans, then much further from its
original area, in Afghanistan, in the wake of the September 11, 2001,
attacks. [Participation in the organization's meetings has]{.underline}
nevertheless [remained restricted to Europe and North America. No
longer. Japan, along with Australia, New Zealand and South Korea have
been invited to attend the Madrid summit as NATO "partners" in the
Asia-Pacific region---a very serious provocation to Beijing. It can only
interpret this invitation as a step toward the consolidation of US-led
alliances in a single global network opposed to both Russia and
China.]{.underline} After the preliminary meeting of NATO's defense
ministers held on June 16, the organization's secretary general, Jens
Stoltenberg, declared that [the new NATO Strategic Concept that will be
adopted at the Madrid summit will set out the alliance's position "on
Russia, on emerging challenges, and for the first time, on
China.]{.underline}" From the perspective of [Washington's drive to
perpetuate its hegemony over most of Europe and the Asia Pacific by
portraying Russia and China as enemies]{.underline}---a grand strategy
that has been followed by all successive post-1991 US
administrations---the new escalation to be confirmed in Madrid makes
full sense. While resolutely supporting Ukraine's resistance to the
Russian invasion, [President Biden has multiplied provocative gestures
toward Beijing, including his statement, prior to a summit meeting in
May of the anti-China alliance known as the Quad (Japan, Australia, and
India along with the United States), that the United States would defend
Taiwan militarily.]{.underline} The statement was quickly watered down
by the State Department, which had in May removed from a Taiwan Fact
Sheet on its website the statement "we do not support Taiwan
independence" and reinstated it in June. From the perspective of Europe
and the Asia Pacific, [acquiescing to this de facto extension of NATO's
role is equivalent to being herded like Panurge's sheep toward throwing
themselves into the sea. Antagonizing China is not in Europe's interest,
nor is it in the interest of any of the states invited to the Madrid
summit. Even if the European governments believed that Russia has now
irreversibly become a threat to their security, it would be utterly
counterproductive for them to push Beijing toward consolidating an
alliance with Moscow.]{.underline} [These developments bring the world
closer to a conflagration that **could dwarf the ongoing war in Ukraine
and endanger the future of humankind.**]{.underline} It is urgent to
rebuild a global peace movement opposed to all military alliances,
demanding their dissolution, a movement opposed as well to the ongoing
massive increases in military budgets. It is high time to return to
global disarmament under the aegis of the UN, as foreseen in the UN
Charter. This charter is the cornerstone of international law whose role
must be renewed against the ongoing drift toward the law of the jungle.
The huge and ever-growing amounts that are spent on armament and
destruction would be wisely reallocated to the only wars that are truly
in humanity's interest: the wars against poverty and climate change.‌

#### No SCS escalation - nukes, interdependence, and power disparity

However, the analogy mismatches international hierarchy and regime type.
In classical times, the incumbent land power, Sparta, was the
authoritarian power who feared the rise of the democratic maritime
power, Athens.3 This incongruity is not even the biggest problem with
the analogy. **[[In order for the Thucydides Trap to apply, China would
have to significantly narrow the power gap]{.mark} with the United
States]{.underline}**. While **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** has caught
up with the United States in important respects, it **[[has not caught
up]{.mark} with the United States [in terms of]{.mark} the logic and

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[China-U.S.
[rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}** **[[is]{.mark} certainly
[growing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[but [war is]{.mark} still some [way
off]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[There are]{.mark}]{.underline}** several
**[[maritime encounters]{.mark} between the two sides every
day]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** [**[thousands]{.underline}**
**[every year]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[[Most]{.mark} of them [are
professional]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[safe]{.underline}**]{.mark}; only a few have involved some risks. The
recent pandemic has made both countries and militaries more sensitive,
which, to some extent, has heightened the tension of the situation.

Because of COVID-19, China and the United States are more concerned and
anxious about each other. In addition to maintaining daily operations in
the western Pacific, both sides have some new worries. The United States
is concerned that China would take advantage of the temporary power
vacuum; thus it has deliberately shown more force and given China more
diplomatic pressure. **[China]{.underline}** **[feels]{.underline}**
that **[Washington's]{.underline}** South China Sea **[policy
is]{.underline}** increasingly desperate to the point that, even during
the pandemic, the United States has not forgotten **[to]{.underline}**
**[provoke]{.underline}** **[China]{.underline}**. Beijing is also
convinced that the U.S., motivated by power competition, is focusing on
China's activities and ignoring the actions of other claimants.

**[From mid-April to early May]{.underline}**[,
**[the]{.underline}**]{.mark} U.S. **[[Navy dispatched]{.mark} several
[warships]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including USS America LHA-6, to the
so-called standoff area between the Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the West Capella
**[[to deter]{.underline}]{.mark}** China's
**[operations]{.underline}**. **[The PLA Navy]{.underline}** was
**[believed to have a similar number of warships]{.underline}** there at
the same time, **[which aroused]{.underline}** **[heated
discussion]{.underline}** **[among the media and experts.]{.underline}**
Another less publicized but more intense case was the reconnaissance and
counter-reconnaissance of China's aircraft carrier Liaoning formation
when it was conducting open sea cross-region mobile training while
followed by American warships and multiple military aircraft. An
anonymous PLA Navy officer revealed that the confrontation was so
intense that one U.S. warship even once came within 100 meters of the
Chinese carrier.

[**[Even so]{.underline}**, **[both]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[sides]{.underline}** have **[[remained]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[largely [professional]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[restrained]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In fact, **[[neither the
Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** military **[[nor the American military
has increased]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[activity]{.mark}
[significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[compared]{.underline}** **[with
the same period of 2019]{.underline}**, **[[despite]{.mark} the
impression]{.underline}** **[given by most media reports]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[expert
[commentaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

The problem is that these operations are over-exposed and over-focused.
**[In the backdrop of]{.underline}** **[power
competition]{.underline}**, **[especially amid the
pandemic]{.underline}**, in order to show their strength and
determination, U.S. **[forces have given]{.underline}** **[undue
prominence]{.underline}** **[to covering and publicizing]{.underline}**
**[military activities]{.underline}**, giving the media and the public a
lot to discuss and imagine. There are some hawks in both countries who
take advantage of this and exaggerate the situation. Although most
countries including the South China Sea claimants, do not want to see
China-U.S. military conflict, some individual countries are indeed
rejoicing over the growing competition between China and the United
States, which may lead to some opportunity for them to expand.
China-U.S. military confrontation or even war in the South China Sea has
a huge market.

**[[China and the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[are]{.underline}**,]{.mark} of course, **[[preparing for]{.mark} any
kind of]{.underline}** military **[conflict]{.underline}** and the
**[[worst scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the South China Sea;
[**[however]{.underline}**, **[there is no]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[indication]{.mark} that [the two]{.mark} sides [want to
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}** their [**[contradictions]{.underline}**
**[by using force]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[strategically or
[operationally]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[[despite
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** repeated **[war
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}** from some senior American officials.
**[[In daily]{.mark} military [interactions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[there are]{.mark} really increasing [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[but]{.underline}** **[in the absence of a subjective desire for
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [**[these risks are]{.underline}**
**[highly]{.underline}**]{.mark} likely to be
**[[controlled]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The most important thing for the Chinese and American militaries to
prevent is miscalculation, considering the relatively backward or
ineffective crisis management mechanisms of the two countries even
compared with Soviet-U.S. and then Russia-U.S. military relations.

In addition, we need to let professionals do their work. The China-U.S.
military rivalry has been unduly influenced by the media, commentators,
and some politicians, which amplifies the intensity of the competition
and is likely to lead to self-fulfilling prophecies.

Both Chinese and the U.S. militaries need to remain competitive and
professional, keeping politics and public opinion in check. After all,
**[if there were to be war]{.underline}**, **[it would be the front-line
commanders]{.underline}** and sailors **[who bear the brunt of
it;]{.underline}** **[others would be mere bystanders]{.underline}**.

#### Won't escalate channeled into diplomatic proxy conflicts instead

**Tierney 21** -- Dominic, a professor of political science, a senior
fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. "The Future of
Sino-U.S. Proxy War", Texas National Security Review, Vol. 4, Issue 2,
<https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/86247>, xx-xx-2021

Strategic doctrine in both the United States and China has downplayed
the possibility of a clash in a foreign internal conflict and in the
U.S. case in particular, focused on the potential for a conventional
interstate war. However, **[[the odds that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark} will [engage in an interstate war are
extremely low]{.mark}]{.underline}** due to a number of factors,
including nuclear deterrence, regime type, trade relations between the
two countries, and international institutions. **[[Military]{.mark}
[competition is much more likely to take the form of a proxy war]{.mark}
in [which]{.mark} Washington and Beijing aid different actors in an
intrastate conflict because of a systemwide shift away from interstate
war]{.underline}** and toward civil war, continued American
hyper-interventionism, and growing Chinese interventionism. In the
coming years, internal conflicts in countries like Venezuela, Pakistan,
Myanmar, or North Korea could become battlegrounds for great-power
rivalry. **[Such U.S.-Chinese proxy wars [will]{.mark} likely
[be]{.mark} much [subtler]{.mark} than the heavy-handed proxy conflicts
of the Cold War]{.underline}** **[[and involve diplomatic
initiatives]{.mark}, economic aid, cyber war, propaganda, and
competition within international institutions]{.underline}**. Indeed,
Washington and Beijing may compartmentalize a particular proxy campaign
--- sparring in one civil war while steering clear of each other or even
cooperating in another internal conflict. U.S. analysts often
characterize the global system in terms of a shift from the
counter-terrorism paradigm of the post-9/11 era, which was focused on
insecure states and nonstate actors, to the great-power competition
paradigm of today's era, which prioritizes U.S. relations with China and
Russia. However, these two paradigms are less distinct than sometimes
thought: Future great-power competition, like earlier counter-terrorism
efforts, may occur within insecure states and feature alliances with
nonstate actors. **[[The question remains whether a Sino-U.S. proxy war
could spiral into an interstate war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The
[barriers]{.mark} to direct hostilities [make this outcome
unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but proxy conflicts could still
escalate in unexpected and costly ways. The United States and China may
try to manipulate civil wars in far-flung lands they do not understand.
Washington has a history of wading into strife-torn countries, like
Afghanistan and Iraq, with alien cultures and languages, leading to
strategic failure. Beijing is even less prepared to comprehend or shape
the contours of foreign civil wars due to a lack of capabilities and
experience. Because of the psychological dynamic of loss aversion, these
two great powers may be willing to ratchet up their commitment in a
given proxy war to avoid the defeat of a favored actor. In addition,
local surrogates could act independently in ways that might escalate a
conflict.
