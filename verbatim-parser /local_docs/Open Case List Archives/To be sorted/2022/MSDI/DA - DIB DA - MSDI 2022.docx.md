[[The US]{.mark} aerospace and [defense market is projected to
grow]{.mark}]{.underline} from USD 416.63 billion in 2020 [[to USD
550.78 billion]{.mark}, registering a CAGR of around 2.37%
[during]{.mark}]{.underline} the forecast period
[[(2021-2030).]{.underline}]{.mark} The US aerospace and defense sector
is undergoing an unprecedented disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the sector is projected to recover in 2021, the recovery is
expected to be uneven across the two constituent sectors. For instance,
the commercial aerospace sector has been significantly affected by the
pandemic, resulting in a drastic reduction in passenger traffic, which,
in turn, has negatively affected aircraft demand. As a result, the
commercial aerospace sector is expected to recover slowly, as travel
demand is projected to normalize to pre-COVID levels by 2023. However,
**[[the defense sector is expected to remain stable and even grow as the
United States has not reduced its defense budget and remains committed
to sustaining its military capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Nevertheless, [due to the widespread disruption in the supply chain,
some defense programs may face minor cost escalations and delays in the
short term.]{.underline} The US aerospace and defense sector is one of
the largest, globally, in terms of infrastructure and manufacturing
activities. In 2019, the total industry sales revenue left a significant
footprint on the American economy, contributing to a combined economic
value of USD 396 billion, representing 1.8% of the nation's GDP. The
market is primarily driven by investments in the A&D sector and is
supported by the rising demand for the products of the A&D sector by
both commercial and military end-users. The market is also bolstered by
the presence of leading industry incumbents in the US, whose
manufacturing and R&D capabilities support the growth of the industry.
Scope of the Report The study provides an in-depth analysis of the
aerospace and defense industry in the United States. The scope of the
study encompasses the commercial and military applications of all aerial
assets. Besides, the study also accounts for the developments in the
industry pertaining to critical systems and components of aircraft,
UAVs, and satellites. For each segment, the market sizing and forecasts
have been done based on value (USD billion). [Key Market
Trends]{.underline} Enhanced Defense Spending Promoting R&D and
Manufacturing **[The United States is ranked as the world's leading
defense manufacturer and exporter]{.underline}**. According to SIPRI,
the [[US defense expenditure grew by 5.3%]{.underline}]{.mark} to amount
to **[USD 732 billion]{.underline}** in 2019, which is [around 38% of
the global defense expenditure]{.underline}. The US Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) increased by USD 15 billion to reach USD 83.5 billion during
FY2020. Besides, the US is one of the world's largest FDI investors and
the leading beneficiary of FDIs. In 2018, FDIs in the US aerospace
industry totaled nearly USD 22 billion. [This resulted in a significant
upgrade of the manufacturing capabilities of key industry incumbents in
the US]{.underline}. For instance, in January 2019, Airbus initiated the
construction of its A220 Manufacturing Facility in Alabama. Similarly,
in September 2018, Planet Labs Inc. invested around USD 183 million to
open a 27,000-square-foot new satellite manufacturing and testing
facility in San Francisco. In 2020, Lockheed Martin completed the
construction of its USD 350 million satellite manufacturing facility,
located at the company\'s Waterton Canyon campus near Denver. **[[As the

[[Many groups have started movements to ban lethal autonomous
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}---autonomous robotics systems that can
independently identify and engage targets based on programmed
constraints---[due to fears]{.underline} that they will lead to armed
conflict on a scale greater and faster than ever before. For example,
116 founders of mostly small robotics and AI companies, including Elon
Musk, signed a letter to the United Nations (UN) in 2017 that urges the
body to ban lethal autonomous weapons.36 In 2018, the UN
Secretary-General António Guterres stated that "machines that have the
power and the discretion to take human lives are politically
unacceptable, are morally repugnant, and should be banned by
international law."37 Also in 2018, members of the European Parliament
adopted a resolution asking member states and the European Council for
"the start of international negotiations on a legally binding instrument
prohibiting lethal autonomous weapons systems."38 [[If policymakers
enacted such a ban, it would slow research into AI, as historically, at
least in the United States, defense agencies have been a source of
significant funding for technology advancement, such as the
Internet]{.mark}. And [much of the research to support autonomous
weapons would yield dual-use technology that could be used for
commercial purposes. For example, a fully autonomous tank will likely
rely on large portions of the same algorithms and data used to develop a
fully autonomous military transport vehicle]{.mark}.39 [These same
algorithms would be relevant to developing autonomous vehicles for
civilian use.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Cut By: m.jam

[The impacts of an [eroding domestic manufacturing base]{.mark} [on
national security]{.mark} largely stem from the military's growing
reliance on commercial cutting-edge technology since the
1980s.]{.underline} There are reasonable doubts that military technology
still lags commercial technologies in all areas, as it generally did
during the 1980s and 1990s. Starting in those years, and continuing into
the present, defense procurement policy has put an emphasis on promoting
greater civilian-military integration, and encouraging agencies and
their contractors to purchase commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and
"dual-use" technology products. The rationale is that drawing on the
often more innovative civilian sector not only would yield more
up-to-date products but also big cost savings. Many, if not most,
"dual-use" contractors and suppliers try to separate their defense and
commercial businesses, in large part to avoid the bureaucratic drag of
defense procurement requirements on their commercial work[.
[Nevertheless, the ability of a firm to design, innovate, and improve on
defense-critical technologies or devices that it produces for defense
markets, increasingly depends on its ability to preserve and draw upon
the technological edge it has obtained in its commercial
business]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} As military products become
more reliant on commercial advanced technologies, technology transfer
from commercial technologies into defense-critical products requires a
close relationship between the Pentagon or defense contractor customer
and the suppliers of these technologies. However, as the commercial base
upon which the defense sector relies for most of its components and
subsystems globalizes, integrating commercial technology into defense
systems becomes more difficult to achieve. [That is, the [loss of
production facilities can lead to the loss of innovation capabilities,
which would dangerously undermine the nation's ability to maintain a
strong defense base.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Specifically, [the migration of manufacturing]{.mark} offshore [is
associated with]{.mark} the following trends: ♣ [Weakening innovation
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} of domestic industrial sectors; ♣
[[The transfer]{.underline}]{.mark}---deliberate and unwitting---[[of
cutting-edge technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} and know-how to economic

#### Hegemony is empirically the most stable system and deters all conflict -- decline causes transition wars

Robert **Kagan, 17**, 2-7-2017, Backing Into World War III,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/06/backing-into-world-war-iii-russia-china-trump-obama/,
Robert Kagan, Ph.D. in American History from American University, M.P.P.

[Think of two significant trend lines in the world today. One is the
increasing ambition and activism of the two great **revisionist powers,
Russia and China**. The other is the declining confidence, capacity, and
will of the democratic world, and especially of the United States, to
maintain the dominant position it has held in the international system
since 1945]{.underline}. As those two lines move closer, [[as the
declining]{.mark} will and [capacity of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies to maintain the present world order
meet]{.mark} the increasing desire and capacity of the [revisionist
powers]{.mark} to change it, we will reach the moment at which [the
existing order collapses]{.mark} and the world descends [into]{.mark} a
phase of **[brutal anarchy]{.mark}**, as it has three times in the past
two centuries. The cost of that descent, in lives and treasure, in lost
freedoms and lost hope, will be staggering.]{.underline} Americans tend
to take the fundamental stability of the international order for
granted, even while complaining about the burden the United States
carries in preserving that stability. History shows that [[world orders
do collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, and [when they do [it
is]{.mark} often **[unexpected, rapid, and
violent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The late 18th century was the high point
of the Enlightenment in Europe, before the continent fell suddenly into
the abyss of the Napoleonic Wars. [[In the first decade of the 20th
century]{.mark}, [**the world's smartest minds predicted an end** to
great-power conflict]{.mark} as revolutions in communication and
transportation knit economies and people closer together. [The most
devastating war]{.mark} in history [came four years
later]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The apparent calm of the postwar
1920s became the crisis-ridden 1930s and then another world war. Where
exactly we are in this classic scenario today, how close the trend lines
are to that intersection point is, as always, impossible to know. Are we
three years away from a global crisis, or 15? [That [we are]{.mark}
somewhere [on that path]{.mark}, however, is unmistakable.]{.underline}
And while it is too soon to know what effect Donald Trump's presidency
will have on these trends, early signs suggest that the new
administration is more likely to hasten us toward crisis than slow or
reverse these trends. The further accommodation of Russia can only
embolden Vladimir Putin, and the tough talk with China will likely lead
Beijing to test the new administration's resolve militarily. Whether the
president is ready for such a confrontation is entirely unclear. For the
moment, he seems not to have thought much about the future ramifications
of his rhetoric and his actions. [[China and Russia are **classic
revisionist powers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although both have never
enjoyed greater security from foreign powers than they do today ---
Russia from its traditional enemies to the west, China from its
traditional enemy in the east --- [they are [dissatisfied with
the]{.mark} current [global configuration of power. Both seek to
restore]{.mark} the [hegemonic dominance]{.mark} they once enjoyed in
their respective regions. [For]{.mark} [China, that means **dominance of
East Asia**]{.mark}, with countries like [Japan, South Korea]{.mark},
and the nations of Southeast Asia both acquiescing to Beijing's will and
acting in conformity with China's strategic, economic, and political
preferences.]{.underline} That includes American influence withdrawn to
the eastern Pacific, behind the Hawaiian Islands. [[For Russia, it
means]{.mark} **hegemonic influence in [Central and Eastern
Europe]{.mark}** and Central Asia, which Moscow has traditionally
regarded as either part of its empire or part of its sphere of
influence. Both Beijing and Moscow seek to redress what they regard as
an unfair distribution of power]{.underline}, influence, and honor [in
the U.S.-led postwar global order.]{.underline} As autocracies, [both
feel threatened by the dominant democratic powers in the international
system]{.underline} and by the democracies on their borders. Both regard
the United States as the principal obstacle to their ambitions, and
therefore [b[oth **seek to weaken** the American-led]{.mark}
international security [order]{.mark} that stands in the way of their
achieving what they regard as their rightful destinies.]{.underline} It
was good while it lasted [Until fairly recently, Russia and China have
faced considerable, almost insuperable, obstacles in achieving their
objectives. The chief obstacle has been the power and coherence of the
international order itself and its principal promoter and defender. The
American-led system of political and military alliances, especially in
the two critical regions of Europe and East Asia, has presented China
and Russia with what Dean Acheson once referred to as "situations of
strength" that have required them to pursue their ambitions cautiously
and, since the end of the Cold War, to defer serious efforts to disrupt
the international system. [The system has checked their
ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline} in both positive and negative ways.
[[During]{.mark} the era of [American primacy, China and Russia
have]{.mark} [participated in and]{.mark} for the most part [been
beneficiaries of the open **international economic system** the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [created]{.mark} and helps sustain; [so
long as that system functions, **they have**]{.mark} **had [more to gain
by playing in it ]{.mark}**[than by]{.mark} challenging and [overturning
it.]{.mark}]{.underline} The political and strategic aspects of the
order, however, have worked to their detriment. The growth and vibrancy
of democratic government in the two decades following the collapse of
Soviet communism posed a continual threat to the ability of rulers in
Beijing and Moscow to maintain control, and since the end of the Cold
War they have regarded every advance of democratic institutions ---
especially the geographical advance of liberal democracies close to
their borders --- as an existential threat. That's for good reason:
Autocratic powers since the days of Klemens von Metternich have always
feared the contagion of liberalism. The mere existence of democracies on
their borders, the global free flow of information they cannot control,
the dangerous connection between free market capitalism and political
freedom --- all pose a threat to rulers who depend on keeping restive
forces in their own countries in check. The continual challenge to the
legitimacy of their rule posed by the U.S.-supported democratic order
has therefore naturally made them hostile both to that order and to the
United States. But, until recently[, a preponderance of domestic and
international forces has dissuaded them from confronting the order
directly. Chinese rulers have had to worry about what an unsuccessful
confrontation with the United States might do to their legitimacy at
home]{.underline}. Even [Putin has pushed only against open doors, as in
Syria, where the United States responded passively to his probes. He has
been more cautious when confronted by even marginal U.S. and European
opposition, as in Ukraine. [The greatest check]{.mark} on Chinese and
Russian ambitions [has been]{.mark} the [military and **economic power**
of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies in Europe and Asia.
[China]{.mark}, although increasingly powerful, [has had to contemplate
facing the]{.mark} combined [military and economic strength of]{.mark}
[the world's superpower]{.mark} and some very formidable regional powers
linked by alliance or common strategic interest --- including Japan,
India, and South Korea]{.underline}, as well as smaller but still potent
nations like Vietnam and Australia. [Russia has had to face the United
States and its NATO allies. When united, these U.S.-led alliances
present a daunting challenge to a revisionist power that can call on few
allies of its own for assistance]{.underline}. Even [were the Chinese to
score an early victory in a conflict, such as the military subjection of
Taiwan or a naval battle in the South or East China Sea, [they would
have to contend]{.mark} over time [with the]{.mark} **combined
industrial productive capacities** of some of the world's **[richest and
most technologically advanced nations]{.mark}** and the likely cutoff of
access to foreign markets on which their own economy
depends.]{.underline} A weaker Russia, with its depleted population and
oil- and gas-dependent economy, would face an even greater challenge.
For decades, [[the strong global position enjoyed by the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies has **discouraged any serious
challenge**]{.mark}. So long as the United States was perceived as a
dependable ally, [Chinese and Russian leaders feared that aggressive
moves would backfire]{.mark} and possibly bring their regimes
down.]{.underline} This is what the political scientist William
Wohlforth once described as the inherent stability of the unipolar
order: As [dissatisfied regional powers sought to challenge the status
quo, their alarmed neighbors turned to the distant American superpower
to contain their ambitions. And it worked. The United States stepped up,
and Russia and China largely backed down]{.underline} --- or were
preempted before acting at all. Faced with these obstacles, [the best
option for the two revisionist great powers has always been to hope for
or, if possible, engineer a weakening of the U.S.-supported world order
from within, either by separating the United States from its allies or
by raising doubts about the U.S. commitment]{.underline} and thereby
encouraging would-be allies and partners to forgo the strategic
protection of the liberal world order and seek accommodation with its
challengers. [[The present system has]{.mark} therefore
[depended]{.mark} **not only [on American power]{.mark} but on
[coherence and unity]{.mark}** at the heart of the democratic world.
[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has had to play its part as the
principal guarantor of the order]{.mark}, especially in the military and
strategic realm, but [the order's]{.mark} ideological and **[economic
core]{.mark}** --- the democracies of Europe and East Asia and the
Pacific --- [has]{.mark} also [had to remain]{.mark} relatively
[healthy]{.mark} and confident.]{.underline}

#### The Defense Industrial Base is stable and doing well now

**US Department of Defense. 2022**. DEPARTMENT of DEFENSE REPORT State
of Competition within the Defense Industrial Base.
media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/15/2002939087/-1/-1/1/STATE-OF-COMPETITION-WITHIN-THE-DEFENSE-INDUSTRIAL-BASE.PDF.

DoD tracks competition by obligations and contract actions based on data
from the Federal Procurement Data System---Next Generation (FPDS-NG).
The FPDS-NG competition report measures competition and fair opportunity
at the contract and order level. The competition rate is calculated as
either the dollars obligated for competitive contracts (i.e., two or
more offerors) divided by the total dollars obligated, or the number of
contract actions for competitive contracts divided by the total number
of contract actions. The competition rate varies depending upon the
mission and type of product or service being procured. Competition rates
also differ greatly depending on whether the calculation uses
obligations or contract actions. The DoD competition rate based on
dollars obligated is typically in the 50-60% range; if based on the
number of contract actions, the competition rate would be consistently
in the 90% range. [[The competitive environment for the DIB remained
relatively stable over the past several years. Over the past ten years,
DoD has seen total dollars obligated vary from a high of \$420
billion]{.underline}]{.mark} in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 to a low of \$273
billion in FY 2015. During that time, [[the competition rates ranged
from a high of 58.3%]{.underline}]{.mark} in FY 2014 [[to
50.1%]{.underline}]{.mark} in FY 2020, and projected at 52% for FY 2021,
for a ten-year average of 54.2%. Figure 1 displays the ten-year trend
for competitive and non-competitive dollars obligated, [with the peak of
\$420B total dollars obligated in FY 2020]{.mark} due to increased
obligations for COVID-19 related actions. To help improve its tracking
of competition within the DIB, DoD developed a Procurement Business
Intelligence Service Competition Analysis Scorecard to report
competition rates at the 3 Obligations refers to the funds reserved in
the accounting system upon contract award. Those dollars are obligated
under the contract for expenditure. 57.1% 56.7% 58.3% 55.4% 52.8% 52.0%

2019 2020 2021 Billions Total Competed (\$B) Total Not Competed (\$B)
Competition Rate (%) Fiscal Year 4 product service code and broader
portfolio group levels.4 The competition scorecard provides
dashboard-like presentations to help components track and analyze
competition trends in portfolio groups for major weapon system platforms
(e.g., aircraft, ships, and land vehicles), electronic and
communications equipment, and their associated sustainment phases.
Historically, these portfolio groups report competition rates in the
15--40% range for dollars obligated, which has a significant impact on
DoD's overall competition rate since these weapon systems and major
equipment account for a sizeable portion of the total dollars obligated.
The competition scorecards provide management-level reports and tools to
enable informed business decisions that support procurement policies
with the goal of improving competition in the DoD supply chain and
industrial base. Similarly, securing competition varies widely based
upon the mission and type of product or service being procured.
Generally, those contracting organizations supporting installation-level
mission support and logistical requirements (e.g., food service,
facility maintenance, grounds maintenance, transportation services)
and/or depot-level maintenance services requirements (e.g., contractor
logistics support for spare parts) have multiple potential suppliers
resulting in very high competition rates. This is also true for
contracting organizations heavily involved in services, commercial
products, and construction. The competitive percentages are lower in
organizations that procure major systems (e.g., weapons, automated
information systems), specialized equipment, spares (especially on aging
weapon systems), and upgrades that may need to be purchased from the
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or supplier. These programs can
require sole-source extensions of contracts that were originally
competed because the programs have moved past the stage in their
lifecycle where competition is economically viable. These sole-source
transactions are made in accordance with statutory requirements that
authorize dealing with only one source.

[[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} and pundits [[debated this week as to
whether it was practical to send Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} armed
Predator [[drones as part of a \$40 billion aid
package]{.underline}]{.mark}. Sharapov and Karpenko said such technology
may give Ukraine what it needs to gain an advantage in the war. The
interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Our readers are about
1,800 corporate members of the defense industrial base in the United
States. What message do you have for them? And what do you need from
them urgently? *Sharapov:* The \[Ministry of Defense\] is concentrating
currently on fulfilling all the needs of the armed forces. You asked a
question about needs. First, you have to understand that the frontline
is 2,500 kilometers long. The frontline where there is active combat in
more than 1,000 kilometers long. That's like from Kyiv to Berlin. ... As
of today, all the people in all of our armed forces and within the
defense and security sector is up to one million people. And we have to
support them all. We have to supply them with small arms, with personal
protection gear and with the means of communication. And of course, to
carry out a war in this day and age, we need heavy weapons --- that's
primarily artillery systems. As of today, our need for heavy artillery
systems is measured by hundreds. That's why we also need a huge number
of rounds for these artillery systems.

Cut By: m.jam

[[Artificial intelligence]{.mark} (AI) [has the potential to deliver
significant social and economic benefits, including reducing accidental
deaths and injuries, making new scientific discoveries, and increasing
productivity]{.mark}.\[1\] [However, an increasing number of
activists]{.mark}, scholars, and pundits [see]{.mark} [AI as inherently
risky]{.mark}]{.underline}, creating substantial negative impacts such
as eliminating jobs, eroding personal liberties, and reducing human
intelligence.\[2\] Some even see AI as dehumanizing, dystopian, and a
threat to humanity.\[3\] As such, the world is dividing into two camps
regarding AI: those who support the technology and those who oppose it.
Unfortunately, the latter camp is increasingly dominating AI
discussions, not just in the United States, but in many nations around
the world. There should be no doubt that nations that tilt toward fear
rather than optimism are more likely to put in place policies and
practices that limit AI development and adoption, which will hurt their
economic growth, social progress, and global competitiveness.

While some people advocate for an almost completely hands-off approach
to regulating new technologies, those who recognize that there is a
legitimate role for government take two distinct approaches toward
action: the precautionary principle and the innovation principle.

The precautionary principle is [t]{.mark}he idea that if a technological
innovation may carry a risk of harming the public or the environment,
then those proposing the technology should bear the burden of proving it
will not. If they cannot, governments should limit the use of the new
technology until proven safe. Those who support the precautionary
principle, which calls for government intervention even when there is no
clear evidence of tangible and imminent threats of harm, adhere to the
cliché it is "better to be safe than sorry."4 For some technologies,
such as nuclear power, the principle makes sense, because the risk of
getting it wrong can be catastrophic. However, for most areas of
innovation, the precautionary principle leads to more harm than good
because it generates hypothetical worst-case scenarios that incorrectly
suggest technological advancement presents severe and irreversible
threats.5

[In contrast, [the innovation principle holds that because the
overwhelming majority of technological innovations benefit
society]{.mark} and pose modest and not irreversible risks,
[government's role should be to pave the way for widespread
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline} while building guardrails, where
necessary, to limit harms. The innovation principle recognizes that
market forces, tort law, existing laws and regulations, or light-touch
targeted interventions can usually manage the risks new technologies
pose[. [The principle does not, however, argue for a ban on regulation
of new technologies.]{.mark} Instead, [it advocates for a case-by-case
approach]{.mark},]{.underline} suggesting regulations only in those
cases where there is a reasonable expectation that other forces will not
suffice and where the potential harms are more than minor. Moreover, in
cases where regulations are needed, it stresses the importance of
designing regulatory interventions and structuring regulatory
enforcement in ways that minimize the harm to innovation, while still
achieving the regulatory goals. Finally, it focuses more on ensuring
that penalties punish bad actors who cause harm than creating
regulations that limit beneficial and benign uses.6 In other words,
speculative concerns should not hold back concrete benefits.

[[Perhaps more so than any government, the U.S. federal government
adhered to the innovation principle in its early regulation of the
Internet, and this approach fostered a successful era of innovation and
growth in the U.S. digital economy]{.mark}.7 In contrast, Europe's more
heavy-handed approach limited and continues to limit digital innovation.
For example, many jurisdictions in Europe have restricted the use of
ride-sharing apps like Uber because of concerns about the impact on the
local taxi industry.8]{.underline}

[The prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, the growing
centrality of information warfare, and threats to traditional command
and control are redefining combat in the age of strategic competition.
[Amidst debates on the use of lethal autonomous weapon systems]{.mark}
(LAWS) [and pressure to modernize U.S. defense capabilities, what steps
must the United States take to maintain its military advantage? CNAS
experts are sharpening the conversation]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about the
deployment of autonomous weapons and other defense technologies to
enhance U.S. military readiness.]{.underline}]{.mark} Continue reading
this edition of Sharper to explore their ideas and recommendations.
[[Gaining an advantage in managing information and exercising command is
a precondition of victory in warfare]{.mark}. This necessity has become
even more acute as military organizations have integrated information
technology into their forces and operations.]{.underline} The Pentagon's
belated response to these strategies appears overly technological and
unrealistically fixated on regaining the kind of information dominance
that the U.S. armed forces enjoyed in the aftermath of the Cold War. A
new CNAS report by [[Chris Dougherty examines how]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
Department of Defense ([DoD]{.mark}) [can embrace, rather than fight
against, the changes in the character of warfare and learn to thrive
within its chaos in ways that China and Russia may be unable to
match.]{.mark}]{.underline} In recent years, the machine learning
revolution has sparked a wave of interest in AI applications across a
range of industries. Nations are also mobilizing to use AI for national
security and military purposes, write Paul Scharre and Michael Horowitz.
It is therefore vital to assess how the militarization of AI could
affect international stability and how to encourage militaries to adopt
AI in a responsible manner. Doing so requires understanding the features
of AI, the ways it could shape warfare, and the risks to international
stability resulting from the militarization of artificial intelligence.
[[America's future leadership in the world and on the battlefield will
be dependent on its ingenuity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, while America
remains the world's leader in technology, its relative advantage wanes,
argues Mikhail Grinberg in a CNAS policy brief. Future military
operating environments will require technology from more diverse sources
and business models that enable faster innovation cycles. Grinberg
concludes that the superiority of next-generation weapon systems will be
derived from progress in science, and the next National Defense Strategy
needs to help the nation prioritize basic research as a source of
competitive advantage. [An international debate over lethal autonomous
weapon systems (LAWS) has been under way for nearly a decade. A new CNAS
report by author Robert O. Work offers seven new principles that
concentrate on the responsible use of autonomous functionalities in
armed conflict in ways that preserve human judgment and responsibility
over the use of force, and help minimize the probability of loss of
control of the system or unintended engagements.]{.underline} Michèle
Flournoy and Gabrielle Chefitz argue in a CNAS policy brief that [[the
United States is losing its military technological advantage vis-à-vis
great-power competitors such as China, and reversing this trend must
b]{.mark}e DoD leadership's [top priority]{.mark}. Doing so [will
require focused]{.mark} and empowered leadership, increased
[investment]{.mark} in the development of new [concepts]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} capabilities, new pathways and incentives for promising
prototypes to bridge the "valley of death" into production, a
willingness to make hard program and budget choices, [the development of
a more tech-savvy workforce, and greater partnership with Congress to
pursue these goals together.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"The Proper Governance Default for AI,"

Cut By: m.jam

[[The precautionary principle holds that innovations are to be curtailed
or potentially even disallowed until the creators]{.mark} of those new
technologies can [prove]{.mark} that [they will not cause any
theoretical harms.]{.mark}]{.underline} The classic formulation of the
precautionary principle can be found in the "Wingspan Statement," which
was formulated at an academic conference that took place at the
Wingspread Conference Center in Wisconsin in 1998. It read: "Where an
activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health,
precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect
relationships are not fully established
scientifically."[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@AdamThierer/the-proper-governance-default-for-ai-d05db6970924#_ftn2) There
have been many reformulations of the precautionary principle over time
but, as legal scholar Cass Sunstein has noted, "in all of them, the
animating idea is that regulators should take steps to protect against
potential harms, even if causal chains are unclear and even if we do not
know that those harms will come to
fruition."[\[3\]](https://medium.com/@AdamThierer/the-proper-governance-default-for-ai-d05db6970924#_ftn3) Put
simply, under almost all varieties of the precautionary principle,
innovation is treated as "guilty until proven
innocent."[\[4\]](https://medium.com/@AdamThierer/the-proper-governance-default-for-ai-d05db6970924#_ftn4) We
can also think of this as permissioned innovation.

The logic animating the precautionary principle reflects a
well-intentioned desire to play it safe in the face of uncertainty. The
problem lies in the way this instinct gets translated into law and
regulation. [[Making the precautionary principle the public policy
default for any given technology or sector has a strong bearing on how
much innovation we can expect to flow from it. When trial-and-error
experimentation is preemptively forbidden or discouraged by law, it can
limit many of the positive outcomes that typically accompany efforts by
people to be creative and entrepreneurial.]{.underline}]{.mark} This
can, in turn, give rise to different risks for society in terms of
forgone innovation, growth, and corresponding opportunities to improve
human welfare in meaningful ways.

St. Thomas Aquinas once observed that if the sole goal of a captain were
to preserve their ship, the captain would keep it in port forever. But
that clearly is not the captain's highest goal. Aquinas was making a
simple but powerful point: There can be no reward without some effort
and even some risk-taking. Ship captains brave the high seas because
they are in search of a greater good, such as recognition, adventure, or
income. Keeping ships in port forever would preserve their vessels, but
at what cost?

Similarly, [[consider the wise words of Wilbur Wright]{.mark}, who
pioneered human flight]{.underline}. Few people better understood the
profound risks associated with entrepreneurial activities. After all,
Wilbur and his brother were trying to figure out how to literally lift
humans off the Earth. The dangers were real, but worth taking. "[[If you
are looking for perfect safety," Wright said, "you would do well to sit
on a fence and watch the birds."]{.mark} [Humans would have never taken
to the skies if the Wright brothers had not gotten off the fence and
taken the risks they did]{.mark}. [Risk-taking drives
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline} and, over the long-haul, improves our
well-being.[\[5\]](https://medium.com/@AdamThierer/the-proper-governance-default-for-ai-d05db6970924#_ftn5) Nothing

[[Military commanders often have very little time to make decisions --
sometimes just seconds]{.mark}. And with threats like hypersonic
missiles accelerating the pace of modern warfare, [that window of time
is shrinking.]{.mark}]{.underline} Complicating things is the sheer
volume of data flow. There are petabytes of intelligence information
coming from sensors on land, at sea, in the air and in space, many using
different formats. [[The solution, according to experts at Raytheon
Intelligence & Space,]{.mark} a Raytheon Technologies business, i[s
clear: Artificial intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline} -- specifically,
teaming military commanders with intelligent systems to cull through
data in seconds. This will be key to bringing the vision for the U.S.
Department of Defense's Joint All Domain Command and Control network,
often called JADC2, to reality. That network will link military
capabilities around the world and in every domain. With artificial
intelligence and machine learning, those systems can define, combine and
provide the right information to the right people at the right time --
giving them the best possible chance to make the best possible decision.
"Manually processing all that data would require armies of analysts, but
with AI/ML, we can task systems to cull through the data and produce
higher level information useful to operators," said Jim Wright, RI&S
technical director for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
Systems. Experts from Raytheon Intelligence & Space discussed the
concept further during a [webinar on July 15,
2021](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4%3bF:QS%2110100&ShowUUID=CAC36112-8AAC-4C45-930D-5F4D90271603)
that is now available on-demand. Here's a preview of what they
discussed. 1. AI/ML makes sense of the complex There's a confluence of
factors that are driving the need for autonomy and automation in data
analysis -- a proliferation of information and a shortage of analysts to
start. AI and ML can help by doing the legwork -- searching, processing
and fusing larger amounts of data across the domains -- and helping the
humans save their brainpower for decision-making. "[A customer once told
me [that the military collects 22 football seasons worth of video every
day," Wright said. "There's a colossal amount of information
circling]{.mark} in today's battlespace. We're developing smart
software]{.underline}, called Cognitive Aids to Sensor Processing,
Exploitation and Response, to lighten the operator's workload and use
automation to help make decisions faster. The cognitive aids will do the
groundwork and data analysis to provide recommended courses of action,
leaving the operators to focus on making the best decision." The
Department of Defense is also mobilizing combatant commands to use AI/ML
for the future battlefield in a new effort called the Artificial
Intelligence and Data Acceleration Initiative. ["[Its goal is to rapidly
advance data and AI-dependent concepts]{.mark} like Joint All-Domain
Command Control," Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said during
the department's [AI
Symposium](https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2021/06/22/pentagon-launches-artificial-intelligence-effort-to-prep-combatant-commands-for-jadc2/)
on June 22.]{.underline} 2. AI/ML counters threats more quickly and
intelligently Another factor is the speed of modern weapons. "Think
about hypersonic glide vehicles and similar types of weapons," Wright
said. "From the time you see them to the time when you must counter them
is very short, and there isn't time for operators to search multi-sensor
data to optimize targeting solutions. Instead, AI/ML can automatically
search across many sensor sources to accurately detect and classify
threats, and then quickly evaluate multiple engagement alternatives to
find the optimum weapons target pairing." AI and ML could even give
combatant commanders insights into adversaries' decision-making
processes -- information they can use to anticipate enemy actions and
proactively outmaneuver them. "At that point, the adversary won't be
able to respond in time because our commander is already way ahead of
them," said Chris Worley, director for Civil and Digital Solutions at
RI&S.

The [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} military is still the most powerful

leaders in weapons innovation and production]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Likewise, the Department of Defense is still the colossus of the federal
system, i.e., the single biggest buyer of goods in the US government.
But unless the industrial and manufacturing base that develops and
builds those goods modernizes and adjusts to the world's new
geopolitical and economic realities, America will face a growing and
likely permanent national security deficit. [[America's defense
industrial base was once the wonder of the free
world,]{.underline}]{.mark} constituting a so-called
"military-industrial complex" that, regardless of criticism, was the
model for, and envy of, every other country---and the mainstay of peace
and freedom for two generations after World War II. Today, however, that
base faces problems that necessitate continued and accelerated national
focus over the coming decade, [**[and that cannot be solved by assuming
that advanced technologies like autonomous systems, artificial

magically preserve American leadership.]{.underline}** [On the contrary,
those advanced technologies themselves rely on a manufacturing complex
whose capability and capacity will have to be trusted and secure to
protect the Pentagon's most vital supply chains.]{.underline}]{.mark}
These include microelectronics, space, cyber, nuclear, and hypersonics,
as well as the more conventional technologies that make up our legacy
defense equipment. What will be required is a defense industrial
strategy based on a four-part program to:

1.  Reshore our defense industrial base and supply chains to the United
    States and to allies, starting with microelectronics, and restore
    our shipbuilding base.

2.  Build a modern manufacturing and engineering workforce and research
    and development (R&D) base.

3.  Continue to modernize the defense acquisition process to fit 21st
    century realities.

4.  Find new ways to partner private sector innovation with public
    sector resources and demand.

All these steps will be necessary to create a robust, resilient, secure,
and innovative industrial base. [**[The defense industrial base is a key
to preserving and extending US competitive military dominance in the
coming century and, with it, deterrence that will keep Americans safe
and keep the peace.]{.underline}** [Realizing a defense industrial

Defense Secretary Ashton Carter did on a trip to Asia this week.
[Beijing has repeatedly ignored earlier warnings to moderate the

On Friday, American officials disclosed that China had installed two
[mobile artillery
vehicles](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/world/asia/chinese-artillery-spotted-on-spratly-island.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)
on an artificial island it is building in the sea, which is rich in
natural resources like oil and gas and where China clearly hopes to
establish some form of hegemony. The weapons are not considered a threat
to American naval forces. Still, they reinforce fears that China intends
to militarize the Spratly Islands, a collection of reefs and rocks also
claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, and use them
to control the waterway's shipping lanes and dominate its smaller
neighbors. [China's ambitions have become increasingly clear since 2012
when it publicly asserted a claim to [80
percent](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/opinion/risky-games-in-the-south-china-sea.html)

little doubt
that](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/chinese-mischief-at-mischief-reef.html)
China is moving with alarming speed to turn the Spratlys into more
substantial land masses, complete with runways and harbors. **[Some
[American officials]{.mark} now [believe China regards its claims in the
S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [as
nonnegotiable.]{.mark}]{.underline}** If so, that's terrible news for
the region but also ultimately for China, which claims it prizes
stability but will find it impossible to realize its economic goals if

forge closer defense ties with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Now, the Obama administration has decided
to more firmly underscore America's intention to remain a Pacific power
and to ensure that the region and its waters remain accessible to all
nations. [[That is a role the United States has played]{.mark}
constructively [for decades, promoting]{.mark} a [stability]{.mark} that
has allowed Japan, South Korea and other countries, including China, to
develop.]{.underline} "**[There should be no mistake: [the United States
will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as forces
do around the world,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Mr. Carter said in his
speech. [He also called for "an immediate and lasting halt to land
reclamation by all claimants."]{.underline} **[Although [the
administration would]{.mark} obviously [prefer a peaceful]{.mark}
resolution of all South China Sea disputes, [it cannot allow China's
claims to go unchallenged]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It sent a surveillance
plane close to one of China's artificial islands, is considering air and
sea patrols that could go closer to disputed reefs and shoals, and is
expanding military exercises with regional partners. President Obama and
President Xi Jinping of China plan to meet later this year. In the
meantime, American officials and their Chinese counterparts must avoid
any miscalculation that could lead to a direct confrontation.

[headed towards witnessing a military showdown]{.mark}]{.underline} with
a revisionist and strategically arrogant China rigidly insistent on
altering the status quo in the South China Sea in defiance of United
States advisories to halt construction of artificial islands to enforce
its sovereignty claims in disputed waters. [[China seems to be]{.mark}
politically and strategically [over-reaching]{.mark} itself [buoyed
by]{.mark} its new-found [military strength and misreading]{.mark}
United States military [intentions]{.mark} in terms of its
resolve]{.underline} to enforce its national security interests in the
South China Sea region. [The United States itself is to blame for
leading China down this path of challenging the unipolar superpower by
being permissive]{.underline} on China's military adventurism in the
South China Sea at the expense of its relatively militarily weaker
neighbours. South China Sea has been witnessing a 'Gathering Storm' as
reflected in a recent SAAG Paper of mine and the imperatives of the
United States to pre-empt China's destabilising moves. Recent United
States official statements and military moves indicate that the United
States has finally woken up to the reality that China by its military
brinkmanship in the South China Sea was imposing its dubious claims on
Vietnam and the Philippines but in effect was all out to challenge
United States supremacy in the Western Pacific as a prelude to pushing
out the United States out of the Pacific. United States rhetoric on the
'freedom of the seas' through the 'global commons' implying the freedom
of navigation through the South China Sea made no sense to an arrogant
China as the United States had made no definitive declarations on its
national security interests in the South China Sea. The United States
has finally woken up to the stark reality that [[China's construction
of]{.mark} seven artificial [islands]{.mark} with US surveillance
photographs [showing military hardware being emplaced]{.mark} is an
adverse game-changer]{.underline} for the United States. Analyses of
these military developments betray China's military intentions and its
two-pronged strategy in the South China Sea to establish Chinese
full-spectrum dominance of the South China Sea. The first prong is to
extend China's sovereign spread over the South China Sea by claiming the
12 mile- territorial limit around each of these newly constructed
islands and an extended EEZ. This is not tenable under international
laws as such territorial limits only apply to natural landforms and not
artificial man-made islands. The second prong of China's strategy is
that [the [Chinese]{.mark} artificially constructed [islands would serve
as]{.mark} mini-[bases for]{.mark} emplacing [air defence]{.mark}
missile, [anti-ship missiles]{.mark}, [and surveillance]{.mark}
rada]{.underline}rs sand naval attack craft with the prime aim of
denying the United States access to Western Pacific and deter USA from
any military intervention. Such platforms could enable China to prevent
USA from sending its naval ships and aircraft to South Chinese islands
under Chinese occupation. [This also has to be read as a precursor to
[China declaring a Chinese ADIZ]{.mark}]{.underline} over the South
China Sea. Surely this is [a strategic challenge to the United States
and a blatant attempt to change the status quo in the South China Sea
with the end aim of converting the South China Sea into an Inland Sea of
China]{.underline}. The United States in the last few months has
commenced issuing statements challenging China's sovereignty over the
South China Sea. The US President is reported to have declared that the
United States does not accept China's logic of sovereignty over the
entire South China Sea and cautioned China not to indulge in an endless
creation of artificial islands in disputed waters. US Assistant
Secretary of State in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee stated "US pressure is needed in South China Sea to ensure
everyone with an interest in the area follows international law. No
matter how much sand you pile on reefs, you can't manufacture
sovereignty." More significantly, Russel told the Committee that US must
use in his words "all instruments of power" to push back what he called
"problematic behaviour" The Pentagon is planning to send US Navy ships
and US Air Force aircraft over the disputed areas both for surveillance
and more importantly enforcing the right of passage over international
waters and air space. Now shifting to China's responses carried in the
Chinese official organ-The Global Times, to the above, undoubtedly they
reflect belligerence and provocative stances against the United States.
These are quoted verbatim below: "For China, the most important bottom
line is to make the construction on the reefs continue until they are
completed." "If the United States bottom line is that China has to shut
down its construction on the reefs, then a US-China war is inevitable.
The intensity of the conflict will be higher than what people usually

"Companies Developing Lethal Autonomous Weapons, As Groups Seek Ban,
Report Says,"
https://www.aviationtoday.com/2019/12/02/companies-developing-lethal-autonomous-weapons-as-groups-seek-ban-report-says/
Cut By: m.jam

[Dozens of defense companies are developing lethal autonomous
weapon]{.mark}s (LAWS), as humanitarian groups seek to build
international support for a treaty to ban them, according to a recent
report. LAWS, so-called \"killer robots,\" would rely on artificial
intelligence (AI) to remove the human from targeting decisions, but how
close such systems are to mature development and deployment readiness is
a matter of debate in technology circles. \"As part of an imminent arms
race to develop increasingly autonomous weapons, states rely on and
involve arms producing companies in those efforts,\" according to
[Slippery Slope: The Arms Industry and Increasingly Autonomous
Weapons](https://www.paxforpeace.nl/publications/all-publications/slippery-slope)
by the Dutch non-governmental organization, PAX for Peace. \"While
digital technology, especially artificial intelligence, can be
beneficial in many ways, countless AI and robotics experts have warned
that the technology must not be used to develop lethal autonomous
weapons. The research however shows the clear proliferation of
increasingly autonomous weapon systems. Not only is there a growing
number of companies in a growing number of countries developing such
weapons, these technologies are also applied to an ever-expanding range
of military systems, in the air, on the ground and at sea.\" The United
Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) has been discussing
LAWS\' concerns and is to start devising a \"normative and operational
framework\" for such weapons at meetings in Geneva on June 22-26 and
August 10-14. But humanitarian groups are frustrated that CCW has not
progressed further in its work on the issue and that CCW has not brought
up a legally binding document to stop or significantly restrict LAWS. In
a message to CCW\'s Group of Government Experts convened for a meeting
on emerging LAWS technologies last March, U.N. Secretary General António
Guterres wrote that \"autonomous machines with the power and discretion
to select targets and take lives without human involvement are
politically unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be prohibited by
international law.\" \"This reflects what I see as the prevailing
sentiment across the world,\" Guterres wrote. \"I know of no state or
armed force in favor of fully autonomous weapon systems empowered to
take human life.\" Last February, Russia\'s ZALA Aero Group, the
unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) division of Kalashnikov, unveiled a
\"kamikaze\" drone \-- the KUB-BLA \-- at the International Defense
Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi. The small UAS is designed
to have a maximum speed of about 80 miles per hour, an endurance of 30
minutes, and an explosive payload of 7 pounds against \"remote ground
targets.\" Loitering munitions can have a dwell time up to six hours and
are equipped with sensors to allow the drones to detect and attack
targets independently. Early 1980s-era examples include Israel Aircraft
Industries\' Harpy suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) drone and
the U.S. Air Force AGM-136 \"Tacit Rainbow\" SEAD system by Northrop
Grumman \-- a \$4 billion development program canceled in 1991.
\"[[Especially significant are the developments related to loitering
munitions, which are able to operate for longer amounts of time and over
larger areas]{.underline}]{.mark} in order to select and attack
targets,\" according to last month\'s PAX for Peace report. \"Major
efforts related to swarm technologies multiply the potential of such
weapons. These developments raise serious questions of how human control
is guaranteed over these weapon systems.\" The Turkish state-owned firm
STM is \"improving the capabilities of its KARGU loitering munitions
through using AI, including facial recognition,\" the report said.
\"According to the company, the KARGU can \'autonomously fire-and-forget
through the entry of target coordinates.\' It has been suggested that
these systems will be deployed on the border with Syria.\" A September
article in The New Scientist magazine reported that KARGU positions
Turkey \"to become the first nation to use drones able to find, track
and kill people without human intervention.\" The Turkish newspaper,
Hürriyet, has said that some 30 STM \"kamikaze\" drones will be deployed
early next year to the Turkish-Syrian border region. The PAX for Peace
report on LAWS listed 30 \"high concern companies,\" as the latter
\"work on increasingly autonomous weapon systems and do not appear to
have a policy in place \[to ensure meaningful human control over such
weapons\] and did not respond in a meaningful way to our survey.\"
[[Such companies include Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon in the
United States]{.mark}; China\'s AVIC and CASC; Russia\'s Rostec;
Israel\'s IAI, Elbit Systems, and Rafael; and Turkey\'s STM, according
to the report.]{.underline}

### A2: LAWS not Key

In 2015 [[the USA elevated]{.mark} the issue of [autonomy to the highest
strategic level]{.mark} with the publication of its new 'Defense
Innovation Initiative']{.underline}, which is also [referred to as the
'Third Offset Strategy']{.underline}.11 Like the first two offset
strategies that were introduced during the cold war,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Third Offset [[Strategy
is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[based]{.underline}** on [[the idea that the
USA should seek to leverage emerging]{.underline}]{.mark} and disruptive
[[technologies in innovative ways to offset the advantages of potential
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} and maintain its strategic
superiority.12 Each of the previous offset strategies had [[a specific
'technological sauce']{.underline}]{.mark} as Robert Work, US Deputy
Secretary of Defense, puts it.13 [[For the First]{.underline}]{.mark}
Offset Strategy, [[it was]{.underline}]{.mark} the miniaturization of
[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} components, which enabled the adoption of
tactical nuclear weapons for conventional deterrence. [[For the
Second]{.underline}]{.mark} Offset Strategy, [[it was the development of
digital]{.underline}]{.mark} microprocessors, information technologies,
new sensors [[and stealth]{.underline}]{.mark}, which enabled the USA to
develop precision-guided weapons and achieve dominance in conventional
warfare. For [[the Third Offset Strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}, a key
component [[is going to be AI]{.underline}]{.mark} (particularly machine
learning) [[and autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}.14 The reasons for this
are manifold (and will be presented in the next subsection), but the
main rationale is that **[[AI and autonomy]{.mark} could [leverage many
operational benefits]{.mark} that could [allow the US military to
improve the strength]{.mark} and cost-effectiveness [of its
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this way, **[[it would continue to
outmatch Russia, China, Iran or No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}**, **[[even if those countries were to catch
up with the USA in]{.mark} the [development of high-end]{.mark} weapon

(Jon Harper is

[The [U.S.]{.mark} military [and China]{.mark}'s \[PLA\] People's
Liberation Army [are both pursuing\[AI]{.mark}\] artificial intelligence
capabilities [which could give them a leg up in future conflicts. PLA
investment in AI is now on par with the Pentagon's]{.mark}, experts say.
The United States [\[US\] views China as its top military]{.mark} and
economic [competitor]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Supported by a burgeoning AI
defense industry, the Chinese military has made extraordinary progress
in procuring AI systems for combat and support functions," according to
a recent report from the Georgetown University Center for Security and
Emerging Technology. The People's Liberation Army is most focused on
procuring AI for intelligence analysis, predictive maintenance,
information warfare, and navigation and target recognition in autonomous
vehicles, said the study, "Harnessed Lightning: How the Chinese Military
is Adopting Artificial Intelligence," by analysts Ryan Fedasiuk,
Jennifer Melot and Ben Murphy. Additionally, laboratories affiliated
with the Chinese military are actively pursuing AI-based target
recognition and fire-control research, which may be used in lethal
autonomous weapon systems, according to the authors. "If public
contracts reflect how the PLA prioritizes different emerging
technologies, then [[it is likely the PLA spends more than \$1.6 billion
each year on AI-enabled systems]{.underline}]{.mark}," the study said.
"However, because it is still an emerging technology, [[the PLA's true
spending on AI likely exceeds this number]{.underline}]{.mark}, as more
funding is captured in research and development rather than
off-the-shelf technology procurement. Moreover, the most
resource-intensive AI projects are likely classified," it added. The
analysts estimate that annual [[Chinese military spending on AI
is]{.underline}]{.mark} in "the low billions" of U.S. dollars, a level
of funding that is "[[on par" with Pentagon's
investments]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Various analyses of DoD budgets for
procurement and research indicate that [[it spent between \$800 million
and \$1.3 billion on AI in 2020, with an additional \$1.7 billion to
\$3.5 billion for]{.underline}]{.mark} unmanned and [[autonomous
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}," the report said. For fiscal year 2022,
the Defense Department requested \$874 million for artificial
intelligence projects, reflecting the "rapidly growing importance of AI
in every facet of the department's operations," according to budget
documents. [[That money would]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[fund more than
600 AI-related efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}. "It remains to be seen how
exactly AI might alter the balance of military power in the
Indo-Pacific," the CSET report said. Additional Pentagon research into
"counter-autonomy" capabilities, as well as U.S. and allied efforts to
regulate access to semiconductor devices, may hinder the utility and
availability of artificial intelligence systems for the PLA, the authors
noted.

\$30,168.1 million]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 2030, [registering a CAGR
\[Compounded annual growth rate\] of 10.4%.]{.underline}The rapid spread
of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the global autonomous weapons
market in 2020, owing to the implementation of strict lockdown measures
across the world. COVID-19 pandemic led to several challenges for the
autonomous weapons industry such as disruption in the supply chain of
essential raw materials, logistics challenges, reduction in defense
spending across various countries, and others. On the other hand, the
defense systems manufacturers and service providers had to reduce
expansion and R&D investments to withstand the decline in revenue and
operating performance of the defense industry. The delay in purchase
orders and slow production rate were some of the challenges observed in
the autonomous weapons market throughout the year, and are expected to
continue for a few years. Without the need for human involvement,
autonomous weapons choose and engage targets. They usually include armed
quadcopters that can hunt for and eliminate persons who fulfil specific
pre-defined criteria, however, they do not include remotely piloted
drones or cruise missiles where humans are in charge of all targeting
decisions. Artificial Intelligence ([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark})
technology [[has advanced to the point that deployment of such systems
may be]{.underline}]{.mark} accomplished [[in a few years, and the
stakes are]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[high]{.underline}]{.mark}. After
gunpowder and nuclear weapons, [[autonomous weapons have been dubbed as
the third revolution in warfare. Rise in technological advancements in
autonomy of weapons are being observed throughout the world. Autonomy is
being added to different parts of existing weapons systems, from target
planning to mission execution. Global]{.underline}]{.mark} military
[[spending]{.underline}]{.mark} on autonomous weapons and AI [[is
anticipated to grow significantly]{.underline}]{.mark} over the years.
This factor is expected to account for rapid development of the
autonomous weapons market during the forecast period. The market
segmentation is based on product, platform, type, and region. The
product segment is further divided into missiles, munitions, guided
rockets, guided projectiles, hypersonic weapon, and others. By platform,
the market is segmented into land, airborne, and naval. By type, it is
segmented into semi-autonomous and autonomous. Region wise, the market
is analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA. Key
players operating in the global autonomous weapons market include BAE
Systems plc, Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd., Kongsberg Gruppen ASA,
Lockheed Martin Corporation, MBDA, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Rafael
Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., Raytheon Technologies Corporation,
Rheinmetall AG, and Thales Group. Increase in number of autonomous
defense vehicles, drones, and robots [[Autonomous]{.underline}]{.mark}
defense [[systems]{.underline}]{.mark} including weapons, smart
vehicles, armed drones, and robots [[play a vital role
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[defense operations]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These are fully autonomous tools that employ telecommunication
technology such as 5G network, at the disposal of defense agencies to
provide services in real time at dangerous, inconvenient, and impossible
areas of operation such as remote surveillance for enemy infantry.
[[Various countries across the globe have focused on development of
autonomous systems]{.underline}]{.mark} to be utilized in public and
national safety applications. In recent times, [[multiple governments
from developed and emerging nations such as the U.S., Russia, China, and
India have invested billions of dollars for
autonomous]{.underline}]{.mark} defense [[projects]{.underline}]{.mark}.
For instance, [[Europe launched a]{.underline}]{.mark} defense
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} and development [[program of \$9.32
billion in January 2021]{.underline}]{.mark} toward financing defense
R&D projects. Adoption of autonomous technologies helps in reduction of
operational costs and increases efficiency significantly. For instance,
[during the [operation of a naval destroyer for a]{.mark} single
[day]{.mark} [\$700,000]{.mark} are spent by the U.S. navy
whereas]{.underline} in the case of [an]{.underline}
[[autonomous]{.mark} ship\'s [operation costs]{.mark} would come down to
[\$15,000]{.mark} to \$20,000 [per day]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover,
for increased efficiency; several nations around the world are deploying
the use of 5G in the operation of autonomous defense vehicles, robots,
and drones. For instance, U.S. ignite launched a technology pilot
program in January 2021 for 5G Living Lab at Marine Corps Air Station
(MCAS) Miramar situated in San Diego. Moreover, several pilot projects
aimed at utilization of 5G in autonomous defense vehicles, drones, and
robots are underway globally. Rise in adoption of autonomous technology
to improve defense capabilities of nation globally is anticipated to
propel growth of the global autonomous weapons market during the
forecast period. Increase in investments to develop autonomous weapons
Although autonomous weapons technology is still in its early stages,
several militaries and private companies are developing and testing
weapons that could one day be deployed to fight on their own. For
instance, Russia is performing tests on autonomous tanks on Syrian
battlefields, the U.S. has successfully tested swarms of drones, the UK
wants to induct drone squadrons in combat roles as soon as possible, and
China is developing unmanned submarines capable of carrying out kamikaze
attacks (Japanese suicide bombing tactic) on enemy vessels. [Armed
forces across the world have been working on autonomous weapons for
several decades now]{.underline}. Presently, at least 30 countries use
them, mainly to defend airbases, ground vehicles, or ships against
missile attacks. [Various countries are competing with each other
intensely to manufacture]{.underline} or procure [leading-edge
autonomous weapons]{.underline}. For instance, China and Russia aim to
pursue development of autonomous weapons and are heavily investing in
R&D activities. In addition, UK's new defense strategy is aimed at
propelling defense capabilities leveraging AI, as does Israel. According
to the Brookings Institution (a Washington, DC-based non-profit public
policy organization), the Chinese military and defense sector have been
investing heavily in robots, swarming, and other artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning applications (ML). So far, advancements in
autonomous weapons have drawn on existing research and development
expertise. Moreover, [Russia is developing]{.underline} an array of
[autonomous]{.underline} weapon platforms utilizing artificial
intelligence [as part of an ambitious push supported by high-tech
cooperation with China. Such developments provide rise in demand for
autonomous weapons, which is anticipated to propel growth of the
global]{.underline} autonomous [weapons]{.underline} market during the
forecast period. Serious issues with fully autonomous weapons Fully
autonomous weapons are those that can choose and fire on targets without
the need for human interaction. Fully autonomous weapons are capable of
assessing tactical context on a battlefield and deciding on appropriate
assault based on processed data. Several countries fund and assist
operations aimed at developing and researching completely autonomous
weaponry. China, Germany, India, Israel, Republic of Korea, Russia, and
the UK. UK, U.S., Israel, and South Korea have already deployed robotic
systems with varying degrees of autonomy and lethality. Although
abovementioned nations project great prospects for fully autonomous
weapons, experts across the globe have pointed out issues related to
accountability, protection of lives of citizens, and falling of such
technology with non-authorized persons. No single human may be held
responsible for his or her acts in an armed battle if the weapon system
is autonomous. Instead, accountability is shared among a larger,
possibly unidentifiable group of people, which could include robot\'s
programmer or maker. Removal of humans from the selection and execution
of attacks on targets, as the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,
summary, or arbitrary executions noted in their report to the Human
Rights Council, represents a critical moment in [the new
technology]{.underline} that [is considered a revolution in modern
warfare]{.underline}. It was advised to nations to carefully consider
consequences of such weapon systems, adding that such technology raises
danger of states engaged in armed conflicts, owing to a lower risk of
military casualties. Fully autonomous weapons could lower conflict
threshold, particularly in cases where other side lacks comparable
systems to deploy in response. These factors, as experts have pointed
out, could lead to serious conflicts and uncalled war like situations
caused due to unsupervised attacks made by fully autonomous weapons, and
hinder growth of the global autonomous weapons market during the
forecast timeframe. Rise in use of autonomous weapons globally Use of
weapons that make their own judgments or autonomous weapons, have
increased in recent years as a result of technological improvements and
rise in complicated conflicts such as the Syrian and Libyan civil wars.
Libya is not the only place where destructive autonomous weapons have
been utilized in recent years. For instance, autonomous quadcopters were
employed by Turkey to monitor its border with Syria. In September 2020,
when Azerbaijan attacked Armenian-occupied territory, it used loitering
munitions (drones that can autonomously fly over an area and divebomb
enemy radar signals) made by both Turkish and Israeli companies. These
weapons appear to be miniature versions of remote-controlled drones that
the U.S. military has deployed extensively in battles with Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other countries. Loitering munitions, on the other hand
have a built-in explosive and destroy themselves on impact with their
target, rather than releasing missiles via remote control. These factors
prove lethality and efficiency of autonomous weapons and rise in use of
autonomous weapons is expected to propel growth of the global autonomous
weapons market during the forecast period.

thought of as easier for catch-up countries to
obtain.[^3^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2021.1917392) Despite
warnings that the United States no longer spends enough on R&D and that
Chinese R&D spending is surging, the reality is that the United States
dramatically leads in military innovation investment. In functional
terms, the United States dominates all other countries, including China,
in 'input factors,' starting with resource allocations to defense
research and development. More important, we believe that the American
defense technology system is pushed toward innovation by specific
contextual factors, the 'soft' categories of attributes and
capabilities, that cannot readily transfer to likely
rivals.[^4^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2021.1917392)

Even without reliable data, [[decision-makers must move forward with AI
governance]{.mark}. And, as the world waits for scientific certainty
(which may never arrive), there is an existing solution that can guide
us into the unknown: [the "precautionary principle."]{.mark} [Adopted
globally in 1992 as part of the United Nations]{.mark}]{.underline} [Rio
Convention](http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm)
on sustainable development, and later incorporated into one of the
[European Union's founding
treaties](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=celex:12016E191),
the precautionary principle states that a lack of [[certainty cannot be
a basis for failing to protect human health]{.mark} or the environment.
That seems like [a suitable way to address the uncertainty of a
tech-driven future.]{.mark}]{.underline} The precautionary principle is
not without its detractors. But while its merits have been debated for
years, [[we need to accept that the lack of evidence of harm is not the
same thing as evidence of lack of harm]{.mark}. This simple idea has
been applied to [myriad human development
issues](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/91173/E83079.pdf)]{.underline}
-- from public health to infant mortality. There are three good reasons
why AI should be next. [[For starters, applying the precautionary
principle to the context of AI would help rebalance the global policy
discussion, giving weaker voices more influence in debates that are
currently monopolized by corporate interests.]{.mark} Decision-making
would also be more inclusive and deliberative,]{.underline} and produce
solutions that more closely reflected societal needs. The [Institute of
Electrical and Electronics
Engineers](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html),
and [The Future
Society](https://assembl-civic.bluenove.com/ai-consultation/home) at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government are already spearheading work in
this participatory spirit. Additional professional organizations and
research centers should follow suit. [[Moreover]{.mark}, by applying the
precautionary principle[, governance bodies could shift the burden of
responsibility to the creators of algorithms]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
requirement of explainability of algorithmic decision-making can change
incentives, prevent blackboxing, help make business decisions more
transparent, and allow the public sector to catch up with the private
sector in technology development. [And, by [forcing tech
companies]{.mark} and governments [to identify and consider multiple
options, the precautionary principle would bring to the fore neglected
issues, like environmental impact.]{.mark} Rarely is science in a
position to help manage an innovation long before the consequences of
that innovation are available for study]{.underline}. But, in the
context of algorithms, machine learning, and AI, humanity cannot afford
to wait. The beauty of the precautionary principle lies not only in its
grounding in international public law, but also in its track record as a
framework for managing innovation in myriad scientific contexts. We
should embrace it before the benefits of progress are unevenly
distributed, or, worse, irreversible harm has been done.

#### Distinction between military and civilian innovation -- the plan doesn't hurt the bulwark of the DIB 

Vincent **Boulanin and** Maaike **Verbruggen 2017** "MAPPING THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMY IN WEAPON SYSTEMS" November 2017 Stockholm
International peace research institute
https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/siprireport_mapping_the_development_of_autonomy_in_weapon_systems_1117_1.pdf

[[The innovation ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is driving the
advance of autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} in weapon systems is diffuse,
chiefly because the technologies, academic disciplines and industry
sectors involved in the development of autonomous capabilities may vary
greatly depending on the type of application and systems at issue.
Nevertheless, three general observations can be made. First, [[much of
the fundamental research in the fields of AI and robotics that
could]{.underline}]{.mark} feed the [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark} of
[[autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} in weapon systems [[is
dual-use]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[divergence between civilian and
military innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[emerges towards the
development end of the R&D cycle]{.underline}]{.mark} because civilian
and military products often need to meet different performance criteria.
Hence, should CCW delegates eventually engage in a formal discussion on
the monitoring or [[regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} of R&D efforts that
could lead to the development and production of LAWS, they [[should
focus on the development end of the R&D cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
this is where the actual capabilities of LAWS will be definitively
created. [[Attempting to monitor and control R&D at the more basic
research level would be challenging]{.underline}]{.mark} from a
practical perspective and possibly problematic as it could threaten
civilian innovation. Second, the barriers to entry to the development of
robotic systems are very low. Nearly all hardware components that might
serve the development of autonomous robots are commercially available.
It is even possible to acquire off-the-shelf low-cost robotic systems
that feature advanced autonomous capabilities. These may be adopted,
modified and weaponized by states but also, and more worryingly, by
non-state actors seeking, for instance, to conduct terrorist operations.
This scenario has not yet received great attention within the CCW
discussions on LAWS, despite the fact it represents an imminent
humanitarian risk. While it falls outside the traditional scope of the
CCW, it would be prudent for the GGE to allocate some time to this issue
in 2018. It could start a discussion on the options that are offered
outside the CCW to control or limit the diffusion and malevolent use of
key technologies. This could include discussing the possibilities
offered by export control mechanisms and self-control by the industry.
Third, future [[discussions]{.underline}]{.mark} on the development and
control of autonomy in weapon systems [[could]{.underline}]{.mark}
usefully [[benefit from]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[exchanges of
experience with the civilian sector]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially
companies developing safety-critical applications of autonomy (e.g.
aerospace companies, carmakers and medical robot companies), considering
that a number of issues that are central to discussion on LAWS have
already been, or are currently being, actively addressed within the
civilian sphere. These issues include the following. 1. How to define
and measure autonomy? This question has been the concern of
standardization and regulatory bodies for a long time. The International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International
Electrotechnical Commission have had multiple projects aimed at
generating an official definition of robot-associated terms, including
'autonomy' (ISO 8373:2012). In addition, the US National Highway Traffic
Safety Association has adopted the Society of Automotive Engineers'
levels of autonomy for self-driving systems, ranging from complete
driver control to full autonomy.110 2. How to operationalize meaningful
human control? Civilian industry sectors that produce safety-critical
systems (e.g. aerospace, automotive and medical robotics) are facing the
same human control dilemmas as the defence sector. They too are
dedicating their efforts to finding a model of the human--machine
command-and-control relationship that will maximize safety. 3. How to
test the safety and predictability of autonomous technologies? The
commercial aerospace sector has procedures to test and verify advanced
automated systems. Inviting experts from this community to talk about
existing procedures would help to identify possible best practices for
testing and evaluating weapons with advanced autonomous capabilities in
the context of Article 36 reviews.

[The DOD recently announced that it is planning to update DODD 3000.09
this year]{.underline}. Michael Horowitz, director of the DOD's Emerging
Capabilities Policy Office and the Pentagon official with responsibility
for shepherding the policy, praised DODD 3000.09 in a recent interview,
stating that "the fundamental approach in the directive remains sound,
that the directive laid out a very responsible approach to the
incorporation of autonomy and weapons systems." While not making any
firm predictions, [Horowitz suggested that major revisions to DODD
3000.09 were unlikely]{.underline}. In general, this is good news. The
DOD's existing policy recognizes that some categories of autonomous
weapons, such as cyber weapons and missile defense systems, are already
in widespread and broadly accepted use by dozens of militaries
worldwide. It also allows for the possibility that future technological
progress and changes in the global security landscape, such as Russia's
potential deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled lethal
autonomous weapons in Ukraine, might make new types of autonomous
weapons desirable. This [[requires proposals for such weapons to clear a
high procedural and technical bar]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to
[[demonstrating compliance with U.S. obligations under domestic and
international law]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[DOD system safety standards,
and DOD AI-ethics principles]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[proposed
autonomous weapons systems must clear an additional senior review
process where the chairman]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, [[under secretary of defense]{.underline}]{.mark} for policy; and
[[the under secretary of defense for acquisition,
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [[and logistics]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[certify that the proposed system meets 11 additional
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}**, each of which require presenting
considerable evidence. **[[Getting the signatures of the U.S. military's
highest-ranking officer]{.underline}]{.mark}** and two under secretaries
in a formal senior review [[is no easy task]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Perhaps the strongest proof of the rigor required to surpass such a
hurdle is the fact that **[[no DOD organization has even

Like many believers, **[proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on faith alone]{.underline}**.41 **[There is precious little
evidence to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline}** the **[pacific trends]{.underline}** that have swept
across the system. In fact, **[[the world remained equally
peaceful]{.underline}]{.mark}**, relatively speaking, **[[while the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[cut]{.mark} its [forces throughout the]{.mark} 19[90s]{.mark}, [as
well as]{.mark} while it [doubled]{.mark} its military [spending in the
first decade]{.mark} of the new century]{.underline}**.42 **[Complex
statistical methods]{.underline}** should not be needed to
[**demonstrate that levels of U.S. military [spending have been]{.mark}
essentially [unrelated to]{.mark} global
[stability]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go
way beyond the absence of simple correlations to support them, however.
**[The theory's supporters have never been able to explain adequately
how precisely 5 percent of the world's population could force peace on
the other 95 percent]{.underline}**, unless, of course, the rest of the
world was simply not intent on fighting. **[Most states are quite free
to go to war without U.S. involvement but choose not to]{.underline}**.
**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[can be counted on]{.mark}, especially [after Iraq, to steer]{.mark}
well [clear of most]{.mark} civil [wars]{.mark} and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}**. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal
**[violence in]{.underline}**, say, **[most of [Africa]{.mark} would be
unlikely to attract serious attention of the world's policeman, much
less intervention]{.underline}**. **[The continent [is]{.mark},
nevertheless, more [peaceful]{.mark} today than at any other time in its
history]{.underline}**, **[[something for which]{.mark} U.S.
[heg]{.mark}emony [cannot take credit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.43
[**[Stability exists]{.mark} today [in many]{.mark} such [places to
which]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony simply [does not
extend.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Overall, [proponents of the **stabilizing
power** of U.S. hegemony should keep in mind one of the most **basic
observations** from **cognitive psychology**]{.underline}: [**rarely**
are our actions as important to others' calculations as we **perceive
them to be**]{.underline}.44 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} so‐​called
**[[egocentric bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is essentially
ubiquitous in human interaction, [[suggests]{.mark} that although it may
be **natural** for [U.S. policymakers]{.mark} to interpret their role as
crucial in the maintenance of world peace, they are **almost certainly
[overestimat]{.mark}ing [their own importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Washington is probably not as central to the **myriad decisions** in
foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks
it is. The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple
of factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [[Americans have]{.mark}
long [been **exceptional** in their
**exceptionalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.45 [The short history of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can easily be read as an
almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story of success, [has led
to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it is **morally,
culturally**, and **politically superior** to other, lesser
countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional state
would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the world.

#### Alternative explanations for stability outweigh.

Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear ---
Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism
--- also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability
fallacy. And unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the
great power of the United States comes a sense of great responsibility:
to serve and protect humanity, to drive history in positive directions.
More than any other single factor, the people of the United States tend
to believe that they are indispensable because they are powerful, and
power tends to blind states to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our
international behavior and our image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It
brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond
common sense."49 **[It is quite likely that [the world does not need the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[to

[any]{.mark} of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing [explanations

(**[[economic development]{.mark}, complex [interdependence,
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, international [institutions]{.mark},
[democracy]{.mark}, [shifting]{.mark} global [norms]{.mark} on

soon]{.underline}**.50 **[[The world will]{.mark} probably [continue its
peaceful ways]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the near future, at the very
least, **[[no matter what the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[chooses to do]{.mark} or not
do]{.underline}**. As Robert Jervis concluded while pondering the likely
effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in foreign capitals, "It is
very unlikely that pulling off the American security blanket would lead
to thoughts of war."51 The United States will remain fundamentally safe
no matter what it does --- in other words, despite widespread beliefs in
its inherent indispensability to the contrary.

Tensions in the South China Sea continue to rise. China's People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)'s Rear Admiral Lou Yuan, regarded as a
hawkish military commentator, recently proclaimed that the continuing
dispute over the ownership of the South China Sea could be resolved by
sinking two US aircraft carriers. Statements like these result in a
legitimate fear that China's increasing presence in the South China Sea
might spark a kinetic military conflict with the United States. However,
**[while most Western scholars and media are paying excessive attention
to the rise of China, few are contemplating China's weaknesses in the
region.]{.underline}** Despite China's constant verbal objections and
rising tensions with the United States in the last century, **[the world
has yet to witness any major military confrontation between the two
superpowers]{.underline}**. **[[China will]{.mark} continue to
[avoid]{.mark} directly [confronting the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [for]{.mark}
[at]{.mark} [least]{.mark} [another decade]{.mark} [because China's
military remains immature and defective]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[China's weak joint command system, which has become an essential
instrument in modern warfare, comprises its first major military
weakness.]{.underline}** **[If any military operations are to be
conducted in a region such as the South China Sea, the integration and
cooperation between the air force, navy, and landing army is
indispensable]{.underline}**. However, even as it boasts the second
largest defense spending figures worldwide, **[China only recently
created their first and only joint command system]{.underline}**, the
Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC), under
President Xi Jinping's new national defense and military reform. In
addition, around 70 percent of the PLA soldiers belong to the PLA Army,
and almost all senior officers on the CMC are army officers. **[This
imbalance has the potential to cause serious complications, such as
interservice rivalry for the newly formed Joint Staff Department, when
it comes to decision-making involving naval and aerial affairs―areas in
which army officers have no experience.]{.underline}** The Chinese are
certainly attempting to resolve this problem by establishing departments
like the PLA Joint Logistic Support Force, which handles logistical
operations and oversees the military supplies, infirmaries, and barracks
of the PLA. However, **[[the "peace disease"]{.mark}―an idea that a
period of prolonged peace can weaken a state's military
ability―continues to [hamper China's]{.mark} military
[modernization]{.mark}, as there has been no opportunity to test its
joint command system in actual combat. The last time China had a
full-fledged military conflict was forty years ago with Vietnam, which
concluded with a Chinese defeat]{.underline}**. **[If the CMC hopes to
win a direct military engagement with US naval forces, it must
compensate for lack of experience in operating a joint command system.
Until it does so,]{.underline}** **[China's military poses little threat
to the United States and its allies]{.underline}**. Sea power is crucial
for taking control of the South China Sea. The Chinese Navy is divided
into the North, East, and South Fleets. Among the four divisions, the
PLAN's South Fleets poses the most immediate threat because it is
currently active in the South China Sea. Together, the fleets possess
only one aircraft carrier in operation: the Liaoning, an abandoned
Soviet-era vessel that was purchased from Ukraine as a training ship,
but reportedly had to return to port immediately due to an engine
failure during a sea trial. The country's one and only domestically
built aircraft carrier, the Type 001A, is under scrutiny, as it is
believed that the carrier manager might have leaked classified
information of Liaoning to the CIA. In contrast, the United States
possesses nineteen aircraft carriers, far outnumbering the Chinese.
Although the number and strength of aircraft carriers do not necessarily
determine the victor of a confrontation, the tonnage of a country's navy
might. Larger tonnage provides more space for fuel, weapons, and
ammunition, and a vessel with bigger hull not only has more rounds to
fire but also the capability to endure longer voyages. The United States
Navy has a total tonnage at least two times greater than that of PLAN's.
China also lags in its ballistic missiles. For instance, China's
People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) only began to field its
Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) DF-26 in 2016, and **[the
country's arsenal only consisted of ninety]{.underline}**
Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles **[(ICBM) as of 2019. In comparison,
the United States had a total of 405 deployed ICBMs and 278 non-deployed
ICBMs as of 2017]{.underline}**. In reality, **[[China's stockpile of
weapons]{.mark} and equipment [is]{.mark} still [substantially
inferior]{.mark} to that of the United States, [deterring a full-fledged
war]{.mark} from breaking out in the South China Sea.]{.underline}**
Alone, **[China's military is insufficient to face the United States in
direct confrontation]{.underline}** and would therefore be forced to
turn to its allies. **[[China]{.mark} currently [lacks any]{.mark} such
[dependable]{.mark} military [allies]{.mark} in the South China Sea.
China's leading ally in the region, North Korea, is a totalitarian
regime with a struggling economy, and most of its vessels are only
operable within fifty nautical miles of its coast]{.underline}**.
Although China and North Korea maintained strong relations during the
Cold War era, the Beijing-Pyongyang relationship has gradually declined
since the beginning of the twenty-first century and the start of North
Korea's nuclear program. China has joined the United Nations in
implementing sanctions against North Korea because of its unauthorized
nuclear testing. Although China remains North Korea's closest friend, an
alliance is rather far-fetched. Moreover, **[the [international
scrutiny]{.mark} that North Korea faces, as well as its deficient
economy, [means]{.mark} that [it lacks the resources]{.mark} to support
Chinese forces in the South China Sea if serious military conflict were
to occur. In contrast, the United States can easily depend on South
Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and the Philippines to provide naval
support]{.underline}**. In addition, although the United States is not
allied with most of the Southeast Asian nations, **[the increasing
cooperation between the United States and]{.underline}** the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (**[ASEAN) is similar to a military alliance
with no written agreement. The United States and ten ASEAN navies have
commenced multiple maritime drills as part of a joint exercise extending
into the South China Sea, countering China's presence in the
region]{.underline}**. In contrast, China and ASEAN only had their first
joint maritime exercise last year, which mostly focused on the code for
unplanned encounters at sea, search and rescue operations, and
communication exercises. In addition, **[US allies in the region have
increased their defense budgets to combat growing Chinese
influence.]{.underline}** Although China's navy has recently
commissioned the Nanchang guided-missile destroyer (the biggest surface
warship ever made), the vessel is only powerful in relation to other
**[Chinese ships]{.underline}**, which **[are around 3,000 tons less
powerful than the United States' Zumwalt-Class destroyer in terms of
displacement.]{.underline}** Consequently, **[China is slowing its plan
to build two aircraft carriers]{.underline}** for each of its regional
fleets to build the Nanchang. **[China may be aiming for a hegemonic
position in Asia, but that does not mean it will succeed. The country's
military―specifically its navy―is still immature.]{.underline}** China
is undoubtedly on the rise, yet **[[the country]{.mark} still [has
many]{.mark} profound and [systemic problems within its
military]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Perhaps some of these problems could be
resolved with China's continued growth, but **[[institutional
change]{.mark}―especially when problems are so ingrained into the
system―[takes a long time]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Based on what defense
analysts currently observe, **[China does not pose a military threat to
the United States in the South China Sea]{.underline}**; therefore,
there is no need to invest more resources and capital into the Pacific
for the time being. However, the United States should maintain its
presence in the area by continuing to foster relationships with its
allies while keeping a close eye on China's movements. Sacrificing
resources for the sake of military proliferation in a region where such
action is unneeded is a wasteful move that the United States should
avoid.

**[believed to have a similar number of warships]{.underline}** there at
the same time, **[which aroused]{.underline}** **[heated
discussion]{.underline}** **[among the media and experts.]{.underline}**
Another less publicized but more intense case was the reconnaissance and
counter-reconnaissance of China's aircraft carrier Liaoning formation
when it was conducting open sea cross-region mobile training while
followed by American warships and multiple military aircraft. An
anonymous PLA Navy officer revealed that the confrontation was so
intense that one U.S. warship even once came within 100 meters of the
Chinese carrier. [**[Even so]{.underline}**,
**[both]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[sides]{.underline}** have
**[[remained]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[largely
[professional]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[restrained]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In fact, **[[neither the
Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** military **[[nor the American military
has increased]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[activity]{.mark}
[significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[compared]{.underline}** **[with
the same period of 2019]{.underline}**, **[[despite]{.mark} the
impression]{.underline}** **[given by most media reports]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[expert
[commentaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The problem is that these
operations are over-exposed and over-focused. **[In the backdrop
of]{.underline}** **[power competition]{.underline}**, **[especially
amid the pandemic]{.underline}**, in order to show their strength and
determination, U.S. **[forces have given]{.underline}** **[undue
prominence]{.underline}** **[to covering and publicizing]{.underline}**
**[military activities]{.underline}**, giving the media and the public a
lot to discuss and imagine. There are some hawks in both countries who
take advantage of this and exaggerate the situation. Although most
countries including the South China Sea claimants, do not want to see
China-U.S. military conflict, some individual countries are indeed
rejoicing over the growing competition between China and the United
States, which may lead to some opportunity for them to expand.
China-U.S. military confrontation or even war in the South China Sea has
a huge market. **[[China and the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[are]{.underline}**,]{.mark} of course, **[[preparing for]{.mark} any
kind of]{.underline}** military **[conflict]{.underline}** and the
**[[worst scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the South China Sea;
[**[however]{.underline}**, **[there is no]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[indication]{.mark} that [the two]{.mark} sides [want to
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}** their [**[contradictions]{.underline}**
**[by using force]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[strategically or
[operationally]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[[despite
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** repeated **[war
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}** from some senior American officials.
**[[In daily]{.mark} military [interactions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[there are]{.mark} really increasing [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[but]{.underline}** **[in the absence of a subjective desire for
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [**[these risks are]{.underline}**
**[highly]{.underline}**]{.mark} likely to be
**[[controlled]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The most important thing for the
Chinese and American militaries to prevent is miscalculation,
considering the relatively backward or ineffective crisis management
mechanisms of the two countries even compared with Soviet-U.S. and then
Russia-U.S. military relations. In addition, we need to let
professionals do their work. The China-U.S. military rivalry has been
unduly influenced by the media, commentators, and some politicians,
which amplifies the intensity of the competition and is likely to lead
to self-fulfilling prophecies. Both Chinese and the U.S. militaries need
to remain competitive and professional, keeping politics and public
opinion in check. After all, **[if there were to be war]{.underline}**,
**[it would be the front-line commanders]{.underline}** and sailors
**[who bear the brunt of it;]{.underline}** **[others would be mere
bystanders]{.underline}**.

The **[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration **[of nuclear weapons [has
been far slower than predicted]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and this seems to
be **[[because]{.mark} the [weapons do not]{.mark} generally
[convey]{.mark} much [advantage]{.mark} to their possessor. [Dozens
of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark} have
[considered]{.mark}]{.underline}** obtaining **[nuclear arsenals,
[but]{.mark} very [few have]{.mark} done so.]{.underline}** A key reason
for this is that the **[possession of such expensive armaments actually
conveys in almost all cases rather little advantage]{.underline}** to
the possessor. In the main, **[[they are difficult to obtain,]{.mark}
militarily [useless, a]{.mark} spectacular [waste of time,
money,]{.mark} and scientific talent, distasteful, [and]{.mark} likely
to [rile]{.mark} the [neighbors.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Moreover, the
weapons have also been **[exceedingly difficult to obtain for
administratively dysfunctional countries.]{.underline}**9 Moreover, the
**[consequences of what little [prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}**eration
**[[has]{.mark} taken place have [been]{.mark} substantially
[benign]{.mark}. Those who have acquired the weapons have "used" them
simply [to stoke]{.mark} their [egos or]{.mark} to [deter]{.mark} real
[or]{.mark} imagined threats.]{.underline}** For the most part, **[they
have [quietly kept]{.mark} the weapons in storage and haven't even found
much benefit]{.underline}** in rattling them from time to time. **[[Nor
have]{.mark} the [weapons proven to be]{.mark} crucial
[status]{.mark}---or virility---[symbols]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
although Pakistan and Russia do probably garner more attention that they
would if they did not have nuclear weapons. But **[how much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would anybody pay a
great deal more attention to Britain or France if their arsenals held
5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much less if they had
none?]{.underline}** Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world
with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics?
**[Prolif]{.underline}**eration **[[alarmists]{.mark} may occasionally
grant that countries principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter
real or perceived threats, but many go on to [argue]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark} newly nuclear [country will]{.mark} then [use]{.mark} its
nuclear [weapons to "dominate"]{.mark}]{.underline}** the area. That
argument was repeatedly trotted out with dramatic urgency before 2003
for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein, and it is now being
applied to Iran. Exactly **[[how]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[domination]{.underline}** business **[is]{.underline}** to be
**[carried out [is never]{.mark}]{.underline}** made
**[[clear.]{.underline}]{.mark}**10 But the notion, apparently, is that
should an atomic country rattle the occasional rocket, other countries
in the area, suitably intimidated, would supinely bow to its demands.
Far more likely, **[any threatened states will make common cause with
each other and with other concerned countries against the threatening
neighbor]{.underline}**---rather in the way they coalesced into an
alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
