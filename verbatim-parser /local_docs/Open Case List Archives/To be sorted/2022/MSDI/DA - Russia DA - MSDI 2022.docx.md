#### NATO is not encircling Russia now

\"NATO-Russia: setting the record straight ,\" NATO (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-29-2022)

[[Myth 4: NATO is encircling]{.underline}]{.mark} and trying to contain
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Fact: NATO is a defensive alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}, whose purpose
is to protect our member states. [[Our exercises and military
deployments are **not** directed against Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} --
or any other country.

This myth also ignores geography. Only 6% of Russia\'s land borders
touch NATO countries. Russia has land borders with 14 countries. Only
five of them are NATO members.

Outside NATO territory, the Alliance only has a military presence in
Kosovo and Iraq. The KFOR peacekeeping mission is carried out with a
United Nations Security Council mandate.

NATO\'s non-combat mission in Iraq contributes to the fight against
terrorism and is carried out at the request of the Iraqi government,
with full respect for Iraq\'s sovereignty. In contrast, Russia has
military bases and soldiers in three countries -- Georgia, Moldova, and
Ukraine -- without the consent of their governments. Russia also has
amassed over 100,000 troops on Ukraine\'s border and is threatening to
invade Ukraine.

#### Doing plan through NATO instead of EU provokes Putin

for Studies (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Historian Timothy Snyder has pointed out the "politics of eternity", or
"the belief in an unchanging historical essence". (19) Other Russia
observers pinpoint how [[Putin tries to capitalise]{.underline}]{.mark}
not only on history, but also [[on identity
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} with Slavic and Orthodox core of the
region populations, [[and revival of Russian
nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Jeffery Mankoff of the Centre for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington recalls that
"throughout Putin's time in office, [[Moscow has pursued a
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} toward Ukraine and Belarus [[predicated on
the assumption that]{.underline}]{.mark} their respective [[national
identities are **artificial**]{.underline}]{.mark}---and therefore
fragile. Putin's arguments about foreign enemies promoting Ukrainian
(and, in a more diffuse way, Belarusian) identity as part of a
geopolitical struggle against Russia echo the way many of his
predecessors refused to accept the agency of ordinary people seeking
autonomy from tsarist or Soviet domination." (20)

These are [[the layers of Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} narratives as he
produces and defends his principles of 'justice', 'legitimacy', 'truth'
and 'worldview' within his own [[constructivist
nuances]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, his rather static interpretation
of history seems to [[collide with the West's]{.underline}]{.mark}
dynamic interpretation, or [[history dynamics, and the will
to]{.underline}]{.mark} Westernisation and
[[Europeanisation]{.underline}]{.mark}, which most of the fifteen former
Soviet republics have pursued in the last three decades. Ukraine has, in
the midst of a ferocious confrontation with Russian troops, maintained
strong hopes it would get rapid admission into the European Union to
help ease up Ukraine's geopolitical vulnerability. As Mankoff put it,
"Russian determination to bring Ukraine back into the fold despite the
enormous economic price it is paying---not to mention the prospect of a
grinding, bloody conflict that it could well lose---suggests that the
current crisis goes beyond the question of Ukraine's relationship with
NATO." (21)

In a joint news conference with visiting European Commission President
Ursula von der Leyen in Kyiv on 11 June 2022, Ukranian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated, "All of Europe is a target for Russia, and
Ukraine is just the first stage in this aggression... This is why a
positive EU response to the Ukrainian application for membership can be
a positive answer to the question of whether the European project has a
future at all." (22) Von der Leyen told him in candid language, "you
have done a lot in strengthening the rule of law, but there is still a
need for reforms to be implemented, to fight corruption, for example."
Still, EU leaders have accepted Ukraine's candidacy.

Meanwhile, [[Putin made a rather surprising
statement]{.underline}]{.mark} about Ukraine's leaning towards Brussels
during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on 17 June 2022:
\"[[We have nothing against it]{.underline}]{.mark}. It\'s their
sovereign decision to join economic unions or not\... It\'s their
business, the business of the Ukrainian people.\" Such a soft-tone
toward [[Ukraine's candidacy for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[EU
membership does not alter Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} devotion to his
own history and [[rigid defiance of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}'s presence in eastern Europe. [[The
**variability** of Putin's tactics vis-à-vis Ukraine's aspirations
toward the EU and the NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and counter tactics of
the re-aligned West's [[call for a close
examination]{.underline}]{.mark} of the decades-long circulating notions
of the Cold War, balance of power, new world order, and the fear [[of
what type the **next possible war** would be]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Putin will use Kaliningrad as a weapon -- it escalates

\"Will Kaliningrad Ignite the Spark of Confrontation Between NATO and
Russia?,\" Al-Estiklal Newspaper (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

In the midst of the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war four months ago, [[the
Russian exclave of Kaliningrad has emerged as a burning
hotspot]{.underline}]{.mark} between Russia and the West, after Western
reports described it as a dagger in the loin of Europe [[and a Russian
**geopolitical weapon** to encircle Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, [[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} recently
[[escalated]{.underline}]{.mark} between Russia and NATO [[after
Lithuania imposed restrictions on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[transit]{.underline}]{.mark} of goods [[by land
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the Russian exclave of [[Kaliningrad, in
compliance with]{.underline}]{.mark} the implementation of [[European
Union sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on Russia, [[which raised fears
that NATO would be drawn into a **direct
confrontation**]{.underline}]{.mark} with Moscow.

In turn, the governor of the Russian exclave, Anton Alikhanov, published
a video in which he says that his neighbor Lithuania has cut off 40-50%
of basic goods to his province, which caused a wave of panic among its
residents and a hysterical demand for supplies.

Observers believe that [[the reasons that prompted Russia to intervene
against Ukraine are **not half** the reasons that prompted Russia to
intervene against Lithuania now]{.underline}]{.mark}, because [[the
issue is **dangerous**]{.underline}]{.mark} and related [[to Russian
national security, given that Kaliningrad is Russia\'s **most
important** strategic location in the Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark} and
Putin\'s arm in the face of Europe.

### NATO Not Encircling now

#### NATO is weakening now post Ukraine -- plan uniquely restores dominance

Intelligence Council at **CIA** with responsibility for global
intelligence estimates
https://grahamefuller.com/some-hard-thoughts-about-post-ukraine/, \"Some

Acc:6-29-2022)

[[Contrary to Washington's triumphalist pronouncements, Russia is
winning the war, Ukraine has lost the war]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any
longer-term damage to Russia is open to debate.

[[American sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} against Russia have [[turned
out to be far more devastating to Europe than to
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. The global economy has slowed and many
[[developing nations face serious food shortages]{.underline}]{.mark}
and risk of broad starvation.

[[There are already deep cracks in]{.underline}]{.mark} the European
façade of so-called "[[NATO unity]{.underline}]{.mark}." Western Europe
will increasingly rue the day that it blindly followed the American Pied
Piper to war against Russia. Indeed, this is not a Ukrainian-Russian war
but an American-Russian war fought by proxy to the last Ukrainian.

Contrary to optimistic declarations, [[NATO may]{.underline}]{.mark} in
fact [[ultimately emerge **weakened**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Western
[[Europeans will **think** long and hard about the
wisdom]{.underline}]{.mark} and deep costs [[of provoking deeper long
term confrontations with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} or other
"competitors"of the US.

[[Europe will]{.underline}]{.mark} sooner or later [[return
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the purchase of [[inexpensive Russian
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia lies on the doorstep and a natural
economic relationship with Russia will possess overwhelming logic in the
end.

### Senate checks the Thumpers

#### Senate checks the expansion thumpers

David **Auerswald**, 5-17-20**22**,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-the-us-senate-could-slow-down-sweden-and-finlands-nato-future/,
\"How the US Senate could slow down Sweden and Finland's NATO future,\"
Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

With the announcements that [[Finland and Sweden will apply for NATO
membership]{.underline}]{.mark}, attention now turns to the existing
members of the Alliance. Adding new members requires amending NATO's
founding treaty, which then needs to be ratified by each of its thirty
members. Proponents within the Alliance---to say nothing of the two
aspirant countries---will want that process to happen as fast as
possible. The longer it drags on, the more opportunities exist for
Russia to derail the expansion process by manipulating public opinion,
engaging in petro-coercion, or increasing its military threats.

[[But could the US Senate]{.underline}]{.mark}, which must provide its
[[advice and consent]{.underline}]{.mark} for any new or amended treaty,
[[imperil the process?]{.underline}]{.mark}

If history is any guide, the Senate will overwhelmingly support adding
Finland and Sweden to NATO (certainly by more than the two-thirds
required by the Constitution). That was the case in 1998, when senators
supported membership for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland by an
80-19 vote; in 2003, when senators unanimously welcomed Bulgaria,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia by a 96-0
vote; in 2008, when senators admitted Albania and Croatia by voice vote;
and in 2017 and 2019, when it approved Montenegro and Northern
Macedonia, respectively, to join the Alliance with only two dissenting
votes each time.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} more interesting [[question is how
long]{.underline}]{.mark} it will take the Senate to provide its advice
and consent---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} here the record [[does not bode
well]{.underline}]{.mark}. The amended treaty is likely to be signed in
the next few weeks, perhaps even before the NATO Summit at the end of
June. That means the Senate, which is typically in recess during August,
would need to hold hearings and vote in June and July, September and
October, or wait until a lame duck session after the midterm elections.
The fastest enlargement process, in 2003, took a month and a half from
the NATO signing ceremony to final Senate passage. Other rounds took
much longer: The 1998 round took more than four months, while the 2017
and 2019 enlargements took more than ten and eight months, respectively.
The war in Ukraine could certainly speed up the process, but [[do not be
surprised if the Senate process drags into the
fall]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Another question is whether senators will condition their votes on
changes in administration policy. In 1997, for example, Republican Sen.
Jesse Helms withheld support for the Chemical Weapons Convention until
the Clinton administration agreed to abolish the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency and the US Information Agency.

[[Senators]{.underline}]{.mark} can also use more subtle means to change
policy. In providing treaty advice and consent, senators [[pass what is
called a ratification document]{.underline}]{.mark} that affirms that
Washington will abide by the treaty's terms. [[Senators can add all
sorts of **reservations**, understandings, and
**conditions**]{.underline}]{.mark} to that document. For example,
senators have specified that arms-control treaties do not limit US
missile-defense capabilities.

\"There's No Need For War With Russia -- OpEd,\" Eurasia Review
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Conflicts have a history of spinning out of control. Trotsky, the
one-time close comrade of Lenin, reportedly said, "You may not be
interested in war, but war is interested in you". The overwhelming
majority of Ukrainians were not interested in war until President
Volodymyr Zelensky took his counterproductive stance on NATO membership
and President Vladimir Putin subsequently launched his invasion and
united most of Ukraine's people against him.

[[Some observers talk about the war between the West and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although [[this could not happen as long
as]{.underline}]{.mark} Angela [[Merkel is around in
Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} (she retains a great deal of influence),
F[[rance remains French and]{.underline}]{.mark} President Joe [[Biden
stays cool]{.underline}]{.mark}, it may be a "damned close-run thing"
(as the Duke of Wellington was supposed to have said after the victory
over Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo).

[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, I believe, [[is not interested in
territorial aggrandisement]{.underline}]{.mark} but he is interested in
Russia not being threatened. Biden knows that many of the US's top
political science and history professors share this interpretation and
sympathise with Russia's predicament, even as they oppose Putin's use of
force. (In a public letter written to President Bill Clinton, these top
professors advised him not to expand NATO.) Biden and other NATO leaders
have to bite on this truth.

### Rebalancing now

#### Post-Ukraine will lead to US rebalancing

Mohammed **Cherkaoui**, 6-26-20**22**, **GMU** professor of Conflict
Resolution and Diplomacy at George Mason University in Washington and
Joaan Bin Jassim Academy for Defence Studies in Doha.

\"Russia-NATO: Four Political Variants under Review,\" Al Jazeera Center
for Studies (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

In contrast, t[[he Biden administration's national defence strategy
maintains the existence of threats of both Russia and China
exist]{.underline}]{.mark}. While delivering the revised classified
strategy to Congress on 28 March 2022, the Pentagon pointed out in a
public statement that [[Russia was posing 'acute threats', with China
remaining "our most consequential strategic
competitor]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the pacing
challenge." (30) Secretary of State Anthony Blinken asserts that "China
is [[the only country with]{.underline}]{.mark} both the [[intent to
reshape the international order]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic,
military, and technological [[power to do it]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Beijing's vision would move us away from the universal values that have
sustained so much of the world's progress over the past 75 years." (31)
He is sceptical about a possible rapprochement, but also determined to
pursue further containment of China. He underscores the United States
"can't rely on Beijing to change its trajectory. So, we will shape the
strategic environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open
and inclusive international system." (32)

Blinken and other U.S. officials' discourse seems to capitalise on the
original framework of containment designed by George Kennan in his
anonymous essay, "X-Article", formally titled, \"The Sources of Soviet
Conduct\", published in Foreign Affairs in July 1947. He called for
countering "Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western
world" through the "adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at
a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points,
corresponding to the shifts and maneuvers of Soviet policy." There is
noticeable return to the containment strategy in Washington in dealing
with China and Russia. Still, [[the White House has not shifted away
from its priority of maintaining a favourable balance of power in the
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some analysts wonder whether
these rivalries can be "managed in Cold War 2.0 or if it will be more
dangerous than its forerunner." (33)

Now, containment is called back again to serve a double-shift task in
Biden's foreign policy and the preservation of the United States'
leadership of the West and standing in world politics. The
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} war [[could be a good opportunity
for]{.underline}]{.mark} adjusting and [[**rebalancing** Biden's
strategic priorities]{.underline}]{.mark} in Indo-Pacific, Europe, the
Gulf and the Middle East. [[Still, the question lingers
whether]{.underline}]{.mark} the reproduction of [[containment
is]{.underline}]{.mark} good enough, or [[strategically
sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}, to give the Biden administration some
leverage to outperform two-rival superpowers with is a common goal: the
pursuit of undermining U.S. power and influence in the world, maximising
their de-dollarisation efforts and endangering the position of the
dollar as the reserve currency.

### No Horizontal Escalation unless plan

#### Horizontal escalation unlikely now, could happen if Putin is weakened

Richard D. **Hooker**, Jr. 4-21-20**22**, Fellow Nonresident Senior
Fellow Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security Transatlantic Security
Initiative
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/managing-escalation-in-ukraine/,
\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

The risk of horizontal escalation

Though it presents incredibly high risk, [[escalating the conflict
beyond Ukraine's borders in the near term is an option Putin could
consider if his survival is at stake. A direct attack on NATO
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}---perhaps [[through Lithuania to obtain a
land corridor to the Kaliningrad]{.underline}]{.mark} exclave and cut
off the Baltic States, should Russian forces find more success in
Ukraine---[[is possible]{.underline}]{.mark}. The powerful Kaliningrad
garrison, which includes nuclear-tipped Iskander-M and Kalibr systems,
could assist. At sea, a desperate Russian Federation might attack and
seize commercial shipping in international waters on the Black Sea and
in the Baltic. [[Broadening the conflict to engage outside powers more
directly might]{.underline}]{.mark} stop the flow of support and lethal
aid to Ukraine, [[throw NATO into disarray]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[create openings]{.underline}]{.mark} for sanctions relief, [[and
rally]{.underline}]{.mark} an increasingly disaffected [[Russian
population]{.underline}]{.mark}. If [[tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} are postured for use, or employed in
desperation, the risks of uncontrolled escalation will become quite
real. [[Such use is not likely, but **cannot** be ruled
out]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Other military options also exist. Belarus has a substantial ground
force of four heavy brigades, an airborne brigade, and strong artillery,
which remain uncommitted. Putin could, in effect, take over and deploy
this force in Ukraine or the Baltics, though its morale appears low.
[[To distract and punish NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} for its support,
[[hybrid operations]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Baltic States using
Russian mercenaries, special-operations troops and intelligence
paramilitaries from the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Main
Intelligence Directorate (GRU) could seize ethnically Russian parts of
NATO territory (for example, in the Narva area in Estonia) and declare
independence. While substantial Russian regular forces are not available
in strength, this move [[would provoke frantic diplomatic
activity]{.underline}]{.mark} in NATO and the EU, [[and could provide
leverage]{.underline}]{.mark} for negotiations and sanctions relief.

Horizontal escalation in other regions---such as the Arctic, the
Mediterranean, and the Far East---is also possible, but would suffer
from the same disability: lack of military resources to achieve any
decisive result. To date, Russian naval forces are intact and could be
employed, but the Russian navy is not a true blue-water maritime force
and, apart from nuisance attacks, could not realistically alter
strategic outcomes. The same is true of Russian military aviation and
space forces. Apart from generating confusion and a degree of
misdirection, it is unlikely that these operations could contribute
significantly to the success of the campaign in Ukraine, Putin's
principal goal. On the contrary, such operations could bring other
military powers into the conflict against Russia, alienate others such
as China and India, and change the correlation of forces decisively
against Russia.

Conclusion: Where will the resolution framework come from?

The current geopolitical impasse between Russia and the NATO will
persist in time and complexity. The fluidity of the four political
constructs -- Cold War, balance of power, new world order and the
fifth-sixth-generation war debate -- discussed in this paper, is still
far away from reaching a minimum rapprochement between the Kremlin and
Western powers for the following reasons:

[[Russia and NATO are not engaged in a zero-sum showdown with one winner
and one loser]{.underline}]{.mark} as realpolitik enthusiasts would
argue. But, [[it is an absolute zero-sum where **both** parties end up
losing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russian and Western economies will struggle
and wane over time in an aimless venture of hurting stalemate.
Differences of political temporalities between Putin's revisionist
approach to history and the West's assumption of eternal weakness after
the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has harkened back to an ahistorical past to
justify his decisions in the present. He has weaponised history to
solidify his [[claims]{.underline}]{.mark} over Crimea in 2014 and
eastern Ukraine in 2022. He stated, "in territories adjacent to Russia,
which I have to note is our historical land, [[a hostile 'anti-Russia'
is taking shape]{.underline}]{.mark}," Putin said in another address
ahead of the invasion. "For our country, it is a matter of life and
death, a matter of our historical future as a nation."

The post-Ukraine War dynamics have shown an incomplete subordination of
forces and strategies among four global players: Russia, China, the U.S.
and the E.U. Russia has gone beyond any other nation to coordinate a
comprehensive strategic partnership with China. But, Chinese officials
are not keen on siding fully with the Kremlin. They have implied that
the 'no limits' partnership has a few limits. U.S. National Security
Adviser Jake Sullivan at the White House stated he has not seen evidence
of [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} providing military support to Russia.
Beijing's diplomacy [[seeks to secure its interests in the Indo-Pacific
region than drumming up support for Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[Transatlantic relations]{.underline}]{.mark} between the United
States and Europe [[will pivot around the **solidification** of]{.mark}
the [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Biden is enthusiastic about
[[reinforcing]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}-US leadership [[as well
as mending fences]{.underline}]{.mark} with several Europeans
governments. During his news conference at the White House with Finish
president Sauli Niinistö and Swedish Prime minister Magdalena Andersson
mid-May 2022, Biden asserted that "today, there is no question: NATO is
relevant, it is effective, and it is more needed now than ever. The
indispensable alliance of decades past is still the indispensable
alliance for the world we face today and, I would argue, tomorrow as
well."

The eclipse of the liberal left's discourse and peace theory. [[What
matters now is how the West and Russia can **manipulate** their hard and
sticky power capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Realpolitik enthusiasts
feel confident now that political realism is back to explain best world
dynamics, and that "great powers compete for power and influence and
others adapt as best they can." (45) However, soft power theorist Joseph
Nye considers any realist assertion that "so much for soft power" as a
response that "betrays a shallow analysis". (46) He acknowledges that
hard military power has dominated the short-run battle. But, he argues
that "the effects of soft power tend to be slow and indirect in
international politics. We can see the effects of bombs and bullets
right away, whereas the attraction of values and culture may be visible
only in the long run." (47)

Any potential outcome of the Russia-NATO showdown will not emerge out of
the wishful political dialectic between the Kremlin and the White House,
nor from the calls of UN Secretary-General António Guterres for the
enactment of an urgent and immediate humanitarian ceasefire. [[The
long-term transformation of the metaconflict will require a **shift** of
the EU position **from stakeholder to mediator** between Moscow and
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Cohesion Link

#### Cohesion is vital to NATO military tactics

\"Resetting NATO's Defense and Deterrence: The Sword and the Shield
Redux,\" No Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Final Word: Political Cohesion and Military Strength

[[NATO is the world's]{.underline}]{.mark} largest, most powerful,
[[most successful]{.underline}]{.mark}, and preeminent [[military
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} of nations. [[One
reason]{.underline}]{.mark} for its longevity [[is continuous
adaptation. The main mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark} for this process
[[has been]{.underline}]{.mark} the alliance's most important document:
[[its strategic concept]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO's new concept will
guide its latest evolution as the alliance resets to deal with a
situation it has never faced in its history: a full-scale land war in
Europe.

[[Yet resetting NATO's defense and deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}
posture [[is not simply a military-strategic matter. It is above
all]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[political]{.underline}]{.mark} one,
[[requiring **unity** and solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}. In facing
this crucial task, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} allies of NATO
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} recall one of the basic principles from its
founding strategic concept, taken from the North Atlantic Treaty itself:
"They are [[resolve]{.underline}]{.mark}d [[to **unite** their
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} for collective defense and for the
preservation of peace and security." Or, in the words of NATO secretary
general Joseph Luns from 1976, which resonate today: "our efforts can
only succeed if they are [[based on political
**cohesion**]{.underline}]{.mark} and on military strength of a scale
sufficient to resist military or political pressures. Then we shall be
able to face with confidence the constant challenges which we must
expect to be our lot over the months and years ahead."84

Western governments are not in favour of engaging in direct armed
confrontation with Russian forces, while differences within the NATO
persist about the best tactics that can fulfil U.S. Secretary of Defence
Lloyd Austin's objective: "We want to see Russia weakened." Some
observers consider his comments "a clear sense of confidence that the
strategy is clearly working." (2) The [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} war
[[has been a good opportunity for]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. President
Joe [[Biden to push for the solidification of the NATO's raison
d'être]{.underline}]{.mark} in terms of protecting Western Europe's
security [[under the banner of U.S. military and technological
leadership. However, it is]{.underline}]{.mark} a challenge for the NATO
to consider what can be termed as [[a double-edge
sword]{.underline}]{.mark} plan of action vis-à-vis the prospects of
admitting two Nordic state members: "a security that is enhanced by
Finland and Sweden; but, an insecurity that is spreading across Eastern
Europe." (3)

A complex metaconflict on the rise

The Ukraine war and the subsequent Russia-NATO showdown have showcased
how conflicts may come in different forms and sizes of complexity. This
complexity explains "why [[interventions may have un-anticipated
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[intricate inter-relationships
of elements within a complex system give rise to multiple chains of
dependencies]{.underline}]{.mark}." (4) The management of [[the ongoing
war has accentuated the interconnectedness]{.underline}]{.mark} between
several global political, military and economic systems and related

### Sanction Link

#### Plan gets framed as a new sanction on Ukraine -- drives Putin overreaction

[[The western response]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russia's invasion of
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} was supposed to help the latter by
punishing the former. That strategy [[isn't
working]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Punishing Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
economically [[is suring up Putin's position
domestically]{.underline}]{.mark}, NATO's expansion is [[strengthening
the China-Russia alignment]{.underline}]{.mark}, and military assistance
to Ukraine without direct NATO involvement is merely protracting the
war, with no clear end in sight. Given the geopolitical deadlock, [[the
only viable option would be]{.underline}]{.mark} for the West to broker
a [[neutrality status]{.underline}]{.mark} for Ukraine. It will be a
difficult deal, with lots of costly compromises, but at this point
[[it\'s the **only** geoplolitical solution
available]{.underline}]{.mark}, writes Alexander Korolev.

The West's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022
can be broken down into three main prongs. The first one has to do with
the imposition of unprecedented economic sanctions to inflict enough
punishment on Russia to delegitimise Vladimir Putin's political regime
or make it change its foreign policy calculus and stop the war. The
second prong materialized in extensive military assistance to Ukraine to
help Kyiv fence off Russia's aggression by making the costs of the war
unacceptable to Moscow. The third prong took the form of a new round of
NATO expansion into Finland and Sweden -- to contain aggressive Russia
more effectively and, according to NATO General Secretary Jens
Stoltenberg, demonstrate that NATO's door remains open regardless of Mr
Putin's preferences and that smaller states have full agency over their
foreign policy choices.

The geopolitical implications of this three-prong response emerge as
opposite to the intended outcomes. While [[punishing
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, it [[fails to help end the
Russia-Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} war. [[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark},
by all evidence, [[it consolidates Putin's grip on power and makes him
dig in for a long haul in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The more the West uses sanctions to push against
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and threaten the existing political regime,
[[the more the majority of Russians rally around
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The economic sanctions have failed to have a tangible impact on Russia's
behaviour in Ukraine. Nor did they undermine Putin's domestic standing.
Even smaller states could sustain an enormous amount of economic
punishment without populations and elites revolting against the ruler.
In Russia, the Western economic sanctions have encountered Russia's own
nationalism that, with the assistance of state propaganda, effectively
channels public indignation about economic hardships into anger against
the external enemy and the cause of the pain -- the West. The more the
West uses sanctions to push against Russia and threaten the existing
political regime, the more the majority of Russians rally around Putin.
According to recent public opinion polls, 76% of Russians trust their
president. Moreover, the data reveals that while in December 2021 only
62% of Russians approved of Putin's job as the President, in May 2022
this figure rose to more than 70%, with 61% noticing increased social
unity around the President. This level of support allows Putin to claim
to have a public mandate to continue carrying out his "special
operation" in Ukraine.

Military assistance to Ukraine, with the West's simultaneous reluctance
to step in and defend Ukraine militarily, also protracts the war. The
crisis is plagued by the "geopolitics of asymmetry" -- a situation where
Russia is willing to pay an enormous price to pursue its geopolitical
interests in Ukraine, a price that neither NATO nor EU is willing to
even consider. Losing in Ukraine would be a political catastrophe for
Putin, which is why the regime will not shy away from the most dramatic
solutions to prevail in the conflict. For the US and its allies, in
turn, Ukraine is not a priority strategic interest beyond its being a
useful strategic bulwark against Russia. According to UK Prime Minister
Boris Johnson, the war in Ukraine "is not a NATO conflict, and will not
become one." In a similar vein, Stoltenberg highlighted that "we are
determined to do all we can to support Ukraine. But we have a
responsibility to ensure that the war does not escalate beyond Ukraine,
and become a conflict between NATO and Russia." In a situation when
Russia is willing to fight and die in Ukraine whereas the EU and the US
are not, flooding Ukraine with weapons without tangible security
guarantees or attempts to broker a neutrality status for Ukraine does
make the war costly for Russia, but it fails to make it shorter, with
Ukraine being destroyed in the process.

Putin has managed to create the world he has been warning Russians and
Russia's allies about: the West is indeed fully out to encircle Russia.

Finally, the expansion of NATO into Sweden and Finland has poignantly
demonstrated that despite the war, Ukraine remains a third-rank citizen
in the West. Sweden and Finland were warmly welcomed by NATO even before
they formally applied. Ukraine, in turn, despite all its efforts to join
NATO, was designated by Boris Johnson on 6 March 2022 as the country
that "had no serious prospects of NATO membership in the near future."
This was echoed, on 11 March 2022, by Josep Borrell, who reflectively
admitted with regards to Ukraine's NATO membership that "it's a mistake
to make promises that you can't keep."

The limits of the West's support of Ukraine are crystal clear to Putin
and the rest of the world. Regardless of what Russia does in Ukraine,
there will be no NATO membership and no collective security guarantees
for Ukraine. Moreover, this round of NATO expansion brings the "enemy"
to the gate of Russia and corroborates [[Putin's besieged-fortress
ideology]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, Putin has managed to create the
world he has been [[warning]{.underline}]{.mark} Russians and Russia's
allies about: [[the West is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed fully [[out to
encircle Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. This self-fulfilling prophecy
shores up Putin's rhetoric within Russia and signals to China that the
West does pose a danger to Russia and is more interested in harming
Russia's geopolitical interests than helping Ukraine. This recognition
[[strengthens China-Russia alignment which will further buttress
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s capacity [[to carry on in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Hybrid war link

#### Even if plan isn't military, it is hybrid war by other means

Resolution and Diplomacy at George Mason University in Washington and

Another framework has focused on Conflict Intelligence (CIQ) as "a set
of competencies and skills used to manage different types of normative
conflicts in diverse or changing situations effectively and
constructively", as illustrated by Peter Coleman, director of the Morton
Deutsch International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution at
Columbia University. (12) Coleman and his colleagues have identified
"two meta-competencies---Conflict Intelligence and Systemic Wisdom---for
adaptively managing different kinds of conflicts across contexts, and
for transforming entrenched patterns of conflict. These represent two
[[distinct]{.underline}]{.mark} but complementary
[[competencies]{.underline}]{.mark} or modes of conflict engagement,
which [[are associated with distinct **types of
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Conflict Intelligence and Systemic
Wisdom framework differentiates conflicts [[according
to]{.underline}]{.mark} their levels of [[complexity, destructiveness,
and endurance]{.underline}]{.mark} over time." (13)

In retrospect, [[the **escalatory mood** between the Kremlin, the White
House and its European allies has entailed a metaconflict with grandiose
**magnitude** since Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}.
It has not been a classic confrontation between serviceman and
mercenaries, but [[a sticky war involving]{.underline}]{.mark} legions
of [[financiers]{.underline}]{.mark}, bankers,
[[business]{.underline}]{.mark} executives,
[[hackers]{.underline}]{.mark}, influencers [[and spin
doctors]{.underline}]{.mark}. The notion of war [[seems to be evolving
rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark} and contests most of the legacy of World
War II.

[[There is a significant shift toward "holistic
doctrines]{.underline}]{.mark} that can comprehensively explain the
multifaceted character of modern war, [[including the Russian concept of
hybrid warfare, the American concept of fourth-generation
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Chinese concept of unrestricted
warfare. Permanent change and full-spectrum clashes are structural
features of contemporary security environments." (14) Before delving
into the four transformative political constructs of the post-Cold War
era, it is important to study first how Russian president Vladimir Putin
has solidified his position and precursors of his defence strategy
vis-à-vis the NATO.

\"Visualizing the NATO Strategic Concept: Five ways to look at the
Alliance\'s future,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:7-2-2022)

[[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has helped to **sharpen the
focus**]{.underline}]{.mark} on the threat posed by the Kremlin,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} it [[is **not** the only security challenge
confronting NATO. To discern]{.underline}]{.mark} the diversity of
[[allied threat perceptions]{.underline}]{.mark} and how the next
Strategic Concept should address them, [[we studied]{.underline}]{.mark}
the security strategies (produced before Russia's war in Ukraine) from
France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United States, and the United
Kingdom [[to see what the **word count** in each strategy might
say]{.underline}]{.mark} [[about]{.underline}]{.mark} each country's
perceived greatest [[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. words
[[like]{.underline}]{.mark} China and **[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[as well its priorities]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. words
[[like]{.underline}]{.mark} Europe/European and
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}).

Geographical concerns abound with Poland rather focused on Russia,
Germany very Europe-centric, Italy biased towards the Mediterranean, and
France particularly invested in Africa. France and the United Kingdom
made the only mentions of the Arctic among the group. China was of some
concern to all these allies, with the United States and France most
invested in Indo-Pacific security--which reinforces why France was so
bruised following the AUKUS agreement, as the region is a definite
priority for Paris. Germany made the most mentions of NATO, alliances,
and Europe, and its strategy very much reflects the long-held standard
of a Federal Republic nestled at the heart of Europe and multilateral
institutions. [[The challenge with the NATO Strategic Concept will be
for drafters to reconcile US interest in the Asia-Pacific region against
the more local interests of other allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. What
role, if any, does NATO have regarding great-power competition in Asia?
How exactly does the Alliance square the circle of requirements from the
Artic to the Mediterranean?

The [[regional divergence]{.underline}]{.mark} was somewhat [[offset by
similar perceptions of]{.underline}]{.mark} the primary challenges with
[[**cyber** issues]{.underline}]{.mark} featuring across the board.
Terrorism and societal resilience to terrorist attacks remains a
prominent issue. The rise of authoritarianism and concerns about the
strength of democratic societies are shared by many, but such concerns
are not mentioned by Poland--- not a surprise considering its own
democratic backsliding. Nearly all the documents, especially the more
recent ones, assert the challenge to the "liberal international order"
and call for reinforcement and support for global norms and
international law. Nuclear weapons proliferation is a worry for some but
not all, and migration featured in the documents of countries that
expressed more concern with instability in NATO's near abroad.

#### Cyber attacks inevitable in the SQ

It is a common saying among cyber practitioners that there are two types
of victims: "those who know that they have been hacked and those who
have, but don't know it yet." [[Attribution of an attack through
cyberspace requires technical information and the willingness to name
names]{.underline}]{.mark}. Attribution can be tricky, though it happens
with increasing frequency in hints and outright statements from
governments as well as a sea of claims from private sector firms. [[To
establish attribution, analysts might try to determine if the
cyberattack **looks like**]{.underline}]{.mark}---or originated from
similar places in cyberspace---as attacks on other targets, if the
software program used in the attack shares similarities with others, or
even the language and time zone of the program (as simple as that may
sound).

While [[government attribution]{.underline}]{.mark} against other states
is more common now than even five years ago, it [[is still seen as a
significant action in part because of the political will necessary to
publicly decry offending states]{.underline}]{.mark}. This map
identifies the NATO governments that have attributed an incident of
cyber espionage and reconnaissance to Russia. As can be seen, [[the
majority of NATO governments have publicly attributed cyber
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} targeting sensitive official files and
government personnel [[to Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent years.
In particular, the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom,
Italy, and Poland have all reported breaches, and in some cases a
multitude of them. [[Russia's continued efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} to
spy on the computer networks and classified systems of NATO governments,
even when revealed in public, would [[suggest that the Kremlin is
**impervious** to "naming and shaming"]{.underline}]{.mark} for these
activities in cyberspace.

While cyberspace has taken its place firmly with air, land, sea, and
space as one of the domains of modern warfare, the ease of connecting
digitally across borders, significant role of the private sector, and a
host of other factors can make cyberspace a challenging domain to
manage. This is especially so when attacks are so common and, seemingly,
useful to attackers. [[Until the United States and its NATO allies
either **increase the risks or lower the rewards** for such attacks,
Russia has no incentive to change course.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Moscow's war against Ukraine has **altered** the European security
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. As allies reorient NATO's focus back
toward collective defense in the Strategic Concept, [[it is time for the
Alliance to get serious]{.underline}]{.mark} about defense spending
[[and move the discussion beyond **rhetoric** and toward **measurable**
contributions]{.underline}]{.mark} to defense and deterrence. As this
graphic indicates, though a number of allies already spend above 2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, if all allies were
to meet or exceed the pledge (agreed to in 2014), they would have nearly
one hundred billion dollars more to invest [[where it's needed most:
readiness, capabilities, and capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not to
mention what Finland and Sweden can bring to the Alliance.

Readiness

Unit and individual readiness should be dramatically increased. Expanded
NATO training and exercise programs should integrate advanced command
and control, logistics support, and military mobility initiatives.

Capabilities

[[Technology applications]{.underline}]{.mark} should be accelerated,
[[particularly cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} defense, [[artificial
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}, autonomy, precision engagement,
power, energy, and logistics.

Capacity

NATO's enhanced Forward Presence in Poland and the Baltics should be
expanded beyond battalion strength, leveraging \$1-2 billion of US
European Deterrence Initiative funding. Naval operations in the High
North, Mediterranean, and Black Sea should be expanded, providing NATO
with opportunities to increase maritime presence and awareness.

Numerous current and future allies have renewed the 2 percent pledge and
already committed substantial new resources to defense. Yet [[allies
have **far more** capacity to act, and the Strategic Concept
must]{.underline}]{.mark} both **[[reassert]{.underline}]{.mark}** this
pledge [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly
**[[prioritize]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a public audience [[where
these new resources should be spent]{.underline}]{.mark}. With a
substantial and focused increase in defense investment, NATO could
enhance European defense and deterrence by responding to the increased
Russian threat with essential readiness, capability, and capacity
upgrades. NATO allies must summon the will to respond to the new
security environment Putin has created. Spending at the 2 percent level
should be considered a floor, and not a ceiling, as we move toward the
new NATO Strategic Concept. At this moment, [[NATO
must]{.underline}]{.mark} lay out a clear level of ambition to
[[**realign** national defense programs]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
actual needs of transatlantic security.

A sixth-generation war?

[[The Russia-NATO metaconflict seems to blend traditional and innovative
mechanisms of war and subordination of political economy to
realpolitik]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Ukraine war seems to be notorious
for the involvement of more modern components. Military experts point
out that the Russian version of 'shock and awe' includes "airstrikes,
drones and hypersonic missiles in order to overwhelm the Ukrainians, as
well as threats of nuclear sabre-rattling to deter the direct
intervention of NATO." (37) Meanwhile, the Kremlin positions its
economic weaponry to counter Western sanctions. Some [[Russia observers
foresee Russia's pursuit of "asymmetric means to hit back and impose
costs on the West]{.underline}]{.mark}. Cyberattacks, political
influence and disinformation campaigns, money laundering and corruption
efforts are few of the many tools in its toolbox." (38)

A new puzzle has emerged regarding [[whether it is a sixth-generation
war]{.underline}]{.mark} if we consider the disparity of weapons:
Russia's hard power and military tools versus the West's sanctions and
other restrictions of political economy. It
[[derives]{.underline}]{.mark} its significance [[from
Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[strategists' approach to
dividing the world into continental and oceanic "theatres of military
action"]{.underline}]{.mark} (teatri voennykh deistvii \[TVDs\]). Chief
of Russia's General Staff, Army General Valery Gerasimov, explained the
role of the military in operations in Syria since September 2015 with an
emphasis on the "limited" application of hard power, culminating in
articulating this as an emerging "strategy of limited actions", [[by
waging "non-contact" warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} and employing
"high-precision weapons systems". (39)

The idea of a possible [[sixth-generation war builds
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the differences of the fifth-generation warfare
([[5GW]{.underline}]{.mark}), which is conducted primarily [[through
**non-kinetic**-military action, such as]{.underline}]{.mark} social
engineering, misinformation, [[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[along with emerging technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} [such as
[artificial intelligence and fully autonomous
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. The term "fifth-generation warfare",
coined in 2003 by Robert Steele, has been described as a war of
\"information and perception\". (40) However, there is a debate whether
fourth-generation wars "had yet to fully materialize". (41)

[[Kaliningrad]{.underline}]{.mark} is located between Lithuania and

[[receives]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[supplies via

Belarus]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[However, Moscow can **still** supply it by sea without being subject

Amid Western fears that Lithuania might be on Russia\'s list of targets
after Ukraine, [[the European Union]{.underline}]{.mark} ambassador
[[called]{.underline}]{.mark} [[on Moscow to solve
the]{.underline}]{.mark} problem of crossing to [[Kaliningrad
diplomatically]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In the midst of this tension, German Chancellor Olaf Schulz confirmed,
on June 21, 2022, his country\'s strong support for Lithuania and the
Eastern European allies.

On the other hand, [[the United States stressed to
Lithuania]{.underline}]{.mark}, a member of NATO,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} any attack on a NATO member would be
considered an attack on the entire alliance.

It is noteworthy that [[one of the main pillars of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} alliance [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the
concept of collective defense, known as [[Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark}, and this means that [[if a member is attacked,
it is considered an attack on the **entire
alliance**]{.underline}]{.mark} with all members having an obligation to
protect each other.

In turn, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said that
his country is implementing the sanctions imposed by the EU, noting that
the measures that were implemented were taken after consulting with the
European Commission and in accordance with its guidelines.

"Russian goods subject to EU sanctions will no longer be allowed to
cross Lithuanian territory," Landsbergis added.

These are immediate implications of the West's response to the
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} war. In the long run, economic sanctions,
support for the Ukrainian military, and NATO expansion might eventually
drag Putin down. But the opposite scenario might also be true. The
Western unity might fail to sustain the stress-testing of the war. The
sanctions are costly for Russia, but so they are for Europe. The
European population might grow tired of skyrocketing fuel prices, which
undermine the competitiveness of Europe's industries, and the impending
food crisis, which will affect large swathes of the population. A new
generation of politicians might come to power and start reconsidering
their relations with Russia and NATO. In any scenario, the conflict
[[seems to have]{.underline}]{.mark} passed the point of no return and
[[morphed into a long-term open confrontation between Russia and the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}, when both sides are more interested in
prevailing in the ongoing Ukraine crisis than in preventing it, which is
detrimental for Ukraine as an independent state.

[[In a geopolitical deadlock]{.underline}]{.mark} like this, [[the only
workable proposal]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[both Russia and the West
could accept without looking like a losing side should have **explicit
humanitarian** grounds]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[a common denominator
for negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, [[the goal of
saving lives in Ukraine should **explicitly prevail** over the
geopolitical logic of weakening Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. The West
should work with Kyiv and Moscow to broker an internationally-guaranteed
neutrality status for Ukraine. Such an agreement must go beyond just
Moscow and Kyiv and involve multiple stakeholders including the United
States, some of its European allies, and also China -- a de facto ally
of Russia. The key to success is to institutionalise the agreement by
making it nested in the existing networks of multilateral security
agreements, which will make breaking the agreement by either Russia or
Ukraine more difficult.

This is a momentous task for diplomats, and the final arrangement will
not be ideal and will involve some difficult decisions. For example,
Ukraine will have to reconsider its claims over Crimea. Russia will have
to at least compensate for the damage inflicted on Ukraine during the
war and contribute to the reconstruction in Ukraine. The West will have
to draw back from concentrating on punishing Russia and start helping
Ukraine instead, which means demonstrating leadership and working hard
on setting up the right incentive structure to compel both Ukraine and
Russia to sign the agreement.

Provided that the West's response is rapid enough, [[the situation may
not be as hopeless as it might look]{.underline}]{.mark}. While it is
extremely difficult to reverse Russia's
[[annexation]{.underline}]{.mark} and effective control
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} Crimea, the situation around [[Luhansk and
Donetsk]{.underline}]{.mark} Peoples Republics [[is not firmly settled
yet and there are no formal barriers]{.underline}]{.mark} for these
newly "independent" states [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} consider
[[reintegration]{.underline}]{.mark} with Ukraine if the incentives are
there. [[The goal now]{.underline}]{.mark} is not finding ideal
geopolitical solutions -- there is none. It [[is
about]{.underline}]{.mark} minimising the damage [[and working out an
arrangement]{.underline}]{.mark} justifiable [[from a **humanitarian**
standpoint]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Myth 2: NATO is aggressive and a threat to Russia

Fact: [[NATO is a defensive alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}, whose purpose
is to protect our members. [[NATO\'s official
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} is that \"the Alliance [[does not seek
confrontation and poses no threat to Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" NATO
didn\'t invade Georgia; NATO didn\'t invade Ukraine. Russia did.

NATO has reached out to Russia consistently and publicly over the past
30 years. We worked together on issues ranging from counter-narcotics
and counter-terrorism to submarine rescue and civil emergency planning
-- even during periods of NATO enlargement. However, in 2014, in
response to Russia\'s aggressive actions against Ukraine, NATO suspended
practical cooperation with Russia. We do not seek confrontation, but we
can\'t ignore Russia breaking international rules, undermining our
stability and security.

In response to Russia\'s use of military force against Ukraine, NATO
deployed four multinational battlegroups to the Baltic States and Poland
in 2016. These units are not permanently based in the region, are in
line with Allies\' international commitments, and amount to around 5,000
troops. They do not pose a threat to Russia\'s 1,000,000 strong army.
Before Russia\'s illegal annexation of Crimea, there were no Allied
troops in the eastern part of the Alliance.

The aftermath of [[the Ukraine war]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a protracted
complex conflict, has [[revealed]{.underline}]{.mark} how [[the
Russia-West geopolitical rivalry has entered **uncharted**
territories]{.underline}]{.mark} with an asymmetrical war and unparallel
weaponry: hard power versus sanctions and other tools of political
economy, or sticky power. It seems to be a misguided venture of power
dynamics: bullets and rockets versus economic and financial warfare,
perpetuating a long hurting stalemate for all stakeholders. This paper
addresses how [[the standoff]{.underline}]{.mark} between Putin\'s
Russia and Western powers [[may amount to a new geopolitical paradigm
shift and raises questions about the validity of certain conceptual
frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark}: the renewal of 'the Cold War', the
imposition of a 'New World Order', and the (im)balance of an assumed
'Balance of Power'. These post-World War II mechanics of Détente were
prolonged, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution
of the Soviet Union in 1991, into the 21st century. The 'post' prefix
endures [[the challenge of forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} what would
come [[after]{.underline}]{.mark} a three-decade prolongation of several
concepts ushering to [[several unknowns of the Ukraine war
postgame]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The ongoing dilemma of economic wars, besides the struggling armed
confrontation inside Ukraine since 24 February 2022, has [[implied the
need for a tabula-rasa re-conceptualisation]{.underline}]{.mark} of
alternative frameworks in [[international
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, another puzzle has emerged: is
it a 'sixth-generation war' if we consider the disparity of weapons:
Russia's hard power and military tools versus the West's sanctions and
other restrictions of the political economy and dominance of sticky
power? The question of a possible sixth-generation war builds on the
differences of the fifth-generation warfare (5GW), which is conducted
primarily through non-kinetic-military action, such as social
engineering, misinformation, cyberattacks, along with emerging
technologies such as artificial intelligence and fully autonomous
systems. (1)

Further cutting lines of communications and supply. At the operational
level, Russian commanders in this phase will be seized with the
importance of cutting ground lines of communication in western Ukraine
used to resupply Ukrainian forces and keep the war going. Surprisingly
effective Ukrainian air defense has inflicted heavy losses on Russian
aircraft, which often launch their weapons from Belarus or Russian
airspace. Aerial and missile fires can be employed against fixed sites
like storage or transshipment points, but, at present, the Russian army
does not have a strong ground presence in western Ukraine. Instead, more
highly trained special-operations units may be used to interdict ground
convoys. [[As the campaign unfolds, sustained foreign assistance will
mount in importance]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Russian desperation
increases, [[Putin will attempt to signal]{.underline}]{.mark} that
continued use of Polish and Romanian territory to supply Ukraine will
have [[drastic consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. Painful cyberattacks,
covert and deniable intelligence operations, and other hybrid methods
may be used for this purpose, including in the United States. [[In this
phase, Putin will not order direct attacks on]{.underline}]{.mark}
neighboring [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}
for fear of bringing the Alliance into the war.

Raising the specter of nuclear attack. [[As the crisis **worsens** for
Russia, the role of nuclear weapons will loom
**larger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this phase of escalation, [[more
strident threats to employ them will be accompanied
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[overt display]{.underline}]{.mark} of
tactical and strategic systems, publicized "drills," repositioning of
nuclear systems, and other activities intended to frighten and
intimidate. Use of primitive chemical agents like chlorine will become
more likely if campaign success eludes Russian forces. A demonstration
or "test" using a low-yield tactical nuclear weapon in a remote area
near the Ukrainian border could occur to add weight to these threats.
Russian journalists, academics, and retired military and intelligence
officers with contacts in the West will be enlisted to convey a
determination to escalate further, if necessary, though such measures
will carry extreme risk.

Days,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Nuclear Option(s)

[[The fall of the Russian army is only one possible scenario for this
war. Another is the Russian use of nuclear weapons. Putin could
authorize a nuclear strike to provide a massive psychological shock to
destroy Ukrainian resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}. The gap between
Russia's war aims, however reduced, and its military's capabilities to
achieve them might only be closed with nuclear weapons.

[[There are three nuclear options]{.underline}]{.mark}: a nuclear
[[demonstration]{.underline}]{.mark} over Ukrainian territory, a nuclear
strike against a major [[population]{.underline}]{.mark} center,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear strikes for
[[tactical]{.underline}]{.mark} purposes.

The first option, such as an airburst very high in the atmosphere over
Ukraine, could provide a warning of escalation to come without causing
the damage and fallout of a full strike. The Kremlin may believe it
could reap the benefit of nuclear coercion without paying the full price
of international outrage. This is probably a fallacy. The
[[breaking]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[the nuclear taboo in any way,
especially against a non-nuclear country that gave up its nuclear
weapons to Russia, will bring worldwide condemnation
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the ultimate in [[sanctions and isolation for
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is also a chance that this would only
further strengthen Ukrainian resolve to resist.

The second option---a strategic strike against a major Ukrainian
city---would aim to harm Ukraine so greatly that its government would
sue for peace to avoid further destruction. It is a horrific possibility
that might be tempered by several factors. The first is the reluctance
of those in the chain of command to follow that order for moral or
practical reasons, anticipating worldwide revulsion. A second factor
could be the difficulty in target selection to not destroy a large
Russian-speaking population (Odessa and Kharkiv), the mother of Russian
civilization (Kyiv), or a city close to NATO territory (Lviv). Finally,
the Russian chain of command might hesitate to conduct a strategic
nuclear strike fearing that instead of terrorizing Ukrainian society, it
might embolden it to resist and refuse to ever surrender or negotiate.

The third option---nuclear strikes to affect the tactical situation on
the battlefield---offers Russia a way to use firepower to make up for
deficiencies of manpower. In theory, "small" nuclear strikes of one,
five, or ten kilotons could punch holes in Ukrainian lines to allow
Russian forces to penetrate, encircle, and route the Ukrainian army.

However, Ukrainian forces are not concentrated enough to provide a
lucrative target for nuclear weapons. This is a war of company- and
battalion-sized units fighting in dispersed formations. Destroying one
or several such formations is unlikely to unhinge any defensive line,
which could be reestablished by other forces a few miles back. Would
such minor tactical gains be worth the further punishment to Russia's
economy that international reaction would bring? Furthermore, the
effects of blast, radiation, and fallout can affect Russia's own forces.
An airburst---the best way to reduce fallout---over a fortified urban
area may kill many of the defenders but also destroy it in a way so that
mechanized forces cannot move through. Russian forces, like Union forces
during the Civil War's Battle of the Crater, could find themselves
trapped in the destruction of their own making.

Russia would also need to consider the effect of nuclear fallout on its
troops and citizens. The NUKEMAP interactive site, created by nuclear
historian Alexander Wellerstein, estimates that a five-kiloton airburst
will create a 500-rem radiation radius of one kilometer.\[30\] Per the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, humans exposed to 500 rems of
radiation without medical treatment will die. Doses between 300 and 400
rems offer a 50 percent chance of death within 60 days.\[31\] After a
non-strategic nuclear attack, advancing Russian forces therefore must
bypass the strike area but then would move into territory not totally
affected by the strike and possibly still defended.

If part of an airburst reaches the ground or if there is a deliberate
ground burst, then fallout would follow the winds. In the spring, the
prevailing winds in northern, southern, and eastern Ukraine are easterly
or southeasterly, causing fallout to move into the Donetsk People's
Republic, Luhansk People's Republic, Crimea, or Russia itself. In the
summer, prevailing winds become northwesterly and westerly, which could
bring fallout into Belarus or NATO countries.\[32\] While the Russians
showed little regard for the safety of their troops occupying Chernobyl,
they cannot ignore the basic realities of tactical nuclear warfare.

This very simplified review of nuclear weapons effects is meant to
illustrate that the actual application of tactical nuclear weapons is
not a panacea or magic wand to sweep away enemy forces. They may still
(God forbid) be used in this war, but the tactical advantages they offer
may not be worth the tactical challenges or strategic costs they bring.

Escalation triggers

As Putin and his senior advisers consider options, conditions on the
ground will drive their calculus. [[Should the Russian military manage
to recover its footing]{.underline}]{.mark} and resume progress, however
halting, [[more extreme options may be **held in
reserve**.]{.underline}]{.mark} If the campaign evolves into a "frozen"
conflict, like the Donbas but on a larger scale, Putin's focus will
shift to destabilizing the Volodymyr Zelenskyy regime in Kyiv and
sanctions relief. [[Should Ukraine achieve decisive
success]{.underline}]{.mark} in recovering its national territory,
[[Putin's **survival** may be at risk, and incentives to employ harsher
and more **high-risk** measures will **grow**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** to each of the below "rungs"
[[will depend on Putin's perception]{.underline}]{.mark} and assessment
of how the campaign is progressing and the prospects for ultimate
success or failure. Though speculative, [[likely triggers for
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} into each subsequent phase of the
conflict [[might include]{.underline}]{.mark}

> an assessment that the campaign has stalled temporarily and different
> approaches are needed to regain momentum;
>
> an [[assessment]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the campaign has stalled
> outright]{.underline}]{.mark} and recovery is unlikely without more
> extreme measures; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
>
> an assessment [[that defeat is imminent]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that
> Putin may fall from power, placing all his options on the table.

As the conflict drags on, NATO and European Union (EU) actions can be
decisive one way or the other, as described further below.

#### Ukraine defeat risks Putin nuclear escalation

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

[[Transitioning the conflict in Ukraine into a frozen conflict lasting
**years**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as has been done in the Donbas since
2014, [[may be Putin's best option **now**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A
resolute Ukrainian government and highly motivated Ukrainian forces will
continue to fight to reassert sovereignty over the national territory.
[[Continued Western support will enable Ukrainian forces to grow
**stronger**]{.underline}]{.mark}, though it may not be possible to
retake the areas newly controlled by Russia without more armor and
combat aircraft. [[In this scenario, Putin will have to consider more
extreme and high-risk strategies to stave off defeat, prevent economic
collapse, divert public opinion, and stay in power]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Even more than success in Ukraine, [[regime survival will become the
overriding priority]{.underline}]{.mark}.

With this in mind, what escalatory options could Putin choose?

Employing cyber tools. Under such desperate circumstances, Putin may
elect to employ the full scope of his offensive cyber capabilities,
which are formidable. Repeatedly in recent years, Russian cyber weapons
have been employed successfully. While Russia has employed its cyber
tools at the tactical level to some success in Ukraine, for reasons that
remain somewhat unclear, the potential strategic effects of these
weapons have been held in reserve so far in the campaign. Potential
targets could include critical infrastructure such as power and
transportation grids, nuclear-power plants, healthcare systems,
government operations, the financial sector, and military command and
control in the United States and Europe. These attacks would certainly
invite retaliation, but Putin may see them as warranted to stave off
defeat and preserve his regime.

Employing WMD. Putin may also choose to resort to weapons of mass
destruction to cow the Ukrainian public and frighten off Western
support. This could take the form of chemical strikes using
military-grade chemical agents, such as nerve or mustard gas (although a
signatory to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, Russia is known to
retain substantial stocks). Russia has already accused Ukraine and the
United States of establishing chemical- and biological-weapons
facilities inside Ukraine, a likely precursor to its own use. Russian
formations field organic nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC)
protection units at all levels, from brigade to combined-arms army, and
Russian planners will surely contemplate using them if faced with a
humiliating defeat.

Employing nuclear weapons. [[Use of tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} inside Ukraine [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[a possibility]{.underline}]{.mark} in a last bid to achieve
military success, although senior Russian military officials may balk at
such an extraordinarily risky step. As NATO's nuclear umbrella does not
extend over Ukraine, Putin may discount the chance of retaliation. An
added benefit could be a sharp warning of Russia's willingness to use
nuclear weapons if provoked---for example, if NATO ultimately entered
the conflict to save a foundering Ukraine. This option would take the
form of low-yield tactical weapons, launched from aircraft or field
artillery, or delivered via Iskander-M short-ranged ballistic missiles
or Kalibr cruise missiles. Such use would not necessarily lead to
uncontrolled escalation, and is well within the calculus of Russian
military doctrine. The shock of such an event would be profound, and
could lead to Ukraine's submission or acceptance of unfavorable terms.
[[Similarly, Russian forces could engineer a nuclear "accident"
involving]{.underline}]{.mark} one or more of
[[Ukraine's]{.underline}]{.mark} fifteen
[[reactors]{.underline}]{.mark}, located at Yuzhnukraines, Rivne,
Khmelnitsky, and Zaporizhzhia. (Chernobyl, located one hundred
kilometers north of Kyiv, is not operational, but still houses large
amounts of radioactive material.) The spread of radioactive fallout
would, however, be very weather dependent, making this a very high-risk
venture. Unquestionably, Russia would be condemned even by its few
remaining supporters, to say nothing of an aroused and angry
international community. At this stage, Russia is already an
international pariah, with little moral currency left to lose. Ordering
[[the use of tactical nuclear weapons could well be game changing. It
might also drive Putin from power]{.underline}]{.mark}.

objectives lock]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia and Ukraine
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}to [[a war of attrition with little hope of a

could provide Russia with some tactical successes and a propaganda
victory but probably not a strategic one. In fact, [[further losses
could]{.underline}]{.mark} weaken the Russian army to the point that it
enables later Ukrainian counterattacks or even
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[the Russian army to
**fracture**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Leaders in Moscow may find that a

Now the West is supporting an unnecessary war, playing with fire as it
builds up [[Ukrainian]{.underline}]{.mark} firepower, a country whose
[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}, if it finds itself losing badly,
[[would probably have no qualms about using NATO weapons to fire into
Russia, thus provoking a Russian attack on nearby NATO
members]{.underline}]{.mark}. That could lead to a Third World War. To
his credit, [[Biden would **not tolerate** such a Ukrainian
offensive]{.underline}]{.mark}.

If only Zelensky had said in the days leading up to the Russian
invasion, "Ukraine has no attention of applying for NATO membership"---
9 words---which in fact is the de facto position of NATO---there would
have been no Russian invasion. By his refusal to do this he has created
a situation where parts of whole towns have been destroyed---in the case
of Mariupol, totally destroyed. [[Ukraine has no money to rebuild its
country, and]{.underline}]{.mark} it should be aware of the likelihood
that [[the West will never give]{.underline}]{.mark} it anything like
[[the full amount]{.underline}]{.mark} of what it will need.

Ukraine is now burdened by the fast-growing number of the quite
unnecessary deaths of its young solders, with all the concomitant pain
that is heaped on their loved ones. Plus, the killing of thousands upon
thousands of innocent civilians. For what? To defend the macho egos of
Zelensky and his fellow rulers. Zelensky in the days before the invasion
had peace within his grasp, but he threw it away as casually as he would
a cigarette packet with his refusal to say Ukraine would not seek to
enter NATO.

The great English poet and writer Rudyard Kipling wrote about the First
World War in which his son died, "If any question why we died, tell them
because our fathers lied". So, it is with Ukraine.

#### Ukrainian conflict risks elevating Iran -- several ways

Implications for the RSII coalition,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,
Acc:6-29-2022)

On a regional level, [[the second Russo-Ukrainian
war]{.underline}]{.mark} could potentially be an opportunity for Tehran.
The war could [[create a rift between Russia and
Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite Israel's efforts to remain seated
on the fence. However, the increasing number of Ukrainian Jews fleeing
to Israel has put Israeli officials in an uncomfortable position,
driving many of them to take a stand against Russia, including Israel's
Foreign Minister, Arie Lapid, who condemned Russia's aggression in
Ukraine saying that the Kremlin's decision had no "justification" and
that "the ground \[of Ukraine\] is soaked with the blood of innocent
civilians."\[12\] Russia promptly responded to Lapid's comment by
summoning Israel's ambassador and accusing Israel of using the war in
Ukraine to "distract" international attention from the Palestinian
issue.\[13\]

If the current Russo-Israeli conflict escalates further, [[Iran might
find itself in an advantageous position with regard to the future of its
military cooperation with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially since
Israel, prior to these events, always played a central role in Moscow's
considerations when it came to arms deals with Iran. Prior to the
Russo-Ukrainian war, at the request of Israel, Russia refrained,
multiple times, from suppling Iran with offensive weapons that could
disrupt the balance of power between Iran and Israel.\[14\] But now that
events in Ukraine have shaken Russo-Israeli relations, it would be
reasonable for Iran to hope that Russia has liberated itself from the
"Israeli factor" with regard to Russo-Persian arms deals.

Another regional impact of the Russo-Ukraine war on Iran concerns
Russo-Persian cooperation in Syria. [[Russia's military focus in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} has forced Moscow to withdraw a significant
part of its forces from Syria.\[15\] The Russian withdrawal from Syria
[[will create a vacuum of power which Iran has already started
filling]{.underline}]{.mark} by deploying Iranian forces and Shia
militias to replace Russian troops in Syria.\[16\] This would likely
make the Assad regime more than ever dependent on Iran, which would give
Iran the advantage of expanding its influence over Syria. Given that
many, including US and British officials, believe that the
Russo-Ukrainian war will drag on for years,\[17\] Assad once again might
have to consider Iran as its major ally, which increases the political
value of Iran for Syria.

[[The timing of this rising opportunity for Iran could not have been
better]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many in Iran were worried that Russia,
having secured major construction and investment agreements with Syria,
was outpacing Iran in collecting the spoils of war in the post-civil war
era.\[18\] However, now that Russia is gradually departing, the
strategic value of Iran's presence in Syria is growing, Tehran might
find itself in a position to benefit from the Syrian regime by signing
construction contracts or obtaining rights of exploration in Syria's
mineral mines and oil fields, which Iran has had its eyes on for a long
time.\[19\] [[This would provide Iran with a window of opportunity to
catch up with Russia in Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} and also to make-up
for part of the financial resources expended by Iran during the Civil
War.

#### Ukrainian conflict destabilizes Syria

Acc:6-29-2022)

Syria

As previously mentioned, the most apparent impacts of the
Russo-Ukrainian war on Syria have a security and military dimension.
Even though today we can safely argue that [[Assad has regained control
of two-thirds of his country]{.underline}]{.mark}, including most of the
central, southern, and Mediterranean coastal regions,\[20\] and has
successfully secured his political survival, [[this does not mean that
the war in Syria is over]{.underline}]{.mark}; for as long as the war
persists, the tide can still be turned. The timing of the Russians'
retreat from Syria is a very sensitive issue for Damascus as it comes at
a time when US special operation forces based in Syria's al-Tanf are
still operative,\[21\] large areas of northern Syria are still occupied
by Turkish Armed Forces,\[22\] and a coalition of nearly 100 thousand
armed rebels under the leadership of the Syrian National Army and Syrian
National Front for Liberation are still active.\[23\] Thus, Assad's
struggles to take back control of all territories and his need for
foreign support are not over yet.

At this point, [[it seems that the only solution to the Russian pull-out
for the pro-Assad coalition is to replace Russians with
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}-led forces. However, one can say that [[this
solution has one major disadvantage: Iran's lack of sufficient military
capability to replace the Russian Air Force and
Navy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Iran, indeed, has the resources to make up
for the absence of Russian manpower, but the efficiency and primary
function of Russia's campaign in Syria has never been based on manpower.
Russian forces barely participate in any battleground fights, and their
operations have primarily been limited to aerial and naval bombardment.
In fact, Russia's navy and air force firepower was what pro-Assad forces
needed to turn the tide of war\[24\] and recapture most of the areas
that Assad lost prior to Russian military intervention in Syria in 2015.

In addition to [[Iran's]{.underline}]{.mark} lack of capability to make
up for the absence of Russia's firepower, its [[endeavors to fill
Russia's place in Syria might provoke Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}, who
has already bombed the positions of Iran-backed forces in Syria more
than 200 times.\[25\] Russia's heavy involvement in Ukraine combined
with Iran's growing presence in Syria might encourage Tel Aviv to
increase its attacks on pro-Iran forces in Syria, [[which might lead to
further escalation between Iran and Israe]{.mark}l]{.underline},
resulting in the renewed destabilization of Syria.

The implications of the Russo-Ukrainian war for Syria are not just at
the regional level; in fact, Syria could be severely impacted on an
international level, especially given the current global climate in
which the US is pressing its own allies, such as Israel,\[26\] to take a
stronger stand against Russia. It is likely that the White House will
apply harsher economic and diplomatic sanctions, which could include
imposing a blockade or increasing its support for anti-government forces
in countries within Russia's sphere of influence, including Syria.
Damascus would be a suitable target for the West since, relatively
speaking, in comparison to Russia's other spheres of influence, such as
Belarus and Central Asian regimes, Syria is further away from Moscow,
and thus would require a more substantial number of resources and
efforts for Russia to counter the West there. In addition, in the last
few years, the Kremlin's propaganda machine has taken great pride in
Russia's military success in Syria.\[27\] Hence the change of status quo
in Syria would be a severe blow to Kremlin's military prestige. However,
we should keep in mind that [[targeting Syria is a perilous choice and
likely would result in the destabilization of Syria, which could spur
the re-emergence of terrorist groups, as was the case with
ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2014.

Overall, it seems that in comparison to Iran, Syria is likely to face
harsher consequences, and only time will tell how the Kremlin's war in
Ukraine will reshape Assad's destiny in Syria.

\"The Evolving Political-Military Aims in the War in Ukraine After 100
Days,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

The Tactical Situation

The Battle of the [[Donbas has been a meat grinder]{.underline}]{.mark}
for both sides. Each army is losing several hundred soldiers killed or
wounded daily.\[17\] While the Ukrainian army has conducted a stubborn
defense, the Russian army has advanced on the flanks of the exposed
Ukrainian salient in Donbas. The easternmost edge of the salient is at
the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, and its flanks are near the
towns of Popasna and Dronivka. Russian advances taking Popasna and
spreading out across the base of this salient threaten Joint Force
Organization units along the Siverskyi Donets River. There has also been
Russian progress to the west of this salient in the vicinity of Lyman.

The Kremlin would likely consider further advances requiring the
evacuation of this salient and the surrender of Severdonetsk and
Lysychansk a major step forward in achieving its political goal of
"liberating" all of Donetsk and Luhansk. However, this accomplishes
little strategically unless Russian forces encircle and capture tens of
thousands of Ukrainian troops. Based on previous Russian rates of
advance, the Ukrainians should be able to withdraw in good order if a
decision to conduct a tactical retreat is made in a timely manner.
[[Occupying all of Donetsk and Luhansk]{.underline}]{.mark} oblasts up
to their administrative borders [[accomplishes **nothing**
strategically]{.mark}, beyond a short-term propaganda
victory]{.underline}, if it does not destroy the Joint Force
Organization Group. Furthermore, it does nothing to prevent the flow of
Western arms and ammunition into Ukraine to increase the size and
capabilities of the Ukrainian army. Therefore, a tactical defeat in
Donbas is not a strategic defeat for Ukraine if it is able to preserve a
large part of its army or if the ongoing efforts to enlarge and equip
its army are successful. It is not a strategic victory for Russia if it
ends up destroying its army through high casualties, which cannot be
replaced anytime soon, and crushed morale.

The Strategic Situation

The [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n military [[is expending thousands of
lives]{.underline}]{.mark} in Donbas to make incremental, almost World
War I--style, advances [[over terrain that has no real strategic
value.]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia is fighting a war of attrition. In
the past, Russia and the Soviet Union had the manpower to make this an
effective strategy. However, Russia today no longer has the mechanisms
to recruit, train, equip, officer, and deploy substantial new military
formations.

In early April, I estimated Russia had suffered approximately 10,000
soldiers killed in action (KIA) and a total of 35,000--38,000
casualties. It is still hard to estimate losses, but if Russian
killed-in-action figures are now, per British intelligence estimates,
roughly 15,000, then total casualties by early June could be
approximately 50,000 men.\[18\]

Who will replace them? The 130,000 Russian conscripts called up on April
1, 2022, are not supposed to go to a war zone (but many will). Putin,
probably fearing social unrest, passed up the opportunity on Victory Day
on May 9 to declare war and announce a general mobilization of Russian
manpower.

Without a general mobilization, how can the Russian army meet wartime
requirements and replace its losses? As word of horrible combat
conditions reaches the population, recruiting of contract soldiers will
suffer. It probably already has, based on the extreme decision to allow
up to 50-year-old men to volunteer.\[19\] Many contract soldiers are
already announcing their intention to leave the army or refuse to serve
in the "special military operation" that Moscow claims is not a war.
Increased conscription cannot make up for recruiting shortfalls in a
country where evading military service is practically a national sport.

If enough soldiers are found, who will lead them? Even before the war,
Russia was having a difficult time retaining junior officers.\[20\] In
this war, officers of all levels have borne an extraordinary brunt of
casualties. Many officer cadets have graduated early to participate in
the war. Furthermore, who will train the new soldiers? Basic and
advanced training in Russia's army is done at the individual unit level,
but many training officers and noncommissioned officers have already
deployed with their units to Ukraine. This leaves limited cadres at home
to instruct new conscripts.\[21\] Metaphorically speaking, the Russian
army is eating its seed corn.

If enough enlisted men and junior officers can be found to serve as
replacements for the tens of thousands of casualties, can Russia equip
them with modern weapons? Equipment losses are catastrophic. The Oryx
website, using conservative, thoroughly documented confirmation
techniques, estimates that as of the end of May 2022, Russia had lost
741 tanks, 1,342 armored/infantry fighting vehicles, and 27 fixed-wing
combat aircraft.\[22\] Actual losses are likely higher.

Besides these losses, vehicles, airplanes, and helicopters involved in
three months of nonstop fighting require major refitting, which is
unlikely to happen while combat operations are underway. War can exhaust
machines as well as men, and without proper maintenance, existing
hardware will become incapable of supporting operations. New
replacements for destroyed equipment will not be coming. Russia's main
tank factories have shut down due to sanctions, which have also hobbled
its aircraft industry.\[23\] T-62 tanks have been pulled out of reserve,
but half-century-old tanks are no answer to modern anti-tank
weapons.\[24\] Decades of munitions production have been used up in
three months, and the decline in the use of guided and cruise missiles
indicates that precision-guided weapons are in short supply.\[25\]

Ukraine is also facing serious military difficulties. It has not
concentrated enough forces in Donbas to match Russia's current
quantitative edge, and it too is suffering high casualties. The previous
article in early April estimated that Ukraine had suffered approximately
3,100 killed in action and 16,000--18,000 casualties of all types. On
April 16, President Zelensky announced that Ukraine had suffered between
2,500 and 3,000 killed in action and an additional 10,000 wounded.
Extrapolating from these figures to the present, Ukrainian military KIA
figures could be approaching 6,000 men and approximately 25,000 total
casualties due to the high intensity of the battles of the Donbas and
Mariupol.\[26\] Per Oryx, Ukraine has lost 186 tanks, 276
armored/infantry fighting vehicles, and 22 fixed-wing combat aircraft,
but these again are conservative figures.\[27\] Attrition warfare is
cutting both ways. The winner may be the side that lasts just a moment
longer than the other.

There are strategic differences between Russian and Ukrainian losses.
[[Ukraine is in a better position to replenish its
losses]{.underline}]{.mark} of men and materiel. It can afford to trade
some territory for time to assimilate Western supplies. With incoming
weapons from the West and the training of new volunteers, [[the
Ukrainian army will grow in numbers and capabilities, while the Russian
army is unlikely to]{.underline}]{.mark}. When ready, Ukraine will have
the forces to counterattack. The Croatian army did the same after losing
territory in 1992 to Serbian forces. By 1995, with Western tutoring and
supplies, Croatia had rebuilt its army and counterattacked, forcing the
Serbs out of the Krajina region within a week. [[Ukraine could play
a]{.underline}]{.mark} similar "[[long game]{.underline}]{.mark}."

#### Russia reliance on China hurts India

This war has many implications for India's strategic posture. Ideally,
[[India would have liked a normal relationship between Russia and the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}. The war has created a lot of economic
difficulties, particularly through the hike in oil prices and through
its cascading impact on general inflation, and this is a big concern for
the government which is going to face the general election in the two
years' time. The government is taking it very seriously and is trying to
contain the inflation through subsidies, but obviously it has
implications on the fiscal balance.

The second implication is on [[India's defense
preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[has been affected in two
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}. One is through sanctions. [[There are
sanctions on Russian banks]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[so]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[India]{.underline}]{.mark}n government
[[has difficulty in paying for Russian defense
supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The war]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[also disturbed
Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} companies' [[focus on]{.underline}]{.mark}
executing [[contracts with India]{.underline}]{.mark}, and there are
certain delays and some modernization projects that have been affected.

But [[the biggest geopolitical fallout]{.underline}]{.mark} of the war
[[is Russia and China coming together]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Tai said,
Russia is increasingly becoming the junior partner of China and [[that
will have implications for India because China is India's biggest
strategic rival and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[historically, Russia has been
a big supporter of India]{.underline}]{.mark} in various forms,
including in the UN Security Council. Going forward, it's unclear
whether that will be the case. The key factor that will drive India's
relationship with Russia will be the Chinese factor.

Russia forming a strong partnership with China has not been to India's
strategic advantage. Having said that, India knows that its future lies
with the West. [[Strategic concerns about Beijing is increasingly
pushing India closer to the U.S., Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, and other
countries, particularly, [[Australia and Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}. At
the same time, India will also try to retain a degree of strategic
autonomy which that has been India's DNA for a long time.

On sanctions on Russia, India won't be party to the West-led
geoeconomics order because India itself has been a victim of sanctions
in the past. So India will try to maintain some balance of autonomy, but
I think its future lies more with the West than with Russia.

### Kaliningrad outweighs

#### Kaliningrad risks global escalation -- fastest scenario

\"Will Kaliningrad Ignite the Spark of Confrontation Between NATO and
Russia?,\" Al-Estiklal Newspaper (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

A Flashpoint in Tensions

For a long time, Kaliningrad was part of Germany, but the exclave became
part of Russia in 1946 and was formally occupied by the Soviet Union
after the war in Europe ended.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and then the accession of
Poland and the Baltic states to the EU in 2004, the problem of the
movement of Russian citizens and the transport of goods to and from
Kaliningrad arose, and a way was reached for the transit of individuals
and goods for the residents of the region according to procedures agreed
upon by Russia, Poland, Lithuania, and the EU.

The Suwałki Gap, with a length of about 104 km, was established on the
land border between Poland and Lithuania, linking the territory of
Belarus (allied with Russia) with Kaliningrad.

During the past period, Kaliningrad was the subject of controversy
between Russia and European countries, as former Deputy Minister of
Defense of Poland Romuald Sheremetiev called for the need to disarm
Kaliningrad, describing the region as a powder keg on which NATO sits.

Weeks ago, NATO began massive naval exercises in the Baltic Sea near the
Russian exclave for a period of two weeks, with the participation of 16
countries, including Finland and Sweden.

According to press reports, [[Moscow is using Kaliningrad to threaten
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, as its port is free of ice all year round,
unlike many Russian ports. As it is also headquarters to its Baltic
Fleet, [[the exclave served as a stronghold during both World
Wars]{.underline}]{.mark} and a defensive fortress during the Cold War.

Moscow announced [[last month]{.underline}]{.mark} that in Kaliningrad,
[[the Russian army simulated the launch of **nuclear**
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} at imagined hostile sites in Europe.

However, [[Sweden expressed its **fears**]{.underline}]{.mark} of using
that area to launch [[a naval attack]{.underline}]{.mark} on its island
of Gotland in the Baltic Sea.

The same fears were expressed by NATO, which indicated that [[Moscow
could use the exclave to invade Poland and
Lithuania]{.underline}]{.mark} by creating a land corridor from its
territory to Belarus.

According to observers, [[any direct Russian attack on
Lithuania]{.underline}]{.mark}, a member of NATO, will be seen as an act
of war against NATO and [[may ignite World War III]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While [[Moscow believes]{.underline}]{.mark} that NATO\'s expansion in
northwest Europe near its borders is based on long-term plans and that
the inclusion of [[Finland and Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
alliance [[came to impose a siege on the Kaliningrad
exclave]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Russian fleet in the Baltic Sea.

Andrey Gurulyov, member of the Duma\'s defense committee, said that
[[London would be the **first** city]{.underline}]{.mark} to be
[[bombed]{.underline}]{.mark} by Russia [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[siege of Kaliningrad]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[led to a
war]{.underline}]{.mark} with NATO.

Expected Scenarios

In turn, political researcher Mahmoud Alloush stressed in a statement to
Al-Estiklal that "the [[Kaliningrad]{.underline}]{.mark} issue
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[turn into a **new**
flashpoint]{.underline}]{.mark} between Moscow and NATO, in light of the
great collapse in Russian-Western relations."

"Lithuania\'s restrictions on transit between Russia and Kaliningrad,
even if they are part of the implementation of sanctions, threaten to
further exacerbate tension with Russia," he pointed out.

"[[Europe has no interest in fueling the conflict with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[this requires a **smart policy** in
applying sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} so that their application does
not lead to the isolation of Kaliningrad from Russia," he noted.

Mr. Alloush also stressed that "the agreements concluded between
Lithuania and Russia prior to its accession to the EU in 2004 included
the free passage of goods and people along the railway line between
Russia and Kaliningrad, but EU sanctions against Russia give Vilnius the
power to inspect shipments to ensure that no prohibited goods are
transported through its territory."

"The Suwałki Gap is Russia's only land supply link to Kaliningrad.
Moscow views these steps as an attempt to restrict its access to its own
territory. It treats this issue as a security threat to it before it is
a restriction on the transit of its goods to and from Kaliningrad," he
continued.

"The Russian attack on Ukraine revealed that [[the rules that had
deterred Russia during the past decades from attacking NATO members in
the Baltics **no longer exist**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Mr. Alloush
pointed out.

"NATO seeks to adapt to the profound transformations that occurred in
the European security structure as a result of the war by strengthening
the Eastern Front and bringing in new members to it," he explained.

However, an analysis by the Economist magazine revealed the difficulties
that Moscow would face, if it saw its exploitation, in the event of a
war with its neighbors or NATO.

Kaliningrad is a region that provides Russia\'s first line of defense
from the west, says Jonas Kjellen, an analyst at FOI, Sweden's state
defense-research agency, noting that this region is full of radar
systems that provide air surveillance of central Europe.

According to the Economist, Russia supplied Kaliningrad in 2012 with the
Russian S-400 long-range missile defense system, and in 2016, it sent
short-range Iskander missiles, bringing nuclear warheads uncomfortably
close to European cities.

In turn, the Kremlin justified this by saying that it is a necessary
step to confront the growing US military presence in the region.

Although Russia has not admitted to having nuclear weapons [[in
Kaliningrad]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [Federation of American Scientists
concluded in 2018]{.underline} that [[the Kremlin had significantly
modernized a nuclear weapons cache]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region,
based on an analysis of satellite imagery.

According to a study by the Rand Corporation for Strategic Research,
Russia\'s [[seizure of the Suwałki Gap]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
the most important gap in the defenses of the Western Alliance, will cut
off the Baltic states and Poland from its allies, isolate the northern
region of NATO, paralyze communications, and complicate aid to it.

"This [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} contribute to the possibility of [[the
fall of]{.mark}]{.underline} the capitals of [[Estonia and Latvia within
sixty hours]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as the ability of advanced
Russian air defense systems to disrupt the airspace in the Baltic states
and Poland," the study revealed.

It is noteworthy that Russia deploys in Kaliningrad, according to
Western figures, about 200,000 of its forces, a number of S-400 and
S-300 air defense batteries, the Iskander-M long-range ballistic missile
system, in addition to the Baltiysk naval base where the Russian Baltic
Fleet is based.

[More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and NATO-allied
countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a
single \"nuclear warning shot,\" according to a terrifying new
simulation. [The simulation is called \"Plan A]{.mark},\"]{.underline}
and it\'s an audio-visual piece that was first posted to to YouTube on
September 6. (You can watch the full video at the end of this story.)
Researchers at the Science and Global Security lab at Princeton
University created the animation, [which shows how [a battle between
Russia and NATO allies that uses]{.mark} so-called low-yield or
\"[tactical\" nuclear weapons]{.mark} --- which can pack a blast
equivalent to those the US used to destroy Hiroshima or Nagasaki in
World War II --- [might]{.mark} feasibly and quickly [snowball into a
global nuclear war]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"This project is motivated by
the need to highlight the potentially catastrophic consequences of
current US and Russian nuclear war plans. **[[The risk of nuclear war
has increased dramatically]{.mark} in the past two
years]{.underline}**,\" the project states on its website. The video has
an ominous, droning soundtrack and a digital map design straight out of
the 1983 movie \"WarGames.\" The Cold War-era movie, in which a young
Matthew Broderick accidentally triggers a nuclear war, \"was exactly the
reference point,\" simulation designer Alex Wellerstein told Insider.
But while simulations can be frightening, they can also be incredibly
helpful: governments can use them to develop contingency plans to
respond to nuclear disasters and attacks in the least escalatory way,
and they can also help ordinary citizens learn how to survive a nuclear
attack. \"[[Plan A\" comes as tensions between Russia and NATO allies
ratchet up]{.mark}. Both Russia and the US are testing weapons
previously banned under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty,
often called INF. Russian bombers have also cruised into US airspace
repeatedly, and the US recently sent its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber on a
mission **[in the Arctic]{.mark}** --- right in Russia\'s backyard.
[This is how a]{.mark} NATO-Russian [confrontation could quickly
escalate into nuclear war.]{.mark} The simulation starts with a
conventional war between NATO and Russian troops. [Conventional
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} --- namely all conflict short of nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons --- [[escalates into nuclear warfare when
Russia launches a]{.mark} nuclear \"[warning shot]{.mark}\" from a base
near Kaliningrad **[to stop NATO advancement]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Russia doesn\'t have a \"no first use\" policy --- it dropped it in
1993. [[NATO forces respond]{.mark} by launching a tactical nuclear
strike. The US already has tactical nuclear weapons, such as B61-12
gravity bombs, and more planned under US President Donald Trump\'s 2018
Nuclear Posture Review. Included in the plan is a low-yield warhead
intended for use in a submarine-launched ballistic missile, as well as a
sea-launched cruise missile. These kinds of weapons are designed for
targets on the battlefield, like troops or munitions supplies, as
opposed to long- or intermediate-range nuclear missiles that are fired
from one country to another, for example, targeting an enemy\'s bombers
and ICBM silos --- or even cities. [Tactical nuclear strikes up the
ante]{.mark}. If the nuclear threshold is crossed, the simulation finds,
then both the US and Russia would respond with tactical nuclear weapons.
[Russia would send 300 warheads]{.mark} to NATO targets, including
advancing troops, in both aircraft and short-range missiles ---
overwhelming force that would obliterate tanks, fortified positions and
soldiers unlike anything ever seen in battle before. Supporting [forces
and civilians not immediately killed would be susceptible to]{.mark}
painful and even fatal [radiation]{.mark} exposure. NATO would respond
by sending about 180 tactical nuclear weapons to Russia via aircraft in
equally devastating retaliation.]{.underline} The simulation was
constructed using independent analysis of nuclear force postures in NATO
countries and Russia, including the availability of nuclear weapons,
their yields, and possible targets, according to the Science and Global
Security lab. The tactical phase of the simulation shows about [**2.6
million casualties over three hours**. [Instead of]{.mark} the [tactical
weapons de-escalating]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}, as proponents claim
they would, **[the simulation shows conflict spiraling out of
control]{.mark}** after the use of tactical weapons. [Russia\'s]{.mark}
tactical [weapons would destroy]{.mark} much of
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, the simulation posits. [In response, [NATO
would launch]{.mark} submarine- and US-based strategic nuclear weapons
toward Russia\'s nuclear arsenals --- [600 warheads]{.mark} in total.
Strategic nuclear weapons have a longer range, so Russia, knowing that
NATO nukes are headed for its weapons cache, would throw all its weight
behind missiles launched from silos, mobile launchers, and submarines.
The casualties during this phase would be 3.4 million in 45
minutes.]{.underline} This leads to 85.3 million additional casualties
in the final phase of the nuclear war simulation. In the wake of
previous attacks, both Russia and NATO would launch warheads toward each
other\'s 30 most populous cities in the final stage of of the scenario,
using five to 10 warheads for each city depending on its size. This
phase would cause 85.3 million casualties --- both deaths and injuries.
But the total casualty count from the entire battle (of less than 5
hours) would be 34.1 million deaths and 57.4 million injuries, or a
combined 91.3 million casualties overall. [**But [that\'s just the
immediate conflict]{.mark}**: The entire world would be affected by
nuclear disaster in the months, years, and decades to come. The
[radioactive fallout]{.mark} from the nuclear disaster [would cause
additional deaths]{.mark} and injuries. Studies also suggest that, even
with a limited nuclear engagement, [Earth\'s atmosphere would cool
dramatically, driving famine]{.mark}, refugee crises, additional
[conflicts, and more deaths.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Middle East Mod

#### Russia will counter NATO clout with Middle East escalation

Implications for the RSII coalition,\" No Publication (ermo/sms,

Since the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine on 24 February
2022, speculation over the cost of this war for Moscow has been the
topic of discussion among experts and scholars. The financial losses in
the aftermath of Western sanctions, diplomatic isolation, military
personnel casualties, and the severe damages to Russia's war machine
were the main objects of speculation. As the Russo-Ukrainian War
escalated, so did the complexity of its dimensions. However, the
long-term implications of the war for Russia appear to be even more
perplexing. The complexity of these implications was heightened when, in
mid-March 2022, several media outlets reported that Russia started to
withdraw some of its troops from Syria, while also drawing thousands of
fighters from the Syrian army and allied militias\[1\] to bolster the
military operation in Ukraine and step up its offensive in the east of
the country. Immediately after, Middle Eastern media outlets claimed
that Iran would fill the vacuum of power created by the Russian
withdrawal by increasing the presence of its troops and Shia militants
in Syria.\[2\] This could shift the balance of influence in Syria in
favor of Tehran.

Russia's military operation in Ukraine has already started to affect
Syria, so one might ask what the implications of Russia's war in Ukraine
would be for the Russia-Syria-Iran-Iraq (RSII) security coalition. This
is a coalition that the Kremlin has been building in the Middle East
with the help of Iran and its Shia allies. The Russo-Shia cooperation
reached its peak in 2015, when the RSII security coalition, with two
headquarters in Baghdad and Damascus, was officially formed.\[3\] The
RSII coalition, since its formation, has been holding annual meetings in
Baghdad to exchange intel and discuss recent regional developments, the
last of which was held on February 25th, the day after Russia's military
operation in Ukraine.\[4\] However, since then, many things have
changed. Russia's recent gradual withdrawal from Syria, and the fact
that the war in Ukraine might not result in Moscow's favor, indicates
that the [[Kremlin might have to shift its attention to deal with the
growing escalation with NATO. Thus]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is very
likely that [[Russia's policy toward the Middle East and the RSII will
change. In this context, Russia might choose to escalate tensions in the
Middle East by sending Iran new advanced weapons that could potentially
alter the balance of power in the region, or]{.underline}]{.mark} it
might [[encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
Assad [[to launch a new offensive against Turkish-backed
rebels]{.underline}]{.mark} in the north or the US-backed SDF. [[Russia
might find further escalation in the Middle East beneficial since it can
force the West to divert its attention]{.underline}]{.mark} from Ukraine
to the Middle East. Thus, it is vital to understand the implications of
the Russo-Ukrainian War for the RSII coalition. To do so, we must first
analyze the implications of the war individually for each member and
then for the coalition as a whole.

Conclusion

In establishing a cost-benefit analysis (CBS) of the association between
the depth of RSII members' ties with Russia and the implications of the
Russo-Ukrainian war for them, we should understand that as the
importance of Russia for them grows, they are likely to lose more. For
instance, Syria is heavily dependent on Moscow's military support; thus,
for Damascus, Russia is a "source of power," and so [[a "conflicted
Russia" poses a high level of threat for Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
this context, given Iraq's friendly relations with both the West and
Russia, [[Baghdad is]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
[[safe]{.underline}]{.mark} spot, and Russia's struggles will have a
lesser impact on Iraqis since they have an "alternative source of
support." [[Iran is]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhere [[in the
middle]{.underline}]{.mark} since Iran is not dependent on Syria, or
Russia, or Iraq, for international support; thus, depending on Tehran's
future decisions, Iran could be in either "damage-control" or
"limited-benefactor" mode.

To summarize, among non-Russian members of the Russia-Syria-Iraq-Iran
security coalition, Iraq is the one who gains the most and loses the
least; Syria is the one that yields the most and makes the least; and
finally, Iran is somewhere in-between with an equal chance of "moderate"
loss or gain. Regarding the future of the Russia-Syria-Iran-Iraq
coalition, we could say that, to a significant extent, the future of the
coalition depends on Russia's position in the post-Ukraine war era.
[[If]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the post-war era, the Kremlin seeks
de-escalation with the West, we can safely argue that Moscow will try
not to open a new frontline between itself and the West in the Middle
East. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, an overconfident or [[humiliated
Russia would likely choose the Middle East as a new battlefield to
counter the West]{.underline}]{.mark}. An overconfident Russia would see
the West as too fragile to confront its might, and a humiliated Russia
would seek a place [[to avenge itself and reclaim its
pride]{.underline}]{.mark}, and nowhere could be a better place than the
Middle East, where the West has not historically had the upper hand.

#### Plan's focus on Ukraine risks Iraq instability

Iraq

Among the members of RSII, Iraq is the one that should be the least
concerned about the implications of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. In
fact, [[Iraq can be considered as one of the unintended benefactors of
Russia's war in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Russo-Ukrainian war
has driven oil prices to their highest levels in almost a decade, with
Iraq [[recording its highest revenue from oil exports in the last fifty
years]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[28\] [[In addition]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
[[the Russo-Ukrainian war]{.underline}]{.mark} is one of the factors
that have [[impacted]{.underline}]{.mark} negotiations over the
[[reimplementation of the JCPOA]{.underline}]{.mark}, the speculation
around the return of Iran as Iraq's traditional competitor in the energy
market does not sound as promising as it used to. Thus, one can argue
that, financially speaking, the situation could not be better for Iraq,
since the future of both Iran, which holds 9.5 % of world oil reserves,
and Russia, with 4.8 % of global reserves,\[29\] is no longer clear.
This has provided Iraq with a great opportunity to widen its position in
the energy market. Iraq's strategic advantage has been further boosted
by the decision of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates not to
increase their oil exports.\[30\]

Despite all the strategic financial advantages that Iraq has gained from
Russia's military operation in Ukraine, [[there is a potential negative
side-effect]{.underline}]{.mark} that might strike Iraq: [[the
probability that the West, and specifically the United States, will
**shift its attention** from the Middle East to Ukraine and the rest of
eastern Europe.]{.underline}]{.mark} The [[lack of Western attention
might lead to]{.underline}]{.mark} Iraq's neighbors, including
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and Turkey, attempting to expand their
influence over Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}; in this context, one might
argue that Turkey's current aerial and artillery bombardment of Kurdish
positions in northern Iraq is not purely fortuitous. In addition, the
lack of the West's engagement in Iraq might encourage terrorist groups
such as ISIS to launch new attacks against the central government, which
could destabilize Iraq. However, we also need to keep in mind that the
probable decline in the role of Iran and Russia in the oil market could
make Iraq invaluable to Western nations, so much so that they let
Baghdad fall into anyone's hands but the Iraqis.

### Thumpers

#### Ukraine war will thump for years into the future

**RFE/RL**\'s Ukrainian Service, 6-19-20**22**,
https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-syevyerodonetsk-belarus-arms-nato-putin-zelenskiy/31901661.html,
\"NATO Says Ukraine Fighting Could Last Years As Russians Pound Eastern
Cities,\" RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

NATO\'s secretary-general has warned that [[the war in Ukraine could go
on for years]{.underline}]{.mark} and urged the supply of
state-of-the-art weapons to Kyiv even if \"costs are high,\" as
[[Ukraine\'s allies sought to preempt any international
\"fatigue\"]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly four months into Russia\'s
unprovoked invasion.

The cautions came as Russia stepped up its offensives against
Syevyerodonetsk and other eastern Ukrainian cities, and with the
European Union readying for a recommendation next week to
[make]{.underline} Ukraine a candidate to join the bloc.

\"We must prepare for the fact that it could take years. We must not let
up in supporting Ukraine,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told
Germany\'s Bild am Sonntag newspaper in comments published on June 19.

\"Even if the costs are high, not only for military support, also
because of rising energy and food prices.\"

Following his visit to Kyiv on June 18 to show support for Ukraine,
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in London\'s Sunday Times
that \"time is the vital factor\" and \"everything will depend on
whether Ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster
than Russia can renew its capacity to attack.\"

Johnson spoke of the need to avoid \"Ukraine fatigue\" from a conflict
that has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians and displaced more than
10 million others since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his
troops across the border on February 24.

Syevyerodonetsk, the focus of Russia's offensive to capture full control
of the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, remained under heavy
artillery fire on June 19, as did the sister city of Lysychansk, just
across the Severskiy Donets River.

The Ukrainian General Staff said early on June 19 that Russian troops
eere concentrating their main efforts in the direction of
Syevyerodonetsk and Bakhmut.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it had taken control of Metyolkine, a
town about 6 kilometers southeast of Syevyerodonetsk that had a
population of about 800 before the war. TASS reported that many
Ukrainian fighters had surrendered there.

Ukraine\'s military said Russia had \"partial success\" in the area, but
Serhiy Hayday, the military governor of Luhansk, told Ukrainian
television that the Russians\' claims that they control Syevyerodonetsk
are false.

\"They control the main part of the town but not the whole town,\" he
said, adding that the fighting made evacuations from the city
impossible.

Despite heavy shelling of Syevyerodonestk\'s twin city, Lysychansk, it
was possible to evacuate 19 people from there, Hayday said.

\"Today, 19 residents of Lysychansk have already exhaled with relief and
are in a place where shells do not fly overhead,\" Hayday said on
Telegram.

The British Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update on June 19
that there was \"little change in the front line\" in recent days in the
so-called Syevyerodonetsk pocket where Russian forces are hoping to
encircle Ukraine\'s defenders.

But the ministry also warned that Ukrainian and Russian combat units
\"committed to intense combat in the Donbas\" are probably suffering
\"variable morale,\" citing information from U.K. intelligence services.

Ukrainian and Western intelligence have pointed for months to signs of
poor morale and even fragging among invading Russian soldiers since the
February 24 invasion began.

But the British statement is among the strongest indications so far of
morale problems among Ukrainians, who mobilized military and civilian
defenders to resist the Russians.

\"Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks,\"
the Defense Ministry said in its latest intelligence update on Ukraine.
\"Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled. Cases of
whole Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between
officers and their troops continue to occur.\"

Reliable casualty estimates from either side have been difficult to come
by.

The Ukrainian side suggests more than 30,000 Russian soldiers have been
killed, although Western intelligence has suggested the number is
considerably lower.

The Ukrainian side has not said how many of its troops or other
defenders have died, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy
recently suggested as many as 100 Ukrainian soldiers are being killed
every day.

#### NATO expansion to Finland/Sweden thumps

\",\" IAI TV - Changing how the world thinks (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Finally, [[the expansion of NATO into Sweden and Finland has poignantly
demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark} that despite the war, Ukraine remains
a third-rank citizen in the West. Sweden and Finland were warmly
welcomed by NATO even before they formally applied.
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[despite all its efforts to
join NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, was designated by Boris Johnson on 6
March 2022 as the country that "[[had no serious prospects of NATO
membership]{.underline}]{.mark} in the near future." This was echoed, on
11 March 2022, by Josep Borrell, who reflectively admitted with regards
to Ukraine's NATO membership that "it's a mistake to make promises that
you can't keep."

The limits of the West's support of Ukraine are crystal clear to Putin
and the rest of the world. Regardless of what Russia does in Ukraine,
there will be no NATO membership and no collective security guarantees
for Ukraine. Moreover, [[this round of NATO expansion brings the "enemy"
to the gate of Russia and corroborates Putin's besieged-fortress
ideology]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, Putin has managed to create the
world he has been warning Russians and Russia's allies about: the West
is indeed fully out to encircle Russia. Th[[is self-fulfilling prophecy
shores up Putin's rhetoric within Russia and signals to China that the
West]{.underline}]{.mark} does pose a danger to Russia and [[is more
interested in harming Russia's geopolitical interests than helping
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} recognition
[[strengthens China-Russia alignment]{.underline}]{.mark} which will
further buttress Russia's capacity to carry on in Ukraine.

[[In response to the invasion of Ukraine, the West has imposed stinging
sanctions, disrupting the Russian economy and forcing the Kremlin to
burn through its financial reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}. Major Russian
banks have been disconnected from SWIFT, the international system that
facilitates financial transactions, while some oligarchs have been
sanctioned. Many [[allies and partners have provided massive financial
and material aid]{.underline}]{.mark}---in the form of
[[funding]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as [[anti-tank and
air-defense]{.underline}]{.mark} systems [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
other [[military equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}---to bolster Ukrainian
resistance. This assistance has helped to stiffen an already stout
Ukrainian defense, which has inflicted heavy losses on the Russian
military. Vladimir Putin now faces the real possibility of a stalled
offensive, or even outright defeat.

Balance of power

[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} the war erupted in [[Ukraine, there has
been]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing [[caution in EU and
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} headquarters in Brussels [[about how
to]{.underline}]{.mark} deal best with the Kremlin's strategy and to
[[avoid any armed confrontation in eastern Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Military historian Rick Atkinson conceives the new order of battle in
Europe as very fluid. He points out, "in less than three months, [[the
strategic landscape has changed profoundly]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[**invigorating** a NATO military alliance that had seemed nearly
**moribund**]{.underline}]{.mark}, undermining if not neutering Russian
imperial ambitions, [[and **reasserting** American
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} in a robust coalition of like-minded
liberal democracies." (27)

Henry [[Kissinger]{.underline}]{.mark}, former U.S. secretary of state
and so-called 'master of grand strategy' said at a Financial Times forum
held in June 2022, "We are now living in a totally new era." He also
[[argued]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}
"obviously [[miscalculated]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's capabilities to
sustain a major enterprise --- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} when the time
comes for settlement ... [[we are **not** going back to the previous
relationship but to a position for Russia that will be

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[eight times increase in NATO
Response Force troops]{.underline}]{.mark} is due to the threat posed by
Russia, say the Alliance.

For clarity, the NATO Response Force is a highly ready and
technologically advanced multinational combat force made up of land,
air, maritime and Special Operations Forces components that the Alliance
can deploy quickly, wherever needed.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg gave a speech today ahead of a
meeting in Madrid amongst NATO allies set to adopt a new strategy for
the Alliance. The [[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} reportedly [[describes
Moscow as a **direct threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Stoltenberg said:

"Our NATO Summit in Madrid this week will be transformative. With many
important decisions. Including on a new Strategic Concept for a new
security reality. A fundamental shift in NATO's deterrence and defence.
And support to Ukraine now, and for the future.

Our new Concept will guide us in an era of strategic competition. I
expect it will make clear that Allies consider Russia as the most
significant and direct threat to our security. It will address China for
the first time. And the challenges that Beijing poses to our security,
interests, and values. It will also cover our evolving approach to a
number of other threats and challenges. Including terrorism, cyber, and
hybrid. At the Summit, we will strengthen our forward defences.

We will enhance our battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance up
to brigade-levels. We will transform the NATO Response Force. And
increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000.

We will also boost our ability to reinforce in crisis and
conflict.Including with:

> More pre-positioned equipment, and stockpiles of military supplies.
>
> More forward-deployed capabilities, like air defence.
>
> Strengthened command and control.
>
> And upgraded defence plans, with forces pre-assigned to defend
> specific Allies.
>
> These troops will exercise together with home defence forces.

And they will become familiar with local terrain, facilities, and our
new pre-positioned stocks. So that they can respond smoothly and swiftly
to any emergency. Together, this constitutes the biggest overhaul of our
collective deterrence and defence since the Cold War. And to do this, we
will need to invest more. Today, we are releasing new defence spending
figures. They show that [[2022 will be the eighth consecutive year of
increases across European Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and Canada. By the
end of the year, [[they will have invested well over 350
billion]{.underline}]{.mark} US dollars extra since we agreed our
defence investment pledge in 2014. [[Nine Allies now
reach]{.underline}]{.mark} -- or exceed -- the [[2%]{.underline}]{.mark}
target. [[Nineteen]{.underline}]{.mark} Allies have clear plans to
[[reach it by 2024]{.underline}]{.mark}. And an additional five have
concrete commitments to meet it thereafter. Two percent is increasingly
considered a floor, not a ceiling. We will also agree to invest more
together in NATO. For the benefit of our security.

### Turn -- Plan Helps Ukraine

#### NATO unity checks Ukraine escalation

Preventing and controlling escalation

[[What can NATO and the European Union do to prevent Russia from
escalating]{.underline}]{.mark} the conflict to unacceptable levels?
What follows are a few principles to guide NATO's assessment of
preventing and avoiding escalation.

Keep Ukraine in the fight. [[The first]{.underline}]{.mark}, and most
immediate, curative [[is to keep Ukraine in the
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. This means continued financial assistance,
shipments of lethal aid, and real-time intelligence sharing, as well as
humanitarian assistance and help with absorption and resettlement of
refugees. The United States and Europe have shown unity and concerted
action in responding swiftly to Russian aggression in Ukraine and this
must continue, even as Putin seeks to find and drive wedges between
transatlantic allies and partners. [[In this struggle, a **coherent
narrative**, shared and articulated in **common**, will be
critical]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In this regard, [[continuous references to the danger of escalation to
"World War III"]{.underline}]{.mark} and a steady drumbeat of measures
not to be taken can only serve to reassure Putin that he has a free hand
in Ukraine. A degree of strategic ambiguity and the possibility of US
and NATO intervention should he go too far can be helpful in moderating
Russian excesses and controlling escalation. An "all measures on the
table" approach will force Russian planners to consider, and prepare
for, multiple response scenarios, complicating resource allocation and
inducing uncertainty. While deterrence is more art than science,
signaling to one's opponent that one is too frightened to engage [[is
more likely to encourage than to deter]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The most effective way to prevent spillover onto NATO territory and
other forms of future Russian aggression is to help defeat Russian
forces in the field inside Ukraine. Supplying Ukraine with food, fuel,
spare parts, and modern equipment is the best way to do that, while
still avoiding direct intervention by NATO. This means combat aircraft,
main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled and rocket
artillery, mobile air defense, secure radios, unmanned aerial vehicles,
target-acquisition radars, spare parts, and ammunition, including
precision-guided munitions. Many of these combat systems exist in
storage in great numbers in the United States and in Europe. The
Ukrainian military has shown remarkable versatility in adapting to
unfamiliar systems such as the Javelin and Stinger, but exportable
training packages, and even training sites in Europe for selected
specialists, also warrant consideration.

#### Only resilience and persistence can check Putin in Ukraine

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Use [[economic tools as a primary "offensive"
weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the military campaign progresses,
sanctions [[will continue to strangle the Russian
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. This pressure must continue---and, if
possible, intensify---[[in order to force Russia]{.underline}]{.mark},
not just to the negotiating table, but [[to withdraw altogether from
Ukrainian territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. To date, not all Russian banks
have been banned from SWIFT, and many oligarchs remain unsanctioned.
Though painful and difficult, weaning Europe from Russian energy,
divesting from Russian businesses, and closing European markets are
powerful weapons the EU can wield in its own right. (While 37 percent of
Russian trade is with Europe, only 4 percent of the EU's goods exports
go to Russia.) Today, Russian energy remains exempt from EU sanctions.
Developing alternate sources of energy, in particular, will take time
and investment, but continued reliance on Russian oil and natural gas
can only enable Putin to continue to finance the war in Ukraine.

In March 2022, the EU imposed its fourth tranche of trade sanctions on
Russia, tightening export restrictions on dual-use technologies,
expanding the list of sanctioned persons related to defense industries;
imposing further trade restrictions for steel, iron, and luxury goods;
and prohibiting transactions with specific state-owned enterprises.
[[The challenge now will be to maintain the full range of sanctions
until they bear fruit. Global food shortages, rising energy prices, and
scarcities]{.underline}]{.mark} among certain commodities [[will
challenge the sanctions regime. Much depends on the]{.underline}]{.mark}
persistence and [[**resolve** of Western leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Properly understood, [[comprehensive economic sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}---what the French finance minister has
called "total economic and financial war on Russia"---[[can be a
**major** tool, denying Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} the financial
[[resources to carry on the war and generating internal
pressures]{.underline}]{.mark} on elites [[that could lead to his
**removal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By themselves, however, they will
probably not end the war. China, Brazil, and India remain open markets
and suppliers, if not active supporters, while Hungary and Serbia retain
close ties. As former Deputy National Security Adviser General Rick
Waddell has pointed out to the author, "An economy that is
self-sufficient in energy and food takes a lot of killing." In concert
with diplomacy, aggressive information operations, and the military
instrument of power, sanctions can be a vital component of an overall
strategy to control and limit escalation and drive conflict termination
by draining Russia of the financial resources it needs to carry on the
war.

#### Only solidification solves Ukraine and avoids Russian expansionism

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and

Maintain unity on the diplomatic front. In the midst of aggressive
warfare, [[diplomacy may not capture the headlines]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}, it must remain in play, above all because
[[political objectives]{.underline}]{.mark} in the end must
[[govern]{.underline}]{.mark} what happens on [[the
battlefield]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here there are minefields.
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the EU [[may be tempted to intervene in
negotiations and offer]{.underline}]{.mark} solutions[[---"**off
ramps**"]{.underline}]{.mark} is au courant---[[to more quickly achieve
a cessation of hostilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. These could take the
form of sanctions relief and acknowledgement of Russian sovereignty over
parts of Ukraine in exchange for "peace." [[This would be a **fatal
error**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Practitioners of realpolitik may minimize Zelenskyy's emphasis on shared
values and the ongoing contest between democracy and autocracy, but his
citizenry and millions in Europe and the United States won't. Despite
the leverage the West has over Ukraine as its storehouse and
quartermaster, [[the Ukrainian people will decide "how this
ends]{.underline}]{.mark}." The political endgame---the definition of
"victory"---must reflect outcomes they deem worthy of the enormous
sacrifices they have made. The trap here is that [[Putin will not give
up his aspirations if allowed to keep some of his
gains]{.underline}]{.mark}, restore his finances, rebuild his forces,
and try again.

The West has an opportunity to rule out that future altogether. [[That
outcome rests on continued pressure, assistance to Ukraine, a **resolute
and united front**, and the willingness to confront Russia decisively
should Putin expand the conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Western diplomacy
must be based on more than "stopping the fighting." [[The United States
and its allies must **see through** and beyond the endgame to a stable
and lasting peace. That means the **comprehensive de**feat of the
Russian military in Ukraine, **before** the conflict metastasizes
further and spreads into Europe and beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Throughout, [[diplomacy should leverage the strong, worldwide opposition
to Russian aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}---as expressed in the UN
General Assembly's overwhelming vote of March 2---[[in all international
forums]{.underline}]{.mark}. Traditional neutrals such as Sweden,
Finland, and Austria have joined in strongly condemning Putin's actions
and have a growing voice. [[**Building and sustaining this coalition**
should remain a **top diplomatic priority**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Conclusion

The Russian invasion of [[Ukraine is the **most dangerous**
event]{.underline}]{.mark} to occur [[in Europe
since]{.underline}]{.mark} the end of [[the Second World
War]{.underline}]{.mark}. In [[its potential for enormous
casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}, destruction on an epic scale, [[and
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} to unthinkable extremes, it
[[demands]{.underline}]{.mark} the attention and [[considered action of
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, the European Union, and the whole world. No
one can see clearly exactly how the crisis will play out. This "strange
voyage," in Winston Churchill's words, is a journey into the unknown, as
all wars are. [[The **best** the West can do is
prepare]{.underline}]{.mark} for the worst, keep its nerve, [[and employ
all its resources]{.underline}]{.mark} when its vital interests and most
cherished values are attacked. Things are very close to that stage
now[**. [At stake]{.mark}** [is an **international order** founded on
something other than brute force, imperial ambition, and autocratic
self-help. A Russian victory in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, even at
great cost, [[places a vengeful Putin on Europe's
**doorstep**]{.underline}]{.mark}, his ambitions partially achieved but
still unrealized. [[The **next blow** will fall on **NATO's eastern
flank**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now is the time to ensure that never
happens.

Underlying these arguments for an inevitable war between the two
superpowers is PTT. PTT originally formulated by Organski (1958) posits
that [[**war is likely** when the power of the]{.mark} dominant state in
the international system (i.e. [hegemon]{.mark}) [is **declining**
and]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} dissatisfied rising [challenger]{.mark}
**substantially [reduces the power gap]{.mark} between the hegemon and
itself**.]{.underline} Unlike balance of power theory, PTT argues that
the war is most likely when there is near power parity between a
dominant state and a rising and dissatisfied challenger (Organski and
Kugler, 1980, pp. 19-20)\[5\]. [[A rising power]{.mark} here is
generally dissatisfied with the existing international order and
**[initiates war against a declining hegemon]{.mark} in order [to impose
orders]{.mark} that are [more favorable]{.mark} to itself**]{.underline}
(Organski 1958, pp. 364-367). Layne (2018, p. 110) put these power
transition dynamics quite succinctly as follows: "Over time, however,
the relative power of states changes, and eventually the international
order no longer reflects the actual distribution of power between or
among the leading Great Powers. When that happens, [the legitimacy of
the prevailing order is called into question, and it will be challenged
by the rising power]{.underline}(s)." And [[when the balance of power
between a dominant state and a rising challenger changes sufficiently, a
new order replaces]{.mark} an old one]{.underline} typically
**[[by]{.mark} a [hegemonic war]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2018, p. 104).
[[Paying]{.mark} close [attention to the **growing Sino--US
competition** over hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline} in the twenty-first
century, therefore, Shirk (2007, p. 4), China specialist, argues that
["[History teaches us]{.mark} that [rising powers are likely to provoke
war]{.mark}."]{.underline} On the other hand, scholars like Gilpin
(1981) contend that the [power [transition war]{.mark} between great
powers is [likely to occur when a hegemonic state]{.mark}]{.underline}
whose power is declining due to imperial overstretch\[6\] [[views
"**preventive war as the most attractive means of eliminating the
threat**]{.mark} posed by challengers"]{.underline} (Ned Lebow and
Valentino, 2009, p. 391), although they do acknowledge that there might
be some "ways to prolong the period of its power preponderance vis-à-vis
the rising challenger, so that the rapidly rising power will not dare to
challenge the hegemonic leadership" (Kim and Gates, 2015, p. 221). In
this case, the initiator of war is a declining hegemon, rather than a
rising challenger. [[The declining hegemon]{.mark} who fears a rising
challenger's overtaking its power in the near future **[sees war as a
better option]{.mark}** than other options of maintaining its hegemony
such as reducing its commitments abroad and appeasing a rising
challenger.]{.underline}

### Ukraine Impact - Genocide

#### Ukraine genocide will force NATO intervention

If NATO intervenes, do it decisively. [[Several European
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Poland, Denmark, and Belgium,
[[are considering]{.underline}]{.mark} [[some form of "peacekeeping"
intervention in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, while [[calls for a no-fly
zone are mounting]{.underline}]{.mark} as the civilian death toll rises.
This suggests [[a critical mass of support may be
forming]{.underline}]{.mark} for outside intervention under certain
circumstances. Strong material and financial aid may enable Ukraine to
hold on, and even advance to retake occupied territory, but Russia
remains a far larger and stronger opponent. [[If the logic that it is
better to defeat Putin in Ukraine than on NATO territory is sound,
intervention to prevent the fall of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} or its
dismemberment [[must be considered]{.underline}]{.mark}. The prospect of
[[actual genocide of Ukrainian civilians, or use of weapons of mass
destruction, might also trigger NATO intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Ukraine Impact -- Asia Pivot

#### Weakening Russia in Ukraine enables Asia Pivot

Another difference is that this is the first conflict involving
quasi-alliances. NATO and the EU are not participants in the war, but
they're clearly involved and not neutral. Russia has a series of
partnerships--- the cooperative treaty organization and its strategic
partnership with China---which are also in play.

One of the questions this war raises is: what does the war's outcome
mean for the U.S. pivot toward Asia? And I think that raises two other
questions. One is: how diminished will Russia be at the end?
[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} Barack [[Obama, the U.S. has been trying to
pivot towards Asia because China is clearly the larger and more
significant long-term competitor. But]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir
[[Putin is]{.underline}]{.mark} sticking around Eastern Europe and
[[kicking the Western order in the shins. That has made it very
difficult to pivot towards Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the other hand,
[[if this war ends with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} being a
[[crippled]{.underline}]{.mark} power, then, in that sense, [[pivoting
towards Asia is going to be **much**]{.mark} were
[easier]{.mark}]{.underline} if what one is dealing with in Europe is a
very weakened Vladimir Putin with a decrepit military that can't
reconstitute itself.

### Ukraine Impact - Food

#### Ukraine puts food security on brink

[[Poorer countries are currently facing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
prospect of [[a major food crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. While much
attention has been paid to [[the Russian blockade of Ukrainian
ports]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[disrupts
supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if the ports become operational
again the problem will remain. First, rising energy prices are already
translating to higher transportation costs of basic goods, driving up
the prices of basic foodstuffs. Second, [[Ukraine and Russia are major
exporters]{.underline}]{.mark} of basic foodstuffs---together they
supply almost 29% of the world's exports of wheat brands, 20% of corn,
and 80% of sunflower oil. While the Western economies have enough
margins to address these rising prices, the situation in the poorer
corners of the world is different---as indicated by the Economist front
page showing human skulls in a sheaf of grain. According to David
Beasley, the executive director of the [[UN World
Food]{.underline}]{.mark} Programme, [[50%]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
wheat supplied by the organization [[was coming from
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia is also a prime exporter of
indispensable ingredients in fertilizers---potash and phosphate. When
Ukrainian farmers are preoccupied with defending their land in the
beginning of the seeding season, and when Russian farmers cannot be paid
due to the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system, [[rising food
prices threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} to bring [[more
instability]{.underline}]{.mark} into already unstable countries. Just a
few weeks into the conflict and the spiraling prices of food and other
basic commodities ignited protests and rallies in Iraq and Morocco.
According to the Financial Times, "a jump in grain prices in 2009-10 is
regarded as one of the triggers of the Arab Spring in the Middle East."
The looming global food crisis threatens to have yet more destructive
consequences, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[conflicts
and]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[refugees]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Many in the West have praised the decisiveness of the EU's effort to
protect Ukrainian refugees escaping the war. While the unprecedented
deal---that grants Ukrainians instant rights to live and work within the
EU---is more than welcome in itself, many human rights groups and
organizations have been clamoring that it demonstrates the EU's "double
standards" in comparison to the 2015 refugee crisis. "The Ukraine
refugee crisis," argues the Global Detention Project (GDP), a
Geneva-based nonprofit organization, "presents Europe with . . . a
critical moment of reflection: Can the peoples of Europe overcome their
widespread racism and animosity and embrace the universalist spirit of
the 1951 Refugee Conventions?" This question might become pivotal once
food shortages start to affect societies [[in the Middle East and North
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. This may expose not only the West's moral
bias but also systemic weaknesses of contemporary institutions that have
shaped globalization processes during the last decades, such as
migration regimes.

### Ukraine Impact - Economy

#### Ukraine war risks global supply chain collapse

Western societies and economies will have to address these urgent
sociopolitical challenges, which may arrive in tandem with other threats
to the global order. The disruption caused by the war to the global
economic model led Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock and one
of the world's leading hedge fund investors, to write that "the Russian
invasion of Ukraine has put an end to the globalization we have
experienced over the last three decades." Fink is worried about two
further expected shockwaves. First, [[the globalized economy is amidst a
supply chain crisis, which the war in Ukraine is aggravating
further]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since the start of the coronavirus
pandemic, shippers have tried to bypass the uncertainty of fraught
container shipping by turning to rail transport as an alternative route
for the Asia--Europe trade. Rail operators ran more than 1,200 freight
trains per month between China and Europe, transiting through Russia,
Ukraine, and Belarus, and transporting almost 1.5 million containers.
The disruption caused by the [[blocking of land routes may result
in]{.underline}]{.mark} more permanent and painful [[retreat by
manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark} from reliance on global supply
chains. Second, [[the war in Ukraine may also disrupt technological
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, much of the world's
[[neon]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is crucial [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
the production of [[computer chips, originates in
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} 50% of this [[is
purified in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[interruption to supply
chains]{.underline}]{.mark} and possible deficit of microchips
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} daunting scenarios [[for global economic
development]{.underline}]{.mark}. But they may also come as a natural
and much needed trend to cool down a radically decentralized,
overcomplicated, and hence venerable global system of trade.

#### Decline [cascades]{.underline} -- nuclear war.

[[Economic stressors]{.underline}]{.mark}, in transcendent VUCA fashion,
[may]{.underline} also [[induce]{.mark} **radical [geopolitical
realignments]{.mark}**. Bullions now carry more weight than NATO's
**security guarantees** in **Eastern Europe**]{.underline}. After Poland
repatriated 100 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2019, Slovakia,
Serbia and Hungary quickly followed suit.

According to former Slovak Premier Robert Fico, [this **erosion** in
**regional trust** was based on historical precedents]{.underline} -- in
particular the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded Czechoslovakia's
Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. As Fico reiterated (Dudik & Tomek, 2019):

> "You can hardly trust even the closest allies after the Munich
> Agreement... I guarantee that if something happens, we won't see a
> single gram of this (offshore-held) gold. Let's do it (repatriation)
> as quickly as possible." (Parenthesis added by author).

President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia (a non-NATO nation) justified his
central bank's gold-repatriation program by hinting at economic
headwinds ahead: "We see in which direction the crisis in the world is
moving" (Dudik & Tomek, 2019). Indeed, [[with]{.mark} two global
Titanics -- the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and China]{.underline}]{.mark} --
set [on a **collision course**]{.underline} with a
quadrillions-denominated iceberg in the middle, and a viral outbreak on
its tip, [the **seismic [ripples]{.mark}** [will be felt]{.mark}
**far**, **wide** and for a **considerable period**]{.underline}.

A reality check is nonetheless needed here: Can additional bullions
realistically circumvallate the economies of 80 million plus peoples in
these Eastern European nations, worth a collective \$1.8 trillion by
purchasing power parity? Gold however is a potent psychological symbol
as it represents national sovereignty and economic reassurance in a
potentially hyperinflationary world. The portents are clear: The current
global economic system will be weakened by rising nationalism and
autarkic demands. Much uncertainty remains ahead. Mauldin (2018)
proposes the introduction of Old Testament-style debt jubilees to
facilitate gradual national recoveries. The World Economic Forum, on the
other hand, has long proposed a "Great Reset" by 2030; a socialist
utopia where "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy" (WEF, 2016).

In the final analysis, COVID-19 is not the root cause of the current
global economic turmoil; it is merely an accelerant to a burning house
of cards that was left smouldering since the 2008 Great Recession
(Maavak, 2020a). We also see how the four main pillars of systems
thinking (diversity, interconnectivity, interactivity and "adaptivity")
form the mise en scene in a VUCA decade.

ENVIRONMENTAL

[What happens to the **environment** when our **economies implode**?
[Think of]{.mark} a [**debt-laden** workforce at]{.mark} sensitive
[**nuclear** and **chemical plants**]{.mark}, along [with a]{.mark}
concomitant [**surge** in]{.mark} **industrial [accidents]{.mark}**?
**Economic stressors**]{.underline}, workforce demoralization and
rampant profiteering -- rather than manmade climate change -- arguably
[pose the **biggest threats** to the environment]{.underline}. In a WEF
report, Buehler et al (2017) made the following pre-COVID-19
observation:

> The ILO estimates that the annual cost to the global economy from
> accidents and work-related diseases alone is a staggering \$3
> trillion. Moreover, a recent report suggests the world's 3.2 billion
> workers are increasingly unwell, with the vast majority facing
> significant economic insecurity: 77% work in part-time, temporary,
> "vulnerable" or unpaid jobs.

Shouldn't this phenomenon be better categorized as a societal or
economic risk rather than an environmental one? In line with the systems
thinking approach, however, [global risks can no longer be boxed into a
**taxonomical silo**]{.underline}. Frazzled workforces may precipitate
another Bhopal (1984), Chernobyl (1986), Deepwater Horizon (2010) or
Flint water crisis (2014). These disasters were notably not the result
of manmade climate change. Neither was the Fukushima nuclear disaster
(2011) nor the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004). Indeed, the combustion of a
long-overlooked cargo of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had nearly
levelled the city of Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug 4 2020. The explosion left
204 dead; 7,500 injured; US\$15 billion in property damages; and an
estimated 300,000 people homeless (Urbina, 2020). The environmental
costs have yet to be adequately tabulated.

Environmental disasters are more attributable to Black Swan events,
systems breakdowns and corporate greed rather than to mundane human
activity.

[Our JIT world aggravates the **cascading potential** of
risks]{.underline} (Korowicz, 2012). [Production and delivery
delays]{.underline}, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, [will eventually
require industrial **overcompensation**]{.underline}. This will further
stress senior executives, workers, machines and a variety of
computerized systems. The trickle-down effects will likely include
substandard products, contaminated food and a general lowering in health
and safety standards (Maavak, 2019a). Unpaid or demoralized sanitation
workers may also resort to indiscriminate waste dumping. Many cities
across the United States (and elsewhere in the world) are no longer
recycling wastes due to prohibitive costs in the global corona-economy
(Liacko, 2021).

Even in good times, strict protocols on waste disposals were routinely
ignored. While Sweden championed the global climate change narrative,
its clothing flagship H&M was busy covering up toxic effluences
disgorged by vendors along the Citarum River in Java, Indonesia. As a
result, countless children among 14 million Indonesians straddling the
"world's most polluted river" began to suffer from dermatitis,
intestinal problems, developmental disorders, renal failure, chronic
bronchitis and cancer (DW, 2020). It is also in cauldrons like the
Citarum River where pathogens may mutate with emergent ramifications.

On an equally alarming note, depressed economic conditions have
traditionally provided a waste disposal boon for organized crime
elements. Throughout 1980s, the Calabriabased 'Ndrangheta mafia -- in
collusion with governments in Europe and North America -- began to dump
radioactive wastes along the coast of Somalia. Reeling from pollution
and revenue loss, Somali fisherman eventually resorted to mass piracy
(Knaup, 2008).

The coast of Somalia is now a maritime hotspot, and exemplifies an
entwined form of economic-environmental-geopolitical-societal emergence.
In a VUCA world, indiscriminate waste dumping can unexpectedly morph
into a Black Hawk Down incident. The laws of unintended consequences are
governed by actors, interconnections, interactions and adaptations in a
system under study -- as outlined in the methodology section.

Environmentally-devastating industrial sabotages -- whether by
disgruntled workers, industrial competitors, ideological maniacs or
terrorist groups -- cannot be discounted in a VUCA world. Immiserated
societies, in stark defiance of climate change diktats, may resort to
dirty coal plants and wood stoves for survival. [Interlinked
ecosystems]{.underline}, particularly water resources, [may be
**hijacked**]{.underline} by nationalist sentiments. [The
**environmental fallouts**]{.underline} of critical infrastructure (CI)
breakdowns [loom like a **Sword of Damocles** over this
decade]{.underline}.

GEOPOLITICAL

[The **primary [catalyst]{.mark}** [behind **WWII** was]{.mark} the
**Great [Depression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since [[history]{.mark}
often **[repeats itself]{.mark}**, expect **familiar bogeymen** to
**reappear**]{.underline} [in societies roiling with
**impoverishment**]{.underline} and ideological clefts.
[[Anti-Semitism]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a societal risk on its own --
[[may]{.mark} reach alarming proportions]{.underline} in the West
(Reuters, 2019), [possibly **[forc]{.mark}**ing [Israel]{.mark} to
undertake **[reprisal]{.mark} operations**]{.underline} inside allied
nations. If that happens, [how will **affected nations**
react?]{.underline} Will security resources be reallocated to protect
certain minorities (or the Top 1%) while larger segments of society are
exposed to restive forces? **[[Balloon effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**
like these [present a classic]{.underline} VUCA
[problematic]{.underline}.

[Contemporary geopolitical risks [include]{.mark} a possible
**[Iran]{.mark}-Israel [war]{.mark}**[; **US-China**]{.mark} **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** [over **Taiwan** or]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea; **North [Korean
prolif]{.mark}eration** of **nuclear** and **missile technologies**; an
**[India-Pak]{.mark}istan [nuclear war]{.mark}**; an **Iranian closure**
of the Straits of **Hormuz**; **fundamentalist-driven implosion in the
Islamic world**; [or]{.mark} a [**nuclear confrontation** between
**NATO** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fears that the Jan 3 2020
assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani might lead to WWIII
were grossly overblown. From a systems perspective, the killing of
Soleimani did not fundamentally change the
actor-interconnection-interaction adaptivity equation in the Middle
East. Soleimani was simply a cog who got replaced.

### Ukraine Impact - Democracy

#### Russia losing in Ukraine -- will take down the authoritarian model

I want to add just one thing, which is that, [[if this war goes
on]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it looks like it will, [[Russia's economy
could start to collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} for lack of spare parts.
The demonstration value of that collapse might be that, in two or three
years, people will look back and say: this was a war that was won by the
sanctions --an unprecedented event.

Granted, there was a period in between the World Wars where trade
embargoes were strong, but trade in intermediate goods, and financial
markets make economies more interlinked now, and more vulnerable. We're
in a world where the hundred designers of chip manufacturing facilities
in Taiwan are critical to global supply chains. Russia is no longer the
simple command economy that the neo-Stalinists want to make great again.
Its consumers use imported smartphones and cars, full of chips. Its
military is also dependent on imported parts and components.

[[People are going to]{.underline}]{.mark} look back and
[[say]{.underline}]{.mark}: Wow, the [[authoritarians really killed that
place]{.underline}]{.mark}, didn't they? [[It was an economy with
remarkable human capital and now it's a dinosaur]{.underline}]{.mark},
like North Korea. I think [[that's going to make
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} reconsider not just their economic
models, but also the [[models of authoritarian regimes, because of the
effect on human capital]{.underline}]{.mark}. Refugees from Russia who
you see now everywhere, not just in Europe, but also in Israel, are
highly educated, angry, and disappointed people whose lives fell apart.
Just like that. They thought that they could deal with the regime but
now that hope is gone. They're very, very talented people. [[The
demonstration value of this authoritarian debacle may end up being the
most important part]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Ukraine outcome controls trajectory of global democracy

Philip **Wasielewski**, 6-9-20**22**, Templeton Fellow at the Foreign
Policy Research Institute. He is a former Paramilitary Case Officer who
had a 31-year career in the Directorate of Operations of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

\"The Evolving Political-Military Aims in the War in Ukraine After 100
Days,\" (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

[[Both nations]{.underline}]{.mark} have suffered severe losses and
[[need to regenerate military strength. The winner will be the one who
is **quickest** to reconstitute]{.underline}]{.mark} its combat forces
at the tactical level and whose leader best motivates his country to
fight and manages to enlarge and equip his armed forces, and the
logistics to sustain those forces, at the strategic level.

Twenty-first century Russia is using twentieth-century weapons to fight
a nineteenth-century war of attrition, combined with eighteenth-century
pillaging. Currently, Russia's numerical advantage in Donbas allows it
to grind out a slow advance toward a pointless objective. Even if
Russian forces advance to the administrative borders of both oblasts, it
will not end the war as long as Ukraine still has the will to fight and
the means to do so. If Putin plans to declare victory once his army has
cleared Ukraine out of Donbas, he is building on sand. Unlike Georgia or
Moldova, Ukraine has the resources and international support to refuse
to accept a "frozen conflict." Instead, the incoming tide of a rebuilt
and expanded Ukrainian army will eventually wash those gains away---be
it months or years from now.

For a short-lived propaganda victory in Donbas, Putin is destroying the
Russian army. If that army revolts in self-defense or collapses under
Ukrainian counterattacks, Putin will face the same fate as other Russian
rulers who have lost wars. Can the gap between Russian war aims and
military capabilities be closed with nuclear weapons? In theory,
possibly---but in practice, such an outcome is unlikely. There is no
silver bullet to overturn poor strategy, leadership, tactics, and
logistics and a lack of will in the face of a motivated opponent.

Despite the prediction two decades ago by political scientist Samuel
Huntington that future conflicts would be clashes between different
cultural civilizations, we are seeing a clash within a cultural
civilization---Orthodox civilization---whose cultural boundaries have
been formed by its Eastern Orthodox confession, Byzantine heritage, and
Slavic ancestry and languages.\[33\] This war between the world's two
largest Orthodox states is about more than Ukraine's ability to join
NATO or the European Union. [[It's]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a fight
between two ideas of how people should be governed]{.underline}]{.mark}.
One side believes it should be by the decree of the powerful and the
other by the consent of the governed. One believes it is entitled to a
sphere of influence; the other believes it is entitled to chart its own
political future.

[[A Russian victory in this conflict could serve as a template or
inspiration for other revisionist or ideological powers. A Ukrainian
victory would do the same for those societies struggling with the
challenges of democracy. On the broadest of scales, that is what this
war is about]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Nuclear Deterrence Turn

#### NATO credibility is vital to effective nuclear deterrence

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

Take an unambiguous stance on nuclear policy. [[To relieve the threat of
a Russian first-use nuclear strike]{.underline}]{.mark} and regain
freedom of action, the United States and [[NATO must return to core
deterrence principles]{.underline}]{.mark}. As it has for many decades,
nuclear [[deterrence rests on **both** capability **and** credibility.
NATO nuclear forces]{.underline}]{.mark}, though much reduced since the
Cold War (especially with respect to theater nuclear systems) [[are
redundant, survivable, and absolutely capable]{.underline}]{.mark} of
destroying Russia from end to end. [[NATO's
credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[is **constantly
undermined** when leaders publicly express palpable **fears** that Putin
will employ his nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}, for unclear
reasons and in unclear ways, and that they must at all costs avoid
pushing him into a corner. [[A resolve **not to be bullied** is
essential. Deterrence works best when leaders are direct, unambiguous,
resolute, and calm]{.underline}]{.mark}, as John Kennedy was during the
Cuban Missile Crisis. As President Emmanuel Macron reminded his public
recently, [[the West has nuclear weapons, too]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Resolve Turn

#### Only firm resolve deters Putin -- reasoning like the DA guts deterrence

Bolster forward presence. As a hedge against further Russian aggression
and to reassure allies, the US deployed two additional heavy brigades to
Poland in February and early March, along with an airborne brigade,
bringing the US rotational "heel-to-toe" brigade there to divisional
strength. US divisional and corps-level headquarters were also sent. The
US 2nd Cavalry Regiment based in Germany (actually a Stryker brigade)
was relocated to Romania at the same time. Additional air units and
ground troops from a number of allies have also been deployed to NATO's
eastern flank, while the forty-thousand-soldier NATO Response Force
(NRF) has been alerted for the first time in its history.

[[Putin's rhetoric and aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark} disinformation
and [[subversion]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts [[have, for years,
targeted the Baltic States]{.underline}]{.mark}, which stand between
Kaliningrad and contiguous Russia and extend almost to the suburbs of
St. Petersburg. [[To forestall future aggression and cement firm
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, these forces should remain in eastern
Europe at least for the near term (i.e., 3--5 years).
[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} the campaign in [[Ukraine unfolds, Putin
should understand clearly that NATO is **postured** to respond
**strongly** to further escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. For many years,
[[policymakers have argued strenuously against]{.underline}]{.mark}
providing the Baltic States, and NATO's eastern flank in general, with
an [[adequate defense for fear of "**provoking**"
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and to "maintain Alliance unity." [[Measures
to build up Ukraine's defensive capacity were resisted for the **same
reasons**]{.underline}]{.mark}; the Barack Obama administration opposed
lethal aid, even after the invasions of Crimea and the Donbas, while the
Donald Trump administration provided only a trickle. [[The invasion of
Ukraine has demonstrated the **pitfalls** of this
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}. Putin's threats were intended to keep his
neighbors weak, but recent events have proven that it is the perception
of weakness, not strength, that provokes him most. Accordingly, [[a firm
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} from the borders of Finnmark to the Black
Sea [[can prevent spillover or regional escalation, communicate resolve,
and reassure]{.mark}]{.underline} host-nation publics [[that the
conflict in Ukraine will not land on their
doorstep]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is under way with the recent
announcement that NATO battlegroups will be posted in Romania, Bulgaria,
Hungary, and Slovakia. Meanwhile, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK),
Denmark, and others have also pledged to increase their forces in the
Baltic States.

To further strengthen deterrence and head off escalation, NATO should
thoughtfully consider how best to help the Baltic States help
themselves. Though proud members of the 2-percent club, their small
economies prevent them from acquiring the air defense and heavy forces
they need to deter future Russian aggression. Estonia and Latvia field
only a single light brigade each, while Lithuania fields a mechanized
brigade with no tanks and a motorized brigade. Using security-assistance
funds (such as the European Deterrence Initiative), the United States
and NATO could equip existing Baltic formations with modern tanks,
self-propelled artillery, and air defense from reserve stocks, along
with the training, spare parts, and ammunition needed to make them
viable. [[The Alliance should also strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark} the
enhanced Forward Presence ([[eFP]{.underline}]{.mark}) formations [[in
the Baltic States]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg has suggested. These forces are too small to pose a credible
offensive threat, but can defend long enough for other NATO forces, such
as the NRF and US armored units in Poland, to move up to assist.

In this regard, [[continuous references to the danger of escalation to
"World War III" and a steady drumbeat of measures not to be taken can
only serve to reassure Putin that he has a free hand in
Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} A degree of strategic ambiguity and the
possibility of US and NATO intervention should he go too far can be
helpful in moderating Russian excesses and controlling escalation. [[An
"all measures on the table" approach will force Russian planners
to]{.underline}]{.mark} consider, and [[prepare
for]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[multiple response scenarios, complicating
resource allocation and inducing uncertainty. While deterrence is more
art than science, signaling to one's opponent that one is too frightened
to engage is more likely to **encourage** than to
**deter**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### No nuclear escalation from Ukraine -- Russia can't find a use that helps its position -- but spurs prolif

There's a third question: what does this mean for nuclear proliferation?
There's been an implicit bargain [[since the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark} that a lot of state[[s agree not to acquire
nuclear weapons in exchange for nuclear states agreeing not to use them
against non-nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} states. And [[this was
a]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[specific part of the Budapest
Memo]{.underline}]{.mark}randum [[with Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Russia has breached that]{.underline}]{.mark} agreement
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly [[threatening to use nuclear
weapons, which could be an argument for other states to want to acquire
nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the other hand, [[Russia has
not used these nuclear weapons likely because it can't figure out an
advantageous way to do so]{.underline}]{.mark}. So I can see the war
either incentivizing proliferation because states look at this and say,
"The only way not to be threatened by nuclear weapons is to have them
ourselves," or I could see states saying, "Here we have a country that
has repeatedly made nuclear weapons central to its National Security
Strategy, has the world's largest nuclear arsenal, and what do they get
from for it? Almost nothing."

### Hardline Good Turn

#### Concessions to Putin fail

Fellow Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security Transatlantic Security

\"Climbing the ladder: How the West can manage escalation in Ukraine and
beyond,\" Atlantic Council (ermo/sms, Acc:6-29-2022)

In short, while these more extreme escalatory options deserve
consideration, most would leave Russia in even worse shape and at
greater risk. Russian elites almost certainly see this. The more
moderate and sensible approach---[[to **withdraw** to pre-war
boundaries, offer concessions to Ukraine and the West, and open Russia
to economic integration and improved relations with the international
community---is highly improbable as long as Putin remains in
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. The most probable outcome is that [[Putin
will **continue to escalate** until he is defeated outright, removed
from power, or offered concessions he can accept as
victory]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Baltics Turn

#### Russia consolidation leads to Baltic escalation

The fourth rung

Consolidating gains. [[Six months into the campaign, Russia will face
one of two outcomes. The first is gradual progress]{.underline}]{.mark}
through a combination of mounting Ukrainian losses---both military and
civilian---that lead to the loss of major urban centers and major
groupings of regular forces. [[Shortages]{.underline}]{.mark} of food,
fuel, spare parts, and precision-guided munitions---as well as attrition
of major combat systems, such as combat aircraft, main battle tanks,
high-altitude air-defense weapons, and self-propelled
artillery---[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}, in time, [[wear down Ukraine's
defense if not quickly replaced by friendly states]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Grinding attrition]{.underline}]{.mark} and catastrophic destruction
of industry, agricultural areas, and infrastructure
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[force the Ukrainian government to
accept a diplomatic settlement]{.underline}]{.mark} that will allow
Putin to claim victory. Such a settlement could include Ukrainian
acceptance of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, and
perhaps Kharkiv and Mariupol, as well as a pledge of permanent
neutrality. Putin would also insist on easing of international sanctions
as a precondition for a ceasefire. Despite serious losses and tactical
defeats, it is too early to count Russia out.

[[In this case, Putin is likely to consolidate his
gains]{.underline}]{.mark}, rebuild and improve his forces, stabilize
his internal domestic politics and economy, and attempt to reestablish
working relationships with Europe---above all, with Germany. [[Even
costly success in Ukraine will not]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[satisfy Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}. The invasion of Ukraine should be
seen as another step in an historic process that includes military
aggression in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea, and the Donbas, as well as the
deployment of Russian troops in frozen conflicts in Armenia and Moldova.
[[Further aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} in areas formerly belonging to
the Russian empire---above all, [[the Baltic
States]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[is **highly likely** following a period
of reorganization and recovery]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Avoiding a stalemate or defeat through extreme escalation. [[The second
outcome is a prolonged stalemate or outright
defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this scenario, after staggering losses
and a scorched-earth campaign throughout Ukraine, Russian forces remain
stalled. Ukrainian regular forces have suffered high losses but remain
largely intact with high morale, while territorial defense forces
continue to fight effectively. Ukrainian performance is actually
improving with combat experience, as well as growing confidence and
elan. Western material and financial support remains strong.

Internally, [[domestic unrest in Russia will become a serious threat to
Putin's regime]{.underline}]{.mark}, as crushing economic hardships
mount and Russian losses and lack of military success become more widely
known. [[Russian oligarchs]{.underline}]{.mark} facing financial
ruin---as well as government, intelligence, and military elites who fear
Putin's wrath and state collapse---[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} act to
[[remove Putin from power]{.underline}]{.mark}. Pressure to resolve the
conflict and reassert control may become overwhelming.

### Prolif Turn

The opportunities and challenges of dual-use technologies

[[Dual-use technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, capabilities, concepts,
and products are ubiquitous, as just about any civilian technology can
have a military application. Examples include GPS, vehicle and aircraft
sensors, safety equipment, weapons components, and weapons themselves.

As technology has advanced, the possibility for additional dual-use
capabilities or new applications of existing capabilities has increased,
which [[creates both opportunities and risks. The proliferation
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of dual-use technology depends on the strength
of export control and treaty regimes, which [[requires
**cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark} between allies and adversaries
alike.

Looking ahead, the rapid pace of technological advancement means
organizations such as [[NATO must demonstrate flexibility and agility
in]{.underline}]{.mark} monitoring and [[understanding technological
advancements to determine when or whether innovation can **further**
Alliance aims or contribute to security
**concerns**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how allies can promote peaceful
and responsible uses of emerging technologies.

The Alliance has already demonstrated its commitment to cooperation over
emerging technologies by introducing the Defence Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic (DIANA) and establishing a NATO Innovation Fund
in 2021.

[[By addressing dual-use, emerging technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the Strategic Concept, [[NATO can demonstrate that it
recognizes]{.underline}]{.mark}---and prioritizes---the [[significant
opportunities and challenges posed by these
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Inclusion in the Strategic Concept
will also promote enduring support for ongoing efforts and could spur
new initiatives to consider the implications of emerging and possibly
disruptive technologies in the future security environment. All of
[[these efforts contribute to NATO's role in deterring illegitimate
pursuits of emerging technologies, while ensuring allies remain at the
cutting ed]{.underline}]{.mark}ge of technological capabilities for
their collective defense.

### Climate Turn

#### Aff NATO cooperation is critical to climate mitigation

\"Visualizing the NATO Strategic Concept: Five ways to look at the

[[As NATO reconceptualizes]{.underline}]{.mark} its role [[to focus on
defense and deterrence while also addressing]{.underline}]{.mark}
non-traditional challenges such as [[emerging technologies and climate
change, the Alliance should look for opportunities to
strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark} climate and technology
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** with partners, especially with
its closest partner states and like-minded international organizations.

NATO's network of partners extends to forty states around the world, and
it includes some of the most innovative economies and global leaders in
addressing climate change. According to the United Nations World
Intellectual Property Organization Global Innovation Index, eight of the
top twenty most innovative global economies are NATO partners. And
according to the MIT Green Future Index, which evaluates countries'
ability to transition to a low-carbon future, six of the top twenty
states are also NATO partners.

### Science Turn

#### Aff Science focus amplifies NATO strength

\"Visualizing the NATO Strategic Concept: Five ways to look at the

New Partnership Priorities

[[NATO should identify a set of priorities for cooperation that
leverages **not only** its allies but the strengths of its
**partners**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As evidenced in the data, [[partner
states are international leaders on climate policy, sustainability, and
clean technology]{.underline}]{.mark}. They also manage sophisticated
markets and innovation ecosystems. They invest heavily in research and
development. And they possess world-class human capital. They have as
much to offer the Alliance as NATO can offer them in conversations about
emerging and disruptive technologies, building climate resilience,
science and technology standards, and responding to natural disasters
and crises, among others.

The Madrid Strategic Concept will redefine the Alliance's core tasks.
The focus will be on defense and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic, but
[[cooperative security]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[relations with
partners are still relevant given the myriad non-traditional challenges
posed by climate, technology, and authoritarianism. Cooperative security
is a means of strengthening the Alliance's relationships
with]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[global innovation and climate
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[leveraging their strengths and
experiences to help shape and sustain the rules-based international
order]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Russia Won't Retaliate

[[Prepare for the **most likely** area of escalation: cyberspace. As
events progressively turn against Putin, the prospect of **cyber** war
will loom ever larger]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it represents one of
Russia's most powerful remaining weapons. Few Western nations possess
true offensive cyber capabilities, and [[the United States **alone**
possesses the ability to **deter** major cyberattacks by delivering
effective and large-scale **reprisals**]{.underline}]{.mark}. President
Joe Biden has issued clear warnings to the private sector to harden its
cyber defenses, which remain patchy and incomplete, and put Putin on
notice that cyber assaults on critical infrastructure, the financial
sector, and other key targets will be met with severe retaliation. A
complicating factor is that [[cyber warfare on a strategic scale has
never occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}, and much remains unknown about it.
For example, [[attacks on critical Russian infrastructure, such as power
grids and transportation networks, could unintentionally cause civilian
deaths]{.underline}]{.mark}, while intrusion into military
command-and-control nodes could alarm the commanders of Russia's nuclear
forces. In many respects, the cyber domain remains the realm of the
unknown. Like aerial warfare in the early twentieth century, [[both
sides must grope forward and learn as they go. A strong and clearly
articulated **cyber-deterrence regime**]{.underline}]{.mark}, punctuated
by sharp demonstrations if necessary, [[is the best **defense**
here]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Russia badly weakened by Ukraine war

**ISA**, 6-24-2022, Institute for Strategic Analysis (in Azeri: Strateji

Perceptional Loss Of Global Stature Post-Ukraine Invasion,\" No
Publication (ermo/sms, Acc:7-1-2022)

Summing-up Russia's military losses in its Ukraine Invasion it is
starkly evident that Russian overwhelming conventional military power
has been militarily ineffective, Russian Army's military prowess resting
on massed use of firepower is questionable and so also is questionable
the 'fighting will' of Russian Army.

Economically, [[Russia's economic strength and resilience stands
emasculated by US & Western sanctions applied post-Ukraine
Invasion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russian economy will be more strangled by
Western sanctions if Russian President Putin persists in 'Turning Defeat
into Victory'.

Russia's vast energy resources on whose high global prices Russian
economic stability rested and which provided a \$ 400 billion military
build-up now is threatened by stringent Western economic sanctions.

[[Economic deprivations are likely to fuel domestic political discontent
with serious implications for stability of the Russian
State]{.underline}]{.mark}. Initial indicators are already are emerging
to the fore.

In conclusion, what can be summed up is that Russian President Putin's
'War of Choice' in [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} Invasion has badly
misfired and not only [[endangers]{.underline}]{.mark} President
[[Putin's longevity in power]{.underline}]{.mark} at Russia's helm
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[seriously sets-back Russia by decades
in]{.underline}]{.mark} its quest for [[regaining its global
stature]{.underline}]{.mark} as an alternative centre of power.

Islamabad : **[There is a need to study the causes of proxy wars, and
what are the potential impacts of such wars on the overall conflict.
These thoughts in a daylong [international seminar on]{.mark} 'Strategic
Dimensions of Peace and [Conflict in]{.mark}]{.underline}** South Asia
and **[[the Middle East]{.mark},' organised by Pak Institute for Peace
Studies (PIPS]{.underline}**), an Islamabad-based think tank,
**[[participated by prominent]{.mark} national and [international
scholars]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Prof]{.underline}**. Shahram **[Akbarzadeh]{.underline}**, Deakin
University, Australia, **[[argued]{.mark} there is significant gap in
the literature on non-state actors]{.underline}**. He called for
empirical research, along with concrete policy suggestions, on the
topic, so as to mitigate the conflicts in the region, in particular
South Asia and Middle East.

Speakers grappled at the notion of non-state actors and proxy wars: PIPS
director Muhammad Amir Rana said **[non-state actors often evoke
memories of violent elements]{.underline}**. This despite that as per
definition, non-state actors include organizations working for human
rights.

Prof. Syed Rifaat Hussain, Department of Government and Public Policy,
NUST, said the term "proxy wars" is a contested notion. There is no
universal agreement on its definition, nor on the set of circumstances
behind such wars. Interestingly, he said, proxy wars are as old as the
phenomena of conventional war itself.

Speakers noted **[[proxy wars are instruments of state
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As to why states go for it, it was argued,
**[it is [because they are]{.mark} often [cheap]{.mark} undertaking to
change the status quo]{.underline}**.

Participants noted over the decades, **[much of the [conflict involves
non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Interstate
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, on the other hand, **[[has
declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent times, he said
**[[tit-for-tat tactics on behalf of such actors have reduced their
appeal.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Dr. Ibrahim **[Fraihat]{.underline}**, Doha Institute of Graduate
Studies, Doha, **[termed proxy war as an arms conflict between two
parties, though one of them is not directly involved]{.underline}**.
This way, **[domestic conflicts are escalated by external power
intervention]{.underline}**. At the same time, proxy war, if unresolved,
can take the shape of conventional war, the most significant example was
of Vietnam War. **[[In contemporary times]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he
lamented, **[[the Middle East has been rendered a stock market of proxy
organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

William Gueriache, Associate Professor American University in the
Emirates Dubai, said on surface, all states support open diplomacy and
multilateralism. Yet the survival of patronage has paved the way for
foreign intervention during conflicts in the whole Middle East.

Dr. Marwan Kablan, Director Policy Analysis at the Arab Center for
Research and Policy Studies Doha, also hinted multiplicity of actors
involved in Syrian conflict, calling it as mother of conflicts in the
region. It was said that wars cannot be ended unless patron states
achieve their interests.

Dr. Shaheen Akhtar, Professor National Defence University Islamabad
focused on the apprehension of Pakistan about India's involvement in
Afghanistan. She said Pakistan's uneasy relationship with Kabul
reinforces a perception of encirclement while growing US-India strategic
cooperation further aggravates these apprehensions.

**[Dr]{.underline}**. Muhammad Riaz **[Shad]{.underline}**, National
University of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad, said **[[fighting
through proxies gives states an opportunity of
deniability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Domestic pushback to plan guts US leadership -- turns case

(ermo/sms, Acc:7-1-2022)

I want to turn back to the question of how this Ukraine-Russia
interaction plays out in terms of state strategies vis-a-vis economics.
We've seen a lot of economic cooperation, but at the heart of some of
the questions you've been asking is this notion that nation-states are
going to be predisposed to look for national economic security, which
will mean developing a capacity for relative strength---independent
strength---vis a vis global changes. The difficulty is that most states
can't do this, and there's a strong impulse toward economic cooperation
along the technological gradient that will allow states to make up for
their potential deficiencies. We've talked at this conference about
semiconductors and it seems pretty clear that no state, even if it does
make major moves in that direction, is going to be capable of complete
autarky in a whole host of these high-tech areas.

The second piece of this relates to domestic politics in the U.S. [[What
we're seeing in the United States is a growing resistance on the part of
segments of the Republican Party to the development of international
support for Ukraine. We're seeing resistance to U.S.
aid]{.underline}]{.mark} for the military, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
we're seeing [[much broader isolationism that goes back to the MAGA
mentality. This has a ripple effect in terms of how other states will
perceive]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
rely on the United States]{.underline}]{.mark} economically. [[The idea
of the U.S. as a reliable]{.underline}]{.mark} economic and security
[[partner is very much at risk]{.underline}]{.mark}.
