## Affirmative Answers

### Framework

#### Vote aff if security cooperation on ai, cybersecurity, or biotech is a good idea or vote neg if it is not -- the aff should get to weigh plan implementation against a competitive alternative and get offense against the means used to achieve \[alt action\], the neg should be held accountable for solvency, resistance, and uniqueness concerns and if they win that, the judge should vote on judge choice -- prefer our interpretation:

1.  **Fairness\-\--neg has a competitive incentive to moot the 1AC
    post-facto**

2.  **Education\-\--debate has [zero]{.underline} value if we never
    discuss the implications of the topic outside of the academy**

### 2AC Perms

**Perm do both**

**Perm do the plan then the alt -- 2x bind: if inclusion after doesn't
solve the links it can't solve the squo**

**Perm do plan and parts of the K not linking to our offense or double
turning the K**

#### Permutation do both: Evaluating synthesis is more productive than prior questions -- their links only prove the mystification of ethics which is why you lean toward problem-solving instead of low link thresholds

To conclude this chapter, [while]{.underline} modernist and
[postmodernist [debates continue, while we are]{.mark} still [unsure as
to what we can legitimately identify as]{.mark} a]{.underline} feminist
[[ethical]{.mark}/political concern, [while we still are unclear about
the relationship between discourse and experience]{.mark}, **[it
is]{.mark}**]{.underline} particularly
**[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}** for feminists **[[that we proceed
with analysis of]{.underline}]{.mark}** both **[[the]{.mark}
material]{.underline}** ([[institutional]{.underline}]{.mark} and
structural) [[as well as the discursive]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This
holds]{.underline} not only for feminists, but [for all theorists
oriented towards the goal of extending further moral inclusion [in
the]{.mark} present social sciences [climate of epistemological
uncertainty. **Important**]{.mark}]{.underline} ethical/[**[political
concerns hang in the balance. We cannot afford to wait]{.mark} for the
meta-theoretical questions to be conclusively answered**. Those answers
may be unavailable.]{.underline} [[Nor can we wait for]{.mark} a
credible vision of an alternative]{.underline} institutional [order to
appear before an]{.underline} emancipatory [agenda can be kicked into
gear. Nor do we have before us a]{.underline} chicken and egg [question
of which comes first: [sorting out]{.mark} the [meta]{.mark}theoretical
[issues]{.mark} or working out which practices contribute to a credible
institutional vision. [The]{.mark} two]{.underline} [[questions can and
should]{.mark} [be pursued together]{.mark}, and can be
[via]{.mark}]{.underline} moral [[imagination]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Imagination can help us think beyond discursive and material
conditions]{.mark} which limit us, [by pushing]{.mark} the
[boundaries]{.mark} of those limitations in thought [and examining what
yields]{.mark}. In this respect, I believe international ethics as
pragmatic critique can be a useful ally to feminist and normative
theorists generally.

Roland **Bleiker 14**, Professor of International Relations, University
of Queensland, "International Theory Between Reification and
Self-Reflective Critique," International Studies Review, 16(2),
6-17-2014, p.325-327

This book is part of an increasing trend of scholarly works that have
embraced poststructural critique but want to ground it in more positive
political foundations, while retaining a reluctance to return to the
positivist tendencies that implicitly underpin much of constructivist
research. The path that Daniel Levine has carved out is innovative,
sophisticated, and convincing. A superb scholarly achievement. For
Levine, [[the key challenge in]{.underline}]{.mark} international
relations ([[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}) [scholarship
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} what he calls ["unchecked reification": the
widespread and dangerous process of **[forgetting "the distinction
between]{.mark} theoretical [concepts and the]{.mark} real-world [things
they]{.mark} mean to [describe]{.mark}**]{.underline} or to which they
refer" (p. 15). [The **[dangers are real]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Levine
stresses, [because **IR deals with** some of the most difficult issues,
[from **genocides** to **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Upholding one
subjective position without critical scrutiny can]{.underline}]{.mark}
thus [[have **far-reaching consequences**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Following Theodor Adorno---who is the key theoretical influence on this
book---Levine takes a post-positive position and assumes that the world
cannot be known outside of our human perceptions and the values that are
inevitably intertwined with them. His ultimate goal is to overcome
reification, or, to be more precise, to recognize it as an inevitable
aspect of thought so that its dangerous consequences can be mitigated.
[Levine]{.underline} proceeds in three stages: First he reviews several
decades of IR theories to resurrect critical moments when scholars
displayed an acute awareness of the dangers of reification. He
refreshingly breaks down distinctions between conventional and
progressive scholarship, for he [detects self-reflective and critical
moments in]{.underline} scholars that are usually associated with
[straightforward positivist positions]{.underline} (such as E.H. Carr,
Hans Morgenthau, or Graham Allison). But Levine also shows how these
moments of self-reflexivity never lasted long and were driven out by the
compulsion to offer systematic and scientific knowledge. The second
stage of Levine\'s inquiry [outlines why]{.underline} IR scholars
regularly closed down critique. Here, he points to a range of factors
and phenomena, from peer review processes to the speed at which
academics are meant to publish. And here too, he eschews conventional
wisdom, showing that work conducted in the wake of the third debate,
[while explicitly **post-positivist**]{.underline} and critiquing the
reifying tendencies of existing [**IR scholarship**, often **lacked
critical self-awareness**]{.underline}. As a result, Levine believes
that many of the [respective authors failed to appreciate sufficiently
that "reification is a consequence of all thinking---including
itself"]{.underline} (p. 68). The third objective of Levine\'s book is
also the most interesting one. Here, he outlines the path toward what he
calls "[sustainable **critique**]{.underline}": a form of
self-reflection that can counter the dangers of reification. Critique,
for him, [is **not just** something that is **directed outwards**,
against particular theories or theorists]{.underline}. [It is **also
inward**-oriented, ongoing, and sensitive to the "limitations of thought
itself"]{.underline} (p. 12). The challenges that such a sustainable
critique faces are formidable. Two stand out: First, if the natural
tendency to forget the origins and values of our concepts are as strong
as Levine and other Adorno-inspired theorists believe they are, then how
can we actually recognize our own reifying tendencies? Are we not all
inevitably and subconsciously caught in a web of meanings from which we
cannot escape? Second, if one constantly questions one\'s own
perspective, does one not fall into a relativism that loses the ability
to establish the kind of stable foundations that are necessary for
political action? Adorno has, of course, been critiqued as relentlessly
negative, even by his second-generation Frankfurt School successors
(from Jürgen Habermas to his IR interpreters, such as Andrew Linklater
and Ken Booth). The response that Levine has to these two sets of
legitimate criticisms are, in my view, both convincing and useful at a
practical level. [He starts off with depicting reification not as a flaw
that is meant to be expunged, but as an a priori condition for
scholarship]{.underline}. The challenge then is not to let it go
unchecked. [**[Methodological pluralism]{.mark}** lies at the heart
of]{.underline} Levine\'s [sustainable critique]{.underline}. He borrows
from what Adorno calls a "constellation": an attempt to **[[juxtapose,
rather than integrate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, different perspectives. It
is in this spirit that Levine advocates [**[multiple methods to
understand the same event]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### A2 Epistemology First

#### Indicts of our epistemology/knowledge production don't come before or disprove the case

**Jackson 2010** (Patrick Thaddeus Jackson, Associate Professor of
International Relations in the School of International Service at the
American University in Washington, DC, 2010, "The Conduct of Inquiry in
International Relations: Philosophy of Science and its Implications for
the Study of World Politics," ebook)

Faced with the impossibility of putting an end to the science question
within IR by turning to the philosophy of science, what should we do?
Since we cannot resolve the question of what science is by appealing to
a consensus in philosophy, [one option is [to]{.mark} become
philosophers of science ourselves, and to [spend our time]{.mark} and
our scholarly efforts [trying to resolve]{.mark} thorny and [abstract
issues about]{.mark} the status of theory and evidence and [the limits
of epistemic certainty]{.mark}.]{.underline} But [this is an unappealing
option for a scholarly field defined]{.underline}, if loosely, [by its
empirical focus (world politics), and]{.underline} it would be roughly
[akin to advising physicists to become philosophers of physics in order
to resolve the question of what physics was and whether it was a
science. This]{.underline} also [[**mis-states the relationship**
between **philosophical debates and**]{.mark} **scientific
[practice]{.mark}**; [practicing scientists have a pretty good]{.mark}
working definition of what it means for something to be "scientific,"
but this "is less a matter of strategy than of [**ongoing evaluative
practice**," conducted in]{.mark} the course of [everyday
knowledge-producing]{.mark} activities]{.underline} (Taylor 1996, 133).
We do not expect physicists to give philosophical answers to questions
about the scientific status of their scholarship; we expect them to
produce knowledge of the physical world. [Similarly, [we should
not]{.mark} expect IR scholars to [engage in "philosophy of IR" **to the
detriment** of generating knowledge about]{.mark} world [politics; the
latter]{.mark}, not the former, [is our main]{.mark} vocational
[task.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Weigh our specific evidence to get closer to the truth

**Kratochwil 2008** (Friedrich Kratochwil, professor of international
relations at European University Institute, 2008(Friedrich, "The Puzzles
of Politics," pg. 200-213)

In what follows, I claim that the shift in focus from "demonstration" to
science as practice provides strong prima facie reasons to choose
pragmatic rather than traditional epistemological criteria in social
analysis.

Irrespective of its various forms, [the epistemological project includes
an argument that all warranted knowledge has to satisfy certain field-
independent criteria that are specified by philosophy]{.underline} (a
"theory of know- ledge"). The real issue of how our concepts and the
world relate to each other, and on which non-idiosyncratic grounds we
are justified to hold on to our beliefs about the world, is "answered"
by two metaphors. The first is that of an inconvertible ground, be it
the nature of things, certain intuitions (Des- cartes' "clear and
distinct ideas") or methods and inferences; the second is that of a
"mirror" that shows what is the case.¶ There is no need to rehearse the
arguments demonstrating that these under- lying beliefs and metaphors
could not sustain the weight placed upon them. A "method" à la Descartes
could not make good on its claims, as it depended ultimately on the
guarantee of God that concepts and things in the outer world match. On
the other hand, the empiricist belief in direct observation forgot that
"facts" which become "data" are -- as the term suggests -- "made". They
are based on the judgements of the observer using cultural criteria,
even if they appear to be based on direct perception, as is the case
with colours.4¶ Besides, [there had always been a sneaking suspicion
that the [epistemological ideal of certainty]{.mark} and rigour [did
not]{.mark} quite [fit the social world]{.mark}]{.underline}, an
objection voiced first by humanists such as Vico, and later rehearsed in
the continuing controversies about erklären and verstehen (Weber 1991;
for a more recent treatment see Hollis 1994). In short, both the
constitutive nature of our concepts, and the value interest in which
they are embedded, raise peculiar issues of meaning and contestation
that are quite different from those of description. As Vico (1947)
suggested, we "understand" the social world because we have "made it", a
point raised again by Searle concerning both the crucial role played by
ascriptions of meaning (x counts for y) in the social world and the
distinction between institutional "facts" from "brute" or natural facts
(Searle 1995). Similarly, since values are constitutive for our
"interests", the concepts we use always portray an action from a certain
point of view; this involves appraisals and prevents us from accepting
allegedly "neutral" descriptions that would be meaningless. Thus, when
we say that someone "abandoned" another person and hence communicate a
(contestable) appraisal, we want to call attention to certain important
moral implica- tions of an act. [Attempting to eliminate the value-tinge
in the description and insisting that everything has to be cast in
neutral, "objective", observational language]{.underline} -- such as "he
opened the door and went through it" -- [would indeed make the statement
"pointless]{.underline}", even if it is (trivially) "true" (for a
powerful statement of this point, see Connolly 1983).¶ [The most
devastating attack on the epistemological project]{.underline}, however,
[came from the history of [science]{.mark} itself]{.underline}. [It not
only [corrected the naive view of knowledge]{.mark} generation
[as]{.mark} mere [accumulation of data, but]{.mark} it [also
cast]{.mark} increasing [doubt]{.mark} on the viability of various
[field-independent "demarcation criteria]{.mark}]{.underline}[".]{.mark}
This was, for the most part, derived from the old Humean argument that
only sentences with empirical content were "meaningful", while value
statements had to be taken either as statements about individual
preferences or as meaningless, since de gustibus non est disputandum. As
the later dis- cussion in the Vienna circle showed, this distinction was
utterly unhelpful (Popper 1965: ch. 2). It did not solve the problem of
induction, and failed to acknowledge that not all meaningful theoretical
sentences must correspond with natural facts.¶ Karl [Popper's ingenious
solution of making "refutability" the logical cri- terion and
interpreting empirical "tests" as a special mode of
deduction]{.underline} (rather than as a way of increasing supporting
evidence) seemed to respond to this epistemological quandary for a
while. An "historical reconstruction" of science as a progressive
development thus seemed possible, as did the specification of a
pragmatic criterion for conducting research.¶ Yet again, studies in the
history of science undermined both hopes. The different stages in
Popper's own intellectual development are, in fact, rather telling. He
started out with a version of conjectures and refutations that was based
on the notion of a more or less self-correcting demonstration. Con-
fronted with the findings that scientists did not use the refutation
criterion in their research, he emphasised then the role of the
scientific community on which the task of "refutation" devolved. Since
the individual scientist might not be ready to bite the bullet and admit
that she or he might have been wrong, colleagues had to keep him or her
honest. Finally, towards the end of his life, Popper began to rely less
and less on the stock of knowledge or on the scientists' shared
theoretical understandings -- simply devalued as the "myth of the
framework" -- and emphasised instead the processes of communica- tion
and of "translation" among different schools of thought within a scien-
tific community (Popper 1994). He still argued that these processes
follow the pattern of "conjecture and refutation", but the model was
clearly no longer that of logic or of scientific demonstration, but one
that he derived from his social theory -- from his advocacy of an "open
society" (Popper 1966). Thus a near total reversal of the ideal of
knowledge had occurred. While formerly everything was measured in terms
of the epistemological ideal derived from logic and physics, "knowledge"
was now the result of deliberation and of certain procedural notions for
assessing competing knowledge claims. Politics and law, rather than
physics, now provided the template.¶ Thus the history of [science has
gradually moved away from the epistemo- logical ideal to focus
increasingly on the actual practices of various scientific communities
engaged in knowledge production, particularly on how they handle
problems of scientific disagreement]{.underline}.5 [This [reorientation
implied]{.mark} a move away from field-independent criteria and from the
demonstrative [ideal]{.mark} to one [in which "arguments" and]{.mark}
the "[weight" of evidence had to be appraised]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, not only generated a bourgeoning
field of "science studies" and their "social" epistemologies (see Fuller
1991), but also [[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} more generally [that
the traditional [understandings of knowledge production based on]{.mark}
the model of "[theory" were in need of revision.]{.mark}]{.underline}¶
If the history of [[science]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
[[provides]{.mark} strong [reasons for a pragmatic
turn]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the discussion above illustrates, what
remains to be shown is how this turn relates to the historical,
linguistic and constructivist turns that preceded it. To start with,
from the above [it should be clear that, in the social world, we are not
dealing with natural kinds that exist and are awaiting, so to speak,
prepackaged, their placement in the appropriate box. The objects we
investi- gate are rather conceptual creations and they are intrinsically
linked to the language through which the social world is
constituted]{.underline}. Here "[constructivists]{.underline}",
particularly those influenced by Wittgenstein and language philosophy,
[easily link up with "pragmatists]{.underline}" such as Rorty, [who
emphasises the product- ive and pragmatic role of "vocabularies" rather
than conceiving of language as a "mirror of nature"]{.underline} (Rorty
1979).¶ Furthermore, precisely because social facts are not natural, but
have to be reproduced through the actions of agents, any attempt to
treat them like "brute" facts becomes doubly problematic. For one, even
"natural" facts are not simply "there"; they are interpretations based
on our theories. Secondly, different from the observation of natural
facts, in which perceptions address a "thing" through a conceptually
mediated form, [[social reality]{.mark} is entirely "arti- ficial" in
the sense that it [is dependent on]{.mark} the [beliefs]{.mark} and
practices of the actors themselves]{.underline}. This reproductive
process, directed by norms, always engenders change either
interstitially, when change is small-scale or adaptive -- or more
dramatically, when it becomes "transformative" -- for instance when it
produces a new system configuration, as after the advent of national-
ism (Lapid and Kratochwil 1995) or after the demise of the Soviet Union
(Koslowski and Kratochwil 1994). [Consequently, any examination of the
social world has to become in a way "historical" even if some
"structuralist" theories attempt to minimise this
dimension]{.underline}. \[. . .\]¶ [Therefore [a pragmatic approach to
social science]{.mark} and IR [seems]{.mark} both necessary and
[promising]{.mark}.]{.underline} ¶ [On the one hand, it is substantiated
by the failure of the epistemological project that has long dominated
the field. On the other, [it offers a different positive heuristics that
challenges]{.mark} IR's [traditional]{.mark} disciplin- ary
[boundaries]{.mark} and methodological assumptions.]{.underline}
Interest in pragmatism therefore does not seem to be just a passing fad
-- even if such an interpre- tation cannot entirely be discounted, given
the incentives of academia to find, just like advertising agencies, "new
and improved" versions of familiar products.

#### Epistemology doesn't indict observations of material reality

**Wendt 2000** (Alexander Wendt, Professor of International Security and
PolSci, Ohio State, 2000 On the Via Media, Review of International
Studies 26)

In the book I argue that, compared to ontology-talk, [[the value of
epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark} talk [for]{.underline} a discipline
like [IR [is]{.mark} [considerably less]{.mark}]{.underline} than
something as imposing as the third 'Great Debate' might suggest. [[What
matters more is what there is, not how we can know it, since we clearly
do know things, and the 'how']{.underline}]{.mark} of this knowledge
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[vary with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the many [[different]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of
[[questions]{.underline}]{.mark} we ask in our field, and the varied
tools at our disposal for answering them.

### A2 Discourse Matters

#### Language focus creates a prison house- prevents solutions to problems

**McNally, 1997** (David McNally, professor of political science at York
University, "in defense of history" p. 26-7)

We are witnessing today a new idealism, infecting large sections of the
intellectual left, which has turned language not merely into an
independent realm, but into an all pervasive realm, a sphere so
omnipresent, so dominant, as virtually to extinguish human agency.
Everything is discourse, you see and discourse is everything. Because
human beings are linguistic creatures, because the world in which we act
is a world we know and describe through language,
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} allegedly follows that there
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} nothing outsides language. Our language, or
"discourse", or "text" -- the jargon varies but not the message --
define and limits what we know, what we can imagine, what we can do.
There is a political theory here too. Oppression is
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} to be rooted ultimately in the way in the
way in which we are and others are defined linguistically, the way in
which we are positioned by words in relation to other words, or by codes
which are said to be "structured like a language." [[Our
very]{.underline}]{.mark} being, our identities and "[[subjectivites,"
are constituted through language]{.underline}]{.mark}. As one trendy
literary theorist puts it in David Lodge's novel Nice Work, it is not
merely that you are what you speak; no, according to the new idealism,
"you are what speaks of you," [[Language is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[the final "prison-house]{.underline}".]{.mark} Our confinement there
is beyond resistance: [[It is impossible to escape from that which makes
us what we are.]{.mark} [This]{.mark} new idealism [corresponds to
a]{.mark} profound [collapse of political
horizons]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is the pseudoradicalism of a
period of retreat for the left, a verbal radicalism of the world without
deed, or, rather, of the word as deed. In response to actual structures
and practices of oppression and exploitation, it offers the rhetorical
gesture, the ironic turn of phrase. It comes as little surprise, then,
when on of the chief philosophers of the new idealism, Jacques Derrida,
tells us that he "would hesitate to use such terms as 'liberation'"
Imprisoned within language, we may play with words; but we can never
hope to liberate ourselves from immutable structures of oppression
rooted in language itself. The new idealism and [[the politics it
entails]{.underline}]{.mark} are not simply harmless curiosities; they
[[are an abdication of political responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially at a time of ferocious capitalist restructuring, of widening
gaps between rich and poor, of ruling class offensives against social
programs. They are also an obstacle to the rebuilding of mass movements
of protest and resistance.

#### Discourse doesn't cause war

**Reiter 95** DAN REITER is a Professor of Political Science at Emory
University and has been an Olin post-doctoral fellow in security studies
at Harvard "Exploring the Powder Keg Myth" International Security v20
No2 Autumn 1995 pp 5-34 JSTOR

A criticism of assessing the frequency of preemptive wars by looking
only at wars themselves is that this misses the non-events, that is,
instances in which preemption would be predicted but did not occur.
However, excluding non-events should bias the results in favor of
finding that preemptive war is an important path to war, as the
inclusion of non-events could only make it seem that the event was less
frequent. There[fore, [if preemptive wars seem infrequent]{.mark} within
the set of wars alone, then [this would]{.mark} have to [be]{.mark}
considered strong evidence in favor of the]{.underline} third, **[[most
skeptical view]{.mark} of preemptive war]{.underline}**, because [even
when the sample is rigged to make preemptive wars seem
frequent]{.underline} (by including only wars), [they are still rare
events]{.underline}. Below, a few cases in which preemption did not
occur are discussed to illustrate factors that constrain preemption.¶
[The rarity of preemptive wars offers preliminary support for
the]{.underline} third, most skeptical [view, that the preemption
scenario does not tell us much about how war breaks out]{.underline}.
[Close]{.mark}r [examination]{.mark} of the three cases of preemption,
set forth below, [**[casts doubt]{.underline}** on the validity
of]{.mark} the two preemption [hypotheses]{.mark} discussed earlier:
[that **[hostile images of the enemy]{.underline}** increase the
chances]{.mark} of preemption, and that belief in the dominance of the
offense increases the chances of preemption. In each case there are
motives for war aside from fear of an imminent attack, indicating that
such [fears may **[not be sufficient to cause
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In addition, in these cases of war the two
conditions hypothesized to stimulate preemption---[hostile
images]{.mark} of the adversary and belief in the military advantages of
striking first---[are **[present to a very high
degree]{.underline}**.]{.mark} This implies that [these are
**[insubstantial causal forces]{.underline}**]{.mark}, as they are
associated with theoutbreak of war only when they are present to a very
high degree. **[[This reduces]{.mark} even further the [significance of
these]{.mark} forces [as causes of war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To
illustrate this point, consider an analogy: say there is a hypothesis
that saccharin causes cancer. Discovering that rats who were fed a lot
of saccharin and also received high levels of X-ray exposure, which we
know causes cancer, had a higher risk for cancer does not, however, set
off alarm bells about the risks of saccharin. Though there might be a
relationship between saccharin consumption and cancer, this is not
demonstrated by the results of such a test.

#### Overemphasis on method destroys their scholarship 

**Wendt 2002** Wendt, Handbook of IR, 2002 p. 68

It should be stressed that in advocating a pragmatic view [we are not
endorsing method-driven social science. [Too much
research]{.mark}]{.underline} in international [relations
[chooses]{.mark}]{.underline} problems or [[things to be
explained]{.mark} [with a view to]{.mark} whether the analysis will
provide support for one or [another]{.mark} [methodological
'ism']{.mark}. But [the point of]{.mark}]{.underline} IR [[scholarship
should be to answer questions]{.mark} about]{.underline} international
[[politics that are of]{.mark} great [normative concern, not to validate
methods.]{.mark} **[Methods are means, not ends]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in themselves. As a matter of personal scholarly choice it may be
reasonable to stick with one method and see how far it takes us. But
since we do not know how far that is, if the goal of the discipline is
insight into world politics then [it makes little sense to rule out one
or the other approach on a priori grounds]{.underline}. In that case
[[a]{.mark} [method]{.mark} indeed [becomes a tacit ontology, which may
lead to neglect of]{.mark} whatever [problems it is poorly suited to
address]{.mark}]{.underline}. Being conscious about these choices is why
it is important to distinguish between the ontological, empirical and
pragmatic levels of the rationalist-constructivist debate. We favor the
pragmatic approach on heuristic grounds, but we certainly believe a
conversation should continue on all three levels.

#### Our reps reflect material reality

**Mearsheimer 1995** John Mearsheimer (International Relations professor
at the University of Chicago) 1995 The False Promise of International
Institutions in International Security Vol 19 Number 3 Winter, pp 43-44.

The main goal of [[critical theorists]{.underline}]{.mark} is to change
state behavior in fundamental ways, to move beyond a world of security
competition and war and establish a pluralistic security community.
However, their [[explanation of how change]{.mark} [occurs is]{.mark} at
best [incomplete]{.mark}, and at worst, internally
contradictory]{.underline}.155 Critical theory maintains that state
behavior changes when discourse changes. But that argument leaves open
the obvious and crucially important question: [[what]{.mark} [determines
why]{.mark} some [discourses become dominant]{.mark} and others lose out
in the marketplace of ideas? What is the mechanism that governs the rise
and fall of discourses?]{.underline} This general question, in turn,
leads to three more specific questions: 1) Why has realism been the
hegemonic discourse in world politics for so long? 2) Why is the time
ripe for its unseating? 3) Why is realism likely to be replaced by a
more peaceful communitarian discourse? [Critical theory provides few
insights on why discourses rise and fall.]{.underline} Thomas Risse-
Kappen writes, \"Research on. . . \'epistemic communities\' of
knowledge-based transna- tional networks has failed so far to specify
the conditions under which specific ideas are selfected and influence
policies while others fall by the wayside.\" 156 Not surprisingly,
critical theorists say little about why realism has been the dominant
discourse, and why its foundations are now so shaky. They certainly do
not offer a well-defined argument that deals with this important issue.
Therefore[, it is difficult to judge the fate of realism through the
lens of critical theory]{.underline}. Nevertheless, critical theorists
occasionally point to particular factors that might lead to changes in
international relations discourse. In such cases, however, they usually
end up arguing that changes in the material world drive changes in
discourse. For example, when Ashley makes surmises about the future of
realism, he claims that \"a crucial issue is whether or not changing
historical conditions have disabled longstanding realist rituals of
power.\" Specifically, he asks whether \"developments in late capitalist
society;\" like the \"fiscal crisis of the state,\" and the
\"internationalization of capital,\" coupled with \"the presence of
vastly destructive and highly automated nuclear arsenals \[has\] de-
prived statesmen of the latitude for competent performance of realist
rituals of power?\" 157 Similarly, [Cox argues]{.underline} that
[fundamental [change occurs when there is a \"disjuncture\" between
\"the stock of ideas people have about the nature of the world and the
practical problems that challenge them]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" He then
writes, \"Some of us think the erstwhile dominant mental construct of
neorealism is inadequate to confront the chal- lenges of global politics
today.\"158 It would be understandable if realists made such arguments,
since they believe there is an objective reality that largely determines
which discourse will be dominant. Critical theorists, however, emphasize
that the world is socially constructed, and not shaped in fundamental
ways by objective factors. Anarchy, after all, is what we make of it.
Yet [when critical theorists attempt to explain why realism may be
losing its hegemonic position, they too point to objective factors as
the ultimate cause of change. [Discourse]{.mark}, so it appears, [turns
out not to be determinative, but]{.mark}]{.underline} mainly [[a]{.mark}
[reflection of developments in the objective world.]{.mark} In short, it
seems that when critical theorists who study inter- national politics
offer glimpses of their thinking about the causes of change in the real
world, they make arguments that directly contradict their own theory,
but which appear to be compatible with the theory they are
challenging.]{.underline}159 There is another problem with the
application of critical theory to international relations. Although
critical theorists hope to replace realism with a discourse that
emphasizes harmony and peace, critical theory per se emphasizes that it
is impossible to know the future. Critical theory, according to its own
logic, can be used to undermine realism and produce change, but it
cannot serve as the basis for predicting which discourse will replace
realism, because the theory says little about the direction change
takes. In fact, Cox argues that although \"utopian expectations may be
an element in stimulating people to act \... such expectations are
almost never realized in practice.\"

### Extinction outweighs

#### Extinction outweighs

Institute. 2018. "Global Catastrophes: The Most Extreme Risks." Risk in
Extreme Environments: Preparing, Avoiding, Mitigating, and Managing,
edited by Vicki Bier, Routledge, pp. 174--184.

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? [Taken **literally**, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a rather low threshold]{.underline}
for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death
on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a
global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic
for the deceased and their loved ones. [However, in common usage, a
global catastrophe would be **catastrophic** for a significant portion
of the globe]{.underline}. Minimum thresholds have variously been set
around ten thousand to ten million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter
of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have
emphasized catastrophes that cause **long-term declines in the
trajectory of human civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that
human civilization **does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and
Baum 2013), [that drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). [A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that **[some]{.mark}
[catastrophes]{.mark} [are vastly more important than
others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to
recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983).
[Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred
million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity
would presumably carry on. However, with **nuclear
winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan, [**[humanity]{.mark} [could go
extinct]{.mark}**. The loss would be not just an additional four billion
or so deaths, but the [loss of **all future
generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion lives]{.mark}**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
[may]{.mark} even [be an **underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
analysis here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the
human species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an **infinite length of time** or
instead merely an **astronomically large but finite** length of
time]{.underline} (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the
stakes with global catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives.** Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert
et al. 2007), [but they have **limited practical significance**. This
can be seen when **evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework**. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, [society should **try 500 trillion times harder to
prevent**]{.mark} **a [global catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it
should [to save a person's life]{.mark}**. Or, preventing one million
deaths is equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability
of global catastrophe. This suggests society should **make extremely
large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives.**]{.underline} Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
[society should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to
prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend
at least [\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the
probability of global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable
disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count
future generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**. The discussion thus far
has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is
**not universally held**]{.underline}. [People often value some people
more than others]{.underline}, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. [Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time, or social relation,
as well as the unborn members of future generations. [This debate is
crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed,
if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [[While
everyone has the right to their **own views**]{.mark} **and
feelings**]{.underline}, we find that [[the strongest arguments are for
the **widely held position** that **all human lives should be valued
equally**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This position is succinctly stated in
the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848
Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident:
that all men and 3 women are created equal". [[Philosophers speak of
a]{.mark}n agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere"]{.underline}
(Nagel 1986) [or [a "veil of ignorance"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rawls
1971) [[in which each]{.mark} person [considers what is best for society
**irrespective of which member**]{.mark} **of society [they happen to
be]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such a perspective **suggests [valuing
everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless of who they are or where or when
they live. This in turn [suggests a **very high value for reducing
GCR**]{.mark}, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}

#### Extinction is the only [egalitarian metric]{.underline}\-\--anything else collapses cooperation on [collective action]{.underline} crises and makes extinction inevitable 

**Khan 18** (Risalat, activist and entrepreneur from Bangladesh
passionate about addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and other
existential challenges. He was featured by The Guardian as one of the
"young climate campaigners to watch" (2015). As a campaigner with the
global civic movement Avaaz (2014-17), Risalat was part of a small core
team that spearheaded the largest climate marches in history with a
turnout of over 800,000 across 2,000 cities. After fighting for the
Paris Agreement, Risalat led a campaign joined by over a million people
to stop the Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh to protect the Sundarbans
World Heritage forest, and elicited criticism of the plant from Crédit
Agricolé through targeted advocacy. Currently, Risalat is pursuing an
MPA in Environmental Science and Policy at Columbia University as a SIPA
Environmental Fellow, "5 reasons why we need to start talking about
existential risks,"
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/5-reasons-start-talking-existential-risks-extinction-moriori/)

**[Infinite]{.underline}** future **[possibilities]{.underline}** I find
the story of the Moriori profound. It teaches me two lessons. Firstly,
that [[human culture is **far from immutable**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
That we can struggle against our baser instincts. That **[[we
can]{.mark} master them and [rise to]{.mark} unprecedented
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Secondly, that [even this does not
make us masters of our own destiny. We can make visionary choices, but
the future can still surprise us.]{.underline} This is a humbling
realization. Because **[[faced with an uncertain future, the only wise
thing we can do is prepare]{.underline}]{.mark}** for possibilities.
Standing at the launch pad of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, [the
possibilities seem endless. They range from]{.underline} an era of
[abundance to the end of humanity]{.underline}, and everything in
between. How do we navigate such a wide and divergent spectrum? I am an
optimist. From my bubble of privilege, life feels like a rollercoaster
ride full of ever more impressive wonders, even as I try to fight the
many social injustices that still blight us. However, the accelerating
pace of change amid uncertainty elicits one fundamental observation.
[Among the infinite future possibilities**, [only one outcome is truly
irreversible: extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[Concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} about extinction
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[dismissed]{.mark} as **apocalyptic
alarmism**]{.underline}. Sometimes, they are. But [repeating that
mankind is still here after 70 years of existential warning about
nuclear warfare is a **straw man argument**.]{.underline} **[The fact
that a 1000-year flood has not happened does not negate its
possibility]{.underline}**. And [there have been **far too many nuclear
near-misses to rest easy.**]{.underline} As the World Economic Forum's
Annual Meeting in [Davos discusses]{.underline} how to create a shared
future in a fractured world, here are [five reasons why the possibility
of existential risks should raise the stakes of
conversation:]{.underline} 1. **[[Extinction is the rule]{.mark}, not
the exception]{.underline}** More than [[99.9% of all the species that
ever existed are gone]{.underline}. **[Deep time is
unfathomable]{.underline}**]{.mark} to the human brain. But [if one
cares to take a tour of the billions of years of life's history, we find
a litany of forgotten species.]{.underline} And we have only discovered
a mere fraction of the extinct species that once roamed the planet. In
the speck of time since the first humans evolved, more than [99.9% of
all]{.underline} the distinct [human cultures that have ever existed are
extinct.]{.underline} Each hunter-gatherer tribe had its own
mythologies, traditions and norms. They wiped each other out, or
coalesced into larger formations following the agricultural revolution.
However, as major civilizations emerged, even those that reached
incredible heights, such as the Egyptians and the Romans, eventually
collapsed. [It is only in the very recent past that we became a truly
global civilization]{.underline}. Our interconnectedness continues to
grow rapidly. "Stand or fall, we are the last civilization", as Ricken
Patel, the founder of the global civic movement Avaaz, put it. 2.
Environmental pressures can drive extinction More than [15,000
scientists just issued a 'warning to humanity']{.underline}. They called
on us to reduce our impact on the biosphere, 25 years after their first
such appeal. The warning notes that we are far outstripping the capacity
of our planet in all but one measure of ozone depletion, including
emissions, biodiversity, freshwater availability and more. The
scientists, not a crowd known to overstate facts, conclude: "soon it
will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and
time is running out". In his 2005 book Collapse, Jared [Diamond charts
the history of past societies]{.underline}. He makes the case that
[overpopulation and resource use beyond the carrying capacity have often
been important,]{.underline} if not the only, drivers [of
collapse.]{.underline} Even though we are making important incremental
progress in battles such as climate change, [we must]{.underline} still
[achieve tremendous]{.underline} step [changes in our response to
several major environmental crises.]{.underline} We must do this even
while the world's population continues to grow. These pressures are
bound to exert great stress on our global civilization. 3.
Superintelligence: unplanned obsolescence? Imagine a monkey society that
foresaw the ascendance of humans. Fearing a loss of status and power, it
decided to kill the proverbial Adam and Eve. It crafted the most
ingenious plan it could: starve the humans by taking away all their
bananas. Foolproof plan, right? This story describes the fundamental
difficulty with superintelligence. A superintelligent being may always
do something entirely different from what we, with our mere mortal
intelligence, can foresee. In his 2014 book Superintelligence, Swedish
philosopher Nick Bostrom presents the challenge in thought-provoking
detail, and advises caution. **[Bostrom cites a survey of industry
experts that projected a 50% chance of the development of artificial
superintelligence by 2050]{.underline}**, **[and a 90% chance by
2075]{.underline}**. The latter date is within the life expectancy of
many alive today. [Visionaries]{.underline} like Stephen Hawking and
Elon Musk have [warned of the existential risks from artificial
superintelligence.]{.underline} Their opposite camp includes Larry Page
and Mark Zuckerberg. But on an issue that concerns the future of
humanity, is it really wise to ignore the guy who explained the nature
of space to us and another guy who just put a reusable rocket in it? 4.
Technology: known knowns and unknown unknowns Many fundamentally
disruptive technologies are coming of age, from bioengineering to
quantum computing, 3-D printing, robotics, nanotechnology and more. Lord
Martin Rees describes potential existential challenges from some of
these technologies, such as a bioengineered pandemic, in his book Our
Final Century. Imagine if North Korea, feeling secure in its isolation,
could release a virulent strain of Ebola, engineered to be airborne.
Would it do it? Would ISIS? Projecting decades forward, we will likely
develop capabilities that are unthinkable even now. The unknown unknowns
of our technological path are profoundly humbling. 5. \'The Trump
Factor\' Despite our scientific ingenuity, we are still a confused and
confusing species. Think back to two years ago, and how you thought the
world worked then. Has that not been upended by the election of Donald
Trump as US President, and everything that has happened since? The mix
of billions of messy humans will forever be unpredictable. When the
combustible forces described above are added to this melee, we find
ourselves on a tightrope. What choices must we now make now to create a
shared future, in which we are not at perpetual risk of destroying
ourselves? Common enemy to common cause [Throughout history, we have
rallied against the 'other']{.underline}. [Tribes]{.underline} have
[overpowered tribes,]{.underline} [empires have conquered
rivals]{.underline}. Even today, [our fiercest displays of unity
typically happen at wartime. We]{.underline} give our lives for our
motherland and defend nationalistic pride like a wounded lion. But like
the early Morioris, [we 21st-century citizens find ourselves on an
**increasingly unstable island**.]{.underline} [[We may have a violent
past, but]{.mark} **we have [no more dangerous enemy than
ourselves]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Our task is to find]{.underline} our
own Nunuku's Law. [Our own shared contract, based on [equity, would help
us navigate safely.]{.mark}]{.underline} It [would ensure [a future that
unleashes the full potential of our]{.mark} still-budding human
[civilization]{.mark}, in all its diversity. [We cannot do this unless
we are **humbly grounded in the possibility of our own
destruction**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Survival is life's primal
instinct]{.underline}**. [In the absence of a common enemy, we must find
common cause in survival.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Our future may depend on
whether we realize this.]{.underline}

#### Existence is a prerequisite to ontological questioning

Global Environmental Policy Program at American University) Winter 2003

http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=539

THE THIRD response to eco-criticism would require critics to acknowledge
the ways in which they themselves silence nature and then to respect the
sheer otherness of the nonhuman world. Postmodernism prides itself on
criticizing the urge toward mastery that characterizes modernity. But
isn\'t mastery exactly what postmodernism is exerting as it captures the
nonhuman world within its own conceptual domain? [Doesn\'t postmodern
cultural criticism deepen the modernist urge toward mastery by
eliminating the ontological weight of the nonhuman world]{.underline}?
What else could it mean to assert that there is no such thing as nature?
I have already suggested the postmodernist response: yes, recognizing
the social construction of \"nature\" does deny the self-expression of
the nonhuman world, but how would we know what such self-expression
means? Indeed, nature doesn\'t speak; rather, some person always speaks
on nature\'s behalf, and whatever that person says is, as we all know, a
social construction. All attempts to listen to nature are social
constructions-except one[. [Even the most radical]{.mark} postmodernist
[must acknowledge the distinction between physical existence and
non-existence.]{.mark}]{.underline} As I have said, [postmodernists
accept that [there is a physical substratum to the]{.mark} phenomenal
[world]{.mark} even if they argue about the different meanings we
ascribe to it. [This]{.mark} acknowledgment of physical existence [is
crucial.]{.mark}]{.underline} We can\'t ascribe meaning to that which
doesn\'t appear. What doesn\'t exist can manifest no character. Put
differently, yes, [the postmodernist should rightly worry about
interpreting nature\'s expressions. And all of us should be wary of
those who claim to speak on nature\'s behalf]{.underline} (including
environmentalists who do that). [But [we need not doubt]{.mark} the
simple idea [that a prerequisite of expression is existence.
This]{.mark} in turn [suggests that preserving the]{.mark} nonhuman
[world]{.mark}-in all its diverse embodiments-[must
be]{.mark}]{.underline} seen by eco-critics as [[a fundamental
good]{.underline}]{.mark}. Eco-critics must be supporters, in some
fashion, of environmental preservation.

#### Existential threats [outweigh]{.underline} -- all life has [infinite value]{.underline} and extinction [eliminates the possibility]{.underline} for future generations -- err against threats, because of innate [cognitive biases]{.underline} 

**GPP 17** (Global Priorities Project, Future of Humanity Institute at
the University of Oxford, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland,
"Existential Risk: Diplomacy and Governance," Global Priorities Project,
2017,
<https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf>)
1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK In his book Reasons and Persons,
Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit advanced an influential argument about
the importance of avoiding extinction: I believe that if we destroy
mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people
think. [[Compare]{.mark} three outcomes: (1) [Peace]{.mark}. (2) A
nuclear [war that kills 99%]{.mark} of the world's existing population.
(3) A nuclear [war that kills 100%]{.mark}.]{.underline} (2) would be
worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of
these two differences? [Most people believe that the greater difference
is between (1) and (2).]{.underline} [I believe that [the difference
between (2) and (3) is]{.mark} very [much greater]{.mark}]{.underline}.
\... [The Earth will remain habitable for **at least another billion
years**.]{.underline} [Civilization began only a few thousand years
ago.]{.underline} [[If we do not destroy \[hu\]mankind]{.mark},
[these]{.mark} few thousand [years may be]{.mark} only [**a tiny
fraction** of the whole of civilized]{.mark} human
[history]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The difference between (2) and (3) may
thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of
this history.]{.underline} [If we compare this possible history to a
day, what has occurred so far is only a **fraction of a
second**.65]{.underline} In this argument, it seems that Parfit is
assuming that the survivors of a nuclear war that kills 99% of the
population would eventually be able to recover civilisation without
long-term effect. As we have seen, this may not be a safe assumption --
but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point stands. [What
makes [existential catastrophes]{.mark} especially bad is that they
[would]{.mark} "**[destroy the future]{.mark}**," as]{.underline}
another Oxford philosopher, Nick [Bostrom, puts it.]{.underline}66
[[This future could]{.mark} potentially [be]{.mark} extremely
[long]{.mark} and full of [flourishing]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} would
therefore [have]{.mark} extremely [large value]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
standard risk analysis, when working out how to respond to risk, we work
out the expected value of risk reduction, by weighing the probability
that an action will prevent an adverse event against the severity of the
event. [Because the value of preventing existential catastrophe is so
vast, even a tiny probability of prevention has huge expected
value.]{.underline}67 Of course, there is persisting reasonable
disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one might
resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. [In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future
generations.]{.underline} For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear
waste storage, governments have considered timeframes of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, and even a million years.69 Justifications for
this policy usually appeal to principles of intergenerational equity
according to which future generations ought to get as much protection as
current generations.70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable
development require development that meets the needs of the current
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.71 [However, when it comes to existential risk, it
would seem that we fail to live up to principles of intergenerational
equity.]{.underline} [[Existential catastrophe would]{.mark} not only
[give future generations]{.mark} less than the current generations; **it
would give them [nothing]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing
existential risk plausibly has a quite low cost for us in comparison
with the huge expected value it has for future generations.]{.underline}
In spite of this, relatively little is done to reduce existential risk.
[Unless we give up on norms of intergenerational equity, they give us a
strong case for significantly increasing our efforts to reduce
existential risks.]{.underline} 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE
SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY [In spite of the importance of [existential risk]{.mark}
reduction, it probably [receives less attention than]{.mark} is
[warranted]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international
cooperation is required if we are to receive adequate protection from
existential risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be
underinvested in [There are several reasons why existential risk
reduction is likely to be underinvested in.]{.underline} [Firstly, [it
is a global public]{.mark} good.]{.underline} [Economic theory predicts
that such goods tend to be underprovided.]{.underline} [The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.]{.underline}
Consequently, a country which reduces existential risk gains only a
small portion of the benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs.
Countries thus have strong incentives to free ride, receiving the
benefits of risk reduction without contributing. As a result, too few do
what is in the common interest. [Secondly]{.underline}, as already
suggested above, [existential risk reduction is an
[intergenerational]{.mark} public [good]{.mark}: most of the benefits
are enjoyed by future generations who have no say in the political
process.]{.underline} [For these goods, the problem is temporal free
riding: the current generation enjoys the benefits of inaction while
future generations bear the costs. Thirdly]{.underline}, many
[[existential risks]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as machine
superintelligence, engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering,
[[pose]{.mark} an [unprecedented]{.mark} and uncertain future
threat.]{.underline} Consequently, it is hard to develop a satisfactory
governance regime for them: there are few existing governance
instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is unclear what
shape new instruments should take. In this way, our position with regard
to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we faced when nuclear
weapons first became available. [[Cognitive biases also lead people to
underestimate]{.mark} existential [risks]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Since
there have not been any catastrophes of this magnitude, these risks are
not salient to politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 This is an
example of the misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental
shortcut which assumes that something is important only if it can be
readily recalled. [[Another]{.mark} cognitive bias affecting perceptions
of existential risk [is scope neglect]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a seminal
1992 study, three groups were asked how much they would be willing to
pay to save 2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered
oil ponds. The groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In
this case, the size of the benefits had little effect on the scale of
the preferred response. [People become numbed to the effect of saving
lives when the numbers get too large.]{.underline} 74 [Scope neglect is
a particularly acute problem for existential risk because the numbers at
stake are so large.]{.underline} [Due to scope neglect, decision-makers
are prone to treat existential risks in a similar way to problems which
are less severe by many orders of magnitude.]{.underline} A wide range
of other cognitive biases are likely to affect the evaluation of
existential risks.75

### Realism Good

**Realism is inevitable -- Uncertainty and enmity between states is
[fixed]{.underline} -- Justifies our epistemology and takes out the
alternative.**

**[de Araujo 14]{.underline}** (Marcelo, professor for Ethics at
Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, "Moral Enhancement and
Political Realism," Journal of Evolution and Technology 24(2): 29-43)

Some **[moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline}** that **[a
society of morally enhanced individuals]{.underline}** **[would be in a
better position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely
to face in]{.underline}** the future such as, for instance, the threats
posed by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** **[The assumption here is]{.underline}** quite
simple: **[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems
mainly from a sort of deficit in human beings' moral
motivation]{.underline}**. **[If human beings were morally
better]{.underline}** -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions --
**[there would be fewer wars, less terrorism, and more willingness to
save our environment.]{.underline}** Although simple and attractive,
**[this assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. **[[At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind]{.mark} in the future [is not a deficit]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
our [moral dispositions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[but]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the endurance of [an old political
arrangement]{.mark} that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a
collective basis.]{.underline}** The political arrangement I have in
mind here is the international system of states. In my analysis of the
political implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my
attention only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the
future by making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss
the threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some
human enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will
explain, in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between
"human nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field
of international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been
among the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form
of human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase
of the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in
the "future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
**[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}**, for instance, **[to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline}** or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some **[studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline}**,and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, **[may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}**n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and
Kugler 2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also
been reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of
empathy" (Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would
like to examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. **[The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline}** on the
one hand, **[threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}**, on
the other, **[a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}**learly **[made by]{.underline}** some **[moral
enhancements theorists]{.underline}**. Douglas, for instance, argues
that "according to many plausible theories, some of the world's most
important problems --- such as developing world poverty, climate change
and war --- can be attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230).
Walker, in a similar vein, writes about the possibility of "using
biotechnology to alter our biological natures in an effort to reduce
evil in the world" (2009, 29). And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson
go as far as to defend the "the need for moral enhancement" of humankind
in a series of articles, and in a book published in 2012. One of the
reasons Savulescu and Persson advance for the moral enhancement of
humankind is that our moral dispositions seem to have remained basically
unchanged over the last millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These
dispositions have proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human
beings as a species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other
in the collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, **[both
positions are correct in recognizing the real possibility of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.]{.underline}** The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). **[Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline}** (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The **[attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}**, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, **[Sparrow correctly argues that ["structural issues," rather
than human nature, constitute]{.mark} the main factor underlying
[political conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he
does not explain what exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend
to do later. Sparrow is right in rejecting the human nature theory
underlying the human enhancement project. But this underlying
assumption, in my view, is not trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as
he suggests. Human nature realism has been implicitly or explicitly
endorsed by leading political philosophers ever since Thucydides
speculated on the origins of war in antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003,
23--36). True, it might be objected that "human nature realism," as it
was defended by Morgenthau and earlier political philosophers, relied
upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical conception of human nature, a
conception that, actually, did not have the support of any serious
scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167). Yet, over the last few years
there has been much empirical research in fields such as developmental
psychology and evolutionary biology that apparently gives some support
to the realist claim. Some of these studies suggest that an inclination
to aggression and conflict has its origins in our evolutionary history.
This idea, then, has recently led some authors to resume "human nature
realism" on new foundations, devoid of the metaphysical assumptions of
the early realists, and entirely grounded in empirical research. Indeed,
some recent works in the field of international relations theory already
seek to call attention to evolutionary biology as a possible new start
for political realism. This point is clearly made, for instance, by
Bradley Thayer, who published in 2004 a book called Darwin and
International Relations: On the Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic
Conflict. And in a paper published in 2000, he affirms the following:
Evolutionary theory provides a stronger foundation for realism because
it is based on science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory
to explain two human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the
egoistic and dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly
described as "realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I
focus on these two traits because they are critical components of any
realist argument in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000,
125; see also Thayer 2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to
egoism and domination stems from human evolutionary history. The
predominance of conflict and competition in the domain of international
politics, he argues, is a reflex of dispositions that can now be proved
to be part of our evolved human nature in a way that Morgenthau and
other earlier political philosophers could not have established in their
own time. Now, what some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct
intervention in our "evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to
make us "fit" to cope with some possible devastating consequences from
the predominance of conflict and competition in the domain of
international politics (Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral
enhancement theorists comprehend the nature of war and conflicts,
especially those conflicts that humankind is likely to face in the
future, as the result of human beings' limited moral motivations.
Compared to supporters of human nature realism, however, moral
enhancement theorists are less skeptical about the prospect of our
taming human beings' proclivity to do evil. For our knowledge in fields
such as neurology and pharmacology does already enable us to enhance
people's performance in a variety of activities, and there seems to be
no reason to assume it will not enable us to enhance people morally in
the future. But **[the question]{.underline}**, of course, is **[whether
moral enhancement will]{.underline}** also **[improve the prospect of
our coping successfully]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** some major
threats to the **[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and
Persson propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as
proposed by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call
attention is that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly
presupposed by some moral enhancement theorists -- has been much
criticized over the last decades within the tradition of political
realism itself. "Structural realism," unlike "human nature realism,"
does not seek to derive a theory about conflicts and violence in the
context of international relations from a theory of the moral
shortcomings of human nature. Structural realism was originally proposed
by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State and War, published in 1959, and then
later in another book called Theory of International Politics, published
in 1979. In both works, Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any
specific conception of human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis
is that the thrust of the political realism doctrine can be retained
without our having to commit ourselves to any theory about the
shortcomings of human nature. What is relevant for our understanding of
international politics is, instead, our understanding of the "structure"
of the international system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer,
too, is an important contemporary advocate of political realism.
Although he seeks to distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz,
he also rejects human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself
as a supporter of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of
the basic tenets of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or
"structural realism") is, first, that the **[[states are
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** main, if not the **[[only, relevant
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the context of international relations;
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** second, that states [**[compete for
power]{.underline}** in]{.mark} the international arena.
**[[Moral]{.mark} [considerations]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
international affairs, according to realists, **[[are
secondary]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[when set against]{.mark} the
state's primary goal]{.underline}**, **[namely its own security and
[survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such
as Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human
beings' natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and
Mearsheimer argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem
from human nature, but from the very "structure" of the international
system of states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and
Mearsheimer, **[it is this structure that compels individuals to act as
they do in the domain of international affairs.]{.underline}** And one
distinguishing feature of the international system of states is **[its
"anarchical structure,"]{.underline}** i.e. the lack of a central
government analogous to the central governments that exist in the
context of domestic politics. **[It means that each individual state is
responsible for its own integrity and survival]{.underline}**. **[In the
absence of a superior authority]{.underline}**, over and above the power
of each sovereign state, **[[political leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**
often **[feel compelled to [favor security over
morality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[[even if]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[human beings
turn out to become [morally enhanced]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
future, **[[humankind]{.mark} may [still]{.mark} have to [face the same
scary scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}** described by some moral
enhancement theorists. **[This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}**, **[human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline}** within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But **[under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline}** -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). **[What has to be
changed]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}**, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While **[[moral
enhancement]{.underline}]{.mark}** may possibly have desirable results
in some areas of human cooperation that do not badly threaten our
security -- such as donating food, medicine, and money to poorer
countries -- it **[[will not motivate political leaders to
dismantle]{.mark} their [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Neither will it deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}**, **[at any rate not [as long as the structure
of]{.mark} international [politics compels them to see]{.mark}
prospective [cooperators in the present as possible enemies in the
future]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The idea of a "structure" should not be
understood here in metaphysical terms, as though it mysteriously existed
in a transcendent world and had the magical power of determining
leaders' decisions in this world. The word "structure" denotes merely a
political arrangement in which there are no powerful law-enforcing
institutions. And **[in the absence of the kind of security that
law-enforcing institutions have the force to create]{.underline}**,
**[political [leaders will]{.mark}]{.underline}** often [**[fail to
cooperate,]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} occasionally
**[[engage in]{.underline}]{.mark}** conflicts and
[**[wars]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[in those areas that are critical to
their]{.underline}** security and **[survival]{.underline}**. Given the
structure of international politics and the basic goal of survival,
**[this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}**, **[[even
if,]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the future, political **[[leaders become
less egoistic and power-seeking]{.mark}]{.underline}** through moral
enhancement. On the other hand, since the structure of the international
system of states is itself another human institution, there is no reason
to suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, **[addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
[bioengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[is unlikely to yield]{.mark}
the expected [results]{.mark}, so long as moral enhancement is pursued
[within the present framework]{.mark} of the international system of
states]{.underline}**.

"Making Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial
Thought,"
https://academic.oup.com/ips/article-abstract/11/3/221/3798787\]

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that **[those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with [a]{.mark} number of possible
[responses]{.mark}: one is to [deem realism, in all its complex]{.mark}
and contradictory [manifestations,]{.mark} as [a failed,
unethical,]{.mark} and [fundamentally racist/imperial
project]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} A second response is to
politically align against liberalism, while holding this partnership at
arm's length. **[A third response]{.underline}**, derived from Ayoob's
(2002) subaltern realism, **[is to work on an epistemic register,
selectively taking insights from realist traditions that help better
explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}**. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this **[[failing does not
delegitimize]{.mark} other [realist insights]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
What is important for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to
combine plausible realist insights with other categories that can grasp
the extent of global politics, including the dynamics of the
postcolonial experience, better.

The final response is the one I advance. To adopt a mode of
argumentation concerned with building a counter-imperial machine is to
neither dismiss constituencies that become caught up in imperial
formations, nor merely to tactically align with them; rather,
establishing resonant connections among postcolonial and realist lines
of thought, highlighting shared dispositions to difference, is to push
the latter toward repositioning itself on new ethical lines that limit
contemporary forms of violence. To recover a minor position in realism
is not to accept all realist positions, nor is it to synthesize or
convert any theoretical line into a coherent framework. It is, however,
to amplify the shared spirituality that informs both realist and
postcolonial thinking, drawing constituencies toward prudential rather
than imperial defenses of difference. It is to furnish current research
agendas with an anti-imperial focus, to seek the creative possibilities
that may arise when divergent constituencies meet, interfuse, and shift.
Thus, our response to Morgenthau, as to other realists, is to cultivate
the connections that do exist, not for epistemic reasons but for a
political project that strengthens counter-imperial movements.

Thinking from the Present

By way of conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that
motivates a theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial
thinking. If the ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of
liberalism and its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a
return to classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and
above postcolonial approaches. However, the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a counter-imperial machine, to cultivate a shared
spirituality that can gather diverse and divergent constituencies to
confront dangerous practices. In my estimation, countering an imperial
machine that operates in complex ways and at complex sites requires a
political strategy as unwieldy and diffuse, linking constituencies that
we may otherwise dismiss. **[[That]{.mark} a tradition of
[realism]{.mark} regularly [circulates through halls of power]{.mark}
across the globe [should be reason not to reject]{.mark} righteously
[but]{.mark} rather [to leverage its authorized status. We can talk
about]{.mark} [imperialism]{.mark}, knowledge production, and race here,
[while they can talk about anarchy]{.mark}, power, [and
self-interest]{.mark} there---or we can theoretically work on the lines
of thought that reverberate among us]{.underline}**. To reiterate,
building a countermachine is not driven to "pragmatic" reconciliation or
consensus and, thus, remains distinct from the "eclecticism" of other
plural approaches popular in IR today. While the combinatory logic of
paradigmatic synthesis has its place, the connections between realist
and postcolonial thought articulated here are made in a far more
agonistic manner. Rather than produce something like a
"postcolonial-realism," **[this]{.underline}** argument **[involves
pushing contemporary realist scholarship toward new research agendas and
new forms of critique]{.underline}** that both capture a spirit internal
to its own traditions while confronting the realities of contemporary
global politics. It engages with minor positions along the realist canon
to orient today's realism away from the logic of great power politics
operating under anarchy toward an understanding of how the logic of
liberal order permits forms of imperial intervention.

Needless to say, **[drawing together realist and postcolonial
thought]{.underline}**, as this essay has done, **[can be met with
analytical skepticism and political hostility. [A mode]{.mark} of
argumentation [that refuses comparisons]{.mark} of theoretical cores or
non-truncated readings of select theorists [strikes a note of analytical
evasion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To this there is no defense---other than
that already discussed at length. On the other hand, if the expressly
political purpose of this work is accepted, the argument anticipates
strong political reservations: why align the project of postcolonial
theory with realism, an unethical tradition of militarism and
realpolitik? To this I would respond that while a kind of strategic
essentialism has its place, **[[reducing "realists"]{.mark} to a
coherent body of thought [not only obscures]{.mark} the
[complexity]{.mark} of their thinking]{.underline}** (see never-ending
interpretations of Machiavelli as an example) **[[but reproduces the
narrative]{.mark} of transhistorical unity [that some]{.mark} realists
[use to authorize unethical]{.mark} policy [programs]{.mark} in the
first place]{.underline}**. More critically, however, **[in embodying an
[unproductive ahistoricism]{.mark}, it [poses]{.mark} conventional
[realist categories of anarchy, selfinterest]{.mark}, and military power
[as the]{.mark} political [problem to confront]{.mark} whereas [the
present]{.mark} historical [context demands attunement to how]{.mark}
some of [these drives]{.mark}]{.underline}** (militarism, national
interest) **[[connect with discrete problems]{.mark} of liberalism and
imperial practices]{.underline}**. In fact, there are good reasons to
think that the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and
Morton 2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR
theory is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of a US
liberal world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while
realism may have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must
theorize from the present. In doing so, we may find that **[[countering
imperial formations may benefit from]{.mark} resonances established not
just among postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and other "critical"
theorists but contemporary [realists who identify links between]{.mark}
[liberalism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Walt 2013). Indeed, **[[if realism]{.mark} as a policy program
defending the national interest [is entangled with]{.mark} current
militaristic and imperial [interventions, we should push the
premise]{.mark} of this statement, [that difference should be defended,
in anti-imperial]{.mark} and prudential
[directions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Doing so may allow new openings to
emerge in the present sense of closure, new strategies to think and
defend alternative politics. In this way, we may more fully embody
postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow critique or
brash conversion but rather attentive translation.

### No impact

#### Threat con doesn't cause war

**Kaufman 9**, Prof Poli Sci and IR -- U Delaware, '9, (Stuart J,

Case," *Security Studies* 18:3, 400 -- 434)

[[Even when hostile narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}, group [fears, and
opportunity [are]{.mark}]{.underline} strongly [[present, war occurs
only if these]{.mark} factors [are harnessed]{.mark}. Ethnic narratives
and fears must combine to create significant]{.underline} ethnic
[hostility among]{.underline} mass [publics. Politicians
must]{.underline} also [seize the opportunity to manipulate that
hostility]{.underline}, evoking hostile narratives and symbols to gain
or hold power by [riding a wave of chauvinist mobilization.]{.underline}
Such mobilization is often spurred by prominent events (for example,
episodes of violence) that increase feelings of hostility and make
chauvinist appeals seem timely. If the other group also mobilizes and if
each side\'s felt security needs threaten the security of the other
side, [the result is a security dilemma spiral]{.underline} of rising
fear, hostility, and mutual threat that results in violence. [A virtue
of]{.underline} this [symbolist theory is that symbolist logic explains
why]{.underline} ethnic [[peace is more common than]{.mark}
ethnonationalist [war.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Even if hostile
narratives]{.underline},]{.mark} fears, and opportunity [[exist,]{.mark}
severe [violence]{.mark}]{.underline} usually [[can]{.underline}]{.mark}
still [[be avoided if]{.underline}]{.mark} ethnic
[[elites]{.underline}]{.mark} skillfully [[define group needs]{.mark} in
moderate ways [and collaborate across]{.mark} group
[lines]{.mark}]{.underline} to prevent violence: this is
consociationalism.17 War is likely only if hostile narratives, fears,
and opportunity spur hostile attitudes, chauvinist mobilization, and a
security dilemma.

#### There's no impact to the K -- reps don't shape reality

**Balzacq 5** (Thierry, Professor of Political Science and International
Relations at Namur University, "The Three Faces of Securitization:
Political Agency, Audience and Context" European Journal of
International Relations, London: Jun 2005, Volume 11, Issue 2)

However, despite important insights, this position remains highly
disputable. The reason behind this qualification is not hard to
understand. With great trepidation my contention is that **[one of the
main distinctions we need to take into account while examining
securitization is that between \'institutional\' and \'brute\' threats.
In its attempts to follow a]{.underline}** more **[radical approach to
security problems where]{.underline}**in **[threats are]{.underline}**
institutional, that is, **[mere products of communicative
relations]{.underline}** between agents, the **[CS has neglected the
importance of \'external]{.underline}** or brute threats\', that is,
**[[threats]{.mark} that [do not depend on language mediation to be what
they are]{.mark}]{.underline}**- **[hazards for human life. In
methodological terms]{.underline}**, however, **[any framework
[over-emphasizing ]{.mark}]{.underline}**either
**[institutional]{.underline}** or brute **[threat [risks losing sight
of]{.mark} important aspects of [a multifaceted
phenomenon]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, securitization, as suggested
earlier, is successful when the securitizing agent and the audience
reach a common structured perception of an ominous development. In this
scheme, there is no security problem except through the language game.
Therefore, **[how problems are \'out there\' is exclusively contingent
upon how we linguistically depict them.]{.underline}** This **[is not
always true]{.underline}**. For one, **[[language does not construct
reality]{.mark}; at best, it shapes our perception of it]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[[it is not theoretically useful nor]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is it **[[empirically credible to hold that what we say about a problem
would determine its essence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For instance,
**[[what I say about a typhoon would not change its
essence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The consequence of this position, which
would require a deeper articulation, is that **[some security problems
are the attribute of the development itself]{.underline}**. In short,
**[threats are not only institutional; some of them can actually wreck
entire political communities regardless of the use of
language]{.underline}**. **[Analyzing security problems then becomes a
matter of understanding how external contexts, including external
objective developments, affect securitization.]{.underline}** Thus, far
from being a departure from constructivist approaches to security,
**[external developments are central to it.]{.underline}**

#### No threat inflation

**Ravenal 09** -- (2009, Earl, Professor Emeritus at the Edmund A. Walsh
School of Foreign Service and the Department of Government at Georgetown
University, "What\'s Empire Got to Do with It? The Derivation of
America\'s Foreign Policy," Critical Review: An Interdisciplinary
Journal of Politics and Society 21.1, 21-75)

Rummaging through the concomitants of "imperialism," Eland (2004, 65)
discovers the thesis of [["threat inflation"]{.underline}]{.mark} (in
this case, virtual threat invention): Obviously, much higher spending
for the military, homeland security, and foreign aid are required for a
policy of global intervention than for a policy of merely defending the
republic. For example, after the cold war, the security bureaucracies
began looking for new enemies to justify keeping defense and
intelligence budgets high. Similarly, Eland (ibid., 183), in a section
entitled "Imperial Wars Spike Corporate Welfare," attributes a large
portion of the U.S. defense budget---particularly the procurement of
major weapons systems, such as "Virginia‐class submarines ... aircraft
carriers ... F‐22 fighters ... \[and\] Osprey tilt‐rotor transport
aircraft"---not to the systemically derived requirement for certain
kinds of military capabilities, but, rather, to the imperatives of
corporate pork. He opines that such weapons have no strategic or
operational justification; that "the American empire, militarily more
dominant than any empire in world history, can fight brushfire wars
against terrorists and their 'rogue' state sponsors without those
gold‐plated white elephants." The underlying notion of "the security
bureaucracies ... looking for new enemies" [[is]{.mark} a
[threadbare]{.mark} concept that has somehow taken hold across the
political spectrum]{.underline}, from the radical left (viz. Michael
Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the liberal center
(viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most alleged "threats"
as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen Carpenter
\[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the Cato
Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [[What is
missing]{.mark} from most analysts' claims of "threat inflation,"
however, [is a]{.mark} convincing theory of [why]{.mark}]{.underline},
say, the American government significantly (not merely in excusable
rhetoric) might magnify and even invent threats (and, more seriously,
act on such inflated threat estimates). In a few places,
[Eland]{.underline} (2004, 185) [suggests that such behavior might stem
from military or national security bureaucrats' attempts to enhance
their personal status and organizational budgets]{.underline}, or even
from the influence and dominance of "the military‐industrial complex";
viz.: "Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback from that
empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the military‐industrial
complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section: In the nation's
capital, [vested interests]{.underline}, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies ... [routinely take advantage of "crises"]{.underline}to
satisfy parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to
get pet projects--- a.k.a. pork---funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus,
"bureaucratic‐politics" theory, which once made several reputations
(such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and Graham Allison)
in defense‐intellectual circles, and spawned an entire sub‐industry
within the field of international relations, 5 is put into the service
of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary. So, too, can a
surprisingly cognate theory, "public choice," 6 which can be considered
the right‐wing analog of the "bureaucratic‐politics" model, and is a
preferred interpretation of governmental decision‐making among
libertarian observers. As Eland (2004, 203) summarizes: [Public‐choice
theory argues]{.underline} \[that\] [the government]{.underline} itself
[can develop separate interests from its citizens]{.underline}. The
government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and the
interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although
this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more
severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies
that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of
public‐choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of
contradiction: [Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time,
subservient]{.underline} to societal interest groups [and
autonomous]{.underline} from society in general. This journal has
pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely consequence of
the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity (e.g., Somin
1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But state
autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute their own
interests for those of what could be called the "national society" that
they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that, precisely
because of the public‐ignorance and elite‐expertise factors, and
especially because the opportunities---at least for bureaucrats (a few
notable post‐government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)---for lucrative
self‐dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and diplomatic areas
of government than they are in some of the contract‐dispensing and more
under‐the‐radar‐screen agencies of government, the "public‐choice"
imputation of self‐dealing, rather than working toward the national
interest (which, however may not be synonymous with the interests,
perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is less likely to hold. In short,
state autonomy is likely to mean, in the derivation of foreign policy,
that "state elites" are using rational judgment, in insulation from
self‐promoting interest groups---about what strategies, forces, and
weapons are required for national defense. Ironically, "public
choice"---not even a species of economics, but rather a kind of
political interpretation---is not even about "public" choice, since,
like the bureaucratic‐politics model, it repudiates the very notion that
bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they are held,
axiomatically, to exhibit "rent‐seeking" behavior, wherein they abuse
their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at least to
build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches. Such
sub‐rational models actually explain very little of what they purport to
observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding the
"behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances, under
some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that they
posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives. My treatment of "role" differs from that of the
bureaucratic‐politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of
foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and
specific identification of the role‐playing of organizationally situated
individuals in a partly conflictual "pulling and hauling" process that
"results in" some policy outcome. Even here, bureaucratic‐politics
theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that "some
players are not able to articulate \[sic\] the governmental politics
game because their conception of their job does not legitimate such
activity." This is a crucial admission, and one that
points---empirically---to the need for a broader and generic treatment
of role. [Roles]{.underline} (all theorists state) [give rise to
"expectations" of performance. My point is that [virtually every]{.mark}
governmental role, and especially [national‐security roles]{.mark}, and
particularly]{.underline} the roles of [the]{.underline} uniformed
[military]{.underline}, [[embody]{.mark} expectations of [devotion to
the "national interest"]{.mark}]{.underline}; [**[rationality]{.mark}**
in the derivation of policy]{.underline} at every functional level;
[[and **objectivity**]{.mark} in the treatment of
parameters]{.underline}, especially external parameters [such as
"threats"]{.underline} and the power and capabilities of other nations.
[Sub‐rational models]{.underline} (such as "public choice") [fail to
take into account even a partial dedication to the "national"
interest]{.underline} (or even the possibility that the national
interest may be honestly misconceived in more parochial terms). [In
contrast, an official's role connects the individual to the]{.underline}
(state‐level) [process, and moderates the]{.underline} (perhaps
otherwise) [self‐seeking impulses of the individual]{.underline}.
[[Role‐derived behavior tends to be **formalized and
codified**]{.underline}]{.mark}; relatively [[**transparent**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} at least
**[[peer‐reviewed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, so as to be consistent with
expectations; [surviving the particular individual and transmitted to
successors and ancillaries]{.underline}; [measured against a
standard]{.underline} and thus corrigible; [defined in terms
of]{.underline} the performed [function]{.underline} and therefore
derived from the state function; [and uncorrrupt, because]{.underline}
personal [cheating and]{.underline} even egregious [aggrandizement are
conspicuously discouraged]{.underline}. My own direct observation
suggests that [defense decision‐makers attempt to "frame" the structure
of the problems that they try to solve on the basis of the most accurate
intelligence]{.underline}. [They make it their business to know where
the threats come from]{.underline}. Thus, **[[threats are not "socially
constructed"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even though, of course, some values
are). [A major reason for]{.underline} the [rationality,
and]{.underline} the [objectivity]{.underline}, of the process [is that
much [security planning is done]{.mark}, not in vaguely undefined
circumstances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior,
but [rather in structured]{.mark} and reviewed [organizational
frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Non‐rationalities]{.underline}]{.mark} (which are bad for
understanding and prediction[) tend to [get filtered
out]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[People are fired for]{.mark} presenting
[skewed analysis and]{.mark} for making [bad
predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because [something important
is riding on the causal analysis and the contingent
prediction]{.underline}. For these reasons, "public choice" does not
have the "feel" of reality to many critics who have participated in the
structure of defense decision‐making. In that structure, obvious, and
even not‐so‐obvious[, ["rent‐seeking"]{.underline}]{.mark} [would not
only be shameful; it would present a severe [risk]{.mark} of [career
termination]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, as mentioned, [the defense
[bureaucracy is hardly a]{.mark} [productive place for]{.mark} truly
talented [rent‐seekers]{.mark} to operate]{.underline}, [[compared
to]{.mark} opportunities for personal profit in [the commercial
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. A bureaucrat's very self‐placement in these
reaches of government testifies either to a sincere commitment to the
national interest or to a lack of sufficient imagination to exploit
opportunities for personal profit.

### Securitization Good / Alt fails

2010, Critique, Security and Power: The political limits to emancipatory
approaches, pg. 127-129

The following section will briefly raise some questions about the
[rejection of the old security framework]{.underline} as it has been
taken up by the most powerful institutions and states. [Here we can
begin to see the political limits to critical and emancipatory
frameworks]{.underline}. In an international system which is marked by
great power inequalities between states, the [[rejection of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} old narrow national interest-based [[security]{.mark}
framework]{.underline} by major international institutions, [and the
adoption of]{.underline} ostensibly [emancipatory policies]{.underline}
and policy rhetoric, [has the consequence of [problematis]{.mark}ing
weak or [unstable states and allow]{.mark}ing international institutions
or major states a more [intervention]{.mark}ary role]{.underline}, yet
[[without]{.mark} establishing mechanisms by which the citizens of
states being intervened in might have any [control]{.mark} over the
agents or agencies of their emancipation. Whatever the problems
associated with the pluralist security framework there were at least
formal and clear demarcations. [This]{.mark} has the consequence of
[entrench]{.mark}ing international [power inequalities and
allow]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark} a shift towards a [hierarchical
international order]{.mark} in which the citizens in weak or unstable
states may arguably have even less freedom or power than
before]{.underline}. Radical critics of contemporary security policies,
such as human security and humanitarian intervention, argue that we see
an assertion of Western power and the creation of liberal subjectivities
in the developing world. For example, see Mark Duffield's important and
insightful contribution to the ongoing debates about contemporary
international security and development. Duffield attempts to provide a
coherent empirical engagement with, and theoretical explanation of,
these shifts. Whilst these shifts, away from a focus on state security,
and the so-called merging of security and development are often
portrayed as positive and progressive shifts that have come about
because of the end of the Cold War, Duffield argues convincingly that
these shifts are highly problematic and unprogressive. For example, the
rejection of sovereignty as formal international equality and a
presumption of nonintervention has eroded the division between the
international and domestic spheres and led to an international
environment in which Western NGOs and powerful states have a major role
in the governance of third world states. Whilst for supporters of
humanitarian intervention this is a good development, Duffield points
out the depoliticising implications, drawing on examples in Mozambique
and Afghanistan. Duffield also draws out the problems of the retreat
from modernisation that is represented by sustainable development. The
Western world has moved away from the development policies of the Cold
War, which aimed to develop third world states industrially. Duffield
describes this in terms of a new division of human life into uninsured
and insured life. Whilst we in the West are 'insured' -- that is we no
longer have to be entirely self-reliant, we have welfare systems, a
modern division of labour and so on -- sustainable development aims to
teach populations in poor states how to survive in the absence of any of
this. [Third world populations must be taught to be self-reliant, they
will remain uninsured. Self-reliance of course means the condemnation of
millions to a barbarous life of inhuman bare survival]{.underline}.
Ironically, although sustainable development is celebrated by many on
the left today, by leaving people to fend for themselves rather than
developing a society wide system which can support people, sustainable
development actually leads to a less human and humane system than that
developed in modern capitalist states. Duffield also describes how many
of these problematic shifts are embodied in the contemporary concept of
human security. For Duffield, we can understand these shifts in terms of
Foucauldian biopolitical framework, which can be understood as a
regulatory power that seeks to support life through intervening in the
biological, social and economic processes that constitute a human
population (2007: 16). Sustainable development and human security are
for Duffield technologies of security which aim to create self-managing
and self-reliant subjectivities in the third world, which can then
survive in a situation of serious underdevelopment (or being uninsured
as Duffield terms it) without causing security problems for the
developed world. For Duffield this is all driven by a neoliberal project
which seeks to control and manage uninsured populations globally.
Radical critic Costas Douzinas (2007) also criticises new forms of
cosmopolitanism such as human rights and interventions for human rights
as a triumph of American hegemony. Whilst we are in agreement with
critics such as Douzinas and Duffield that [these [new security
frameworks cannot be empowering, and]{.mark} ultimately [lead to more
power for powerful states]{.mark}]{.underline}**,** we need to
understand why these frameworks have the effect that they do. We can
understand that these frameworks have political limitations without
having to look for a specific plan on the part of current powerful
states. In new security frameworks such as human security we can see the
political limits of the framework proposed by critical and emancipatory
theoretical approaches.

#### Even if security is a construction, the alt cannot create change in actors that have already internalized it

**Wendt 92** (Alexander, Assistant Professor of Political Science at
Chicago, "Anarchy is what States Make of it: The Social Construction of
Power Politics, International Organization, VOl. 46, no. 2.)

Let us assume that processes of identity- and interest-formation have
created a world in which states do not recognize rights to territory or
existence---a war of all against all. In this world, anarchy has a
"realist" meaning for state action: be insecure and concerned with
relative power. [Anarchy has]{.underline} this [meaning only in virtue
of collective]{.underline}, insecurity-producing [practices, but
[if]{.mark} those [practices are]{.mark} relatively [stable,
they]{.mark} do constitute a system that may [resist change.]{.mark} The
fact [that]{.mark}]{.underline} worlds of [power [politics are]{.mark}
socially [constructed]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words, [[does not
guarantee they are malleable]{.underline},]{.mark} for at least two
reasons. The first reason is that [[once constituted, any]{.mark} social
[system confronts]{.mark} each of its [members as an objective]{.mark}
social [fact that reinforces]{.mark}]{.underline} certain
[[behaviors]{.underline}]{.mark} and discourages others. Self-help
systems, for example, tend to reward competition and punish altruism.
[The possibility of [change depends on whether]{.mark} the
[exigencies]{.mark} of such competition [leave room for]{.mark} actions
that [deviate from the]{.mark} prescribed [script. If they do not, the
system will be reproduced and **deviant actors will**
**not**."]{.mark}]{.underline} The second reason is that [systemic
[change may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[be inhibited]{.underline}
by]{.mark} actors' [[interests in maintaining]{.mark}., relatively
[stable]{.mark} role [identities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such interests
are [rooted]{.underline} not only [in the desire to minimize
uncertainty]{.underline} [and]{.mark} anxiety, [manifested in efforts to
confirm existing-beliefs about the social world, but also in the [desire
to avoid]{.mark} the expected [costs of breaking commitments]{.mark}
made to others---notably domestic constituencies and foreign allies in
the case of states]{.underline}---as part of past practices. The level
of resistance that these commitments induce will depend on the
"salience" of particular role identities to the actor. The United
States, for example, is more likely to resist threats to its identity as
"leader of anticommunist crusades" than to its identity as "promoter of
human rights." But [[for]{.mark} almost [any]{.mark} role [identity,
practices]{.mark}]{.underline} and information [[that challenge
it]{.mark} are likely to [create]{.mark} cognitive dissonance
and]{.underline} even [[perceptions of threat]{.mark}, and
[these]{.mark} may [cause]{.mark} [resistance to transformations]{.mark}
of the self]{.underline} and thus to social change." For both systemic
and "psychological" reasons, then, intersubjective understandings and
expectations may have a self-perpetuating quality, constituting
path-dependencies that new ideas about self and other must transcend.
This does not change the fact that through practice agents are
continuously producing and reproducing identities and interests,
continuously "choosing now the preferences \[they\] will have later."
But it does mean that choices may not be experienced with meaningful
degrees of freedom. [This could be a constructivist justification for
the realist position that only simple learning is possible in self-help
systems.]{.underline} [The realist might concede that such [systems
are]{.mark} socially [constructed]{.mark} and [still]{.mark} argue that
after the corresponding identities and in have become institutionalized,
[they are]{.mark} almost]{.underline} [[impossible to
transform]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Threats are real -- we must securitize them to prevent war 

**Knudsen 1**-- PoliSci Professor at Sodertorn (Olav, Post-Copenhagen
Security Studies, Security Dialogue 32:3)

Moreover, I have a problem with the underlying implication that it is
unimportant whether states \'really\' face dangers from other states or
groups. In the Copenhagen school, threats are seen as coming mainly from
the actors\' own fears, or from what happens when the fears of
individuals turn into paranoid political action[. In my view, this
emphasis on the subjective is [a misleading conception of
threat]{.mark}, in that it [discounts]{.mark} an independent [existence
for]{.mark} what- ever is perceived as [a threat]{.mark}. Granted,
political life is often marked by [misperceptions]{.mark}, mistakes,
pure imaginations, ghosts, or mirages, but such phenomena [do not occur
simultaneously to large numbers of politicians, and hardly most of the
time]{.mark}. During the Cold War, [threats]{.mark} - in the sense of
plausible possibilities of danger - referred to \'real\' phenomena, and
they [refer to \'real\' phenomena]{.mark} now]{.underline}. The objects
referred to are often not the same, but that is a different matter.
Threats have to be dealt with both ín terms of perceptions and in terms
of the phenomena which are perceived to be threatening. The point of
Waever's concept of security is not the potential existence of danger
somewhere but the use of the word itself by political elites. In his
1997 PhD dissertation, he writes, 'One can View "security" as that which
is in language theory called a speech act: it is not interesting as a
sign referring to something more real - it is the utterance itself that
is the act.'24 The deliberate disregard of objective factors is even
more explicitly stated in Buzan & WaeVer's joint article of the same
year." As a consequence, the phenomenon of threat is reduced to a matter
of pure domestic politics." It seems to me that the security dilemma, as
a central notion in security studies, then loses its foundation. Yet I
see that Waever himself has no compunction about referring to the
security dilemma in a recent article.\" This discounting of the
objective aspect of threats shifts security studies to insignificant
concerns. [What has long made \'threats\' and 'threat perceptions'
important phenomena in the study of IR is the implication that [urgent
action may be required]{.mark}. Urgency, of course, is where Waever
first began his argument in favor of an alternative security conception,
because a convincing sense of urgency has been the chief culprit behind
the abuse of \'security\' and the consequent 'politics of
panic\']{.underline}, as Waever aptly calls it." Now, here - in the case
of urgency - another baby is thrown out with the Waeverian bathwater.
When real situations of urgency arise, those situations are challenges
to democracy; they are actually at the core of the problematic arising
with the process of making security policy in parliamentary democracy.
But in Waever's world, threats are merely more or less persuasive, and
the claim of urgency is just another argument[. I hold that [instead of
\'abolishing\' threatening phenomena]{.mark} 'out there' by
reconceptualizing them, as Waever does, [we should]{.mark} continue
[pay]{.mark}ing [attention to them, because situations with]{.mark} a
[credible]{.mark} claim to [urgency will keep coming back]{.mark} and
then we need to know more about how they work in the interrelations of
groups and states (such as civil wars, for instance), not least to find
adequate democratic procedures for dealing with them.]{.underline}

#### Our impact is [epistemologically sound]{.underline} -- it's based on readings of history and statistically strong modelling -- empirics are the best way to make predictions -- the alt causes extinction

Stanford University. 1995. "The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate."
p.115-116.

[There are [two]{.mark} basic kinds of [errors]{.mark} that one can make
[in assessing nations]{.mark} other than one\'s own]{.underline}. The
first error is [[rooted in **ethnocentrism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
is [a common mistake]{.underline} Americans make when looking at others:
we [too often assume that other nations are less competent, less
intelligent, and less rational than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Kenneth Waltz has performed an important service
in this regard: his analysis of nuclear proliferation is a valuable
corrective against such ethnocentrism and the blind spots it can create
among both scholars and government officials. He is absolutely correct,
in my view, to criticize a number of proliferation pessimists who argue,
in effect, that the United States has been perfect in handling nuclear
weapons (but others will not be), that the United States can control
these awesome weapons forever (but no one else can), or that the United
States has utterly unproblematic civil-military relations (but no one
else does). Waltz\'s analysis should serve as a constant reminder of how
dangerous it is in international affairs to assume, to put it crudely,
that the United States is smart, but that other nuclear states are or
will be stupid. [[The second]{.mark} basic error, however, [is the
opposite: to assume that others are better than we are]{.mark}. This
is]{.underline}, I believe, [the central problem with]{.underline}
Kenneth Waltz\'s [arguments about the consequences of
proliferation]{.underline}. He now appears to accept many of the
arguments made by scholars who have studied the operational accidents
and near-accidents, conflicts in civil-military relations, and other
organizational problems experienced by the United States during the Cold
War. Yet he maintains [that other states will do better, will be
smarter, will learn more quickly, [will]{.mark}, in short, [avoid the
kinds of errors]{.mark} that [we have suffered]{.mark} in the
past]{.underline}. I believe, in contrast, that [[there are]{.mark} both
**[strong theoretical]{.mark} reasons [and]{.mark} emerging [empirical
evidence]{.mark}** [to expect that new states will not avoid such
problems]{.mark}. New nuclear powers [may not make exactly the same
mistakes]{.mark} as their predecessors; [but]{.mark} they are [likely to
make their own serious errors, and some will be
deadly]{.mark}]{.underline}.
