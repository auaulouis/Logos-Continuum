The Myth of the Offense Contrary to observed patterns of limited
disruption and espionage, Cyber Command sees cyberspace as a domain
fraught with increasing risk, where great powers such as China and
Russia will undermine American power. The only solution, from this
perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the [benefits of an
offensive posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in cyberspace,
[[are]{.mark} mostly **[illusory]{.mark}**]{.underline} to date.
Instead, the [cyber]{.underline} domain [tends to be optimized for
defense and **deception**, not **decisive offensive
blows**.]{.underline} Not only is [offense]{.underline} likely the
weaker form of competition in cyberspace, it also **[risks inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}**. The fear, suspicion, and misperception that
characterize interstate rivalries exacerbate the risk of offensive
action in cyberspace. Cyber Command's 2018 persistent-action strategy
aims to "expose adversaries' weaknesses, learn their intentions and
capabilities, and counter attacks close to their origins."44 Put in
simple terms, the best defense is a good offense: get on adversary
networks and stop cyber operations targeting the United States before
they occur. Under this strategy, offensive cyber operations will also be
preemptive in that they are designed to "contest dangerous adversary
activity before it impairs \[U.S.\] national power."45 To use another
sports metaphor, come out swinging. Go on the offense first and
establish escalation dominance (that is, demonstrating such superior
capabilities over the target state that it can't afford to escalate in
response).46 According to Cyber Command, preemptive strikes will "impose
. . . strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift
resources to defense and reduce attacks."47 Whether through punishment,
risk, or denial strategies, offensive actions theoretically alter the
target's behavior by increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S.
interests.48 Offensive action, according to this thinking, deters future
aggression by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance.
Yet, there are well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options
produce the intended results in cyberspace. Defense and Deception The
rationale behind persistent action---that the best defense is a good
offense---is deeply flawed. In fact, most military and strategic theory
holds that the defense is the superior posture.49 For example, Sun Tzu
describes controlling an adversary to make their actions more
predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them to attack
strong points.50 The stronger form of war is a deception-driven defense:
confusing an attacker so that they waste resources attacking strong
points that appear weak. This parallels cybersecurity scholars Erik
Gartzke and Jon Lindsay's claim that [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}space
[[is **not offense** ]{.mark}**dominant**, **[but deception
dominant]{.mark}**]{.underline}.51 [Rather than persistent]{.underline}
action and [preemptive strikes]{.underline} on adversary networks, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs
**persistent deception** and **defensive counterstrikes**]{.mark}
optimized [to undermine adversary planning and
capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline} Fear and the Security Dilemma [New
policy options]{.underline} proposed [by Cyber Command and]{.underline}
the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration risk
[[exacerbat]{.underline}]{.mark}ing fear in other countries and creating
a self-reinforcing spiral of tit-for-tat escalations that risk war even
though each actor feels he is acting defensively---or, as it is called
in the scholarly literature, [[a **security
dilemma**]{.underline}]{.mark}.52 As shown above, [most cyber
op]{.underline}eration[s to date have not resulted in
escalation]{.underline}. [The cyber domain has been a world of
spies]{.underline} collecting valuable information [and engaging in
limited disruptions that **substitute** for]{.underline}, as well as
complement, [more conventional options]{.underline}. [Shifting
to]{.underline} a policy of **[[preemptive offensive
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** warfare [[risks **provoking fear** and
**overreaction**]{.underline}]{.mark} in other states and possibly
producing conflict spirals. [[Even
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}-objective cyber offensive
[[action]{.underline}]{.mark} defined as ["**defending forward**" [can
be **misinterpreted** and lead to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 As the historian Cathal Nolan puts
it, "intrusions into a state's strategically important networks pose
serious risks and are therefore inherently threatening."54 More
worryingly, with a more offensive posture, it will be increasingly
difficult for states to differentiate between cyber espionage and more
damaging degradation operations.55 [[What]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[calls
**defending forward**, **China and Russia will call preemptive
strikes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Worse still, [[this]{.mark} posture
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[lead great powers to assume
all]{.mark} network [intrusions]{.mark}, including espionage, [are
preparing]{.mark} the environment [for **follow-on offensive
strikes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to cybersecurity scholar Ben
Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own view, such moves are clearly
defensive, merely ensuring that its military will have the strength and
flexibility to meet whatever comes its way. Yet potential adversaries
are unlikely to share this perspective."56 The new strategy risks
[[producing a "**forever cyber war**"]{.mark} prone to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline} because it implies all cyber operations should
be interpreted as escalatory by adversaries.57

Deter, then Defend? NATO's defenses are only as strong as the sum of
those of its members. Like in other domains, [alliance cyber assets are
not NATO-owned but provided by member states.]{.underline}19 [[**U.S.
capabilities** in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain [are]{.mark} by far
[the **most sophisticated among**]{.mark} **the
[allies]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Besides having an edge over most
competitors]{.underline} in the field of cyber security,20 [the United
States **tops [ranking]{.mark}s** [as]{.mark} a **global [leader in
offensive cyber capabilities]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}21 The
recent [announcement that it would contribute its capabilities to NATO
operations consequently could help the alliance **bolster its deterrence
posture** against hostile cyber-attacks.]{.underline} Until recently,
[NATO and member states]{.underline}, including the United States, have
[relied on strictly defensive cyber tools to protect their
infrastructure.]{.underline} However, [given that this approach has done
**little to discourage hostile actors**]{.underline}, the strategic
value of [incorporating **o**ffensive **c**yber **o**perations has long
been discussed.]{.underline} In late 2017, [Stoltenberg
announced]{.underline} that [[NATO]{.mark} would [integrate cyber
weapons]{.mark} of its members into military operations to deter and
defend against threats, [marking the "**biggest overall policy shift in
decades**,"]{.mark}]{.underline} according to officials.22 The U.S.
decision to commit offensive and defensive capabilities to NATO follows
on the heels of this move. The [addition of offensive cyber tools to the
defense and deterrence toolbox is not only new for NATO, it]{.underline}
also [tracks a **recent shift in the U.S. posture**.]{.underline} The
White House authorized the use of offensive cyber weapons to deter
foreign adversaries in September following the publication of the
Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy.23 The
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[incorporates]{.underline}]{.mark}
a new mission of [["defending forward"]{.mark} as a means to "disrupt or
halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that
falls below the level of armed conflict."]{.underline}24 [While
defending forward is]{.underline}, as the name suggests, [defensive in
nature, [it entails **targeting foreign cyberspace infrastructure** to
**pre-empt incoming attacks** through **o**]{.mark}ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber **[o]{.mark}**peration[**s**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This [shift from reactive to preemptive action in cyberspace marks the
most significant departure from the previous U.S. cyber
strategy]{.underline}, published in 2015, and comes in response to
persistent cyber campaigns against the United States directed by Russia
and China. Taken individually, these offenses may fall short of
provoking an official response, but their cumulative impact over time is
a significant concern and needs to be addressed. The [new
[forward-leaning posture]{.mark} of the United States seeks to address
this threat [preemptively **without risking** an **escalation to
conventional military**]{.mark} uses of force.]{.underline}25 [Superior
cyber capabilities will not be a deterrent per se, but they can add to
**NATO's resilience** against threats.]{.underline}26 Aggressive cyber
operations have already become an important element in the hybrid
warfare tool kit of many adversaries. Adding offensive cyber
capabilities will likely not stop this. That is why [it is critical that
**deterrence against cyber threats** not only relies on cyber
operations, but also draws on the **full spectrum of conventional and
unconventional responses**]{.underline}, as outlined in the 2018
Brussels summit declaration.27 [Defensive and offensive cyber
capabilities can reinforce NATO members' ability to deter and deny
cyber-attacks by disincentivizing other actors from developing cyber
weapons in the first place, and by convincing those]{.underline} with or
without offensive cyber capabilities [that attacks will be largely
ineffective or come at an equal or greater cost to them. Proactive cyber
defense]{.underline} also [can]{.underline} help to [anticipate and
prevent an attack on computers and networks]{.underline}, which requires
active monitoring of hostile actors. This is where [offensive cyber
operations provide the most strategic value.]{.underline} For instance,
[they could interfere directly with operations of adversaries by
manipulating their devices and infrastructure through malware, or by
shutting off power and networks from which an attack originates. They
can]{.underline} also [**affect the calculations of hostile actors** who
may judge that the potential cost of an attack outweighs its strategic
gains.]{.underline} On the other hand, [**[countering]{.mark} cyber
[threats with offensive op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [could have a
**cascading effect** that]{.mark} eventually [**precipitates
conventional conflict**.]{.mark}]{.underline}28 A [[more assertive U.S.
posture on cyber]{.mark} could thus potentially **[heighten]{.mark} the
risk of an [unanticipated crisis]{.mark}** [in the **cyber** and
**conventional domains**. This could have **serious implications**
for]{.mark} other **[NATO allies]{.mark} that [might be pulled into a
conflict]{.mark}**[, especially if the **lines between NATO and U.S.

recent statement.

Edited for language

For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been
exploring how it could employ its own very robust cyberattack
capabilities to compromise or destroy enemy missiles from such states as
North Korea before they can be fired, a strategy sometimes called "left
of launch."3 Russia and China can assume, on this basis, that their own
launch facilities are being probed for such vulnerabilities, presumably
leading them to adopt escalatory policies such as those espoused in the
2018 NPR report. Wherever one looks, therefore, [the [links between
cyberwar and nuclear war are growing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Nuclear-Cyber Connection These links exist because the [[NC3
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States
and other [[nuclear-armed states are heavily dependent
on]{.underline}]{.mark} computers and other digital
[[processors]{.underline}]{.mark} [for]{.underline} virtually [every
aspect of]{.underline} their [operation [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
because those systems [are [**highly vulnerable to
cyberattack**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Every nuclear force is composed,
most basically, of weapons, early-warning radars, launch facilities, and
the top officials, usually presidents or prime ministers, empowered to
initiate a nuclear exchange. Connecting them all, however, is an
extended network of communications and data-processing systems, all
reliant on cyberspace. Warning systems, ground- and space-based, must
constantly watch for and analyze possible enemy missile launches. Data
on actual threats must rapidly be communicated to decision-makers, who
must then weigh possible responses and communicate chosen outcomes to
launch facilities, which in turn must provide attack vectors to delivery
systems. All of this involves operations in cyberspace, and it is in
this domain that great power rivals seek vulnerabilities to exploit in a
constant struggle for advantage. The use of cyberspace to gain an
advantage over adversaries takes many forms and is not always aimed at
nuclear systems. China has been accused of engaging in widespread
cyberespionage to steal technical secrets from U.S. firms for economic
and military advantages. Russia has been accused, most extensively in
the Robert Mueller report, of exploiting cyberspace to interfere in the
2016 U.S. presidential election. Nonstate actors, including terrorist
groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group, have used the
internet for recruiting combatants and spreading fear. Criminal groups,
including some thought to be allied with state actors, such as North
Korea, have used cyberspace to extort money from banks, municipalities,
and individuals.4 Attacks such as these occupy most of the time and
attention of civilian and military cybersecurity organizations that
attempt to thwart such attacks. Yet for those who worry about strategic
stability and the risks of nuclear escalation, it is the threat of
cyberattacks on NC3 systems that provokes the greatest concern. Gen.
Paul M. Nakasone, commander of U.S. Cyber Command, testifies during a
Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on February 14. He warned that
China and Russia are conducting sustained cybercampaigns against the
United States. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)Gen. Paul M. Nakasone,
commander of U.S. Cyber Command, testifies during a Senate Armed
Services Committee hearing on February 14. He warned that China and
Russia are conducting sustained cybercampaigns against the United
States. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)This concern stems from the
fact that, despite the immense effort devoted to protecting NC3 systems
from cyberattack, no enterprise that relies so extensively on computers
and cyberspace can be made 100 percent invulnerable to attack. This is
so because such systems employ many devices and operating systems of
various origins and vintages, most incorporating numerous software
updates and "patches" over time, offering multiple vectors for attack.
Electronic components can also be modified by hostile actors during
production, transit, or insertion; and the whole system itself is
dependent to a considerable degree on the electrical grid, which itself
is vulnerable to cyberattack and is far less protected. Experienced
"cyberwarriors" of every major power have been working for years to
probe for weaknesses in these systems and in many cases have devised
cyberweapons, typically, malicious software (malware) and computer
viruses, to exploit those weaknesses for military advantage.5 Although
activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and track than
conventional military operations, enough information has become public
to indicate that the major nuclear powers, notably [[**China**,
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, along
with such secondary powers as [[**Iran** and
**No**]{.underline}]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea,
[[have]{.mark} established]{.underline} extensive cyberwarfare
capabilities and engage in **[[o]{.mark}ffensive
[c]{.mark}yber[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** on a regular
basis, often [[aimed at **critical**]{.mark} **military
[infrastructure]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} "Cyberspace is a
contested environment where we are in constant contact with
adversaries," General Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber
Command (Cybercom), told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February
2019. "We see near-peer competitors \[China and Russia\] conducting
sustained campaigns below the level of armed conflict to erode American
strength and gain strategic advantage." Although eager to speak of
adversary threats to U.S. interests, Nakasone was noticeably but not
surprisingly reluctant to say much about U.S. offensive operations in
cyberspace. He acknowledged, however, that Cybercom took such action to
disrupt possible Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections. "We
created a persistent presence in cyberspace to monitor adversary actions
and crafted tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts," he testified
in February. According to press accounts, this included a cyberattack
aimed at paralyzing the Internet Research Agency, a "troll farm" in St.
Petersburg said to have been deeply involved in generating disruptive
propaganda during the 2016 presidential elections.6 Other press
investigations have disclosed two other offensive operations undertaken
by the United States. One called "Olympic Games" was intended to disrupt
Iran's drive to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity by sabotaging
the centrifuges used in the process by infecting them with the so-called
Stuxnet virus. Another left of launch effort was intended to cause
malfunctions in North Korean missile tests.7 Although not aimed at
either of the U.S. principal nuclear adversaries, those two attacks
demonstrated a willingness and capacity to conduct cyberattacks on the
nuclear infrastructure of other states. Efforts by strategic rivals of
the United States to infiltrate and eventually degrade U.S. nuclear
infrastructure are far less documented but thought to be no less
prevalent. Russia, for example, is believed to have planted malware in
the U.S. electrical utility grid, possibly with the intent of cutting
off the flow of electricity to critical NC3 facilities in the event of a
major crisis.8 Indeed, every major power, including the United States,
is believed to have crafted cyberweapons aimed at critical NC3
components and to have implanted malware in enemy systems for potential
use in some future confrontation. Pathways to Escalation Knowing that
the NC3 systems of the major powers are constantly being probed for
weaknesses and probably infested with malware designed to be activated
in a crisis, what does this say about the risks of escalation from a
nonkinetic battle, that is, one fought without traditional weaponry, to
a kinetic one, at first using conventional weapons and then,
potentially, nuclear ones? None of this can be predicted in advance, but
those analysts who have studied the subject worry about the emergence of
dangerous new pathways for escalation. Indeed, several such scenarios
have been identified.9 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} first and possibly
[[**most dangerous path to escalation** would arise from]{.mark} the
[**early use** of cyberweapons in a great power
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} to ~~paralyze~~ the vital command, control,
and communications capabilities of an adversary, many of which serve
nuclear and conventional forces. In the "fog of war" that would
naturally ensue from such an encounter, [the
[recipient]{.mark}]{.underline} of such an attack [[might fear]{.mark}
more [punishing]{.mark} follow-up kinetic [attacks,]{.mark} possibly
**[including]{.mark} the use of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and, fearing the loss of its own arsenal, launch its weapons
immediately. [This might [occur]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example,
[[in]{.mark} a **[confrontation between NATO and Russia]{.mark}n
forces**]{.underline} in east and central Europe or between U.S. and
Chinese forces in the Asia-Pacific region. Speaking of a possible
confrontation in Europe, for example, James N. Miller Jr. and Richard
Fontaine wrote that "both sides would have overwhelming incentives to go
early with offensive cyber and counter-space capabilities to negate the
other side's military capabilities or advantages." If these early
attacks succeeded, "it could result in huge military and coercive
advantage for the attacker." This might induce the recipient of such
attacks to back down, affording its rival a major victory at very low
cost. Alternatively, however, [the [recipient might view]{.mark} the
[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} on its critical command, control, and
communications infrastructure [[as]{.mark} the **[prelude to]{.mark} a
[full-scale attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} aimed at neutralizing its
nuclear capabilities [[and]{.mark} **choose to [strike
first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "It is worth considering," Miller and
Fontaine concluded, "how [[even a]{.mark} very [limited attack]{.mark}
or incident [could set]{.mark} both sides on [a **slippery slope to
rapid escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}."10 U.S. servicemen conduct a

NC3 systems so dangerous is that it may not even need to be activated to
increase the risk of nuclear escalation]{.underline}. [[If a]{.mark}
nuclear-armed [state comes to believe]{.mark} that [its]{.mark} critical
[systems are infested]{.mark} with enemy malware, its [leaders

Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
"\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code into nuclear weapons
through the supply chain that compromises the effectiveness of those
weapons could lead to a lack of confidence in the nuclear deterrent,"
undermining strategic stability.11 Without confidence in the reliability
of its nuclear weapons infrastructure, a nuclear-armed state may
misinterpret confusing signals from its early-warning systems and,
fearing the worst, launch its own nuclear weapons rather than lose them
to an enemy's first strike. This makes the scenario proffered in the
2018 NPR report, of a nuclear response to an enemy cyberattack, that
much more alarming.

**It triggers tit-for-tat retaliation that escalates out of control**

Columbia University), "The implications of persistent (and permanent)

The new strategy is a compelling assessment of cyber conflict as a state
of constant contact and presents a strong case that reduced operational
constraints enabling tactical friction to regain the initiative will
nudge conflict back towards lower levels of aggression \[9\]. It is
worth noting that forward defense is only one among several policies
that can be termed active defense or indeed cyber deterrence: the
administration of Donald Trump has continued and expanded a wide set of
policy tools used by previous administrations, including sanctions and
indictments \[59\]. It has also introduced new responses, most
importantly coordinated international attribution of Russian \[60\] and
North Korean \[61\] operations seen as particularly insulting to global
norms and getting search warrants for computers outside of US territory
in order to disrupt a North Korean botnet \[62\]. Still, it is no wonder
that the [[US military]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[embraced]{.underline}]{.mark} an academic concept justifying its
decade-long desire for [[**reduced operational constraints**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} a more **[[active
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}** to "take the fight to the enemy." There
remain major concerns. An **[overarching worry]{.underline}** is that
[US Cyber Command]{.underline} **[does not]{.underline}** [appear to see
this approach as fundamentally **risky.**]{.underline} The Vision
asserts that the Command wants to be "not risk averse but risk aware"
but it only highlights one procedural risk (an insufficient body of
highly trained personnel) and one diplomatic risk (adversaries will
falsely "seek to portray our strategy as 'militarizing' the cyberspace
domain"). But those are the only risks the Command can imagine, or at
least, is willing to publicly acknowledge. Indeed, [because]{.underline}
[[defending forward]{.mark} is framed as essential---"if the United
States is to shape the development of international cyberspace norms, it
can do so only [through active cyber operations]{.mark}"]{.underline}
\[54\], [and "not a choice, but a structurally and strategically driven
imperative" \[]{.underline}57\]---then the main risk is failing to adapt
quickly and forcefully enough. To get to the promised land of milk and
honey, superiority and stability, there is only one path: forward
defense. It is technically determined that there is a single dominant
strategy, one that is the best regardless of the strategies chosen by US
adversaries. As in the Cold War, the military is again attempting to
"pose starker alternatives and to couch them in terms of necessity
rather than choice:" either remove constraints on the military or lose
\[63\]. Imperatives are slippery things. Some are not imperatives at
all, just a particularly unyielding perspective or preference presented
as a dichotomy. How many US airmen died in World War Two because of the
bomber-driven cult of the offensive? Other imperatives may be critical
to tactical success but imperil the larger strategy, perhaps winning the
battle but losing the war. The [battlefield imperative to use
overwhelming firepower can, for example, be fatal to a counterinsurgency
strategy if it causes extensive collateral damage]{.underline}. [Even
seeming strategic imperatives]{.underline} can [lead to catastrophic
national security outcomes]{.underline}, as with Wilhelmine Germany's
pursuit of a grand fleet-in-being to challenge the British \[64\]. The
dynamics here may be similar. [A more thorough assessment of the
risks]{.underline} must be rooted with the simplest one, [[the
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} might [fail and **[intensify
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many assumptions]{.underline},
apparently unrecognized, underlie the belief that [the USA can have both
superiority and overmatch]{.underline} [as well as
stability]{.underline}. [Yet, in a system as complex as the Internet,
"we can never merely do one thing]{.underline}" \[9, page 10\].8 As Herb
Lin and Max Smeets of Stanford University highlight, "[neither
'escalate' or 'escalation' appear in the \[Vision\]
document,]{.underline}" a significant omission which suggests [[US Cyber
Command]{.mark} is **[downplaying]{.mark}**, or not fully thinking
through, the full [dynamics of conflic]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark}
\[65\]. A more [engaged [forward defense]{.mark} might [result]{.mark}
not [in]{.mark} "negative" feedback]{.underline}---reducing conflict by
bringing it back to the historical norm---but instead "[**[positive"
feedback]{.mark}**, exacerbating the conflict and [adversaries]{.mark}
may [see]{.mark} the new [US]{.mark} vision as a [challenge to]{.mark}
**[rise to,]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} one from which to [back
away]{.mark}]{.underline} \[9, chapter 4\]. According to my colleague
[Robert Jervis, "a failure to anticipate positive feedback is one reason
why consequences are often unintended,"]{.underline} \[9, page 165\] and
sufficient [positive feedback can [push the system past **a tipping
point**]{.mark}, at which the system resets itself into a new, and
potentially far more dangerous, equilibrium]{.underline}. [[States
have]{.mark} [decided to keep]{.mark} their [attacks below]{.mark}
certain [thresholds, but]{.mark} conflict and **competition** in
cyberspace is only a few decades old.]{.underline} This may only be a
phase, and an early one at that. [[As cyberspace becomes]{.mark} more
**[existential]{.mark}** for more states, the stakes continue to rise,
[elevating the risks]{.mark} along with them.]{.underline}

not]{.mark} be allowed to **\"[hack back]{.mark}\"**]{.underline} [to
retrieve stolen data or shut down computers targeting their
networks]{.underline}. There\'s been hot debate over companies\' rights
to defend themselves in cyberspace by taking offensive action.

private sector, and the privacy advocacy community
[warn]{.mark}]{.underline} the strategy, commonly known as **[\"[hacking
back,\" could go very wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \"Hacking back is
[the **worst option**]{.underline} for companies [because they don\'t
know who is on the other end]{.underline} of the keyboard nor what
capabilities that person has. What may start as simple \[intellectual
property\] theft could, after a [\'hacking back\']{.underline} attempt,
[result in the utter destruction of the entire network]{.underline},\"
says Jeffrey Carr, president of cybersecurity firm Taia Global. \"For a
small to medium-sized company, that could put them out of business. For
an enterprise, it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.
People with any life experience usually understand and respect the adage
\'never pick a fight with a stranger.\' The same adage applies in

\"We should not be [[looking to **escalate a
cyberwar**]{.underline}]{.mark}; we should be trying to defuse it,\"
said one Influencer who chose to remain anonymous. Another added:
\"Would we let it happen in the physical world?\" The Passcode
Influencers Poll brings together a diverse group of more than 90
security and privacy experts from across government, the private sector,
academia, and the privacy community. To preserve the candor of their
responses, Influencers have the choice to keep their comments anonymous,
or voice their opinions on the record. Some Influencers drew upon their
own personal experiences to explain the potential perils. \"I am an old
Army cyber guy and I had a boss who, when I was feeling frustrated when
I could not respond in kind back to a bad guy who was attacking us,
would pull me aside and say, \'You know what, Rick? The enemy gets a
vote,\' \" says Rick Howard, chief security officer for Palo Alto
Networks. \"Just because you are able to jab back against a cyber
adversary does not mean that you should. Do you think the bad guy will
just go away simply because you took a swing at him? Do you think he
will say, \'Wow, these guys are tough. I guess I will hang up my hacking
spurs forever?\' More likely than not, [you would have succeeded in
**[poking the beehive]{.mark}**]{.underline} and you may have unleashed
a world of hurt on your organization that it did not need.\" Even
government organizations where the sole purpose, Mr. Howard said, is to
attribute attacks have a hard to doing it with any level of confidence
that would warrant an offensive action. \"The idea of turning that
problem over to [a commercial organization]{.underline} who [does not
have a **tenth of the resources**]{.underline} is ludicrous,\" he said.
\"[The result [would]{.mark}]{.underline} be to [[transform the Internet
into the **Wild**]{.mark} **Wild [West]{.mark}**]{.underline};
commercial organizations pointing their cyber six-shooters at any
perceived slight rightfully or wrongly.\" Even then, Howard says, [[the
task should be left to]{.mark} **professionals: [law enforcement and
intel]{.mark}ligence**]{.underline}. They too \"absolutely should not
get carte blanche for this kind of activity. There has to be some rules
put in place that all citizens understand. There has to be some
oversight put in place that regularly reports back to the citizenry
about what these forces are doing.\" A minority of 18 percent of
Influencers said companies should be allowed to hack back after they\'re
hit. \"There is a significant spectrum of options for a victim to employ
against a cyberattacker; \'shutting down\' the computers used in an
attack is at the extreme end of that spectrum,\" one Influencer said.
\"The fact is, [the US government is **not responding**]{.underline} to
vast majority of cyberintrusions, whether for theft or destruction;
private companies are on their own, and as such, they should be able to
defend themselves in cyberspace. Does the Second Amendment not extend to
cyberspace?\" If companies cannot get timely help and protection from
law enforcement, one Influencer said, \"they should be allowed to take
responsible action to mitigate the impact of theft of their data. This
should be done with full accountability for any damage to innocent
parties.\" Companies should be allowed to hack back \"but only under
strict controls, such as using a bonded, licensed company -- perhaps
even deputized by an accredited law enforcement agency -- which acts on
their behalf,\" suggested Jay Healey, head of the Cyber Statecraft
Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank. \"This should start as a
small pilot project as [the **international blow back**]{.underline} [is
likely to be **significant**]{.underline}.\" We want to hear from you.
Take the readers version of the Influencers poll here. \"Hacking back
sounds like a great idea until you think about how easy it is to
subvert. Today\'s attackers go to great lengths to hide the source of
their attacks. How can any company know they\'re really hacking their
attacker, and not some innocent bystander?\" - Matthew Green, Johns
Hopkins University \"The idea that someone could \'hack back\' without
producing unintended consequences is absurd pipe dream promoted by
businesses trying to monetize the concept. The millions of innocent
people around the world whose machines are unwittingly serving as
waypoints or botnet hosts would be the ones who ultimately pay the
price.\" - Chris Finan, Manifold Security \"Today the Internet is the
Wild West; with hack back it moves closer to Hobbes\' Leviathan.\" -
Jacob Olcott, BitSight Technologies \"Companies should be investing in
actual defense mechanisms, not offensive capabilities. Actually doing
defense is a far better security tactic than \'hack back.\'
Additionally, companies tend to have a misunderstanding of how difficult
doing offense is and a misunderstanding of what can be gained. Applying
the resources to being able to do \'hack back\' to security would be a
better use of those resources and go farther for the intended goals.
Additionally, once data is gone from the network there is rarely any
ability to \'retrieve\' it or keep it from ending up in the adversary\'s
hands. Executives in companies discussing \'hack back\' strategies
should focus efforts on empowering and training their people, breaking
down cultural barriers hampering security, and aligning efforts to the
threats they actually face.\" - Robert Lee, Dragos Security \"It
depends. There are so many possible unintended consequences in hacking
back that unless you truly understand what you are doing, it isn\'t
worth the risk. Remember, when you hack back, you are escalating an
event with someone who may have far greater skills, resources and evil
intent than you. Hacking back should only be done after consulting with
legal counsel because this opens a company up to all sorts of complex
legal issues -- especially if you hack back and find out you've made a
mistake. Additionally and this is a bit unfair, but if you couldn't keep
someone out of your environment in the first place, what makes you think
you have the skill to up the game by attacking back?\" - Mark
Weatherford, Chertoff Group \"Hey, I\'ve got an idea, let\'s legalize
vigilantism, but only for the one type of crime where people constantly
talk about how difficult accurate attribution is. What could go
wrong?\" - Julian Sanchez, Cato Institute \"This is the role of law
enforcement. Allowing a safe harbor for \'hack backs\' would be an
invitation to abuse competitors and the like. Let\'s keep the job where
it belongs, with law enforcement.\" - Influencer \"We can\'t be taking
law into our own hands as a general rule. Would need to understand the
facts and circumstances. One should always contact law enforcement as
fast as possible.\" - Influencer \"Vigilantism feels good but is rarely
effective (for anyone other than Liam Neeson).\" - Peter Singer, New
America \"While we can imagine cases where it\'d be satisfying for
companies to do this, madness this way lies. Bad actors almost never
directly tunnel into a network; they hide behind hijacked accounts and
machines. To contemplate \'hacking back\' puts those intermediate
accounts and machines more in the crossfire. This isn\'t to say nothing
should be done -- ISPs and others can play a helpful role in
quarantining the launching pads of attacks that are being used without
their owners\' knowledge -- but hacking back should be off the
table.\" - Jonathan Zittrain, Harvard University \"The legal right to
[[\'hack back\']{.underline}]{.mark} would [[incentivize]{.mark} an
**[escalating]{.mark}** spiral of [**attacks** with]{.mark}]{.underline}
almost [[certain **collateral damage**]{.underline}]{.mark} to both
networks and individuals. In the most sophisticated and damaging
attacks, accurately identifying the attacker has proven elusive at
best.\" - Influencer \"Hack back, retaliation, vigilantism. These words
not only make for great headlines; they spark heated debate over the
appropriate roles of the private sector and government in cybersecurity.
Unfortunately, the \'hack-back\' debate often obscures a much more
fundamental debate over the future direction of US cybersecurity policy.
For the past two decades, US cybersecurity has focused almost
exclusively on defense -- we\'ve dedicated our time and resources to
making it harder for our adversaries to penetrate our networks. But
strong network fortifications are not fail-safe. Especially against
nation-states and other concerted adversaries who are willing to go to
almost any level of time, effort, and expense to penetrate a target\'s
network. Defensive measures alone may delay -- but are unlikely to
prevent -- penetration of target networks by concerted adversaries.
Focusing exclusively on defense will not solve our cybersecurity
problem. We need to raise the costs and risks to concerted adversaries
in order to deter their activities. There are many divergent views as to
the best way to do this, but one thing is clear: the time has come for a
national conversation. [Effective **deterrence** is **not synonymous
with hack-back**]{.underline}, retaliation, or vigilantism. [Elements
of]{.underline} an [effective deterrence]{.underline} strategy [include:
real-time **detection**]{.underline} of intrusions (a high likelihood of
discovery will deter some would-be intruders) [as well as
**identification**]{.underline} and punishment of cyberintruders. In the
absence of such consequences, cyberintruders should be expected to
continue targeting our networks.\" - Melanie Teplinsky, American
University \"There is a range of activities from passive defense,
through more active defense, to offensive tactics. [We]{.underline} do
[need]{.underline} to move to where [something **more active than
today**, but]{.underline} perhaps [less than **full scale \'hack
back\'**]{.underline} is acceptable and even more commonplace.\" -

stylized debate about cybersecurity in international relations argues
that offensive advantages in cyberspace empower weaker nations,
terrorist cells, or even lone rogue operators to paralyze vital
infrastructure \[4--8\]. The other side argues that operational
difficulties and effective deterrence restrains the severity of cyber
attack, while governments and cybersecurity firms have a pecuniary
interest in exaggerating the threat \[9--13\]. [Although we have

leads us to view cyberwar as a limited political instrument in most
situations also leads us to view it as **incredibly
destabilizing**]{.underline} in rare situations. In a recent Israeli
wargame of a regional scenario involving the United States and Russia,
one participant remarked on "how quickly
**[[localized]{.underline}]{.mark}** [cyber [events can turn]{.mark}
**dangerously [kinetic]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[when leaders are
ill-prepared]{.underline}]{.mark} to deal in the cyber domain" \[17\].
Importantly, [this sort of **[catalytic instability]{.mark}** arises not
from the cyber domain itself but through its interaction with forces and
characteristics in other domains]{.underline} (land, sea, air, etc.).
[Further, it arises]{.underline} only in situations [[where
actors]{.mark} possess, and are willing to [use]{.mark},
robust]{.underline} [[**traditional** military forces]{.mark} to defend
their interests. [Classical deterrence]{.mark} theory developed to
[explain]{.mark} nuclear deterrence with nuclear weapons,
but]{.underline} different types of weapons or
**[combinations]{.underline}** of operations in different domains can
[have]{.underline} **[differential effects]{.underline}** on deterrence
and defense \[18, 19\]. [Nuclear weapons and cyber operations
are]{.underline} particularly **[complementary]{.underline}** (i.e.
nearly complete opposites) [with respect to their strategic
characteristics.]{.underline} [Theorists and practitioners have stressed
the unprecedented **destructiveness**]{.underline} [of nuclear weapons
in explaining how nuclear deterrence works, but it is equally, if not
more, important for deterrence that capabilities and intentions
are]{.underline} **[clearly communicated]{.underline}**. As quickly
became apparent, **[[public displays]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of]{.underline} their [nuclear arsenals improved deterrence. At the
same time, disclosing]{.underline} **[details]{.underline}** of a
nation's nuclear capabilities [did not much degrade the ability to
strike or retaliate, given that defense against nuclear attack remains
extremely difficult.]{.underline} Knowledge of nuclear capabilities is
necessary to achieve a deterrent effect \[20\]. [**[Cyber]{.mark}**
operations, in contrast, [rely on **undisclosed
vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, social engineering, and creative
guile to generate indirect effects in the information systems that
coordinate military, economic, and social behavior. Revelation enables
crippling countermeasures, while the imperative to conceal capabilities
constrains both the scope of cyber operations and their utility for
coercive signaling \[21, 22\]. The diversity of cyber operations and
confusion about their effects also contrast with the obvious
destructiveness of nuclear weapons. The problem is that [transparency
and deception]{.underline} [**do not mix well**. [An attacker who
hacks]{.mark} an adversary's [nuclear command and control
apparatus]{.mark}, or the weapons themselves, [will gain an
**advantage**]{.mark} **in warfighting**]{.underline} [that [the
attacker]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**cannot reveal**, while the
**adversary** will **continue to believe it wields a deterrent**]{.mark}
**that may no longer exist.**]{.underline} [Most analyses of inadvertent
escalation from cyber or conventional to nuclear war focus on "use it or
lose it" pressures and fog of war]{.underline} created by attacks that
become visible to the target \[23, 24\]. In a US--China conflict
scenario, for example, conventional military strikes in conjunction with
cyber attacks that blind sensors and confuse decision making could
generate incentives for both sides to rush to preempt or escalate
\[25--27\]. These are plausible concerns, but the revelation of
information about a newly unfavorable balance of power might also cause
hesitation and lead to compromise. Cyber blinding could potentially make
traditional offensive operations more difficult, shifting the advantage
to defenders and making conflict less likely. **[Clandestine
attacks]{.underline}** [that remain invisible to the target]{.underline}
potentially [present [a]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[more [insidious
threat to crisis stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are empirical
and theoretical reasons for taking seriously the effects of offensive
cyber operations on nuclear deterrence, and we should expect the dangers
to vary with the relative cyber capabilities of the actors in a crisis
interaction. Nuclear command and control vulnerability General Robert
Kehler, commander of US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in 2013, stated in
testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, "we are very
concerned with the potential of a cyber-related attack on our nuclear
command and control and on the weapons systems themselves" \[28\].
Nuclear command, control, and communications ([NC3]{.underline}) [form
the nervous system of the nuclear enterprise]{.underline} spanning
intelligence and early warning sensors located in orbit and on Earth,
fixed and mobile command and control centers through which national
leadership can order a launch, operational nuclear forces including
strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental missiles (ICBMs),
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and the communication and
transportation networks that tie the whole apparatus together \[29,
30\]. [NC3 should ideally ensure that nuclear forces will **always be
available** if **authorized**]{.underline} [by the National Command
Authority (to **enhance deterrence**) and never used]{.underline}
**[without authorization]{.underline}** ([to enhance **safety** and
**reassurance**]{.underline}). **[Friendly errors]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[enemy interference]{.underline}** [in NC3 [can
**undermine the "always-never" criterion**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[weakening deterrence]{.underline}** \[31, 32\]. [NC3 has long been
recognized as the **weakest link** in the US nuclear
enterprise]{.underline}. According to a declassified official history, a
Strategic Air Command (SAC) task group in 1979 "reported that tactical
warning and communications systems ... were 'fragile' and susceptible to
electronic countermeasures, electromagnetic pulse, and sabotage, which
could deny necessary warning and assessment to the National Command
Authorities" \[33\]. Two years later, the Principal Deputy Under
Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering released a
broad-based, multiservice report that doubled down on SAC's findings:
"the United States could not assure survivability, endurability, or
connectivity of the national command authority function" due to: major
command, control, and communications deficiencies: in tactical warning
and attack assessment where existing systems were vulnerable to
disruption and destruction from electromagnetic pulse, other high
altitude nuclear effects, electronic warfare, sabotage, or physical
attack; in decision making where there was inability to assure national
command authority survival and connection with the nuclear forces,
especially under surprise conditions; and in communications systems,
which were susceptible to the same threats above and which could not
guarantee availability of even minimum-essential capability during a
protracted war. \[33\] [The [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [safety literature
likewise provides a number of]{.mark} troubling [examples of NC3
glitches]{.mark} that illustrate some of the **vulnerabilities**
[attackers **could**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in principle,
**[[exploit]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[34--36\]. The SAC history noted
that **[NORAD]{.underline}** [has received **numerous false launch
indications**]{.underline} from faulty computer components, [**loose
circuits**, and even a **nuclear war training tape** loaded by mistake
into a live system that produced erroneous Soviet launch
indications]{.underline} \[33\]. In a 1991 briefing to the STRATCOM
commander, a Defense Intelligence Agency targeteer confessed, "Sir, I
apologize, but we have found a problem with this target. There is a
mistake in the computer code ... . Sir, the error has been there for at
least the life of this eighteen-month planning cycle. The nature of the
error is such that the target would not have been struck" \[37\]. It
would be a difficult operation to intentionally plant undetected errors
like this, but [the presence of bugs does reveal that]{.underline} such
**[a hack is possible]{.underline}**. [Following many near-misses and
self-audits]{.underline} during and after the Cold War, [American NC3
improved with the addition of new safeguards and
redundancies]{.underline}. As General Kehler pointed out in 2013, "the
nuclear deterrent force was designed to operate through the most extreme
circumstances we could possibly imagine" \[28\]. Yet vulnerabilities
remain. In 2010, the US Air Force lost contact with 50 Minuteman III
ICBMs for an hour because of a faulty hardware circuit at a launch
control center \[38\]. If the accident had occurred during a crisis, or
the component had been sabotaged, the USAF would have been unable to
launch and unable to detect and cancel unauthorized launch attempts. As
Bruce Blair, a former Minuteman missileer, points out, during a control
center blackout the antennas at unmanned silos and the cables between
them provide potential surreptitious access vectors \[39\]. The
unclassified summary of a 2015 audit of US NC3 stated that "known
capability gaps or deficiencies remain" \[40\]. Perhaps more worrisome
are the unknown deficiencies. A 2013 Defense Science Board report on
military cyber vulnerabilities found that while the: nuclear deterrent
is regularly evaluated for reliability and readiness ... , most of the
systems have not been assessed (end-to-end) against a \[sophisticated
state\] cyber attack to understand possible weak spots. A 2007 Air Force
study addressed portions of this issue for the ICBM leg of the U.S.
triad but was still not a complete assessment against a high-tier
threat. \[41\] [If NC3 **vulnerabilities** are unknown, it is also
**unknown** whether]{.underline} [an **advanced cyber actor** would be
able to **exploit** them.]{.underline} As Kehler notes, "**[[We don't
know what we don't know]{.underline}]{.mark}**" \[28\]. [Even if NC3 of
nuclear forces narrowly conceived is a hard target, cyber [attacks
on]{.mark} **other [critical infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
preparation to or [during a nuclear crisis [could **complicate**]{.mark}
or **confuse [government decision making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. General
Keith Alexander, Director of the NSA in the same Senate hearing with
General Kehler, testified that: [our infrastructure that we ride on, the
[**power** and]{.mark} the [communications]{.mark} grid, are one of the
things that is a source of concern ... [we can go to backup
generators]{.mark} and we can have independent routes, [but]{.mark} ...
our [ability to **communicate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would be
**significantly reduced**]{.mark} and it would complicate our
**governance**]{.underline} ... . I think what General Kehler has would
be intact ... \[but\] [[the]{.underline} **[cascading
effect]{.underline}**]{.mark}[ ... in that kind of environment ...
[concerns us.]{.mark}]{.underline} \[28\] Kehler further emphasized that
"there's a continuing need to make sure that we are protected against
electromagnetic pulse and any kind of electromagnetic interference"
\[28\]. Many NC3 components are antiquated and hard to upgrade, which is
a mixed blessing. Kehler points out, "[Much of the nuclear command and
control system today is the legacy system]{.underline} that we've had.
[In some ways that helps us in terms of the cyber threat. In some cases
it's point to point, hard-wired, which makes it very difficult for an
external]{.underline} cyber [threat to emerge]{.underline}" \[28\]. The
Government Accountability Office notes that the "Department of Defense
uses 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the
operational functions of the nation's nuclear forces" \[42\]. While this
may limit some forms of remote access, [it is also indicative of
reliance on an earlier generation of software when **security**
engineering standards were **less mature**]{.underline}. Upgrades to the
digital Strategic Automated Command and Control System planned for 2017
have the potential to correct some problems, but these changes may also
introduce new access vectors and vulnerabilities \[43\]. Admiral Cecil
Haney, Kehler's successor at STRATCOM, highlighted the challenges of NC3
modernization in 2015: Assured and reliable NC3 is fundamental to the
credibility of our nuclear deterrent. The aging NC3 systems continue to
meet their intended purpose, but risk to mission success is increasing
as key elements of the system age. The unpredictable challenges posed by
today's complex security environment make it increasingly important to
optimize our NC3 architecture while leveraging new technologies so that
NC3 systems operate together as a core set of survivable and endurable
capabilities that underpin a broader, national command and control
system. \[44\] In no small irony, the internet itself owes its
intellectual origin, in part, to the threat to NC3 from large-scale
physical attack. A 1962 RAND report by Paul Baran considered "the
problem of building digital communication networks using links with less
than perfect reliability" to enable "stations surviving a physical
attack and remaining in electrical connection ... to operate together as
a coherent entity after attack" \[45\]. Baran advocated as a solution
decentralized packet switching protocols, not unlike those realized in
the ARPANET program. The emergence of the internet was the result of
many other factors that had nothing to do with managing nuclear
operations, notably the meritocratic ideals of 1960s counterculture that
contributed to the neglect of security in the internet's founding
architecture \[46, 47\]. Fears of NC3 vulnerability helped to create the
internet, which then helped to create the present-day cybersecurity
epidemic, which has come full circle to create new fears about NC3
vulnerability. NC3 vulnerability is not unique to the United States. The
NC3 of other nuclear powers may even be easier to compromise, especially
in the case of new entrants to the nuclear club like North Korea.
Moreover, the United States has already demonstrated both the ability
and willingness to infiltrate sensitive foreign nuclear infrastructure
through operations such as Olympic Games (Stuxnet), albeit targeting
Iran's nuclear fuel cycle rather than NC3. It would be surprising to
learn that the United States has failed to upgrade its Cold War NC3
attack plans to include offensive cyber operations against a wide
variety of national targets. Hacking the deterrent The United States
included NC3 attacks in its Cold War counterforce and damage limitation
war plans, even as contemporary critics perceived these options to be
destabilizing for deterrence \[48\]. The best known example of these
activities and capabilities is a Special Access Program named Canopy
Wing. East German intelligence obtained the highly classified plans from
a US Army spy in Berlin, and the details began to emerge publicly after
the Cold War. An East German intelligence officer, Markus Wolf, writes
in his memoir that Canopy Wing "listed the types of electronic warfare
that would be used to neutralize the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact's
command centers in case of all-out war. It detailed the precise method
of depriving the Soviet High Command of its high-frequency
communications used to give orders to its armed forces" \[49\]. It is
easy to see why NC3 is such an attractive target in the unlikely event
of a nuclear war. [If for whatever reason deterrence fails and the enemy
decides to push the nuclear button, it would obviously be better to
disable or destroy missiles **before they launch**]{.underline} than to
rely on possibly futile efforts to shoot them down, or to accept the
loss of millions of lives. American plans to disable Soviet NC3 with
electronic warfare, furthermore, would have been intended to complement
plans for decapitating strikes against Soviet nuclear forces. Temporary
disabling of information networks in isolation would have failed to
achieve any important strategic objective. A blinded adversary would
eventually see again and would scramble to reconstitute its ability to
launch its weapons, expecting that preemption was inevitable in any
case. Reconstitution, moreover, would invalidate much of the
intelligence and some of the tradecraft on which the blinding attack
relied. Capabilities fielded through Canopy Wing were presumably
intended to facilitate a preemptive military strike on Soviet NC3 to
disable the ability to retaliate and limit the damage of any retaliatory
force that survived, given credible indications that war was imminent.
Canopy Wing included \[50\]: "Measures for short-circuiting ...
communications and weapons systems using, among other things,
microscopic carbon-fiber particles and chemical weapons." "Electronic
blocking of communications immediately prior to an attack, thereby
rendering a counterattack impossible." "Deployment of various weapons
systems for instantaneous destruction of command centers, including
pin-point targeting with precision-guided weapons to destroy 'hardened
bunkers'." "Use of deception measures, including the use of
computer-simulated voices to override and substitute false commands from
ground-control stations to aircraft and from regional command centers to
the Soviet submarine fleet." "Us\[e of\] the technical installations of
'Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty' and 'Voice of America,' as well as the
radio communications installations of the U.S. Armed Forces for creating
interference and other electronic effects." Wolf also ran a spy in the
US Air Force who disclosed that the Americans had managed to penetrate
the \[Soviet air base at Eberswalde\]'s ground-air communications and
were working on a method of blocking orders before they reached the
Russian pilots and substituting their own from West Berlin. Had this
succeeded, the MiG pilots would have received commands from their
American enemy. It sounded like science fiction, but, our experts
concluded, it was in no way impossible that they could have pulled off
such a trick, given the enormous spending and technical power of U.S.
military air research. \[49\] One East German source claimed that Canopy
Wing had a \$14.5 billion budget for research and operational costs and
a staff of 1570 people, while another claimed that it would take over 4
years and \$65 million to develop "a prototype of a sophisticated
electronic system for paralyzing Soviet radio traffic in the
high-frequency range" \[50\]. Canopy Wing was not cheap, and even so, it
was only a research and prototyping program. Operationalization of its
capabilities and integration into NATO war plans would have been even
more expensive. This is suggestive of the level of effort required to
craft effective offensive cyber operations against NC3. Preparation
comes to naught when a sensitive program is compromised. Canopy Wing was
caught in what we describe below as the cyber commitment problem, the
inability to disclose a warfighting capability for the sake of
deterrence without losing it in the process. According to New York Times
reporting on the counterintelligence investigation of the East German
spy in the Army, Warrant Officer James Hall, "officials said that one
program rendered useless cost hundreds of millions of dollars and was
designed to exploit a Soviet communications vulnerability uncovered in
the late 1970\'s" \[51\]. This program was probably Canopy Wing. Wolf
writes, "Once we passed \[Hall's documents about Canopy Wing\] on to the
Soviets, they were able to install scrambling devices and other
countermeasures" \[49\]. It is tempting to speculate that the Soviet
deployment of a new NC3 system known as Signal-A to replace Signal-M
(which was most likely the one targeted by Canopy Wing) was motivated in
part by Hall's betrayal \[50\]. Canopy Wing underscores the potential
and limitations of NC3 subversion. Modern cyber methods can potentially
perform many of the missions Canopy Wing addressed with electronic
warfare and other means, but with even greater stealth and precision.
Cyber operations might, in principle, compromise any part of the NC3
system (early warning, command centers, data transport, operational
forces, etc.) by blinding sensors, injecting bogus commands or
suppressing legitimate ones, monitoring or corrupting data
transmissions, or interfering with the reliable launch and guidance of
missiles. In practice, the operational feasibility of cyber attack
against NC3 or any other target depends on the software and hardware
configuration and organizational processes of the target, the
intelligence and planning capacity of the attacker, and the ability and
willingness to take advantage of the effects created by cyber attack
\[52, 53\]. Cyber compromise of NC3 is technically plausible though
operationally difficult, a point to which we return in a later section.
To understand which threats are not only technically possible but also
probable under some circumstance, we further need a political logic of
cost and benefit \[14\]. In particular, how is it possible for a crisis
to escalate to levels of destruction more costly than any conceivable
political reward? Canopy Wing highlights some of the strategic dangers
of NC3 exploitation. Warsaw Pact observers appear to have been deeply
concerned that the program reflected an American willingness to
undertake a surprise decapitation attack: they said that it "sent
ice-cold shivers down our spines" \[50\]. The Soviets designed a system
called Perimeter that, not unlike the Doomsday Device in Dr.
Strangelove, was designed to detect a nuclear attack and retaliate
automatically, even if cut off from Soviet high command, through an
elaborate system of sensors, underground computers, and command missiles
to transmit launch codes \[54\]. Both Canopy Wing and Perimeter show
that the United States and the Soviet Union took nuclear warfighting
seriously and were willing to develop secret advantages for such an
event. By the same token, they were not able to reveal such capabilities
to improve deterrence to avoid having to fight a nuclear war in the
first place. Nuclear deterrence and credible communication Nuclear
weapons have some salient political properties. They are singularly and
obviously destructive. They kill in more, and more ghastly, ways than
conventional munitions through electromagnetic radiation, blast,
firestorms, radioactive fallout, and health effects that linger for
years. Bombers, ICBMs, and SLBMs can project warheads globally without
significantly mitigating their lethality, steeply attenuating the
conventional loss-of-strength gradient \[55\]. Defense against nuclear
attack is very difficult, even with modern ballistic missile defenses,
given the speed of incoming warheads and use of decoys; multiple
warheads and missile volleys further reduce the probability of perfect
interception. If one cannot preemptively destroy all of an enemy's
missiles, then there is a nontrivial chance of getting hit by some of
them. When one missed missile can incinerate millions of people, the
notion of winning a nuclear war starts to seem meaningless for many
politicians. As defense seemed increasingly impractical, early Cold War
strategists championed the threat of assured retaliation as the chief
mechanism for avoiding war \[56--59\]. Political actors have issued
threats for millennia, but the advent of nuclear weapons brought
deterrence as a strategy to center stage. The Cold War was an intense
learning experience for both practitioners and students of international
security, rewriting well-worn realities more than once \[60--62\]. A key
conundrum was the practice of brinkmanship. Adversaries who could not
compete by "winning" a nuclear war could still compete by manipulating
the "risk" of nuclear annihilation, gambling that an opponent would have
the good judgment to back down at some point short of the nuclear brink.
Brinkmanship crises---conceptualized as games of Chicken where one
cannot heighten tensions without increasing the hazard of the mutually
undesired outcome---require that decision makers behave irrationally, or
possibly that they act randomly, which is difficult to conceptualize in
practical terms \[63\]. The chief concern in historical episodes of
chicken, such as the Berlin Crisis and Cuban Missile Crisis, was not
whether a certain level of harm was possible, but whether an adversary
was resolved enough, possibly, to risk nuclear suicide. The logical
inconsistency of the need for illogic to win led almost from the
beginning of the nuclear era to elaborate deductive contortions
\[64--66\]. Both mutually assured destruction (MAD) and successful
brinksmanship depend on a less appreciated, but no less fundamental,
feature of nuclear weapons: political transparency. Most elements of
military power are weakened by disclosure \[67\]. Military plans are
considerably less effective if shared with an enemy. Conventional
weapons become less lethal as adversaries learn what different systems
can and cannot do, where they are located, how they are operated, and
how to devise countermeasures and array defenses to blunt or disarm an
attack. In contrast, relatively little reduction in destruction follows
from enemy knowledge of nuclear capabilities. For most of the nuclear
era, no effective defense existed against a nuclear attack. Even today,
with evolving ABM systems, one ICBM still might get through and
annihilate the capital city. Nuclear forces are more robust to
revelation than other weapons, enabling nuclear nations better to
advertise the harm they can inflict. [The need for transparency to
achieve an effective deterrent is driven home by the satirical Cold War
film, Dr. Strangelove: "the whole point of a Doomsday Machine is lost,
if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world]{.underline},
eh?" [During the real Cold War]{.underline}, fortunately, [Soviet
leaders paraded their nuclear weapons through Red Square for the benefit
of foreign military attaches and the international press
corps]{.underline}. Satellites photographed missile, bomber, and
submarine bases. While other aspects of military affairs on both sides
of the Iron Curtain remained closely guarded secrets, the United States
and the Soviet Union permitted observers to evaluate their nuclear
capabilities. This is especially remarkable given the secrecy that
pervaded Soviet society. [The relative transparency of nuclear arsenals
ensured that the superpowers could calculate risks and
consequences]{.underline} within a first-order approximation, which led
to a reduction in severe conflict and instability even as political
competition in other arenas was fierce \[61, 68\]. Recent insights about
the causes of war suggest that **[divergent expectations]{.underline}**
[about the costs and consequences of war are **necessary for contests to
occur**]{.underline} \[69--73\]. These insights are associated with
rationalist theories, such as deterrence theory itself. [[Empirical
studies]{.mark} and psychological critiques of the **rationality**
assumption have [helped]{.mark} to **[refine models]{.mark}** and bring
some **circumspection** into their application, [but]{.mark} the
formulation of **[sound]{.mark} strategy** (if not the
**[execution]{.mark}**) [still requires]{.mark} the articulation of
**some [rational linkage]{.mark}** between cause and effect]{.underline}
\[19, 62, 74\]. [Many supposedly **[nonrational factors]{.mark}**,
moreover, simply manifest as **uncertainty** in strategic
interaction.]{.underline} Our focus here is on the effect of uncertainty
and ignorance on the ability of states and other actors to bargain in
lieu of fighting. [Many wars are [a product of]{.mark} what adversaries
do not know or what they misperceive, whether as a result of
[**bluffing**, **secrecy**, or **intrinsic
uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[75, 76\]. [If knowledge of
capabilities or resolve [is]{.mark} a prerequisite for deterrence, then
[one reason for **deterrence failure**]{.mark} is the inability or
unwillingness to **credibly communicate details of the genuine balance
of power**]{.underline}, threat, or interests. Fighting, conversely, can
be understood as a costly process of discovery that informs adversaries
of their actual relative strength and resolve. From this perspective,
successful deterrence involves instilling in an adversary perceptions
like those that result from fighting, but before fighting actually
begins. Agreement about the balance of power can enable states to
bargain (tacit or overt) effectively without needing to fight, forging
compromises that each prefers to military confrontation or even to the
bulk of possible risky brinkmanship crises. [Despite other deficits,
nuclear weapons have long been considered to be stabilizing with respect
to **rational incentives for war**]{.underline} (the risk of nuclear
accidents is another matter) \[77\]. [If each side has a secure second
strike]{.underline}---or even a minimal deterrent with some nonzero
chance of launching a few missiles---[then each side can expect to gain
little and lose much by fighting a nuclear war.]{.underline} Whereas the
costs of conventional war can be more mysterious because each side might
decide to hold something back and meter out its punishment due to some
internal constraint or a theory of graduated escalation, even a modest
initial nuclear exchange is recognized to be extremely costly. As long
as both sides understand this and understand (or believe) that the
adversary understands this as well, then the relationship is stable.
Countries engage nuclear powers with considerable deference, especially
over issues of fundamental national or international importance. At the
same time, nuclear weapons appear to be of limited value in prosecuting
aggressive action, especially over issues of secondary or tertiary
importance, or in response to aggression from others at lower levels of
dispute intensity. Nuclear weapons are best used for signaling a
willingness to run serious risks to protect or extort some issue that is
considered of vital national interest. As mentioned previously, both
superpowers in the Cold War considered the warfighting advantages of
nuclear weapons quite apart from any deterrent effect, and the United
States and Russia still do. High-altitude bursts for air defense,
electromagnetic pulse for frying electronics, underwater detonations for
anti-submarine warfare, hardened target penetration, area denial, and so
on, have some battlefield utility. Transparency per se is less important
than weapon effects for warfighting uses, and can even be deleterious
for tactics that depend on stealth and mobility. Even a single tactical
nuke, however, would inevitably be a political event. Survivability of
the second strike deterrent can also militate against transparency, as
in the case of the Soviet Perimeter system, as mobility, concealment,
and deception can make it harder for an observer to track and count
respective forces from space. Counterforce strategies, platform
diversity and mobility, ballistic missile defense systems, and force
employment doctrine can all make it more difficult for one or both sides
in a crisis to know whether an attack is likely to succeed or fail. The
resulting uncertainty affects not only estimates of relative
capabilities but also the degree of confidence in retaliation. At the
same time, there is reason to believe that platform diversity lowers the
risk of nuclear or conventional contests, because increasing the number
of types of delivery platforms heightens second strike survivability
without increasing the lethality of an initial strike \[78\]. While
transparency is not itself a requirement for nuclear use, stable
deterrence benefits to the degree to which retaliation can be
anticipated, as well as the likelihood that the consequences of a first
strike are more costly than any benefit. Cyber operations, in contrast,
are neither robust to revelation nor as obviously destructive. The cyber
commitment problem Deterrence (and compellence) uses force or threats of
force to "warn" an adversary about consequences if it takes or fails to
take an action. In contrast, defense (and conquest) uses force to "win"
a contest of strength and change the material distribution of power.
Sometimes militaries can change the distribution of information and
power at the same time. Military mobilization in a crisis signifies
resolve and displays a credible warning, but it also makes it easier to
attack or defend if the warning fails. Persistence in a battle of
attrition not only bleeds an adversary but also reveals a willingness to
pay a higher price for victory. More often, however, the informational
requirements of winning and warning are in tension. Combat performance
often hinges on well-kept secrets, feints, and diversions. Many military
plans and capabilities degrade when revealed. National security involves
trade-offs between the goals of preventing war, by advertising
capabilities or interests, and improving fighting power should war break
out, by concealing capabilities and surprising the enemy. The need to
conceal details of the true balance of power to preserve battlefield
effectiveness gives rise to the military commitment problem \[79, 80\].
Japan could not coerce the United States by revealing its plan to attack
Pearl Harbor because the United States could not credibly promise to
refrain from reorienting defenses and dispersing the Pacific Fleet. War
resulted not just because of what opponents did not know but because of
what they could not tell each other without paying a severe price in
military advantage. The military benefits of surprise (winning) trumped
the diplomatic benefits of coercion (warning). Cyber operations, whether
for disruption and intelligence, are extremely constrained by the
military commitment problem. Revelation of a cyber threat in advance
that is specific enough to convince a target of the validity of the
threat also provides enough information potentially to neutralize it.
Stuxnet took years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop but
was patched within weeks of its discovery. The Snowden leaks negated a
whole swath of tradecraft that the NSA took years to develop. States may
use other forms of covert action, such as publicly disavowed lethal aid
or aerial bombing (e.g. Nixon's Cambodia campaign), to discretely signal
their interests, but such cases can only work to the extent that
revelation of operational details fails to disarm rebels or prevent
airstrikes \[81\]. Cyber operations, especially against NC3, must be
conducted in extreme secrecy as a condition of the efficacy of the
attack. Cyber tradecraft relies on stealth, stratagem, and deception
\[21\]. Operations tailored to compromise complex remote targets require
extensive intelligence, planning and preparation, and testing to be
effective. Actions that alert a target of an exploit allow the target to
patch, reconfigure, or adopt countermeasures that invalidate the plan.
As the Defense Science Board points out, competent network defenders:
can also be expected to employ highly-trained system and network
administrators, and this operational staff will be equipped with
continuously improving network defensive tools and techniques (the same
tools we advocate to improve our defenses). Should an adversary discover
an implant, it is usually relatively simple to remove or disable. For
this reason, offensive cyber will always be a fragile capability. \[41\]
The world's most advanced cyber powers, the United States, Russia,
Israel, China, France, and the United Kingdom, are also nuclear states,
while India, Pakistan, and North Korea also have cyber warfare programs.
NC3 is likely to be an especially well defended part of their cyber
infrastructures. NC3 is a hard target for offensive operations, which
thus requires careful planning, detailed intelligence, and long
lead-times to avoid compromise. Cyberspace is further ill-suited for
signaling because cyber operations are complex, esoteric, and hard for
commanders and policymakers to understand. Most targeted cyber
operations have to be tailored for each unique target (a complex
organization not simply a machine), quite unlike a general purpose
munition tested on a range. Malware can fail in many ways and produce
unintended side effects, as when the Stuxnet code was accidentally
released to the public. The category of "cyber" includes tremendous
diversity: irritant scams, hacktivist and propaganda operations,
intelligence collection, critical infrastructure disruption, etc. Few
intrusions create consequences that rise to the level of attacks such as
Stuxnet or BlackEnergy, and even they pale beside the harm imposed by a
small war. Vague threats are less credible because they are
indistinguishable from casual bluffing. Ambiguity can be useful for
concealing a lack of capability or resolve, allowing an actor to pool
with more capable or resolved states and acquiring some deterrence
success by association. But this works by discounting the costliness of
the threat. Nuclear threats, for example, are usually somewhat veiled
because one cannot credibly threaten nuclear suicide. The consistently
ambiguous phrasing of US cyber declaratory policy (e.g. "we will respond
to cyber-attacks in a manner and at a time and place of our choosing
using appropriate instruments of U.S. power" \[82\]) seeks to operate
across domains to mobilize credibility in one area to compensate for a
lack of credibility elsewhere, specifically by leveraging the greater
robustness to revelation of military capabilities other than cyber. This
does not mean that cyberspace is categorically useless for signaling,
just as nuclear weapons are not categorically useless for warfighting.
Ransomware attacks work when the money extorted to unlock the
compromised host is priced below the cost of an investigation or
replacing the system. The United States probably gained some benefits in
general deterrence (i.e. discouraging the emergence of challenges as
opposed to immediate deterrence in response to a challenge) through the
disclosure of Stuxnet and the Snowden leaks. Both revelations
compromised tradecraft, but they also advertised that the NSA probably
had more exploits and tradecraft where they came from. Some cyber
operations may actually be hard to mitigate within tactically meaningful
timelines (e.g. hardware implants installed in hard-to-reach locations).
Such operations might be revealed to coerce concessions within the
tactical window created by a given operation, if the attacker can
coordinate the window with the application of coercion in other domains.
As a general rule, however, the cyber domain on its own is better suited
for winning than warning \[83\]. Cyber and nuclear weapons fall on
extreme opposite sides of this spectrum. Dangerous complements Nuclear
weapons have been used in anger twice---against the Japanese cities
Hiroshima and Nagasaki---but cyberspace is abused daily. Considered
separately, the nuclear domain is stable and the cyber domain is
unstable. In combination, the results are ambiguous. The nuclear domain
can bound the intensity of destruction that a cyber attacker is willing
to inflict on an adversary. US declaratory policy states that
unacceptable cyber attacks may prompt a military response; while nuclear
weapons are not explicitly threatened, neither are they withheld.
Nuclear threats have no credibility at the low end, where the bulk of
cyber attacks occur. This produces a cross-domain version of the
stability--instability paradox, where deterrence works at the high end
but is not credible, and thus encourages provocation, at low
intensities. Nuclear weapons, and military power generally, create an
upper bound on cyber aggression to the degree that retaliation is
anticipated and feared \[22, 83, 84\]. In the other direction, the
unstable cyber domain can undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence.
Most analysts who argue that the cyber--nuclear combination is a recipe
for danger focus on the fog of crisis decision making \[85--87\].
Stephen Cimbala points out that today's relatively smaller nuclear
arsenals may perversely magnify the attractiveness of NC3 exploitation
in a crisis: "Ironically, the downsizing of U.S. and post-Soviet Russian
strategic nuclear arsenals since the end of the Cold War, while a
positive development from the perspectives of nuclear arms control and
nonproliferation, makes the concurrence of cyber and nuclear attack
capabilities more alarming" \[88\]. Cimbala focuses mainly on the [risks
of **misperception** and **miscalculation**]{.underline} that [emerge
when a cyber attack muddies the **transparent
communication**]{.underline} [required for opponents to understand one
another's interests, redlines, and willingness to use force, and to
ensure reliable control over subordinate commanders. Thus a nuclear
actor "faced with a sudden burst of **holes**]{.underline} [in its vital
warning and response systems might, for example, press the **preemption
button** instead of **waiting to ride out the attack and then
retaliate**]{.underline}" \[85\]. [The outcome of fog of decision
scenarios such as these depend on how humans react to risk and
uncertainty]{.underline}, which in turn depends on bounded rationality
and organizational frameworks that might confuse rational decision
making \[89, 90\]. These factors exacerbate a hard problem. Yet within a
rationalist framework, cyber attacks that have already created their
effects need not trigger an escalatory spiral. While being handed a fait
accompli may trigger an aggressive reaction, it is also plausible that
the target's awareness that its NC3 has been compromised in some way
would help to convey new information that the balance of power is not as
favorable as previously thought. This in turn could encourage the target
to accommodate, rather than escalate. While defects in rational decision
making are a serious concern in any cyber--nuclear scenario, the
situation becomes even more hazardous when there are rational incentives
to escalate. Although "known unknowns" can create confusion, to
paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, the "unknown unknowns" are perhaps more
dangerous. [A successful clandestine penetration of NC3 can **defeat the
informational symmetry that stabilizes nuclear
relationships**.]{.underline} [Nuclear weapons are useful for deterrence
because they impose a degree of **consensus** about the distribution of
power; each side knows the other can inflict prohibitive levels of
damage, even if they may disagree about the precise extent of this
damage. Cyber operations are attractive **precisely because they can
secretly revise the distribution of power**]{.underline}. [NC3
neutralization]{.underline} may be an expensive and rarified capability
in the reach of only a few states with mature signals intelligence
agencies, but it [is much cheaper than nuclear attack]{.underline}. Yet
the very usefulness of cyber operations for nuclear warfighting ensure
that deterrence failure during brinksmanship crises is more likely.
[[Nuclear states may initiate crises of risk and
resolve]{.underline}]{.mark} to see who will back down first, which is
not always clear in advance. Chicken appears viable, ironically,
be[cause each player understands that a nuclear war would be a disaster
for all, and thus all can agree that someone can be expected
swerve.]{.underline} Nuclear deterrence should ultimately make dealing
with an adversary diplomatically more attractive than fighting, provided
that fighting is costly---as would seem evident for the prospect of
nuclear war---and assuming that bargains are available to states willing
to accept compromise rather than annihilation. [If, however, one side
knows, but the other does not, that the attacker has disabled the
target's ability to perceive an impending military attack, or to react
to one]{.underline} when it is underway, then [they will not have a
shared understanding of the probable outcome of war, even in broad
terms.]{.underline} Consider a brinksmanship crisis between two nuclear
states where only one has realized a successful penetration of the
rival's NC3. The cyber attacker knows that it has a military advantage,
but it cannot reveal the advantage to the target, lest the advantage be
lost. The target does not know that it is at a disadvantage, and it
cannot be told by the attacker for the same reason. The attacker
perceives an imbalance of power while the target perceives a balance. A
dangerous competition in risk taking ensues. The first side knows that
it does not need to back down. The second side feels confident that it
can stand fast and raise the stakes far beyond what it would be willing
to if it understood the true balance of power. Each side is willing to
escalate to create more risk for the other side, making it more likely
that one or the other will conclude that deterrence has failed and move
into warfighting mode to attempt to limit the damage the other can
inflict. The targeted nature and uncertain effects of offensive cyber
operations put additional pressure on decision makers. An intrusion will
probably disable only part of the enemy's NC3 architecture, not all of
it (which is not only operationally formidable to achieve but also more
likely to be noticed by the target). Thus the target may retain control
over some nuclear forces, or conventional forces. The target may be
tempted to use some of them piecemeal to signal a willingness to
escalate further, even though it cannot actually escalate because of the
cyber operation. The cyber attacker knows that it has escalation
dominance, but when even a minor demonstration by the target can cause
great damage, it is tempting to preempt this move or others like it.
This situation would be especially unstable if only second strike but
not primary strike NC3 was incapacitated. Uncertainty in the efficacy of
the clandestine penetration would discount the attacker's confidence in
its escalation dominance, with a range of possible outcomes. Enough
uncertainty would discount the cyber attack to nothing, which would have
a stabilizing effect by returning the crisis to the pure nuclear domain.
A little bit of uncertainty about cyber effectiveness would heighten
risk acceptance while also raising the incentives to preempt as an
insurance measure. [[Adding allies into the mix introduces additional
instability]{.underline}]{.mark}. An ally emboldened by its nuclear
umbrella might run provocative risks that it would be much more
reluctant to embrace if it was aware that the umbrella was actually full
of holes. Conversely, if the clandestine advantage is held by the state
extending the umbrella, allies could become unnerved by the willingness
of their defender to run what appear to be outsize risks, oblivious of
the reasons for the defender's confidence, creating discord in the
alliance and incentives for self-protective action, leading to greater
uncertainty about alliance solidarity. The direction of influence
between the cyber and nuclear realms depends to large degree on which
domain is the main arena of action. Planning and conducting cyber
operations will be bounded by the ability of aggressors to convince
themselves that attacks will remain secret, and by the confidence of
nuclear nations in their invulnerability. Fears of cross-domain
escalation will tend to keep instability in cyberspace bounded. However,
if a crisis has risen to the point where nuclear threats are being
seriously considered or made, then NC3 exploitation will be
destabilizing. Brinksmanship crises seem to have receded in frequency
since the Cuban Missile Crisis but may be more likely than is generally
believed. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has insinuated more than
once in recent years that his government is willing to use tactical
nuclear weapons if necessary to support his policies. Cyber power and
nuclear stability Not all crises are the same. Indeed, their very
idiosyncrasies create the uncertainties that make bargaining failure
more likely \[75\]. So far our analysis would be at home in the Cold
War, with the technological novelty of cyber operations. Yet not every
state has the same cyber capabilities or vulnerabilities. Variation in
cyber power relations across dyads should be expected to affect the
strategic stability of nuclear states. The so-called second nuclear age
differs from superpower rivalry in important ways \[91\]. There are
fewer absolute numbers of warheads in the world, down from a peak of
over 70 000 in the 1980s to about 15 000 today (less than 5000
deployed), but they are distributed very unevenly \[92\]. The United
States and Russia have comparably sized arsenals, each with a fully
diversified triad of delivery platforms, while North Korea only has a
dozen or so bombs and no meaningful delivery system (for now). China,
India, Pakistan, Britain, France, and Israel have modest arsenals in the
range of several dozen to a couple hundred weapons, but they have very
different doctrines, conventional force complements, domestic political
institutions, and alliance relationships. The recent nuclear powers lack
the hard-won experience and shared norms of the Cold War to guide them
through crises, and even the United States and Russia have much to
relearn. Cyber warfare capacity also varies considerably across
contemporary nuclear nations. The United States, Russia, Israel, and
Britain are in the top tier, able to run sophisticated, persistent,
clandestine penetrations. China is a uniquely active cyber power with
ambitious cyber warfare doctrine, but its operational focus is on
economic espionage and political censorship, resulting in less refined
tradecraft and more porous defenses for military purposes \[16\].
France, India, and Pakistan also have active cyber warfare programs,
while North Korea is the least developed cyber nation, depending on
China for its expertise \[93\]. It is beyond the scope of this article
to assess crisis dyads in detail, and data on nuclear and cyber power
for these countries are shrouded in secrecy. Here, as a way of summing
up the arguments above, we offer a few conjectures about how stylized
aspects of cyber power affect crisis stability through incentives and
key aspects of decision making. We do not stress relative nuclear weapon
capabilities on the admittedly strong (and contestable) assumption that
nuclear transparency in the absence of cyber operations would render
nuclear asymmetry irrelevant for crisis bargaining because both sides
would agree about the terrible consequences of conflict \[94\]. We also
omit domestic or psychological variables that affect relative power
assessments, although these are obviously important. Even if neither
India nor Pakistan have viable cyber--nuclear capabilities,
brinksmanship between them is dangerous for many other reasons, notably
compressed decision timelines, Pakistan's willingness to shoot first,
and domestic regime instability. Our focus is on the impact of offensive
and defensive cyber power on nuclear deterrence above and beyond the
other factors that certainly play a role in real-world outcomes. First,
does the cyber attacker have the organizational capacity, technical
expertise, and intelligence support to "compromise" the target's NC3?
Can hackers access critical networks, exploit technical vulnerabilities,
and confidently execute a payload to disrupt or exploit strategic
sensing, command, forces, or transport capacity? The result would be
some tangible advantage for warfighting, such as tactical warning or
control paralysis, but one that cannot be exercised in bargaining.
Second, is the target able to "detect" the compromise of its NC3? The
more complicated and sensitive the target, the more likely cyber
attackers are to make a mistake that undermines the intrusion.
Attribution is not likely to be difficult given the constricted pool of
potential attackers, but at the same time the consequences of
misattributing "false flag" operations could be severe \[95\]. At a
minimum, detection is assumed to provide information to the target that
the balance of power is perhaps not as favorable as imagined previously.
We assume that detection without an actual compromise is possible
because of false positives or deceptive information operations designed
to create pessimism or paranoia. Third, is the target able to "mitigate"
the compromise it detects? Revelation can prompt patching or network
reconfiguration to block an attack, but this assumption is not always
realistic. The attacker may have multiple pathways open or may have
implanted malware that is difficult to remove in tactically meaningful
timelines. In such cases the cyber commitment problem is not absolute,
since the discovery of the power to hurt does not automatically disarm
it. Successful mitigation here is assumed to restore mutual assessments
of the balance of power to what they would be absent the cyber attack.
Table 1 shows how these factors combine to produce different deterrence
outcomes in a brinksmanship (chicken) crisis. If there is no cyber
compromise and the target detects nothing (no false positives) then we
have the optimistic ideal case where nuclear transparency affords stable
"deterrence." Transparency about the nuclear balance, including the
viability of secure second strike forces, provides strategic stability.
We also expect this box to describe situations where the target has
excellent network defense capabilities and thus the prospect of defense,
denial or deception successfully deters any attempts to penetrate NC3.
This may resemble the Cold War situation (with electronic warfare in
lieu of cyber), or even the present day US--Russia dyad, where the odds
of either side pulling off a successful compromise against a highly
capable defender are not favorable. Alternately the attack may be deemed
risky enough to encourage serious circumspection. However, the existence
of Canopy Wing does not encourage optimism in this regard. \[\[TABLE 1
OMITTED\]\] Conversely, if there is a compromise that goes undetected,
then there is a heightened risk of "war" because of the cyber commitment
problem. This box may be particularly relevant for asymmetric dyads such
as the United States and North Korea, where one side has real cyber
power but the other side is willing to go to the brink where it
believes, falsely, that it has the capability to compel its counterpart
to back down. Cyber disruption of NC3 is attractive for damage
limitation should deterrence fail, given that the weaker state's
diminutive arsenal makes damage limitation by the stronger state more
likely to succeed. The dilemma for the stronger state is that the
clandestine counterforce hedge, which makes warfighting success more
likely, is precisely what makes deterrence more likely to fail. The
United States would face similar counterforce dilemmas with other dyads
like China or even Russia, although even a strong cyber power should be
more circumspect when confronted with an adversary with a larger/more
capable nuclear and conventional arsenal. More complex and cyber savvy
targets, moreover, are more likely to detect a breach in NC3, leading to
more ambiguous outcomes depending on how actors cope with risk and
uncertainty. Paradoxically, confidence in cyber security may be a major
contributor to failure; believing one is safe from attack increases the
chance that an attack is successful. If the successful compromise is
detected but not mitigated, then the target learns that the balance of
power is not as favorable as thought. This possibility suggests fleeting
opportunities for "coercion" by revealing the cyber coup to the target
in the midst of a crisis while the cyber attacker maintains or develops
a favorable military advantage before the target has the opportunity to
reverse or compensate the NC3 disruption. Recognizing the newly
transparent costs of war, a risk neutral or risk averse target should
prefer compromise. The coercive advantages (deterrence or compellence)
of a detected but unmitigated NC3 compromise will likely be fleeting.
This suggests a logical possibility for creating a window of opportunity
for using particular cyber operations that are more robust to revelation
as a credible signal of superior capability in the midst of a crisis. It
would be important to exploit this fleeting advantage via other credible
military threats (e.g. forces mobilized on visible alert or deployed
into the crisis area) before the window closes. One side may be able
gain an unearned advantage, an opportunity for coercion via a "bluff,"
by the same window-of-opportunity logic. A target concerned about NC3
compromise will probably have some network monitoring system and other
protections in place. Defensive systems can produce false positives as a
result of internal errors or a deception operation by the attacker to
encourage paranoia. It is logically possible that some false positives
would appear to the target to be difficult to mitigate. In this
situation, the target could believe it is at a disadvantage, even though
this is not in fact the case. This gambit would be operationally very
difficult to pull off with any reliability in a real nuclear crisis.
Cyber--nuclear coercion and bluffing strategies are fraught with danger.
Detection without mitigation might put a risk-acceptant or loss-averse
target into a "use-lose" situation, creating pressures to preempt or
escalate. The muddling of decision-making heightens the risk of
accidents or irrational choices in a crisis scenario. Worry about
preemption or accident then heightens the likelihood that the initiator
will exercise counterforce options while they remain available. These
pressures can be expected to be particularly intense if the target's
detection is only partial or has not revealed the true extent of damage
to its NC3 (i.e. the target does not realize it has already lost some or
all of what it hopes to use). These types of scenarios are most usually
invoked in analyses of inadvertent escalation \[23--27\]. The essential
distinction between "use-lose" risks and "war" in this typology is the
target's knowledge of some degree of NC3 compromise. Use-lose and other
cognitive pressures can certainly result in nuclear war, since the
breakdown of deterrence leads to the release of nuclear weapons, but we
distinguish these outcomes to highlight the different decision making
processes or rational incentives at work. A "spiral" of mistrust may
emerge if one side attempts a compromise but the defender detects and
mitigates it. Both sides again have common mutual estimates of the
relative balance of power, which superficially resembles the
"deterrence" case because the NC3 compromise is negated. Unfortunately,
the detection of the compromise will provide the target with information
about the hostile intentions of the cyber attacker. This in turn is
likely to exacerbate other political or psychological factors in the
crisis itself or in the crisis-proneness of the broader relationship.
The strange logical case where there is no compromise but one is
detected and mitigated could result from a false positive misperception
(including a third-party false flag operation) that could conflict
spiraling \[96, 97\]. The bluff and coercion outcomes are also likely to
encourage spiraling behavior once the fleeting bargaining advantage
dissipates or is dispelled (provided anyone survives the interaction).
The risk of crisis instability is not the same for all dyads. It is
harder to compromise the NC3 of strong states because of the redundancy
and active defenses in their arsenal. Likewise, strong states are better
able to compromise the NC3 of any states but especially of weaker
states, because of strong states' greater organizational capacity and
expertise in cyber operations. Stable deterrence or MAD is most likely
to hold in mutually strong dyads (e.g. [the United States
and]{.underline} the Soviet Union in the Cold War or
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** today to a lesser extent). Deterrence
is slightly less likely in other equally matched dyads
(**[[India--Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**) where defensive
vulnerabilities create temptations but offensive capabilities may not be
sufficient to exploit them. Most states can be expected to refrain from
targeting American NC3 given a US reputation for cyber power (a general
deterrence benefit enhanced by Stuxnet and Snowden). The situation is
less stable if the United States is the attacker. The most dangerous
dyad is a stronger and a weaker state (United States and **[[North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}** or [**[Israel]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark}). [Dyads involving
strong and middle powers are]{.underline} also
**[dangerous]{.underline}** ([United States and **China**]{.underline}).
[The stronger side is tempted to disrupt NC3 as a warfighting hedge in
case deterrence breaks down, while the weaker but still formidable side
has a reasonable chance at detection. The marginally weaker may also be
tempted to subvert NC3, particularly for reconnaissance; the stronger
side is more likely to detect and correct the intrusion but will be
alarmed by]{.underline} the [ambiguity in distinguishing intelligence
collection from attack planning]{.underline} \[98\]. [[In a
brinksmanship crisis]{.mark} between them, [windows for coercion may be
available yet fleeting, with real risks of spiral and
war.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Creating Unnecessary Vulnerabilities [Prioritizing [offensive
operations]{.mark} can **[increase adversaries' fears]{.mark}**,
suspicions, [and **readiness to take**]{.mark} **offensive
[action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Cyber [offenses include cyber
exploitation (intelligence gathering) and cyberattack]{.underline}
(disrupting, destroying, or subverting an adversary's computer systems).
An [adversary can easily mistake defensive cyber exploitation for
offensive operations because [the distinction is]{.mark} a matter of
[intent, not technical operation]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The difficulty
of distinguishing]{.underline}]{.mark} [between offensive and defensive
tactics [makes]{.mark} mistrustful [adversaries **more
reactive**]{.mark}, and repeatedly conducting offensive cyber operations
only **increases distrust**]{.underline}. A focus on [offensive
operations]{.underline} can also **[increase
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**; for example, secretly stockpiling
information about vulnerabilities in computers for later exploitation,
rather than publicizing and helping civil society to mitigate those
vulnerabilities, leaves critical infrastructure vulnerable to attack.
The skills and organizational capabilities for offense and defense are
very similar. Defense requires understanding how to compromise computer
systems; one of the best ways to protect computer systems is to engage
in penetration testing (i.e., controlled offensive operations on one's
own systems). [The similarity between offensive and defensive skills
makes it **unnecessary to conduct offensive operations** against
adversaries to maintain offensive capability.]{.underline} Thus, rather
than stockpiling technologies in the hope of gaining offensive
advantage, states should develop the skills and organizational
capabilities required to innovate and maintain information and
communications technologies. Managing Complexity The complexity of
information systems gives the offense certain advantages for purely
probabilistic reasons. [Imagine a race: offense and defense go hunting
for randomly distributed vulnerabilities, with the offense attempting to
exploit those vulnerabilities and the defense aiming to patch them. The
number of [vulnerabilities grows with]{.mark} the **[size and
complexity]{.mark}** of the computer system]{.underline}, as do the
technological advantages of offense---at least in principle. [With a
vast number of vulnerabilities, [it is **unlikely** that the defense
will]{.mark} be able to find and [patch every vulnerability]{.mark}
before the offense finds and exploits it.]{.underline} Technology is,
however, embedded in social organizations, and organizations can help
the defense better manage complexity. Those that develop software can
check for common errors before making hardware-software systems
available for use. [The defender has complete access to its computer
system, whereas the attacker has a more limited set of attack
vectors.]{.underline} Organizations can help skilled defenders by
establishing good cybersecurity processes, such as continually scanning
for vulnerabilities and updating software. Assessing Kinetic Effects To
date, failures of cyber defense have largely been failures of
management, and the successes of offense are a result of its relatively
simpler goals. [[Offense]{.mark}, like defense, [becomes more difficult
as]{.mark} its [goals become]{.mark} more [complex]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In particular, the advantages that complexity offers the offense in
cyberspace diminish in the physical world. [Computers controlling
physical machinery can be hacked, but achieving particular physical
effects, such as covertly sabotaging nuclear enrichment facilities,
requires knowledge of the physical processes that the computers control,
not merely knowledge of the computers. Much of the detailed knowledge
needed to run an industrial control system is tacit]{.underline}, passed
from one engineer to another but never written down, let alone stored on
a computer. [Gathering such information requires traditional espionage
by humans on the ground, which is both expensive and risky]{.underline}.
A cost-benefit analysis of Stuxnet for both the offense and the defense
demonstrates why [[damaging]{.mark} physical [infrastructure is **more
costly** than]{.mark} simply [infiltrating]{.mark} information
[networks]{.mark}. The costs of Stuxnet were likely far greater for the
offense (the United States and Israel) than for the defense (Iran), and
[Stuxnet was]{.mark} relatively [ineffective, setting back
Iran's]{.mark} nuclear [program by fewer than three
months]{.mark}]{.underline}. The great expense of Stuxnet was
intelligence; though digital espionage can be used to obtain some kinds
of information, the knowledge needed to disrupt a physical control
system, such as the detailed methods and settings used to control
pressure in Iran's nuclear centrifuges, is not generally held in
computers. The costs for both sides are dominated not by technology but
by skilled labor---for example, hackers who identify and exploit
zero-day vulnerabilities, systems administrators who manage and defend
computer systems, and the nuclear engineers who understand enrichment
processes and the means of disrupting them. In addition, assessing costs
alone is misguided: [the perceived benefits of attacking with and
defending from Stuxnet (i.e., the value of Iran's nuclear weapons
program) greatly exceeded the costs for both the offense and the
defense]{.underline}. This is one reason not to be complacent about the
need to secure industrial control systems and critical infrastructure:
[though cyberattacks on such systems will be costly, [a determined
adversary may be **willing to pay the cost**]{.mark} to achieve its
aims]{.underline}. Conclusion The common assumption that the offense
dominates cyberspace is dangerous and deeply misguided. The
offense-defense balance can be assessed only for specific operations,
not for all of cyberspace, as it is shaped by the capabilities of
adversaries and the complexity of their goals in any conflict. When it
comes to exerting precise physical effects, [cyberspace **does not offer
overwhelming advantages** to the offense]{.underline}. Because the
capabilities of offense and defense are similar, [improving [defensive
operations allows preparation]{.mark} for cyber offense [without
**risking geopolitical instability**]{.mark} or increasing vulnerability
to attack.]{.underline}

"In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand." 1 These words, written
in 2010 by Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn, reflect
conventional wisdom among military officers, policymakers, and scholars.
2 A minority of scholars disagree. 3 Nonetheless, [[the]{.mark}
prevalent [belief that cyberspace favors]{.mark} the [offense]{.mark}
has major consequences for **international security**]{.underline}.
According to offense-defense theory, [state perceptions that technology
favors the offense [increase fears of attack **encourage arms
races**]{.mark}, and through interactions between fears [and]{.mark}
capabilities, **[increase the likelihood]{.mark} and consequences [of
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 4 [[Overconfidence in]{.mark} the
[advantages]{.mark} of offense can [create a "cult of the offensive"
with]{.mark} potentially **[tragic results]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 5
Many of [these dynamics appear to be at work with cyber
conflict.]{.underline} Military leaders perceive cyberspace as favoring
the offense and are seeking more discretion to conduct offensive cyber
operations. 6 Cyberattack features prominently in the U.S. intelligence
community's list of global threats. 7 In 2012 Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta warned of a potential "cyber-Pearl Harbor." 8 [Fears of being
hacked, optimism about hacking others, or both have spurred massive
investments in military [cyber operations]{.mark} around the world,
suggesting a cyber arms race]{.underline}. 9 Because [cyber operations
can [**blur lines** between espionage]{.mark} (or "cyber exploitation")
[and use of force]{.mark} (or "cyberattack"), they create a
"cybersecurity dilemma]{.underline}," wherein network intrusions
undertaken for defensive purposes are easily misunderstood as
preparation for an attack, [**[creating the risk of escalation]{.mark}**
and use of force.]{.underline} 10

US ambivalence toward cyber war is both strategic and normative, the
implication being that what is bad for the United States is also bad for
the world. [Washington insists that any cyber operations it might
conduct would be 'in a manner **consistent with US and international
law**]{.underline}**'**.5 Perceiving cyber war as war implies the
applicability of the laws of war, specifically the principles of
non-aggression, non-intervention, proportionality, discrimination and
respect for neutrality.6 [[Compliance with]{.mark} all these [norms
could be **challenging** when]{.mark} initiating and [conducting
offensive cyber war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Case in point: [the United
States]{.underline} and Israel [are said to have created and inserted
the Stuxnet worm to interfere with the control of centrifuges used by
Iran]{.underline} to enrich uranium. However justified by the imperative
of preventing Iran from building nuclear weapons, [it is fair to ask if
this act of cyber war was lawful]{.underline}, especially in light of
the unintended collateral effects it reportedly had. More broadly,
harming non-combatants and civilian life, which can occur when infecting
non-military computer systems, raises especially vexing issues, at least
for the United States -- thus its defensive posture. [There are
**several obvious reasons** for US wariness about offensive cyber
war]{.underline}. Firstly, US [[military]{.underline}]{.mark},
intelligence, economic, governmental and societal [[functions
are]{.mark} **highly [dependent on computer systems]{.mark}**[, and
vulnerable to]{.mark} their [disruption]{.mark} and
degradation.]{.underline} Put starkly, having led and benefited
enormously from the 'digital revolution', the United States regards
cyber war as counter-revolutionary. Moreover, [once begun, the course a
[cyber war]{.mark} might take [would be **hard to**]{.mark} **predict,
[control]{.mark} or contain**. [It could trigger **kinetic
hostilities**]{.mark}, visit indiscriminate harm on non-combatants,
[escalate]{.mark} far beyond what the belligerents intended, [and
cause]{.mark} grave [economic damage]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 Finally, US
superiority in conventional military capabilities limits the need for
cyber war, whereas enemies could use cyber war as an asymmetric answer
to such superiority. In other words, cyber war could level the
battlefield to the US disadvantage.

In contemporary defense policy discourse [there are three **influential
narratives** of mounting cyber peril, corresponding roughly to the three
operational modes of attack, exploitation, and defense.]{.underline} The
most dangerous scenarios envision the paralysis of industrial control
systems or military command and control through surprise attack by
anonymous hackers. [[The]{.mark} imagined [aggressor may be]{.mark} a
**revisionist state** like [China or Iran or a non-state]{.mark}
anarchist or [terrorist]{.mark} empowered by the information
revolution.]{.underline} A second narrative offers an alternative to the
shock of sudden catastrophe, warning instead of the long term erosion of
economic and military competitiveness drained away through persistent
computer espionage. The relentless theft of vital secrets stored on
corporate and government networks produces a "death by a thousand cuts"
as states give their firms an unfair commercial advantage and equip
their military forces with potent countermeasures to U.S. strengths. In
both of these scenarios, [[commercial]{.mark} hacking [tools]{.mark} and
ubiquitous connectivity [give]{.mark} weaker states and [terrorists
provide a **potent means** to exploit]{.mark} and attack the expanding
attack surface of digitally-dependent advanced [industrial
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. A third threat narrative concerns the
transformation of internet architecture to decisively benefit one
political group at the expense of the other. At one extreme, the growth
of flexible social media enables connected protesters to overwhelm and
overthrow authoritarian regimes.15 At the other extreme, authoritarian
governments censor internet content and reconfigure internet governance
to undermine the internet's potential for innovation and freedom. State
paranoia about the threats of paralysis and erosion thus leads to
digital lockout or "the end of the internet" as we know it.16 [[Threats
of]{.mark} catastrophic attack, omniscient [exploitation]{.mark}, and
unassailable defense are myths because they [imagine major rewards for
little cost.]{.mark} The actual [rewards of any]{.mark} given cyber
[campaign are **rarely**]{.mark} **so [great]{.mark}** and the c[osts
are rarely]{.mark} so [trivial]{.mark}. Potential [benefits]{.mark} of
attack [are **discounted by uncertainty** about the]{.mark} true [value
of the target]{.mark} to the adversary and the ability for the attacker
to take advantage of it. [**Operative costs** include]{.mark} the
bureaucratic resources, [development and testing]{.mark} requirements,
human capital, [and intelligence experience]{.mark} required to plan and
run an effective covert cyber campaign.]{.underline} Setting aside the
myths of low costs and high rewards (no free lunch), there are a variety
of more realistic cyber operations with significant variation in their
operative costs and benefits. A set of higher cost, and, potentially,
higher reward complements enhance the capabilities of stronger actors
who can master them. A much larger set of low cost, low reward irritants
are available to weaker actors or even solitary individuals, but they
provide only a small marginal return on a small investment.

[More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and NATO-allied
countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a
single \"nuclear warning shot,\" according to a terrifying new
simulation. [The simulation is called \"Plan A]{.mark},\"]{.underline}
and it\'s an audio-visual piece that was first posted to to YouTube on
September 6. (You can watch the full video at the end of this story.)
Researchers at the Science and Global Security lab at Princeton
University created the animation, [which shows how [a battle between
Russia and NATO allies that uses]{.mark} so-called low-yield or
\"[tactical\" nuclear weapons]{.mark} --- which can pack a blast
equivalent to those the US used to destroy Hiroshima or Nagasaki in
World War II --- [might]{.mark} feasibly and quickly [snowball into a
global nuclear war]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"This project is motivated by
the need to highlight the potentially catastrophic consequences of
current US and Russian nuclear war plans. **[[The risk of nuclear war
has increased dramatically]{.mark} in the past two
years]{.underline}**,\" the project states on its website. The video has
an ominous, droning soundtrack and a digital map design straight out of
the 1983 movie \"WarGames.\" The Cold War-era movie, in which a young
Matthew Broderick accidentally triggers a nuclear war, \"was exactly the
reference point,\" simulation designer Alex Wellerstein told Insider.
But while simulations can be frightening, they can also be incredibly
helpful: governments can use them to develop contingency plans to
respond to nuclear disasters and attacks in the least escalatory way,
and they can also help ordinary citizens learn how to survive a nuclear
attack. \"[[Plan A\" comes as tensions between Russia and NATO allies
ratchet up]{.mark}. Both Russia and the US are testing weapons
previously banned under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty,
often called INF. Russian bombers have also cruised into US airspace
repeatedly, and the US recently sent its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber on a
mission **[in the Arctic]{.mark}** --- right in Russia\'s backyard.
[This is how a]{.mark} NATO-Russian [confrontation could quickly
escalate into nuclear war.]{.mark} The simulation starts with a
conventional war between NATO and Russian troops. [Conventional
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} --- namely all conflict short of nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons --- [[escalates into nuclear warfare when
Russia launches a]{.mark} nuclear \"[warning shot]{.mark}\" from a base
near Kaliningrad **[to stop NATO advancement]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Russia doesn\'t have a \"no first use\" policy --- it dropped it in
1993. [[NATO forces respond]{.mark} by launching a tactical nuclear
strike. The US already has tactical nuclear weapons, such as B61-12
gravity bombs, and more planned under US President Donald Trump\'s 2018
Nuclear Posture Review. Included in the plan is a low-yield warhead
intended for use in a submarine-launched ballistic missile, as well as a
sea-launched cruise missile. These kinds of weapons are designed for
targets on the battlefield, like troops or munitions supplies, as
opposed to long- or intermediate-range nuclear missiles that are fired
from one country to another, for example, targeting an enemy\'s bombers
and ICBM silos --- or even cities. [Tactical nuclear strikes up the
ante]{.mark}. If the nuclear threshold is crossed, the simulation finds,
then both the US and Russia would respond with tactical nuclear weapons.
[Russia would send 300 warheads]{.mark} to NATO targets, including
advancing troops, in both aircraft and short-range missiles ---
overwhelming force that would obliterate tanks, fortified positions and
soldiers unlike anything ever seen in battle before. Supporting [forces
and civilians not immediately killed would be susceptible to]{.mark}
painful and even fatal [radiation]{.mark} exposure. NATO would respond
by sending about 180 tactical nuclear weapons to Russia via aircraft in
equally devastating retaliation.]{.underline} The simulation was
constructed using independent analysis of nuclear force postures in NATO
countries and Russia, including the availability of nuclear weapons,
their yields, and possible targets, according to the Science and Global
Security lab. The tactical phase of the simulation shows about [**2.6
million casualties over three hours**. [Instead of]{.mark} the [tactical
weapons de-escalating]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}, as proponents claim
they would, **[the simulation shows conflict spiraling out of
control]{.mark}** after the use of tactical weapons. [Russia\'s]{.mark}
tactical [weapons would destroy]{.mark} much of
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, the simulation posits. [In response, [NATO
would launch]{.mark} submarine- and US-based strategic nuclear weapons
toward Russia\'s nuclear arsenals --- [600 warheads]{.mark} in total.
Strategic nuclear weapons have a longer range, so Russia, knowing that
NATO nukes are headed for its weapons cache, would throw all its weight
behind missiles launched from silos, mobile launchers, and submarines.
The casualties during this phase would be 3.4 million in 45
minutes.]{.underline} This leads to 85.3 million additional casualties
in the final phase of the nuclear war simulation. In the wake of
previous attacks, both Russia and NATO would launch warheads toward each
other\'s 30 most populous cities in the final stage of of the scenario,
using five to 10 warheads for each city depending on its size. This
phase would cause 85.3 million casualties --- both deaths and injuries.
But the total casualty count from the entire battle (of less than 5
hours) would be 34.1 million deaths and 57.4 million injuries, or a
combined 91.3 million casualties overall. [**But [that\'s just the
immediate conflict]{.mark}**: The entire world would be affected by
nuclear disaster in the months, years, and decades to come. The
[radioactive fallout]{.mark} from the nuclear disaster [would cause
additional deaths]{.mark} and injuries. Studies also suggest that, even
with a limited nuclear engagement, [Earth\'s atmosphere would cool
dramatically, driving famine]{.mark}, refugee crises, additional
[conflicts, and more deaths.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [detonation]{.underline} of an atomic bomb with this explosive power
[will instantly ignite fires]{.underline} over a surface area of three
to five square miles. In the recent studies, the scientists calculated
that [the blast, fire, and radiation]{.underline} from a war fought with
100 atomic bombs [could produce direct fatalities comparable to all of
those worldwide in World War II,]{.underline} or to those once estimated
for a "counterforce" nuclear war between the superpowers. However, [the
long-term environmental effects of the [war could]{.mark} significantly
[disrupt]{.mark} the **[global weather]{.mark}**]{.underline} for at
least a decade, [which would]{.underline} likely [[result in]{.mark} a
**vast [global famine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The scientists predicted
that [nuclear]{.underline} **[[firestorms]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
burning cities [would cause]{.underline} at least five million tons of
**[[black carbon smoke]{.underline}]{.mark}** to quickly rise above
cloud level into the stratosphere, where it could not be rained out. The
smoke would circle the Earth in less than two weeks and would [form a
**global**]{.underline} stratospheric smoke **[layer]{.underline}**
[that would remain for]{.underline} more than [a]{.underline}
**[decade]{.underline}**. The smoke would [[absorb]{.underline}]{.mark}
warming **[[sunlight]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which would heat the smoke
to temperatures near the boiling point of water, [[producing **ozone
losses**]{.underline}]{.mark} of 20 to 50 percent over populated areas.
This would almost double the amount of UV-B [reaching]{.underline} the
most populated regions of the mid-latitudes, and it would create [UV-B
indices **[unprecedented in]{.mark}** ~~human~~ \[humyn}
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}. In North America and Central Europe, the
time required to get a painful sunburn at mid-day in June could decrease
to as little as six minutes for fair-skinned individuals. As the smoke
layer blocked warming sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface, it
[would produce]{.underline} the **[cold]{.underline}**est average
surface **[temperatures]{.underline}** in the last 1,000 years. The
scientists calculated that [global food production would decrease by 20
to 40 percent during a five-year period following such a
war.]{.underline} Medical experts have predicted that [the shortening of
growing seasons and corresponding decreases in agricultural production
could cause up to **two billion** people to **perish** from
famine.]{.underline} The climatologists also investigated the effects of
a nuclear war fought with the vastly more powerful modern thermonuclear
weapons possessed by the United States, Russia, China, France, and
England. Some of the thermonuclear weapons constructed during the 1950s
and 1960s were 1,000 times more powerful than an atomic bomb. During the
last 30 years, the average size of thermonuclear or "strategic" nuclear
weapons has decreased. Yet today, each of the approximately 3,540
strategic weapons deployed by the United States and Russia is seven to
80 times more powerful than the atomic bombs modeled in the
India-Pakistan study. The smallest strategic nuclear weapon has an
explosive power of 100,000 tons of TNT, compared to an atomic bomb with
an average explosive power of 15,000 tons of TNT. Strategic nuclear
weapons produce much larger nuclear firestorms than do atomic bombs. For
example, a standard Russian 800-kiloton warhead, on an average day, will
ignite fires covering a surface area of 90 to 152 square miles. A war
fought with hundreds or thousands of **[U.S. and Russian]{.underline}**
strategic nuclear [weapons]{.underline} would ignite immense nuclear
firestorms covering land surface areas of many thousands or tens of
thousands of square miles. The scientists calculated that these fires
would produce up to 180 million tons of black carbon soot and smoke,
which would form a dense, global stratospheric smoke layer. The smoke
would remain in the stratosphere for 10 to 20 years, and it would block

NUCLEAR WINTER IN BRIEF The profound cold and darkness following nuclear
war became known as nuclear winter and was first predicted in 1983 by a
group of NASA scientists led by Carl Sagan. During the mid-1980s, a
large body of research was done by such groups as the Scientific
Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), the World
Meteorological Organization, and the U.S. National Research Council of
the U.S. National Academy of Sciences; their work essentially supported
the initial findings of the 1983 studies. The idea of nuclear winter,
published and supported by prominent scientists, generated extensive
public alarm and put political pressure on the United States and Soviet
Union to reverse a runaway nuclear arms race, which, by 1986, had
created a global nuclear arsenal of more than 65,000 nuclear weapons.
Unfortunately, this created a backlash among many powerful military and
industrial interests, who undertook an extensive media campaign to brand
nuclear winter as "bad science" and the scientists who discovered it as
"irresponsible." Critics used various uncertainties in the studies and
the first climate models (which are primitive by today's standards) as a
basis to criticize and reject the concept of nuclear winter. In 1986,
the Council on Foreign Relations published an article by scientists from
the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who predicted drops in
global cooling about half as large as those first predicted by the 1983
studies and described this as a "nuclear autumn." The nuclear autumn
studies were later shown to be deeply flawed, but the proof came too
late to stop a massive smear campaign that effectively discredited the
initial studies. Nuclear winter was subject to criticism and damning
articles in the Wall Street Journal and Time magazine. In 1987, the
National Review called nuclear winter a "fraud." In 2000, Discover
Magazine published an article that described nuclear winter as one of
"The Twenty Greatest Scientific Blunders in History." The endless smear
campaign was successful; the general public, and even most anti-nuclear
activists, were left with the idea that nuclear winter had been
scientifically disproved. REJECTION BY LEADERS Yet the scientists did
not give up. In 2006, they returned to their labs to perform the
research I have previously described. Their new research not only upheld
the previous findings but also found that the earlier studies actually
underestimated the environmental effects of nuclear war. Dr. Robock of
Rutgers and Dr. Toon of the University of Colorado have spent years
attempting to bring official attention to their work and get follow-up
research studies done by appropriate agencies in the federal government.
In a recent (2016) interview, Dr. Toon stated: The Department of Energy
and the Department of Defense, which should be investigating this
problem, have done absolutely nothing. They have not published a single
paper, in the open literature, analyzing this problem ... We have made a
list of where we think the important issues are, and we have gone to
every \[federal\] agency we can think of with these lists, and said
"Don't you think someone should study this?" Basically, everyone we have
tried so far has said, "Well that's not my job." In the same interview,
Dr. Robock also noted: The Department of Homeland Security really should
fund this. They will fund you to study one terrorist bomb in New York
City. When you explain to them that a war between India and Pakistan is
a much greater threat to the U.S. homeland than one terrorist bomb, as
horrible as that is, they respond with "Oh, well that's not my job, go
talk to some other program manager" --- who, of course, doesn't exist.
After the more recent series of studies were published in 2007 and 2008,
Drs. Robock and Toon also made a number of requests to meet with members
of the Obama administration. The scientists offered to brief Cabinet
members and the White House staff about their findings, which they
assumed would have a great impact upon nuclear weapons policy. Their
offers were met with indifference. Finally, after several years of
trying, Drs. Robock and Toon were allowed an audience with John Holdren,
Senior Advisor to President Barack Obama on Science and Technology. Dr.
Robock also eventually met with Rose Gottemoeller, then Under Secretary
of State for Arms Control and International Security. Dr. Robock has
written to me that, after these meetings, he and Dr. Toon were left with
the impression that neither Holdren nor Gottemoeller think the nuclear
winter research "is correct." But it is not only Holdren and
Gottemoeller who reject the nuclear winter research. Greg Mello, of the
Los Alamos Study Group, cites a source who confirms that the group that
determines the "full range of activities related to the development,
production, maintenance (upkeep) and elimination (retirement,
disassembly and disposal) of all United States nuclear weapons --- the
members of the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Council --- have stated that "the
predictions of nuclear winter were disproved years ago." The members of
the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Council include: Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Vice ~~Chairman~~ \[Chairperson}
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Under Secretary for Nuclear Security of the
Department of Energy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Commander of
the United States Strategic Command It is important to understand that
some members of this group --- especially the Commander of the U.S.
Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) --- also develop the policies that guide
the use of nuclear weapons. Perhaps General John Hyten, Head of
USSTRATCOM, who is in charge of the U.S. nuclear triad, and General Paul
Selva, Vice ~~Chairman~~ \[Chairperson\] of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the second highest ranking officer in the United States, have never seen
or heard of the 21st century nuclear winter studies. Perhaps when they
hear a question about "nuclear winter," they only remember the smear
campaigns done against the early studies. Or, maybe, they just choose
not to accept the new scientific research on nuclear winter, despite the
fact that it has withstood the criticism of the global scientific
community. Regardless, the rejection of nuclear winter research by the
top leaders of the United States raises some profoundly important
questions: Do U.S. military and political leaders fully understand the
consequences of nuclear war? Do they realize that even a "successful"
nuclear first-strike against Russia could cause most Americans to die
from nuclear famine? In 2010, Drs. Toon and Robock wrote in Physics
Today: We estimate that the direct effects of using the 2012 arsenals
would lead to hundreds of millions of fatalities. The indirect effects
would likely eliminate the majority of the ~~human~~ \[humyn\]
population. In 2013, Drs. Toon and Robock wrote in the Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists that: A nuclear war between Russia and the United
States, even after the arsenal reductions planned under New START, could
produce a nuclear winter. Hence, an attack by either side could be
suicidal, resulting in Self-Assured Destruction. RENEWED COLD WAR
Although president-elect Trump appears to favor a return to the policy
of détente with Russia, many if not most U.S. political leaders appear
to support the Obama administration's policies of [direct confrontation
with Putin's Russia]{.underline}. Mainstream corporate media, including
the editorial boards of The New York Times and The Washington Post,
routinely engage in anti-Russian and anti-Putin rhetoric that surpasses
the hate speech of the McCarthy era. Under President Obama, the United
States has [renewed the **Cold War**]{.underline} with Russia, with
little or no debate or protest, [and]{.underline} has subsequently
[engaged in **proxy wars**]{.underline} [with Russia in **Ukraine and
Syria,**]{.underline} [as well as threatening **military action against
China**]{.underline} [in the **South China Sea**]{.underline}. In
response to what NATO leaders describe as Russia's "dangerous and
aggressive actions," [NATO has built up a **"rapid-response
force"**]{.underline} of 40,000 troops [on the Russian border in the
Baltic States and Poland.]{.underline} This force includes hundreds of
tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy artillery. NATO troops stationed in
Estonia are [within **artillery range of St. Petersburg**]{.underline},
the second largest city of Russia. The United States has [deployed its
**Aegis**]{.underline} Ashore Ballistic Missile Defense
(**[BMD]{.underline}**) system [in]{.underline}
**[Romania]{.underline}** [and is constructing another]{.underline} such
BMD system [in **Poland**]{.underline}. [[The Mark 41 launch
system]{.underline}]{.mark} used [[in the Aegis Ashore systems
can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to [[launch]{.underline}]{.mark} a
variety of missiles, including **[[long-range nuclear]{.mark}-armed
cruise [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [In other words, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has built and [is building **launch
sites**]{.mark} **for nuclear missiles [on the Russian
border]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This fact has been widely reported on
Russian TV and has infuriated the Russian public. In June, Russian
President Putin specifically warned that [Russia would be **forced to
retaliate**]{.underline} against this threat. While Russian officials
maintain that its actions are normal and routine, [Russia]{.underline}
now [appears to be **preparing for war**]{.underline}. On October 5,
2016, Russia [conducted a nation-wide civil defense drill that included
40 million]{.underline} of its people being [directed to fallout
shelters]{.underline}. Reuters reported two days later that
[Russia]{.underline} had [moved its Iskander]{.underline}
nuclear-capable [missiles to **Kaliningrad**]{.underline}, which borders
Poland. While the United States ignores the danger of nuclear war,
Russian scholar Stephen Cohen reports that the danger of war with the
United States is the leading news story in Russia. Cohen states: Just as
there is no discussion of the most existential question of our time, in
the American political class --- the possibility of war with Russia ---
it is the only thing being discussed in the Russian political class . .
. These are two different political universes. In Russia, all the
discussion in the newspapers, and there is plenty of free discussion on
talk show TV, which echoes what the Kremlin is thinking, online, in the
elite newspapers, and in the popular broadcasts, the number 1, 2, 3, and
4 topics of the day are the possibility of war with the United States.
Cohen goes on to say: I conclude from this that [the leadership of
Russia **actually believes**]{.underline} now, [in reaction to what the
United States and NATO have said and done over the last two years, and
particularly in reaction to the breakdown of the proposed cooperation in
Syria, and the rhetoric coming out of Washington, that **war is a real
possibility**]{.underline}. I can't remember when, since the Cuban
Missile Crisis, that the Moscow leadership came to this conclusion in
its collective head. Perhaps this narrative will change under
president-elect [Trump]{.underline}. However, he [is inheriting a
situation **fraught with danger**]{.underline}, [which retains the
possibility of **direct military conflict**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [**Russia in Ukraine and Syria**, as well
as]{.underline} increasingly militarized confrontation
[with]{.underline} **[China in the South China Sea]{.underline}**.

**But the plan solves**

https://natowatch.org/default/2011/ban-offensive-cyber-operations-needed/ceng

Russia's call for NATO to launch an investigation into the computer worm
that targeted a Russian-built Iranian nuclear power plant deserves a
response. [Claims that the incident could have triggered a new Chernobyl
are probably exaggerated, but an investigation is certainly warranted.
Indeed, a joint Russia-NATO investigation might be beneficial,
especially if it were also to review the 2007 cyber attacks against
Estonia (2007) and Georgia (2008).]{.underline} The New York Times has
reported that US and Israeli intelligence services collaborated to
develop the destructive computer worm in a bid to sabotage Iran\'s
efforts to make a nuclear bomb. [No smoking Russian state gun has ever
been found in relation to the attacks on Estonia, although evidence
points to coordination among Russian professional computer specialists
and chat sites that were exhorted on the blogosphere to attack Estonian
sites.]{.underline} The question of who masterminded the attack itself
has been reverberating for several years, with many fingers pointing at
the Kremlin, but without any evidence to substantiate these claims. A
joint NATO-Russian analysis of both the Stuxnet and Estonia/Georgia
cyber attacks would be an exemplary case of cooperative security in
action. But don't expect it to happen any time soon. The rattling of
cyber skeletons inside both the Kremlin and Pentagon will see to that.
In addition, the opinion pages in America have been full of praise for
the "bloodless cyber warfare attack" on Iran, which is hardly surprising
given the domestic support for other remote technological fixes in the
US arsenal, such as armed drones. [But just as those have blowback
consequences, [the moving of malware]{.mark} from the domain of civilian
black-hats [to full-bore military weaponry]{.mark} also [has the
potential to threaten us]{.mark} in return.]{.underline} As the Los
Angeles Times points out "[it\'s hard to ignore the signs that a new
kind of arms race has started]{.underline}". This is troubling for at
least two reasons: **[[we don\'t know how existing international
laws]{.mark} and treaties that govern conventional conflicts [would
apply to cyber war]{.mark}, if at all, [and]{.mark} second, our crucial
[infrastructure is highly vulnerable to attacks]{.mark} from cyberspace.
In an increasingly interconnected world, [it\'s hard to tell where the
cyber battlefield begins and ends]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is clear,
however, that the US Defence Department is carrying out clandestine
cyber activities with very little oversight by lawmakers, a situation
that is almost certainly mirrored across several other NATO member
states as well as other major powers, like Russia, India and China. [The
US military\'s use of offensive cyber warfare has only rarely been
disclosed, the most well-known instance being the electronic jamming of
Iraqi military and communications networks in advance of the 'shock and
awe' attack in 2003.]{.underline} It seems highly likely that the US
military is also involved in offensive military cyber activities in
Afghanistan, Yemen and several other countries where it is supporting
counterinsurgency or counterterrorism operations. The Pentagon has also
centralized its cyberspace operations within a Cyber Command that became
fully operational in October last year. [It is also clear that the US is
making most of the running in developing cyber security partnerships
with NATO and the EU.]{.underline} Hungary\'s Gabor Iklody is the point
person on emerging security challenges for NATO, including cyber
security, heading up a new office opened last August. The Lisbon Summit
in November and NATO's new Strategic Concept also identified cyber
security as a priority and commit the Alliance to bringing a NATO
cyber-incident response organization fully online by 2012 and to
centralize NATO cyber security. The declaration also included
commitments to develop an in-depth cyber defence policy by June 2011 and
prepare an action plan for its implementation. [One of Ambassador
Iklody's first tasks should be to clearly define the parameters of
offensive and defensive cyber operations and explore [how NATO might
contribute towards an international ban on offensive cyber
attacks]{.mark}, or at minimum, a 'no-first use policy' akin to that
adopted by some nuclear weapon states (but not NATO). He [will first be
required to]{.mark} remove the blinkers and [address a significant
obstacle to international cooperation]{.mark} in this area: that a major
source of cyber attacks and [a major spur to the cyber arms race resides
within NATO itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[An offensive cyber organization]{.mark} will also need attack tools to
achieve a certain effect or goal]{.underline}. Payloads greatly vary in
size. On one end of the spectrum, they can come as very lightweight
files that are easy to distribute, but once executed they will trigger
the download of a much larger piece of malware.43 On the other end of
the spectrum, payloads can be multiple megabytes (MBs) in size. A
multipurpose toolkit was discovered in 2012 by researchers from
Kaspersky Lab, which they called Flame. Whereas the Stuxnet code is
"only" about 1 MB in size, Flame's malware code is about twenty times
larger---and still not fully understood.44 [It [is
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}[---**[and cost
inefficient]{.underline}**]{.mark}---[to build an arsenal of tools for a
more mature cyber command or intelligence agency]{.underline}. [Although
early development and stockpiling would be desirable to ensure swift
deployment if the need arises, [tools]{.mark} often [must be tailored to
the target]{.mark} and desired effect]{.underline} (especially if the
actor desires stealth and stability), [which means that in-time
[development is often necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for
example, a case in which the leadership of a command decides there is a
need to target a specific programmable logic controller (PLC) used to
run a certain manufacturing process. The developers will likely have to
build tools that can work on that particular PLC model. If leadership
subsequently decides to target a different process, developers will have
to deploy a new toolset. Finally, [the more features of the target you
can use, the less you need yourself]{.underline}. Napoleon was famous
for making sure his troops were living off the land through which they
moved. It allowed his army to travel light and march long distances.
This notion of living off the land is also commonly applied to cyber
operations. The attacker may use something exotic to get into a target's
network, but it makes a lot of sense to subsequently use the target's
existing infrastructure to gain further network access. For example,
[existing communication lines to push out notifications can be used to
move through an organization's network. Living off the land is not
merely done for cost-efficiency benefits]{.underline}. The practice is
equally, if not more, important for remaining undetected. Fourth, [to
effectively run cyber operations an organization requires
infrastructure, broadly defined as the processes, structures, and
facilities needed to pull off an offensive cyber operation]{.underline}.
This element can be split into two categories: control infrastructure
and preparatory infrastructure. [Control infrastructure refers to
processes directly used to run an operation. This is also the type of
infrastructure that is generally burned down after a failed
operation]{.underline}. It includes domain names of phishing sites,
leaked email addresses, or other abused technologies.45 It also concerns
C&C infrastructure used in remotely conducted operations to maintain
communication with compromised systems within a target network.
Depending on an operation's goal and resources, the C&C infrastructure
might be as basic as a single server operating on the external
network.46 At the same time, an organization may run a whole set of
operations simply to compromise legitimate web servers to use them for
C&C later.

The Myth of the Offense Contrary to observed patterns of limited
disruption and espionage, Cyber Command sees cyberspace as a domain
fraught with increasing risk, where great powers such as China and
Russia will undermine American power. The only solution, from this
perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the [benefits of an
offensive posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in cyberspace,
[[are]{.mark} mostly **[illusory]{.mark}**]{.underline} to date.
Instead, the [cyber]{.underline} domain [tends to be optimized for
defense and **deception**, not **decisive offensive
blows**.]{.underline} Not only is [offense]{.underline} likely the
weaker form of competition in cyberspace, it also **[risks inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}**. The fear, suspicion, and misperception that
characterize interstate rivalries exacerbate the risk of offensive
action in cyberspace. Cyber Command's 2018 persistent-action strategy
aims to "expose adversaries' weaknesses, learn their intentions and
capabilities, and counter attacks close to their origins."44 Put in
simple terms, the best defense is a good offense: get on adversary
networks and stop cyber operations targeting the United States before
they occur. Under this strategy, offensive cyber operations will also be
preemptive in that they are designed to "contest dangerous adversary
activity before it impairs \[U.S.\] national power."45 To use another
sports metaphor, come out swinging. Go on the offense first and
establish escalation dominance (that is, demonstrating such superior
capabilities over the target state that it can't afford to escalate in
response).46 According to Cyber Command, preemptive strikes will "impose
. . . strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift
resources to defense and reduce attacks."47 Whether through punishment,
risk, or denial strategies, offensive actions theoretically alter the
target's behavior by increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S.
interests.48 Offensive action, according to this thinking, deters future
aggression by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance.
Yet, there are well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options
produce the intended results in cyberspace. Defense and Deception The
rationale behind persistent action---that the best defense is a good
offense---is deeply flawed. In fact, most military and strategic theory
holds that the defense is the superior posture.49 For example, Sun Tzu
describes controlling an adversary to make their actions more
predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them to attack
strong points.50 The stronger form of war is a deception-driven defense:
confusing an attacker so that they waste resources attacking strong
points that appear weak. This parallels cybersecurity scholars Erik
Gartzke and Jon Lindsay's claim that [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}space
[[is **not offense** ]{.mark}**dominant**, **[but deception
dominant]{.mark}**]{.underline}.51 [Rather than persistent]{.underline}
action and [preemptive strikes]{.underline} on adversary networks, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs
**persistent deception** and **defensive counterstrikes**]{.mark}
optimized [to undermine adversary planning and
capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline} Fear and the Security Dilemma [New
policy options]{.underline} proposed [by Cyber Command and]{.underline}
the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration risk
[[exacerbat]{.underline}]{.mark}ing fear in other countries and creating
a self-reinforcing spiral of tit-for-tat escalations that risk war even
though each actor feels he is acting defensively---or, as it is called
in the scholarly literature, [[a **security
dilemma**]{.underline}]{.mark}.52 As shown above, [most cyber
op]{.underline}eration[s to date have not resulted in
escalation]{.underline}. [The cyber domain has been a world of
spies]{.underline} collecting valuable information [and engaging in
limited disruptions that **substitute** for]{.underline}, as well as
complement, [more conventional options]{.underline}. [Shifting
to]{.underline} a policy of **[[preemptive offensive
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** warfare [[risks **provoking fear** and
**overreaction**]{.underline}]{.mark} in other states and possibly
producing conflict spirals. [[Even
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}-objective cyber offensive
[[action]{.underline}]{.mark} defined as ["**defending forward**" [can
be **misinterpreted** and lead to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 As the historian Cathal Nolan puts
it, "intrusions into a state's strategically important networks pose
serious risks and are therefore inherently threatening."54 More
worryingly, with a more offensive posture, it will be increasingly
difficult for states to differentiate between cyber espionage and more
damaging degradation operations.55 [[What]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[calls
**defending forward**, **China and Russia will call preemptive
strikes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Worse still, [[this]{.mark} posture
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[lead great powers to assume
all]{.mark} network [intrusions]{.mark}, including espionage, [are
preparing]{.mark} the environment [for **follow-on offensive
strikes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to cybersecurity scholar Ben
Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own view, such moves are clearly
defensive, merely ensuring that its military will have the strength and
flexibility to meet whatever comes its way. Yet potential adversaries
are unlikely to share this perspective."56 The new strategy risks
[[producing a "**forever cyber war**"]{.mark} prone to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline} because it implies all cyber operations should
be interpreted as escalatory by adversaries.57

A. [Victim States of CDOs Have No Legal Recourse in the United
Nations]{.underline} Charter Article 2(4) The [lawfulness of resorting
to military measures]{.underline}, the jus ad bellum, [is regulated by
the Charter of United Nations]{.underline} Article 2(4). Article 2(4)
provides that "[all members shall refrain in their international
relations from the threat or use of force]{.underline} against the
territorial integrity or political independence of any state."48 No
definitions are provided in the Charter, however, for the key terms,
"use of force" and "political independence," except for a mentioning in
the preamble that one purpose of the Charter is to "ensure...that armed
force shall not be used, save in the common interest."49 It is
altogether unclear if "use of force" in Article 2(4) implies a use of
armed force, and it would be imprudent to draw such a definite
conclusion as arguments were made that use of force is "a large category
of activities containing a smaller subset of events that qualify as
armed subset."50 [[CDO]{.underline}]{.mark}s, while capable of asserting
broad influence on the target states, **[[can hardly fall under the
category of armed force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore, [[a CDO
rarely amount to a "use of force]{.underline}]{.mark}," [even when the
term arguably covers operations less grave than armed
force]{.underline}. Regardless of the scope of use of force, incursions
into a nation's political independence in the form of CDOs have an
"ostensibly peaceful" façade that is non-belligerent in nature, and
therefore are "[seldom broadly accepted as uses of
force]{.underline}."51 The worry of **[[counting CDOs as "use of
force]{.underline}]{.mark}**," other than it is counter-intuitive to the
plain language, is that [[the effect]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of CDOs
might be disproportionate to that of belligerent military
actions]{.underline}]{.mark} (the traditional understanding of "use of
force"). Consequently, [[counting CDOs as "use of
force]{.underline}]{.mark}" might **[[trigger a state's countermeasures
disproportionate to what CDOs deserve]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[in forms
of]{.underline}]{.mark} draconian economic [[sanctions
or]{.underline}]{.mark} even **[[military
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially when the effect of CDOs is
extremely hard to measure as I will discuss in later sections.

[[One option is to lay out a]{.underline}]{.mark} specific [[policy
that]{.underline}]{.mark} would be a part of the Strategic Concept and
that [[describes the sort of cyber attack that is damaging enough to
trigger]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}
commitment from other NATO member states. [[The
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of such a specific declaration **[[is that it
could "green light" lower level]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** by [[guaranteeing that they would not
trigger a NATO response]{.underline}]{.mark}. The advantage of a
specific policy is that it sets up a clear red line for potential
adversaries and potentially deters more dangerous types of cyber
attacks. Bureaucratically, clear guidance about responding to cyber
attacks could facilitate rapid responses in a crisis and prevent
dangerous delays that place the security of member states at risk.
[While individual NATO member states are capable of acting
quickly]{.underline}, **[NATO as an institution, like many institutions,
works more slowly]{.underline}**. Having preset procedures in place to
govern the response to a cyber attack could help NATO members
effectively coordinate in a crisis.

[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[offensive against
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} is an act of aggression that will make
already worrisome tensions between Nato and Moscow even more dangerous.
The west's new cold war with Russia has turned hot. Vladimir [[Putin
bears primary responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} for this latest
development, **[[but Nato's arrogant,]{.mark}]{.underline}** tone‐​deaf
[[policy toward Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} over the past
quarter‐​century [[deserves a large share as well]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Analysts committed to a US foreign policy of realism and restraint have
warned for more than a quarter‐​century that [[continuing to expand the
most powerful military alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} in history
**[[toward another major power would not end
well]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The war in [[Ukraine
provides]{.underline}]{.mark} definitive [[confirmation that it did
not]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thinking through the Ukraine crisis -- the
causes "It would be extraordinarily [difficult to expand Nato eastward
without that action's being viewed by Russia as unfriendly]{.underline}.
Even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of
the old Soviet Union. Some of the more ambitious versions would have the
alliance virtually surround the Russian Federation itself." I wrote
those words in 1994, in my book Beyond Nato: Staying Out of Europe's
Wars, at a time when expansion proposals merely constituted occasional
speculation in foreign policy seminars in New York and Washington. I
added that expansion "would constitute a needless provocation of
Russia". What was not publicly known at the time was that Bill
[Clinton's administration had already made the fateful decision the
previous year to push for including some former Warsaw Pact countries in
Nato]{.underline}. The administration would soon propose inviting
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to become members, and the US
Senate approved adding those countries to the North Atlantic Treaty in
1998. It would be the first of several waves of membership expansion.
[Even that first stage provoked Russian opposition and
anger]{.underline}. In her memoir, Madeleine Albright, Clinton's
secretary of state, concedes that "\[Russian president Boris\] Yeltsin
and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing it as a
strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europe's dividing
line to the east, leaving them isolated." Strobe Talbott, deputy
secretary of state, similarly described the Russian attitude. "Many
Russians see Nato as a vestige of the cold war, inherently directed
against their country. They point out that they have disbanded the
Warsaw Pact, their military alliance, and ask why the west should not do
the same." It was an excellent question, and neither the Clinton
administration nor its successors provided even a remotely convincing
answer. George Kennan, the intellectual father of America's containment
policy during the cold war, perceptively warned in a May 1998 New York
Times interview about what the Senate's ratification of Nato's first
round of expansion would set in motion. "I think it is the beginning of
a new cold war," Kennan stated. "I think the Russians will gradually
react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a
tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was
threatening anybody else." He was right, but [US and Nato leaders
proceeded with new rounds of expansion]{.underline}, including the
provocative step of adding the three Baltic republics. Those countries
not only had been part of the Soviet Union, but they had also been part
of Russia's empire during the Czarist era. That wave of expansion now
had Nato perched on the border of the Russian Federation. [[Moscow's
patience with Nato]{.underline}]{.mark}'s ever more intrusive behavior
[[was wearing thin]{.underline}]{.mark}. The last reasonably friendly
warning from Russia that the alliance needed to back off came in March
2007, when Putin addressed the annual Munich security conference. "[Nato
has put its frontline forces on our borders]{.underline}," Putin
complained. Nato expansion "represents a serious provocation that
reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against
whom is this expansion intended? And what happened to the assurances our
western partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?" In his
memoir, Duty, Robert M Gates, who served as secretary of defense in the
administrations of both George W Bush and Barack Obama, stated his
belief that "the relationship with Russia had been badly mismanaged
after \[George HW\] Bush left office in 1993". Among other missteps, "US
agreements with the Romanian and Bulgarian governments to rotate troops
through bases in those countries was a needless provocation." In an
implicit rebuke to the younger Bush, Gates asserted that "trying to
bring Georgia and Ukraine into Nato was truly overreaching". That move,
he contended, was a case of "recklessly ignoring what the Russians
considered their own vital national interests". The following year, the
Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with [Nato's continuing
incursions]{.underline} into Russia's security zone [had moved beyond
verbal objections]{.underline}. Moscow exploited a foolish provocation
by Georgia's pro‐​western government to launch a military offensive that
brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the capital. Thereafter,
Russia permanently detached two secessionist‐​minded Georgian regions and
put them under effective Russian control. Western (especially US)
leaders continued to blow through red warning light after a red warning
light, however. The Obama administration's shockingly arrogant meddling
in Ukraine's internal political affairs in 2013 and 2014 to help
demonstrators overthrow Ukraine's elected, pro‐​Russia president was the
single most brazen provocation, and it caused tensions to spike. Moscow
immediately responded by seizing and annexing Crimea, and a new cold war
was underway with a vengeance. Could the Ukraine crisis have been
avoided? Events during the past few months constituted the last chance
to avoid a hot war in eastern Europe. **[Putin demanded that Nato
provide guarantees on several security issues]{.underline}**.
Specifically, [[the Kremlin wanted binding
assurances]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that the alliance would
reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} the scope of [[its growing military
presence]{.underline}]{.mark} in eastern Europe and would never offer
membership to Ukraine. He backed up those demands with a massive
military buildup on Ukraine's borders. The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration's [[response to Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s quest for
meaningful western concessions and security guarantees
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} tepid and [[evasive]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Putin then]{.underline}]{.mark}** clearly **[[decided to
escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}** matters. Washington's attempt to make
Ukraine a Nato political and military pawn (even absent the country's
formal membership in the alliance) may end up costing the Ukrainian
people dearly. The Ukraine tragedy History will show that Washington's
treatment of Russia in the decades following the demise of the Soviet
Union was a policy blunder of epic proportions. It was entirely
predictable that Nato expansion would ultimately lead to a tragic,
perhaps violent, breach of relations with Moscow. Perceptive analysts
warned of the likely consequences, but those warnings went unheeded. We
are now paying the price for the US foreign policy establishment's
myopia and arrogance.

### 2AC\-\--AI Arms Race Bad

#### The narrative of an AI arms race is false and actively perpetuates increased risks of unsafe AI being launched

The nation that leads in the development of artificial intelligence
will, Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed in 2017, "become the
ruler of the world." That view has become commonplace in global
capitals. Already, more than a dozen governments have announced national
AI initiatives. In 2017, China set a goal of becoming the global leader
in AI by 2030. Earlier this year, the White House released the American
AI Initiative, and the U.S. Department of Defense rolled out an AI
strategy. But [[the emerging narrative of an "AI arms
race]{.underline}]{.mark}" **[[reflects a mistaken view of the risks
from AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[and introduces significant new
risks as a result]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For each country, [[the real
danger is not that it will fall behind]{.underline}]{.mark} its
competitors in AI [[but that the perception of a
race]{.underline}]{.mark} will **[[prompt everyone to rush to deploy
unsafe AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** systems. [[In their desire to
win]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[countries risk endangering themselves just
as much as their opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [AI promises to bring
both enormous benefits, in everything from health care to
transportation, and huge risks]{.underline}. But **[those [risks aren't
something out of science fiction]{.mark}]{.underline}**; there's no need
to fear a robot uprising. [[The real threat will come from
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}. Right now, [AI systems are powerful but
unreliable]{.underline}. Many of them are vulnerable to sophisticated
attacks or fail when used outside the environment in which they were
trained. Governments want their systems to work properly, but
[competition brings pressure to cut corners]{.underline}. **[Even if
other countries aren't on the brink of major AI breakthroughs, the
perception that they're rushing ahead could push others to do the
same]{.underline}**. And if a [[government deployed an untested
AI]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons system [[or relied
on]{.underline}]{.mark} a faul[[ty AI system to launch
cyberattacks,]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[the result could be disaster for
everyone involved]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Policymakers should learn from
the history of computer networks and make security a leading factor in
AI design from the beginning. They should also **[ratchet down the
rhetoric about an AI arms race]{.underline}** and look for opportunities
to cooperate with other countries to reduce the risks from AI. A race to
the bottom on AI safety is a race no one would win.

[AUTOCRATIC INTELLIGENCE]{.underline}

Harm from [[AI misuse isn't hypothetical]{.underline}]{.mark}; **[[it's
already here]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Bots are regularly used to
[[manipulate social media]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[amplifying]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[messages and suppressing
others]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Deepfakes, AI-generated fake
videos]{.underline}, have been used in so-called revenge porn attacks,
in which a person's face is digitally grafted onto the body of a
pornographic actor. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} examples [[are only the
start]{.underline}]{.mark}. Political campaigns will use AI-powered data
analytics to **[[target individuals with political
propaganda]{.underline}]{.mark}** tailored just for them. Companies will
use the same analytics to [design manipulative advertising]{.underline}.
Digital thieves will **[[use AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** tools
**[[to]{.mark} [create more effective phishing
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Bots will be able to convincingly
impersonate humans online and over the phone by cloning a person's voice
with just a minute of audio. Any interaction that isn't in person will
become suspect. Security specialists have shown that [[it's possible to
hack into autonomous cars]{.underline}]{.mark}, [disabling the steering
and brakes]{.underline}. Just one person could conceivably **[[hijack an
entire fleet of vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a few keystrokes,
creating a traffic jam or **[[launching a terrorist
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**. AI's power as a tool of repression is
even more frightening. [[Authoritarian governments]{.underline}]{.mark}
could [[use deepfakes to discredit dissidents]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[facial recognition]{.underline}]{.mark} to **[[enable round-the-clock
mass surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and predictive analytics to
[[identify potential troublemakers]{.underline}]{.mark}. China has
already started down the road toward digital authoritarianism. It has
begun a massive repression campaign against the Muslim Uighur population
in Xinjiang Province. Many of the tools the government is using there
are low tech, but it has also begun to use data analytics, facial
recognition systems, and predictive policing (the use of data to predict
criminal activity). Vast networks of surveillance cameras are linked up
to algorithms that can [detect anomalous public behavior]{.underline},
from improperly [parked vehicles to people running where they are not
allowed]{.underline}. The Chinese company Yuntian Lifei Technology
boasts that its intelligent video surveillance system has been deployed
in nearly 80 Chinese cities and has identified some 6,000 incidents
related to "social governance." Some of the ways in which Chinese
authorities now use AI seem trivial, such as tracking how much toilet
paper people use in public restrooms. Their proposed future uses are
more sinister, such as monitoring patterns of electricity use for signs
of suspicious activity.

**[[THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY]{.mark}]{.underline}** Today's
[[AI technologies are powerful but unreliable]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Rules-based systems cannot deal with
circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} their programmers [[did not
anticipate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Learning systems are limited by the
data on which they were trained. [AI failures have already led to
tragedy]{.underline}. Advanced autopilot features in cars, although they
perform well in some circumstances, have driven cars without warning
into trucks, concrete barriers, and parked cars. In the wrong situation,
**[[AI systems go from supersmart to superdumb in an
instant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [When [an enemy]{.mark} is [trying to
manipulate and hack an AI system]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the risks are
even greater]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even when they don't break down
completely, learning systems sometimes learn to achieve their goals in
the wrong way. In a research paper last year, a group of 52 AI
researchers recounted dozens of times when AI systems showed surprising
behavior. An algorithm learning to walk in a simulated environment
discovered it could move fastest by repeatedly falling over. A
Tetris-playing bot learned to pause the game before the last brick fell,
so that it would never lose. [One program deleted the files containing
the answers against which it was being evaluated, causing it to be
awarded a perfect score]{.underline}. As the researchers wrote, "It is
often functionally simpler for evolution to exploit loopholes in the
quantitative measure than it is to achieve the actual desired outcome."
Surprise seems to be a standard feature of learning systems.
[Machine-learning systems are only ever as good as their training
data]{.underline}. If the data don't represent the system's operating
environment well, the system can fail in the real world. In 2018, for
example, researchers at the MIT Media Lab showed that **[three leading
facial recognition systems were far worse at classifying dark-skinned
faces than they were at classifying light-skinned ones.]{.underline}**
When they fail, machine-learning systems are also often frustratingly
opaque. For rules-based systems, researchers can always explain the
machine's behavior, even if they can't always predict it. [For
deep-learning systems, however, researchers are often unable to
understand why a machine did what it did.]{.underline} Ali Rahimi, an AI
researcher at Google, has argued that much like medieval alchemists, who
discovered modern glassmaking techniques but did not understand the
chemistry or physics behind their breakthroughs, modern machine-learning
engineers can achieve powerful results but lack the underlying science
to explain them. [[Every failing of an AI system]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[presents a vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} that can be
exploited. In some cases, **[[attackers can poison the training
data]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2016, Microsoft created a chatbot called
Tay and gave it a Twitter account. Other users began tweeting offensive
messages at it, and within 24 hours, Tay had begun parroting their
racist and anti-Semitic language. In that case, the source of the bad
data was obvious. But not all data-poisoning attacks are so visible.
[Some can be buried within the training data in a way that is
undetectable to humans but still manipulates the machine.]{.underline}
Even if the creators of a deep-learning system protect its data sources,
the system can still be tricked using what are known as "adversarial
examples," in which an attacker feeds the system an input that is
carefully tailored to get the machine to make a mistake. A neural
network classifying satellite images might be tricked into identifying a
subtly altered picture of a hospital as a military airfield or vice
versa. The change in the image can be so small that the picture looks
normal to a human but still fools the AI. Adversarial examples can even
be placed in physical objects. In one case, researchers created a
plastic turtle with subtle swirls embedded in the shell that made an
object identification system think it was a rifle. In another,
researchers placed a handful of small white and black squares on a stop
sign, causing a neural network to classify it as a 45-mile-per-hour
speed-limit sign. To make matters worse, [attackers]{.underline} can
[develop these kinds of deceptive images and objects without access to
the training data]{.underline} or the underlying algorithm of the system
they are trying to defeat, and **[researchers have struggled to find
effective defenses against the threat]{.underline}**. [[Unlike with
cybersecurity vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, which can often be
patched once they are uncovered, **[[there is no known way of fully
inoculating algorithms against these attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Governments already have plenty of experience testing military, cyber-,
and surveillance tools, but no testing method can guarantee that complex
systems won't experience glitches once they're out in the real world.
The first time F-22 fighter jets crossed the International Date Line,
their computers crashed and the aircraft were nearly stranded over the
Pacific Ocean. **[Testing AI systems often takes even more time and
money than testing traditional military hardware]{.underline}**. Their
complexity, which makes them more capable, also creates more
opportunities for unexpected glitches. Imagine that a government
develops an AI system that can hack into its adversaries' computer
networks while avoiding detection. The first government to deploy such a
system would gain a huge advantage over its competitors. [Worried that
an adversary was developing a similar tool]{.underline}, [[the
government might feel compelled to cut testing
short]{.underline}]{.mark} and deploy the system early. This dynamic has
already played out in other industries, such as self-driving cars.
**[[The consequences of accidents caused by national security AI
tools]{.mark}]{.underline}** could **[[be far
worse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. AI wouldn't be the first case of
governments relying on a powerful but unsafe technology. That's exactly
what happened with computers, which play critical roles in everything
from trading stocks to guiding missiles even though they suffer from
enormous vulnerabilities. In 2018, investigators at the U.S. Government
Accountability Office found that U.S. weapons systems were riddled with
cybersecurity loopholes that could be exploited with "relatively simple
tools and techniques." Even worse, Defense Department program managers
didn't know about the problems and dismissed the GAO's findings,
claiming the tests were not realistic. Computer security vulnerabilities
aren't limited to government-run systems. Company after company has
suffered major data breaches. Digital security is already too often an
afterthought. [[A world of widespread]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[unprotected AI systems isn't just a
possibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[[it's the
default]{.underline}]{.mark}** setting.

### 2AC\-\--AT: OCO Intel & OCO Good

#### US pledging OCOs for NATO military use disrupts their intelligence gathering capabilities -- makes them exclusively used to hack targets not gather intel 

Trey **Herr, 18**, (Trey Herr, Trey Herr is a visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution. Jacquelyn Schneider is an assistant professor and

6-26-2022) SCade

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development. The Associated
Press reports that the [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} Defense Department
will [announce a]{.underline} new [[**commitment** to use
offensive]{.underline}]{.mark} and defensive cybersecurity
[[capabilities on behalf of NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. The new
commitment is notable given how cybersecurity has long been treated as
an exceptional domain of operations, and cyber capabilities reserved as
strategic national assets to be shared with only the closest of allies.
With this announcement, [the Pentagon is suggesting that cyber
capabilities might be used alongside conventional weapons with
allies]{.underline} and indeed, [**equal weight** appears to be **given
to** offensive and defensive operations]{.underline}. Perhaps most
significantly, the announcement moves NATO partners closer to what has
been a tight coterie of U.S.-favored signals intelligence partners such
as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The DoD
announcement is a sign of the continued, if nascent, normalization of
cybersecurity under the current administration and in Europe. [Even
**where offensive cyber operations** may not rise to the level of war,
**they provide decision-makers with options to influence the
geopolitical environment**]{.underline}. This aligns with recent trends
in the U.S. military to integrate cyber capabilities into maneuver units
and large exercises, and reflects the shift towards more risk acceptant
and offensive measures to counter cyberattacks found in the 2018 DoD
Cyber Strategy. [[Moving cyber capabilities into]{.mark} the
same]{.underline} strategic [frame as [conventional weapons,]{.mark}
**especially [with NATO]{.mark}**[, reflects a shift in]{.mark}
institutional [cyber]{.mark} arrangements within the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the growing power of the **military** relative
to the **intelligence community**.]{.underline} For the United States,
cyber capabilities have always had a complicated relationship with the
intelligence community, in particular the National Security Agency
(NSA). When Cyber Command stood up in 2010 as a sub-unified combatant
command within the Department of Defense, it moved into the NSA's
headquarters, staffed its management ranks with longtime NSA employees,
borrowed networks and technical capabilities, and to this day shares a
dual-hatted commander. In the immediate years after the command was
created, it was logical that the structure of partnerships with allies
looked more like the special signals intelligence relationships formed
around the NSA rather than traditional alliance networks in NATO and
Asia. [The recent [announcement aligns cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}
more closely [with D]{.mark}]{.underline}epartment
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense missions,
[which are more likely to posture capabilities [for deterrent effects,
than **intelligence missions**, which view capabilities as]{.mark}
assets to be [**carefully husbanded**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Treating
cybersecurity capabilities more like conventional arms and less like
national assets]{.underline} also [helps drive the integration of cyber
operations into the planning and execution of a broader array of
conventional military missions.]{.underline} Early cyber operations were
largely conventional espionage and surveillance activities supercharged
by the spread of computing and the internet. In the United States, this
led to the creation of large and complex software tools, carefully
guarded by the intelligence community as national assets (sometimes
unsuccessfully). [The]{.underline} DoD's [announcement indicates a move
towards treating]{.underline} at least some of these capabilities, along
with their supporting infrastructure, [more like **conventional
armaments** and making them **available for broader use**]{.underline};
a model closer to Central or Special Operations Command and less like
the National Security Agency. [The Pentagon's **new
[commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline} also [[reflects]{.mark}
changes]{.underline} in how Europe talks [about cybersecurity and
characterizes the Russian threat. The last two years have seen [a trend
toward]{.mark} more open discussion of offensive cyber operations and
the possibility of the alliance adopting [**more assertive postures** to
**counter cyber operations**]{.mark}]{.underline} against its members.
After years of devastating ransomware attacks and cyber-enabled
information attacks, [[NATO members **are** ]{.mark}**more [willing to
explore cyber triggers to Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They have
also been [more willing to articulate the cyber threat against the
alliance]{.underline}. In addition to last week's denunciation by Dutch,
UK, and U.S. authorities, Russian state actors are widely suggested to
be responsible for an increasingly brazen series of operations,
including targeting German government ministries, French and British TV
stations, and more. Sharing offensive cyber capabilities raises the
question of whether cyber operations can extend effective deterrence to
NATO partners. There seems to be little focus on using these operations
to deter conventional or nuclear attacks on NATO countries, but this may
evolve. The United States seems to want NATO to use cyber operations to
deter other cyber operations, particularly those falling under the

### 2AC\-\--AT: AI Arms Race Fake 

#### Even if AI doesn't reach the level of an Arms Race -- their author concedes there are risks in investing into AI more

In 2015, a group of prominent AI and robotics researchers signed an open
letter warning of the dangers of autonomous weapons. "The key question
for humanity today," they wrote, "is whether to start a global AI arms
race or to prevent it from starting. If any major military power pushes
ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually
inevitable."1 Today, [[many nations are working to apply AI for military
advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the term "AI arms race" has become a
catchphrase used by both critics and proponents of AI militarization. In
2018, then-Under Secretary of Defense Michael Griffin, calling for the
United States to invest more in AI, stated, "There might be an
artificial intelligence arms race, but we're not yet in it."2 In a 2020
Wired article, Will Roper, then chief acquisition officer for the U.S.
Air Force, warned of the risks of falling behind in a "digital arms race
with China."3 The so-called AI arms race has become a common feature in
news headlines,4 but the arms race framing fails to match reality. While
[[nations are clearly competing to develop and adopt AI technology for
military use]{.underline}]{.mark}, the character of that competition
does not meet the traditional definition of an arms race. **[[Military
AI competition nevertheless does pose risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
widespread adoption of [[military AI]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[cause
warfare to evolve]{.mark}]{.underline} in a manner that leads [[to less
human control]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to
**[[warfare becoming faster, more violent, and more
challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}** in [terms of being able to manage
escalation [and bring a war to an end]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Additionally, [[perceptions of a "race]{.underline}]{.mark}" to field AI
systems before competitors do could **[[cause nations to cut
corners]{.underline}]{.mark}** on testing, **[[leading to the deployment
of unsafe AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** systems that are at risk of
accidents [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} could **[[cause unintended
escalation or destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Even if fears
of]{.underline}]{.mark} an "[[AI arms race]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[are
overblown]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[military AI competition brings real
risks]{.mark} to which nations should attend]{.underline}**. There are
concrete steps nations can take to mitigate some of these dangers.

### 2AC -- Russian Deterrence Disad Answers (Impact Defense)

#### No meltdowns impact

**Shellenberger 19** -- Michael, author, environmental policy writer,
cofounder of Breakthrough Institute and founder of Environmental
Progress, Time Magazine "Hero of the Environment". "It Sounds Crazy, But
Fukushima, Chernobyl, And Three Mile Island Show Why Nuclear Is
Inherently Safe", Forbes,

In other words, **[the main [lesson]{.mark}]{.underline}** that should
be drawn **[[from the worst]{.mark} nuclear [accidents is]{.mark} that
[nuclear]{.mark} energy [has always been]{.mark} inherently
[safe]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The truth about nuclear power's safety is
so shocking that it's worth taking a closer look at the worst accidents,
starting with the worst of the worst: Chernobyl. The nuclear plant is in
Ukraine which, in 1986, the year of the accident, was a Soviet Republic.
Operators lost control of an unauthorized experiment that resulted in
the reactor catching fire. There was no containment dome, and the fire
spewed out radioactive particulate matter, which went all over the
world, leading many to conclude that Chernobyl is not just the worst
nuclear accident in history but is also the worst nuclear accident
possible. Twenty-eight firefighters died after putting out the Chernobyl
fire. While the death of any firefighter is tragic, it's worth putting
that number in perspective. Eighty-six firefighters died in the U.S. in
2018, and 343 firefighters died during the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks. Since the Chernobyl accident, 19 first responders have died,
according to the United Nations, for "various reasons" including
tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, heart attacks, and trauma. The
U.N. concluded that "the assignment of radiation as the cause of death
has become less clear." What about cancer? By 2065 there may be 16,000
thyroid cancers; to date there have been 6,000. Since thyroid cancer has
a mortality rate of just one percent --- it is an easy cancer to treat
--- expected deaths may be 160. The World Health Organization claims on
its web site **[that Chernobyl could result in the premature [deaths of
4,000]{.mark} people]{.underline}**, but according to Dr. Geraldine
Thomas, who started and runs the Chernobyl Tissue Bank, that number
**[[is]{.mark} based on a [disproven]{.mark} methodology]{.underline}**.
"**[That]{.underline}** WHO **[number is based on
[LNT]{.mark},"]{.underline}** she explained, using the acronym for the
"linear no-threshold" method of extrapolating deaths from radiation. LNT
assumes that there is no threshold below which radiation is safe, but
**[that]{.underline}** assumption **[[has been discredited]{.mark} over
recent decades [by multiple]{.mark} sources of
[data]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Support for the idea that radiation is
harmless at low levels comes from the fact that people who live in
places with higher background radiation, like Colorado, do not suffer
elevated rates of cancer. In fact, **[residents of Colorado, where
radiation is higher because of]{.underline}** high concentrations of
**[uranium in the ground, enjoy]{.underline}** some of [**the lowest
cancer rates in** the U.S.]{.underline} Even relatively high doses of
radiation cause far less harm than most people think. Careful, large,
and long-term studies of survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki offer compelling demonstration. **[[Cancer rates
were]{.mark} just [10 percent higher among]{.mark} atomic [blast
survivors, most]{.mark} of whom [never got
cancer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even those who received a dose 1,000
times higher than today's safety limit saw their lives cut short by an
average of 16 months. But didn't the Japanese government recently award
a financial settlement to the family of a Fukushima worker who claimed
his cancer was from the accident? It did, but for reasons that were
clearly political, and having to do with the Japanese government's
consensus-based, conflict-averse style, as well as lingering guilt felt
by elite policymakers toward Fukushima workers and residents, who felt
doubly aggrieved by the tsunami and meltdowns. The worker's cancer was
highly unlikely to have come from Fukushima because, once again, the
level of radiation workers received was far lower than the ones received
by the Hiroshima/Nagasaki cohort that saw (modestly) higher cancer
rates. What about **[Three Mile Island?]{.underline}** After the
accident in 1979, Time Magazine ran a cover story that superimposed a
glowing headline, "Nuclear Nightmare," over an image of the plant.
**[[Nightmare? More like a dream. What other]{.mark} major industrial
[technology can suffer]{.mark} a [catastrophic failure and not kill
anyone?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Remember when the Deepwater Horizon oil
drilling rig caught on fire and killed 11 people? Four months later, a
Pacific Gas & Electric natural gas pipeline exploded just south of San
Francisco and killed eight people sleeping in their beds. And that was
just one year, 2010. The worst energy accident of all time was the 1975
collapse of the Banqiao hydroelectric dam in China. It collapsed and
killed between 170,000 and 230,000 people. **[Nuclear's]{.underline}**
worst **[accidents show]{.underline}** that **[the technology has always
been safe]{.underline}** for the same, inherent reason that it has
always had such a small environmental impact: the high energy density of
its fuel. **[[Splitting atoms]{.mark} to create heat]{.underline}**,
rather than than splitting chemical bonds through fire, **[[requires
tiny]{.mark} amounts of [fuel]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A single Coke can
of uranium can provide enough energy for an entire high-energy life.
**[[When the worst occurs]{.mark}, and the fuel melts, [the
amount]{.mark} of]{.underline}** particulate **[matter [that
escapes]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the plant **[[is
insignificant]{.underline}]{.mark}** in contrast to both the fiery
explosions of fossil fuels and the daily emission of particulate matter
from fossil- and biomass-burning homes, cars, and power plants, which
kill seven million people a year. It\'s not that nuclear energy never
kills. It\'s that **[nuclear\'s [death toll is vanishingly
small]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Consider nuclear\'s global death toll in
context. These are just annual deaths. - walking: 270,000 - driving:
1,350,000 - working: 2,300,000 - air pollution: 4,200,000 By contrast,
**[nuclear\'s death total is]{.underline}** likely to be **[[around
200]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### No Nuclear Meltdowns -- countries have learned from Fukushima and Chernobyl implementing safety defenses -- failure is increasingly unlikely because nuclear detonations are stopped -- that's Shellenberger

#### No risk of meltdowns.

To hear Booker tell it, his evolution on the subject was the product of
scientific rigor and anti-ideological clarity on decarbonization. He
related this narrative during a media blitz, comparing anti-nuclear
Democrats to Republican climate deniers over their rejection of an
**[[incontrovertible science]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while pledging to
usher in a nuclear future that no right-minded person could deny. "Where
the science is going, to me, at first sounded like science fiction ...
**[[new nuclear actually portends]{.underline}]{.mark}** of exciting
things where you have **[[no risk of the kinds of meltdowns we're
seeing]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he proclaimed at CNN's climate town
hall. Grandiosity aside, Booker isn't alone in his **[nuclear embrace.
He's part of an unlikely pro-nuclear political alliance, an emergent
accord that spans the centrist think tank Third Way]{.underline}**,
Andrew Yang, Jay Inslee, environmental activists, and progressive
commentators alike. "The left should stop worrying and **[[learn to love
existing nuclear power plants]{.underline}]{.mark}**," wrote New York's
Eric Levitz in a subsequent send-up of Bernie Sanders's and Elizabeth
Warren's twin commitments to phase out the technology. In a world where
the rapid deployment of zero-carbon energy production is urgent, nuclear
power, the argument goes, represents the only proven bet. As **[it
stands, nuclear is currently the largest single source of
near-zero-carbon energy generation in the United States, providing 20
percent of our total energy mix]{.underline}**. And **[while the waste
may be dangerous]{.underline}**, and th**[[e risks associated with
meltdowns cinematically seared into our collective memory, the
technology is actually safer than burning fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[one study found that per unit of
electricity generated, oil is 263 times more deadly than
nuclear,]{.underline}]{.mark}** on account of air pollution alone. With
11 years, per the U.N.'s 2018 IPCC report, to overhaul our energy
system, to be serious about decarbonization is to find a place at the
table for nuclear. It's an alluring idea. Already, this logic has been
embraced in states like Ohio and Booker's New Jersey, which have been
allocating green tax subsidies to nuclear projects. And while it's
largely played out in the background, the question of what to do about
nuclear has vexed Green New Dealers since the rollout of Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez's framework in February. While plane travel and hamburgers
raised hackles in the press, one of the first clauses to be deleted from
the initial proposal pledged to phase out the technology altogether. So
does the Green New Deal need nuclear to achieve its lofty goals? Does
zero-carbon energy infrastructure necessitate a nuclear buildout, or at
least an embrace of already-existing nuclear as a bridge fuel, as
countries like Sweden have done? Unfortunately, the case for nuclear as
a green technology is not so simple---the technology faces a spate of
environmental and economic challenges, while its track record as a
bridge fuel shows it may be more rivalrous than concomitant with
renewables. In fact, it may be the nuclear industry that needs the Green
New Deal, not the other way around. DESPITE THE NEWFOUND exigency of
overhauling the country's energy mix, this is not the first time
America's energy system has arrived at a crossroads in the last ten
years, nor is it the first time nuclear has been trotted out as its
last, best hope. In the late aughts, with oil prices soaring and
production stagnant, policymakers made a commitment to expanding
American nuclear generation. An era of so-called "nuclear renaissance"
began, with four **[[next-generation reactors
commissioned]{.mark}]{.underline}** at two plants, one in Georgia and
the other in South Carolina. Since nuclear energy was first announced as
a civilian project in 1953, its promises of worldwide abundance have far
outpaced its production. Now, over a decade later, that project managed
to bankrupt its construction company, Westinghouse, nearly taking down
the entire Toshiba conglomerate, Westinghouse's parent company, with it.
The two reactors in South Carolina were abandoned, while the Southern
Nuclear and Georgia Power utility companies assumed control of the
remaining two reactors in Georgia, the Vogtle 3 and 4. But even a cash
infusion from Georgia ratepayers, who began subsidizing the completion
of the project in 2011, was not enough to keep the project close to its
budget or timeline. Initially expected to come online in 2016-2017, the
Vogtle plant has run some \$14 billion over budget. Its completion dates
have been deferred to 2021-2022. There's currently no other active
nuclear development in the United States. That timeline should be
particularly alarming for nuclear enthusiasts. If it's going to take 10
to 15 years to see a plant through to completion, even with massive
financial backing, that's seemingly impossible to square with the 11
years to decarbonize. At the very least, we'd need hundreds, if not
thousands of plants already under construction just to make a dent.
Booker, Yang, and other advocates are betting that **[[R&D might
accelerate that process,]{.underline}]{.mark}** but in a real sense it's
already too late. So if new construction can't be counted on, and the
window for adding new nuclear to the fleet has already shut, what about
the reactors we currently have? Has their environmental potential gotten
short shrift? While nuclear fission emits far less carbon dioxide than
energy production by oil and gas, the process of getting to that energy
generation complicates nuclear's claim to zero-carbon status. Uranium
mining, processing, and transport are all carbon-intensive procedures
done by diesel-powered heavy machinery. Instead of carbon, the plants
themselves emit heat, often in great quantities, which can warm nearby
air and water dramatically, killing fish and wildlife and afflicting
neighboring habitats. And while nuclear may maintain a cleaner sheet
than fossil fuels when it comes to CO2, its record on H2O is less rosy.
An American nuclear plant can require between 19 million and 1.4 billion
gallons of water a day, just for purposes of cooling. Because of that
implacable thirst, it's imperative that **[[nuclear plants are
constructed near major water sources.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Thus,
nuclear plants dot our rivers and coastline, each of which carries with
it its own climate-specific challenges. Plants built near abundant
freshwater---rivers and lakes---have been forced to contend with the
twin challenges of too much water and not enough. In recent years,
nuclear reactors, like those on the Great Lakes, **[[have been]{.mark}
forced to [shut down when droughts]{.mark} have plagued rivers and
lakes, reducing water levels to perilous lows.]{.underline}** Meanwhile,
in places like Nebraska, flood risks have necessitated shutdowns. And in
France, which sports one of the most robust nuclear programs in the
world, heat waves have caused **[water temperatures to [surge]{.mark} to
the point of shutdowns multiple summers in a row.]{.underline}**
