#### Artificial Intelligence

Ed **Burns** "What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?"
<https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence>
Tech Target Accessed 23 June 2022 (jshock)

Artificial intelligence is **[[the simulation of human intelligence
processes by machines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially computer
systems. Specific **[[applications]{.underline}]{.mark}** of AI
**[[include [expert
systems](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/expert-system),
natural language processing, speech recognition and [machine
vision](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-vision-computer-vision).]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Artificial neural
networks](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/neural-network)
and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly
evolving, primarily because **[AI processes large amounts of data much
faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly
possible.]{.underline}**

#### AI excludes machine learning

William **Stanton**, 2-24-20**16**,
https://www.alphr.com/artificial-intelligence/1002792/what-is-ai-ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-future-of/,
\"What is AI? Ten things you need to know about the future of artificial
intelligence,\" Alphr (ermo/sms, Acc:6-27-2022)

To truly understand what AI is, though, you need to appreciate the
jargon that's thrown around out there right now. For instance, you need
to know that [[artificial intelligence is not the same as machine
learning]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite the fact it's regularly used as a
synonym for it. [[The chief difference]{.underline}]{.mark} to remember
[[is that machine learning is simply a process by which a computer can
**learn** a skill, whereas artificial intelligence refers to a computer
that can "think" for itself **without being
programmed**]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so.

#### AI excludes robots -- it supplements humans, not replaces us

Nirmal **Narayanan**, 2-19-20**19**,
https://www.ibtimes.co.in/will-artificial-intelligence-take-away-jobs-humans-792246,
\"Will Artificial Intelligence take away jobs from humans?,\" IBTimes
India (ermo/sms, Acc:6-27-2022)

As panic surrounding job loss due to artificial intelligence reaches new
levels, experts have clarified that [[AI will not take away jobs from
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}. Experts revealed that [[artificial
intelligence is actually **supplementing** human
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} all across the spectrum, and it will
actually make the life of humans easy.

In a recent post written on Science Focus, [[Dr Peter
Bentley]{.underline}]{.mark}, a British author and computer scientist
based at University College London [[revealed that artificial
intelligence is **not the same** as factory automation or
robots]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bentley believes that AI is very similar to
the internet, and [[it is basically an **enabling
technology**]{.underline}]{.mark} which creates new jobs in various
industries.

#### AI does not mean artificial consciousness

Brian **Green**, August 24, 20**18** Director of Technology Ethics,
Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, Faculty (adj.), School of
Engineering, Santa Clara University
https://www.academia.edu/40920739/Ethical_Reflections_on_Artificial_Intelligence,
\"Ethical Reflections on Artificial Intelligence,\" Scientia et Fides
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-27-2022)

[[Artificial intelligence is not the same as artificial
consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark} (artificial consciousness has
sometimes been called "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)," "Strong
AI," or "Full AI"). Some thinkers vehemently believe that artificial
consciousness is possible (e.g., Chrisley 2008; Kurzweil 2012; Koene
2013; most contributors to Chella & Manzotti 2013), while others just as
vehemently believe that it is impossible (e.g., Searle 1980; Schlagel
1999; and from a Catholic perspective: Labrecque 2017). I am agnostic on
the subject, but I am sure of this: AI developers will certainly try to
make an AI that simulates interaction with a human as closely as
possible (see, for example, Google's recent release of Duplex (Leviathan
& Matias 2018)). In other words, the artificial construct, if very well
done, will seem conscious. But will it be conscious, or will it only be
a simulation? To me, there is no reason to believe that a close mimicry
of consciousness is the same as consciousness any more than a close
mimicry of anything (fill in the blank: forged money, forged artwork,
actors imitating famous people, simulated gemstones, etc.) actually
becomes the real thing. But the possibility of an exception remains,
after all, some artificial gemstones, such as rubies and sapphire,
really are molecularly identical to natural rubies and sapphires (both
are the mineral corundum: aluminum oxide). Will consciousness be exactly
duplicable, like corundum? I doubt it, but I cannot be certain.

### Lethal Autonomous Weapons:

#### Lethal Autonomous Weapons

**Congressional Research Service 2020** "Defense Primer: U.S. Policy on
Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems"
<https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11150.pdf> CRS (jshock)

**[[Lethal autonomous weapon systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** (LAWS) are a
special class of **[[weapon systems that use sensor suites and computer
algorithms to independently identify a target]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
employ an onboard weapon system to engage **[[and destroy the target
without manual human control of the system.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Autonomous Weapon Systems

**UQ School of Law** October **2020** "Autonomous Weapon Systems"
<https://law.uq.edu.au/research/future-war/autonomous-weapon-systems#terms>
The University of Queensland (jshock)

Likewise, different countries have adopted a range of differing criteria
for designating a weapon system as 'autonomous'. Some, notably the
[United States](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/d3000_09.pdf), use broad
definitions which focus on the role of the human operator:

'**[[A weapon system that]{.underline}]{.mark}**, once activated,
**[[can select and engage targets without further intervention by a
human operator. This includes human-supervised autonomous weapon systems
that are designed to allow human operators to override operation of the
weapon system, but can select and engage targets without further human
input after activation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.'

#### Autonomous Capability can be defined with the highest level of autonomy and evolution

**UQ School of Law** October **2020** "Autonomous Weapon Systems"
<https://law.uq.edu.au/research/future-war/autonomous-weapon-systems#terms>
The University of Queensland (jshock)

Other countries use more restrictive definitions based on some threshold
level of autonomous capability. China, in a [2018 position
paper](https://unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/E42AE83BDB3525D0C125826C0040B262/$file/CCW_GGE.1_2018_WP.7.pdf),
proposed a set of criteria including lethality, a **[[high level of
autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}** ('**[absence of human intervention and
control during the entire process of executing a task']{.underline}**),
'**[[impossibility for termination']{.underline}]{.mark}**,
'indiscriminate effect' and '**[[evolution, meaning that through
interaction with the environment the device can learn autonomously,
expand its functions and capabilities in a way exceeding human
expectations']{.underline}]{.mark}**. No existing weapons fit that
definition, nor are any likely to in the foreseeable future. The United
Kingdom also [originally
proposed](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644084/20110505-JDN_2-11_UAS_archived-U.pdf)
very stringent criteria, although there are more [recent
signs](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/709359/20180517-concepts_uk_human_machine_teaming_jcn_1_18.pdf)
that their position may be
[softening](http://www.article36.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Shifting-definitions-UK-and-autonomous-weapons-July-2018.pdf).

genetically engineered to produce a material of interest (for example,
to be able to ferment specific types of biomass for fuel or to produce
industrial enzymes). Use of naturally-occurring organisms for
fermentation-based production may be relevant to an indirect or lesser
degree; for instance, biofuels can be produced by fermentation with
unmodified microorganisms. [[For this study of biotechnology, we are

practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information.

#### Cybersecurity -- 5 Types

**COMPtia** "What is Cybersecurity?"
<https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-cybersecurity> CompTIA
Accessed 23 June 2022 (jshock)

CompTIA's Chief Technology Evangelist, James Stanger says it best when
he [defines
cybersecurity](https://www.comptia.org/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-it-security-and-cybersecurity)
as "**[[focusing on protecting electronic assets]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- including internet,
[WAN](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-a-wide-area-network)
and
[LAN](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-a-local-area-network)
resources -- used to store and transmit that information."

Cybersecurity can be categorized into five distinct types:

- **[[Critical infrastructure security]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **[[Application security]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **[[Network security]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **[[Cloud security]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **[[Internet of Things (IoT) security]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Cybersecurity excludes information security -- it is about the infrastructure

Bay, Morten, 2016, Ph.D. Candidate in Information Studies at UCLA
https://frenchjournalformediaresearch.com/lodel-1.0/main/index.php?id=988,
\"What is cybersecurity? In search of an encompassing definition for the
post-Snowden era \" French Journal For Media Research -- n° 6/2016 --
ISSN 2264-4733 (ermo/sms, Acc:6-27-2022)

57 Topical difference

Upon further analysis into the actual meaning of the terms, differences
also start to appear. Von Solms & van Niekerk (2013) shows that,
although there are many similarities, there are also plenty of examples
where [[a breach of cybersecurity is not the same as a breach of
information security]{.underline}]{.mark}:

If cybersecurity is synonymous with information security it would be
reasonable to assume that cybersecurity incidents could also be
described in terms of the characteristics used to define information
security. Thus, a cybersecurity incident would, for example, also lead
to a breach in the confidentiality, integrity or availability of
information. (p.99)

58The authors then go on to present a number of [[scenarios
that]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[...deal with a specific aspect of cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}
where the interests of a person, society or nation, including their
non-information based assets, need to be protected from risks stemming
from interaction with cyberspace. This [[serve]{.underline}]{.mark}s
[[to highlight the difference between information security and
cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} (p.100).

59Generally, von Solms & van Niekerk conclude that the main difference
in the natures of information security and cybersecurity is that
[[information security is focused on the protection of the actual
information itself, where as cybersecurity is concerned with the
information **infrastructure**, and what is **reachable** through the
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} (which is not exclusively
information):

Information security is the protection of information, which is an
asset, from possible harm resulting from various threats and
vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is not necessarily
only the protection of cyberspace itself, but also the protection of
those that function in cyberspace and any of their assets that can be
reached via cyberspace. (p. 101)

60With the number of devices connected to networks and the Internet
growing, not least because of the emergence of the so-called 'Internet
of Things', it is clear that information is not the only vulnerable
assets in need of protection online (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco, &
Coen-Porisini, 2015; Tan & Wang, 2010)

#### Plan is cyber resilience not cybersecurity

**Imagine IT**, 7-29-20**21**,
https://imagineiti.com/understanding-cyber-resilience/, \"Understanding
cyber resilience. And how it relates to security,\" Imagine IT
(ermo/sms, Acc:6-27-2022)

Cyber resilience vs. cyber security

[[The difference between cyber security and cyber-resilience comes down
to the expected outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark} of each.

[[Cyber security]{.underline}]{.mark}: Is a component of cyber
resilience and consists of technology processes and measures to protect
networks, systems, and sensitive data from cyber attacks. Effective
cyber-security [[reduces the chances of cyber
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} and protects your organization from
external and internal assaults.

[[Cyber resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}: It reflects the fact that SMB
technology systems will always have flaws and weaknesses that are
exploitable. It [[has a much bigger scope]{.underline}]{.mark} and
includes cyber security and business resilience. Cyber resilience
focuses on instances when your company is disrupted by things like power
outages, weather emergencies, and human error. This concept helps SMBs
prepare, prevent, respond, and successfully recover to pre-event
business levels and processes.

Why cyber resilience?

Because traditional cybersecurity measures for SMBs are just not enough.

The truth is, harmful cyber events negatively impact SMBs every day.
These events may be external or internal and may be intentional or
unintentional, caused by humans, nature, or a combination of both.

It isn't a matter of if they will get in; it is when!

Today, it's as critical for SMBs to be able to respond and recover from
security breaches as it is to be able to prevent them. Cyber resilience
aims to give your organization a plan that will consider actions and
outcomes before, during, and after an event.

What are the benefits:

It improves your cyber-security posture

Reduces financial losses

Maintains the trust of customers

Protects your organization's reputation

Maintains the trust of vendors

Improves your cultural and internal processes

Maintains the trust of employees

How does cyber resilience work?

It is a strategy that [[is considered a preventive measure to counteract
human error and security weaknesses]{.underline}]{.mark} in hardware and
software. The overall purpose is to protect the organization while
understanding that there will likely be insecure parts, no matter how
robust security controls are.

The main components of your [[cyber reliance]{.underline}]{.mark}
strategy should [[include]{.underline}]{.mark}:

[[Threat protection]{.underline}]{.mark}: As security solutions advance,
so does the ability of the cyber-attackers to breach your system. What
were once state-of-the-art solutions are now the bare minimum
requirements to protect your SMB.

[[Recoverability]{.underline}]{.mark}: After a security incident,
whether internal or external, your organization must have the ability to
return to normal operations quickly.

[[Adaptability]{.underline}]{.mark}: Your organization must evolve and
adapt to new tactics that cyber-criminals deploy. Investing in
continuous security monitoring so your people can recognize security
issues in real-time and take immediate action is critical.

Resilience: Your organization's ability to effectively operate after a
security breach.

The six elements of a successful cyber resilience strategy

Identify

Includes the use of attack surface management, continuous monitoring to
identify irregularities and breaches before they cause any significant
damage

Protect

A good cyber resilience strategy protects your system, your
applications, and your data. You need to ensure that only authorized
users can access your system.

Detect:

You need the ability to detect when someone is trying to act maliciously
against your systems and can come externally or internally.

Respond

You also need to Developing an incident response plan, identifying roles
and responsibilities to ensure you can operate normally even after a
cyber-attack.

Recover

Ability to quickly store digital and technology platforms and adapt and
recover mission-critical systems to avoid disruption

Anticipate

You want to rely on automation, machine learning, and adaptive
cyber-threat detection to address future threats

A digital transformation mindset

Cyber resilience goes hand in hand with digital transformation. Both
require a similar way of thinking. Cyber resilience recognizes that the
outdated notion of SMBs having impenetrable defenses be abandoned. Cyber
resilience assumes that attackers will be successful, so measures must
be in place to prevent, respond, and recover from these attacks.

For those measures to be successful, cybersecurity needs to be
everybody's responsibility, and cyber best practices need to be inserted
into all aspects of the organization.

As the pandemic has changed all aspects of your business, it has
accelerated the need for digital transformation in SMBs. As digital
transformation has accelerated, so too have efforts to boost
cybersecurity. Businesses realize that cyber-resilience is critical if
they are to survive the effects of COVID.

Digital transformation requires a greater dependency on IT. Because SMBs
are more dependent on IT, they need strong cyber resiliency. Without it,
a business can't be confident of its ability to continue operations when
faced with increased cyber threats that accompany increased dependence
on IT.

Do you put cyber-security first?

Is cyber-security front and center of your strategies, or are you just
paying it lip service? Do you have a security-first culture, and does
your leadership put cyber resilience in the same "box" as operational
performance?

Like measuring your business's ROI and profitability, cyber-security and
cyber resilience must be a strategic priority that you track and
measure.

Closing thoughts:

[[Cyber resilience is an organization-wide strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}
that actively monitors threats, risks, and weak points. It is a
collaborative strategy that extends to everyone your company connects
with.

Organizations should keep in mind that [[cybersecurity is **not the same
as** cyber resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[When cybersecurity fails,
you must have a plan]{.underline}]{.mark} in place to assess the problem
and have the ability [[to recover quickly]{.underline}]{.mark} back to
pre-cyber-event status.

### Offensive Cyber Operations

#### Offensive Cyber Operations

Dennis **Miralis** "Offensive Cyberattacks and Operations"
<https://ngm.com.au/australia-offensive-cyber-capabilities/> NGM Defense
Lawyers and Advisors Accessed 23 June 2022 (jshock)

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's Cyber Lexicon project
defines offensive cyber operations as '**[[activities in cyberspace that
manipulate, deny, disrupt, degrade or destroy targeted computers,
information systems, or networks]{.underline}]{.mark}**'.

Offensive cyber operations could encompass a range of
[cybercrimes](https://ngm.com.au/cybercrime-lawyers/) including:

- Removing computer accounts or changing passwords;

- Altering databases either subtly or destructively;

- Defacing web pages;

- Encrypting or deleting data;

- Attacks that affect critical infrastructure, such as electricity
  networks.

By contrast, cyber espionage is designed to gather intelligence without
being detected.

While all of the programs previously mentioned are authorized under 22
U.S.C (Title 22), and are under the general control of the Department of
State (DoS), the Department of Defense (DoD) administers many of them.
**[[Title 10 U.S. Code Section 301 defines security cooperation programs
and activities of DoD as any program or interaction of U.S.C. with the
security establishment of a foreign country to build capabilities,
provide access or build relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As such,
many of the previously described FAA and AECA-authorized security
assistance programs administered by the DoD, in accordance with the
SAMM, fall under the broad definition of security cooperation. The
following is a categorization of programs, and a brief explanation,
based upon a partial list presented in the 2016 DoD Guidance for
Security Cooperation. For more detail on the different programs that can
be found under each category, access and download the Security
Cooperation Programs book found on the DSCU website or use the SC

Security cooperation (SC) encompasses all Department of Defense (DOD)
interactions, programs, and activities with foreign security forces
(FSF) and their institutions to build relationships that help promote US
interests; enable partner nations (PNs) to provide the US access to
territory, infrastructure, information, and resources; and/or to build
and apply their capacity and capabilities consistent with US defense
objectives. It includes, but is not limited to, military engagements
with foreign defense and security establishments (including those
governmental organizations that primarily perform disaster or emergency
response functions), DOD-administered security assistance (SA) programs,
combined exercises, international armaments cooperation, and information
sharing and collaboration.

SC uses a combination of programs and activities by which DOD, in
coordination with DOS, encourages and enables countries and
organizations to partner with the US to achieve strategic objectives. SC
involves an overarching functional relationship rather than a
hierarchical relationship with its associated activities/programs. The
definition of SC deliberately encompasses a multitude of actions,
programs, and missions. Many SC activities are functionally related and
dependent upon DOD-administered and DOS-funded SA as part of DOS foreign
assistance, in addition to Service funds.

a\. SC can be conducted across the range of military operations and
during all phases of an operation or campaign. DOD policy supports SC
activities that enable building security relationships, building partner
capacity, and gaining/maintaining access.

#### NATO Security Alliance 

**US Mission** "About NATO" <https://nato.usmission.gov/about-nato/> U.S
Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Accessed 23 June 2022
(jshock)

Formed in 1949 with the signing of the Washington Treaty, **[[NATO is a
security alliance of 30 countries from North America and
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO's **[[fundamental goal is to
safeguard the Allies' freedom and security by political and military
means]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO remains the principal security
instrument of the transatlantic community and expression of its common
democratic values. It is the practical means through which the security
of North America and Europe are permanently tied together. NATO
enlargement has furthered the U.S. goal of a Europe whole, free, and at
peace.

[Article 5 of the Washington
Treaty](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm)
 --- that an attack against one Ally is an attack against all --- is at
the core of the Alliance, a promise of collective defense. **[[Article 4
of the treaty ensures consultations among Allies on security matters of
common interest]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which have expanded from a
narrowly defined Soviet threat to the critical mission in Afghanistan,
as well as peacekeeping in Kosovo and **[[new threats to security such
as cyber attacks, and global threats such as terrorism and piracy that
affect the Alliance and its global network of
partners.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### NATO's Collective Military Power

<https://shape.nato.int/page11283634/knowing-nato/episodes/the-power-of-natos-military>
Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Accessed 23 June 2022 (jshock

Since 1949, NATO has increased its collective military power. Today
**[[it has the capability to count on nearly 3.5-million personnel,
troops and civilian combined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Each member
state agrees to contribute with different strategic weight and
influence.]{.underline}**

Allied Command Operations (ACO) led by Supreme Allied Commander Europe
(SACEUR), is responsible for executing all NATO operations and missions,
Deputy SACEUR coordinates troop contributions. When an operation or
mission ends, multinational forces return to their respective countries.

When the North Atlantic Council (NAC) decides to carry out an operation,
mission or exercise, NATO\'s military authorities propose a draft
concept of operations (called CONOPS) that presents the minimum request
of forces they are demanding in terms of equipment, work force and
resources. This process is called force generation.

**Increase requires pre-existence.**

**Brown, 2003** (US Federal Judge for the United States District Court
for the District of Oregon, Elena mark and paul Gustafson v. Valley
Insurance Company and Valley Property and Casualty, July 17, lexis)

FCRA does not define the term \"increase.\" [The]{.mark} plain and
[ordinary meaning of the verb \"to increase\" is to make something
greater]{.mark} or larger. 4 Merriam-Webster\'s \[\*\*22\] Collegiate
Dictionary 589 (10th ed. 1998). The \"something\" that is increased in
the statute is the \"charge for any insurance.\" The plain and common
meaning of the noun \"charge\" is \"the price demanded for something.\"
Id. at 192. Thus, the statute plainly means an insurer takes adverse
action if the insurer makes greater (i.e., larger) the price demanded
for insurance. [An insurer cannot \"make greater\" something that did
not exist previously]{.mark}. The statutory definition of adverse
action, therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an
initial charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase
that charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance \[\*\*23\] coverage at a lower
price.

**Previously existing.**

**American Heritage, 2010** (The American Heritage Dictionary of the
English Language, 4th edition, google)

[Augment]{.mark}; [usually applies to what is already developed]{.mark}
or well under way

**"Increase" requires evidence of the preexisting condition to determine
a net increase**

**Ripple 87** (Circuit Judge, Emmlee K. Cameron, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
Frances Slocum Bank & Trust Company, State Automobile Insurance
Association, and Glassley Agency of Whitley, Indiana,
Defendants-Appellees, 824 F.2d 570; 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 9816, 9/24,
lexis)

Also related to the waiver issue is appellees\' defense relying on a
provision of the insurance policy that suspends coverage where the risk
is increased by any means within the knowledge or control of the
insured. However, [the term \"increase\" connotes change. To show
change, appellees would have been required to present evidence of the
condition of the building at the time the policy was
issued]{.underline}. See 5 J. Appleman & J. Appleman, Insurance Law and
Practice, § 2941 at 4-5 (1970). [Because no such evidence was presented,
this court cannot determine]{.underline}, on this record, [whether the
risk has, in fact, been increased.]{.underline} Indeed, the answer to
this question may depend on Mr. Glassley\'s knowledge of the condition
of the building at the time the policy was issued, see 17 J. Appleman &
J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 9602 at 515-16 (1981), since
the fundamental issue is whether the appellees contemplated insuring the
risk which incurred the loss.

**[Doesn't require preexistence]{.underline}**

**One can increase from zero**

20a, 07, 76)

Increase: [Salary change of from zero to \$12,000 and \$1,200 annually

**Increase doesn't require pre-existence**

**Reinhardt, 2005** (U.S. Judge for the United States Court of Appeals
for the ninth circuit, Reynolds and Rausch v. Hartford Financial
Services Group, inc, lexis)

Specifically, we must decide whether charging a higher price for initial
insurance than the insured would otherwise have been charged because of
information in a consumer credit report constitutes an \"increase in any
charge\" within the meaning of FCRA. First, we examine the definitions
of \"increase\" and \"charge.\" Hartford Fire contends that, limited to
their ordinary definitions, these words apply only when a consumer has
previously been charged for insurance and that charge has thereafter
been increased by the insurer. The phrase, \"has previously been
charged,\" as used by Hartford, refers not only to a rate that the
consumer has previously paid for insurance but also to a rate that the
consumer has previously been quoted, even if that rate was increased
\[\*\*23\] before the consumer made any payment. Reynolds disagrees,
asserting that, [under]{.mark} \[\*1091\] [the ordinary definition of
the term, an increase]{.mark} [**in a charge also**]{.underline} [occurs
whenever]{.mark} [**an insurer charges**]{.underline} [a higher]{.mark}
[**rate**]{.underline} [than it would otherwise]{.mark} **[have charged
because of any factor]{.underline}**\--such as adverse credit
information, age, or driving record 8 \--[regardless of]{.mark}
**[whether the customer was]{.underline}** [previously]{.mark}
[**charged**]{.underline} [some]{.mark} [**other**]{.underline}
[rate]{.mark}. According to Reynolds, he was charged an increased rate
because of his credit rating when he was compelled to pay a rate higher
than the premium rate because he failed to obtain a high insurance
score. Thus, he argues, the definitions of \"increase\" and \"charge\"
encompass the insurance companies\' practice. Reynolds is correct.
["]{.underline}[Increase\" means to make something greater]{.mark}. See,
e.g., OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1989) (\"The action, process, or
fact of becoming or making greater; augmentation, growth, enlargement,
extension.\"); WEBSTER\'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN ENGLISH (3d
college ed. 1988) (defining \"increase\" as \"growth, enlargement,
etc\[.\]\"). \"Charge\" means the price demanded for goods or services.
See, e.g., OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1989) (\"The price required
or demanded for service rendered, or (less usually) for goods
supplied.\"); WEBSTER\'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN ENGLISH (3d
college ed. 1988) (\"The cost or price of an article, service, etc.\").
[Nothing in the definition of]{.mark} these words implies that the term
\"[increase]{.mark} in any charge for\" [should be limited to cases in
which]{.mark} a company [raises]{.mark} the rate that an individual has
[previously]{.mark} been charged.

### Limits Good 

#### Turns their offense---limits are vital to creativity and innovation 

David **Intrator** (President of The Creative Organization) October
21, **2010** "Thinking Inside the Box,"
http://www.trainingmag.com/article/thinking-inside-box  

One of the most pernicious myths about creativity, one that seriously
inhibits creative thinking and innovation, is the belief that one needs
to "think outside the box."  As someone who has worked for decades as a
professional creative, nothing could be further from the truth. This a
is view shared by the vast majority of creatives, expressed famously by
the modernist designer Charles Eames when he wrote, "Design depends
largely upon constraints."  The myth of thinking outside the box stems
from a fundamental misconception of what creativity is, and what it's
not.  In the popular imagination, creativity is something weird and
wacky. The creative process is magical, or divinely inspired.  But, in
fact, [creativity is]{.underline} not about divine inspiration or magic.
It's [about problem-solving, and by definition a problem is a
constraint]{.underline}, [a limit, a box.]{.underline} One of the best
illustrations of this is the work of photographers. They create by
excluding the great mass what's before them, choosing a small frame in
which to work. Within that tiny frame, literally a box, they uncover
relationships and establish priorities. [What makes creative
problem-solving uniquely challenging is that ]{.underline}you, as the
creator, are the one defining the problem. You're the one choosing the
frame. And you alone determine what's an effective solution. This can be
quite demanding, both intellectually and emotionally.
Intellectually, [you are required to **establish limits**]{.underline},
set priorities, and cull patterns and relationships from a great deal of
material, much of it fragmentary. More often than not, this is the
material you generated during brainstorming sessions. At the end of
these sessions, you're usually left with a big mess of ideas,
half-ideas, vague notions, and the like. Now, chances are you've had a
great time making your mess. You might have gone off-site, enjoyed a
"brainstorming camp," played a number of warm-up games. You feel
artistic and empowered. But [to be truly creative]{.underline}, you have
to clean up your mess, [organizing]{.underline} those [fragments into
something ]{.underline}real, something[ useful]{.underline}, something
that actually works.[ That's the hard part.]{.underline} It takes a lot
of energy, time, and willpower to make sense of the mess you've just
generated. It also can be emotionally difficult. You'll need to throw
out many ideas you originally thought were great, ideas you've become
attached to, because they simply don't fit into the rules you're
creating as you build your box. 

### Procedural Fairness 

#### Reasonable semblances of procedural fairness [are absolutely]{.underline} [achievable]{.underline} for all players in the debate-game model to incentivize prep and clash 

**Rodriguez, 2006**- media theory professor at the City University of
Hong Kong with a PhD from NYU (Hector Rodriguez, December 2006, "The
Playful and the Serious: An approximation to Huizinga\'s Homo Ludens,"
published in Game Studies, vol. 6 issue 1, fg) 

There is a core feature of playing that offers a huge potential for
serious game designers. According to Huizinga, [the consciousness of
play as a separate and self-contained sphere
is]{.underline} often [reinforced by
the]{.underline} pervasive [tendency to enclose the players within a
spatiotemporal frame, the]{.underline} so-called [\"magic
circle\", which isolates their game from]{.underline} the [more serious
tasks of daily living.]{.underline} The separation often consists in a
literal physical precinct: a chessboard, ring, arena, field, stadium,
stage, altar, etc. There are also sharp temporal boundaries, a clear
beginning and an end, which clearly mark the game off as a temporary
interruption of ordinary life. [The game unfolds within a temporarily
closed world.]{.underline} Moreover, [the existence of the magic circle
is ]{.underline}closely [related to the existence of artificial rules or
conventions that hold only within this
enclosure.]{.underline}\[4\] [Higher cultural
forms]{.underline} also [unfold within a magic circle.]{.underline} The
temple or sacred area, for instance, provides a self-contained enclosure
for the performance of religious ceremonies in accordance with strictly
codified regulations. Many other cultural practices, such as initiation
rites, require the demarcation of a special place characterized by
temporary norms of behaviour that hold only for the duration of the
ceremony. The boundaries of the playing field mark off the arena wherein
the special rules of the game hold absolutely. These rules often
generate ideal
conditions. [Playful competition]{.underline} often [requires]{.underline},
for instance, [that all players be given an equal chance at the
outset.]{.underline} Two chess players always receive the same amount of
pieces in the beginning of the game, to avoid favouring one player at
the expense of another. [While perfect equality may be difficult to
achieve in practice, competitive games establish artificial conditions
designed to neutralize potential sources of unfairness from the
outset.]{.underline} Thus questions of ethics lie at the heart of many
forms of play. Huizinga himself asserts that gaming often has an ethical
import, and so tends to acquire at least a touch of seriousness. To play
is in many instances to test the player\'s strength, intelligence,
effort, persistence, manual dexterity, spatial reasoning and so forth.
The idea of fair play also suggests an element of moral evaluation at
the heart of many games. Huizinga clearly recognizes the presence of
this ethical element, which strongly implies that the demarcation of
play from obligation is not absolute. The institution of the magic
circle is a core element in the ideal of an ordered life ruled by
agreed-upon conventions, which lies at the heart of human society.

### Limits -- Iterative testing

#### A well-defined resolution is critical to allow the neg to refute the aff in an in-depth fashion\-\--this process of negation produces [iterative testing and improvement]{.underline}, where we learn to improve our arguments based on our opponents' arguments. This process does [not]{.underline} proscribe particular styles or forms of argument, but [does]{.underline} require a common point of disagreement around which arguments can be organized. 

**Poscher 16** -- Director at the Institute for Staatswissenschaft and
Philosophy of Law at the University of Freiburg (Ralf, "Why We Argue
About the Law: An Agonistic Account of Legal Disagreement",
Metaphilosophy of Law, Tomasz Gizbert-Studnicki/Adam Dyrda/Pawel Banas
(eds.), Hart Publishing, forthcoming) 

Hegel's dialectical thinking powerfully exploits [the idea of
negation]{.underline}.
It [is]{.underline} a [central]{.underline} feature of spirit and
consciousness that they have the power to negate. The spirit "is this
power only by looking the negative in the face and tarrying with it.
This \[...\] is the magical power that converts it into being."102 The
tarrying with the negative is part of what Hegel calls [the "labour of
the negative"]{.underline}103. In a loose reference to this Hegelian
notion Gerald Postema [points to]{.underline} yet another feature
of [disagreements as a necessary ingredient of the process of practical
reasoning. Only if our reasoning is exposed to contrary
arguments can we test its merits. We must go through the "labor of the
negative" to have trust in our deliberative processes]{.underline}.104
This also holds where we seem to be in agreement. [Agreement without
exposure to disagreement can be deceptive]{.underline} in various
ways. [The first phenomenon]{.underline} Postema draws attention
to [is]{.underline} the [group polarization]{.underline} effect. When a
group of like‐minded people deliberates an issue, informational and
reputational cascades produce more extreme views in the process of their
deliberations.105 [The polarization and biases that are well documented
for such groups]{.underline}106 [can be countered]{.underline} at least
in some settings [by the inclusion of dissenting voices]{.underline}. In
these scenarios, [disagreement can be
a cure for dysfunctional deliberative polarization and
biases]{.underline}.107 [A
second]{.underline} deliberative [dysfunction]{.underline} mitigated by
disagreement [is superficial agreement]{.underline}, which can even be
manipulatively used in the sense of a "presumptuous
'We'"108. [Disagreement can help]{.underline} to police such distortions
of deliberative processes [by challenging superficial
agreements]{.underline}. Disagreements may thus signal that a
deliberative process is not contaminated with dysfunctional agreements
stemming from polarization or superficiality. [Protecting our discourse
against such contaminations is valuable even if we do not come to terms.
Each of the opposing positions will profit from the catharsis it
received "by looking the negative in the face and tarrying with
it".]{.underline} These advantages of disagreement in collective
deliberations are mirrored on the individual level. [Even if the
probability of reaching a consensus with our opponents is very low from
the beginning]{.underline}, as might be the case in deeply entrenched
conflicts, [entering into an exchange of arguments can still serve
to test and improve our position. We have to do the "labor of the
negative" for ourselves. Even if we cannot come up with a line of
argument that coheres well
with everybody else's beliefs]{.underline}, attitudes and
dispositions, [we can still come up with a line of argument that
achieves this goal for our own personal beliefs]{.underline}, attitudes
and dispositions. To provide ourselves with the most coherent system of
our own beliefs, attitudes and dispositions is -- at least in important
issues -- an aspect of personal integrity -- to borrow one of Dworkin's
favorite expressions for a less aspirational idea. [In hard cases we
must]{.underline} -- in some way -- [lay out the argument for ourselves
to figure out what we believe to be the right answer. We might not know
what we believe ourselves]{.underline} in questions of abortion, the
death penalty, torture, and stem cell research, [until we have developed
a line of argu]{.underline}m[ent against the background
of our subjective beliefs, attitudes and dispositions]{.underline}. In
these cases [it might be rational to discuss the issue with
someone unlikely to share some of our more fundamental convictions
or who opposes the view towards which we lean. This might even be the
most helpful way of corroborating a view, because we know that our
adversary is much more motivated to find a potential flaw in our
argument than someone with whom we know we are in
agreement]{.underline}. It might be more helpful to discuss a liberal
position with Scalia than with Breyer if we want to make sure that we
have not overlooked some counter‐argument to our case. [It would be too
narrow an understanding of our practice
of]{.underline} legal [disagreement and argumentation if we restricted
its purpose to persuading an adversary in the case at hand and inferred
from this narrow understanding the irrationality of argumentation in
hard cases]{.underline}, in which we know beforehand that we will not be
able to persuade. Rational argumentation is a much more complex practice
in a more complex social framework. [Argumentation with an adversary can
have purposes beyond persuading]{.underline} him: [to test one's own
convictions, to engage our opponent in inferential commitments and to
persuade third parties are only some of these; to rally our troops or
express our convictions might be others]{.underline}. To make our peace
with Kant we could say that "there must be a hope of coming to terms"
with someone though not necessarily with our opponent, but maybe only a
third party or even just ourselves and not necessarily only on the issue
at hand, but maybe through inferential commitments in a different arena.
f) The Advantage Over Non‐Argumentative Alternatives It goes without
saying that in real world legal disagreements, all of the reasons listed
above usually play in concert and will typically hold true to different
degrees relative to different participants in the debate: There will be
some participants for whom our hope of coming to terms might still be
justified and others for whom only some of the other reasons hold and
some for whom it is a mixture of all of the reasons in shifting degrees
as our disagreements evolve. It is also apparent that, with the
exception of the first reason, [the rationality of our disagreements is
of a secondary nature. The rational does not lie in the discovery of
a single right answer to the topic of debate]{.underline}, since in hard
cases there are no single right answers. Instead, [our disagreements are
instrumental to rationales which lie beyond the topic at
hand, ]{.underline}like the exploration of our communalities or of our
inferential commitments. Since these reasons are of this secondary
nature, they must stand up to alternative ways of settling
irreconcilable disagreements that have other secondary reasons in their
favor -- like swiftness of decision making or using fewer
resources. [Why does our legal practice require lengthy arguments and
discursive efforts]{.underline} even in appellate or supreme court cases
of irreconcilable legal disagreements? [The closure has to come by some
non‐argumentative mean]{.underline} and courts have always relied on
them. For the medieval courts of the Germanic tradition it is bequeathed
that judges had to fight it out literally if they disagreed on a
question of law -- though the king allowed them to pick surrogate
fighters.109 It is understandable that the process of civilization has
led us to non‐violent non‐ argumentative means to determine the law.
But [what was wrong with]{.underline} District Judge Currin of Umatilla
County in Oregon, who -- in his late days -- decided inconclusive
traffic violations by publicly [flipping a coin]{.underline}?110 If we
are counting heads at the end of our lengthy argumentative proceedings
anyway, [why not decide hard cases by gut voting at the outset and spare
everybody the cost of developing elaborate arguments on questions, where
there is not fact of the matter to be discovered?]{.underline} One
reason lies in the mixed nature of our reasons in actual legal
disagreements. The different second order reasons can be held apart
analytically, but not in real life cases. The hope of coming to terms
will often play a role at least for some time relative to some
participants in the debate. A second reason is
that [the objectives listed above could not be achieved by a
non‐argumentative procedure]{.underline}. Flipping a coin, throwing dice
or [taking a gut vote would not help us to explore our
communalities or our inferential commitments nor help to scrutinize the
positions in play]{.underline}. A third reason is the overall rational
aspiration of the law that Dworkin relates to in his integrity
account111. In a justificatory sense112 [the law aspires to give a
coherent account of itself -- even if it is not the only right one --
required by equal respect under conditions of normative
disagreement]{.underline}.113 [Combining legal argumentation with the
non‐argumentative decision‐ making procedure of counting reasoned
opinions serves the coherence aspiration of the law]{.underline} in at
least two ways: First, [the labor of the negative reduces the chances
that constructions of the law that have major flaws or inconsistencies
built into the arguments supporting them will prevail]{.underline}.
Second, [since every position must be a reasoned one within the given
framework of the law, it must be one that somehow fits into the overall
structure of the law along coherent lines. It thus protects against
incoherent "checkerboard" treatments]{.underline}114 [of hard cases. It
is the combination of reasoned disagreement and the non‐rational
decision‐making mechanism of counting reasoned opinions that provides
for both in hard cases]{.underline}: a decision and one -- of multiple
possible -- coherent constructions of the law. [Pure non‐rational
procedures]{.underline} -- like flipping a coin -- [would only provide
for the decision part. Pure argumentative procedures -- which are not
geared towards a decision procedure -- would undercut the incentive
structure of our agonistic disagreements]{.underline}.115 In the face of
unresolvable disagreements endless debates would seem an idle
enterprise. [That the debates
are about winning or losing helps to keep the participants engaged. That
the decision depends on counting reasoned opinions guarantees that the
engagement focuses on rational argumentation]{.underline}. No plain
non‐argumentative procedure would achieve this
result. [If the judges were to flip a coin]{.underline} at the end of
the trial in hard cases, [there would be little incentive to engage in
an exchange of arguments. It is specifically the count of reasoned
opinions which provides for rational scrutiny in our legal
disagreements]{.underline} and thus contributes to the rationales
discussed above. 2. THE SEMANTICS OF AGONISTIC DISAGREEMENTS The
agonistic account does not presuppose a fact of the matter, it is not
accompanied by an ontological commitment, and the question of how the
fact of the matter could be known to us is not even raised. Thus [the
agonistic account]{.underline} of legal disagreement is not confronted
with the metaphysical or epistemological questions that plague
one‐right‐answer theories in particular. However,
it [must]{.underline} still [come up with a semantics that explains in
what sense we disagree about the same issue and are not just talking at
cross purposes]{.underline}. In a series of articles David Plunkett and
Tim Sundell have reconstructed legal disagreements in semantic terms as
metalinguistic negotiations on the usage of a term that at the center of
a hard case like "cruel and unusual punishment" in a death‐penalty
case.116 [Even though the different sides in the debate define the term
differently, they are not talking past each other, since they are
engaged in]{.underline} a metalinguistic [negotiation
on]{.underline} the use of [the same term.]{.underline} The
metalinguistic negotiation on the use of [the term serves as a semantic
anchor for a disagreement on the substantive
issues]{.underline} connected with the term because of its functional
role in the law. The "cruel and unusual punishment"‐clause thus serves
to argue about the permissibility of the death penalty. This account,
however only provides a very superficial semantic commonality. But the
commonality between the participants of a legal disagreement go deeper
than a discussion whether the term "bank" should in future only to be
used for financial institutions, which fulfills every criteria for
semantic negotiations that Plunkett and Sundell propose. Unlike in mere
semantic negotiations, like the on the disambiguation of the term
"bank", there is also some kind of identity of the substantive issues at
stake in legal disagreements. A promising route to capture this aspect
of legal disagreements might be offered by recent semantic approaches
that try to accommodate the externalist challenges of realist
semantics,117 which inspire one‐right‐answer theorists like Moore or
David Brink. Neo‐ descriptivist and two‐valued semantics provide for the
theoretical or interpretive element of realist semantics without having
to commit to the ontological positions of traditional externalism. In a
sense they offer externalist semantics with no ontological strings
attached. The less controversial aspect of the externalist picture of
meaning developed in neo‐ descriptivist and two‐valued semantics can be
found in the deferential structure that our meaning‐providing intentions
often encompass.118 In the case of natural kinds, speakers defer to the
expertise of chemists when they employ natural kind terms like gold or
water. If a speaker orders someone to buy \$ 10,000 worth of gold as a
safe investment, he might not know the exact atomic structure of the
chemical element 79. In cases of doubt, though, he would insist that he
meant to buy only stuff that chemical experts -- or the markets for that
matter -- qualify as gold. The deferential element in the speaker's
intentions provides for the specific externalist element of the
semantics. In the case of the law, the meaning‐providing intentions
connected to the provisions of the law can be understood to defer in a
similar manner to the best overall theory or interpretation of the legal
materials. Against the background of such a semantic framework the
conceptual unity of a linguistic practice is not ratified by the
existence of a single best answer, but by the unity of the interpretive
effort that extends to legal materials and legal practices that have
sufficient overlap119 -- be it only in a historical perspective120. [The
fulcrum of disagreement]{.underline} that Dworkin sees in the existence
of a single right answer121 [does not lie in its existence, but in the
communality of the effort -- if only on the basis of an overlapping
common ground of legal materials, accepted practices, experiences and
dispositions. As two athletes are engaged in the same contest when they
follow the same rules, share the same concept of winning and losing and
act in the same context, but follow very different
styles]{.underline} of e.g. wrestling, boxing, swimming etc. [They are
in the same contest, even if there is no single best
style]{.underline} in which to wrestle, box or swim. [Each]{.underline},
however, [is engaged in developing the best style to win against their
opponent, just as two lawyers try to develop the best argument to
convince]{.underline} a bench of [judges]{.underline}.122 [Within such a
semantic framework even people with radically opposing views about the
application of an expression can still share a concept, in that they are
engaged in the same process of theorizing over roughly the same legal
materials and practices]{.underline}. [Semantic frameworks along these
lines allow for adamant disagreements without abandoning the idea that
people are talking about the same concept]{.underline}. [An
agonistic]{.underline} account of legal disagreement can build on such a
semantic [framework]{.underline}, which [can explain in what
sense]{.underline} lawyers, judges
and [scholars engaged in agonistic disagreements are not talking past
each other. They are engaged in developing the best interpretation of
roughly the same]{.underline} legal [materials, albeit against the
background of diverging beliefs, attitudes and dispositions that lead
them to divergent conclusions]{.underline} in hard cases. Despite the
divergent conclusions, [semantic unity is provided by the largely
overlapping legal materials that form the basis
for their disagreement. Such a semantic collapses only when we lack a
sufficient overlap in the materials]{.underline}. To use an example of
Michael Moore's: If we wanted to debate whether a certain work of art
was "just", we share neither paradigms nor a tradition of applying the
concept of justice to art such as to engage in an intelligible
controversy.

Cyber resilience vs. cyber security

[[The difference between cyber security and cyber-resilience comes down
to the expected outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark} of each.

[[Cyber security]{.underline}]{.mark}: Is a component of cyber
resilience and consists of technology processes and measures to protect
networks, systems, and sensitive data from cyber attacks. Effective
cyber-security [[reduces the chances of cyber
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} and protects your organization from
external and internal assaults.

[[Cyber resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}: It reflects the fact that SMB
technology systems will always have flaws and weaknesses that are
exploitable. It [[has a much bigger scope]{.underline}]{.mark} and
includes cyber security and business resilience. Cyber resilience
focuses on instances when your company is disrupted by things like power
outages, weather emergencies, and human error. This concept helps SMBs
prepare, prevent, respond, and successfully recover to pre-event
business levels and processes.

Why cyber resilience?

Because traditional cybersecurity measures for SMBs are just not enough.

The truth is, harmful cyber events negatively impact SMBs every day.
These events may be external or internal and may be intentional or
unintentional, caused by humans, nature, or a combination of both.

It isn't a matter of if they will get in; it is when!

Today, it's as critical for SMBs to be able to respond and recover from
security breaches as it is to be able to prevent them. Cyber resilience
aims to give your organization a plan that will consider actions and
outcomes before, during, and after an event.

What are the benefits:

It improves your cyber-security posture

Reduces financial losses

Maintains the trust of customers

Protects your organization's reputation

Maintains the trust of vendors

Improves your cultural and internal processes

Maintains the trust of employees

How does cyber resilience work?

It is a strategy that [[is considered a preventive measure to counteract
human error and security weaknesses]{.underline}]{.mark} in hardware and
software. The overall purpose is to protect the organization while
understanding that there will likely be insecure parts, no matter how
robust security controls are.

The main components of your [[cyber reliance]{.underline}]{.mark}
strategy should [[include]{.underline}]{.mark}:

[[Threat protection]{.underline}]{.mark}: As security solutions advance,
so does the ability of the cyber-attackers to breach your system. What
were once state-of-the-art solutions are now the bare minimum
requirements to protect your SMB.

[[Recoverability]{.underline}]{.mark}: After a security incident,
whether internal or external, your organization must have the ability to
return to normal operations quickly.

[[Adaptability]{.underline}]{.mark}: Your organization must evolve and
adapt to new tactics that cyber-criminals deploy. Investing in
continuous security monitoring so your people can recognize security
issues in real-time and take immediate action is critical.

Resilience: Your organization's ability to effectively operate after a
security breach.

The six elements of a successful cyber resilience strategy

Identify

Includes the use of attack surface management, continuous monitoring to
identify irregularities and breaches before they cause any significant
damage

Protect

A good cyber resilience strategy protects your system, your
applications, and your data. You need to ensure that only authorized
users can access your system.

Detect:

You need the ability to detect when someone is trying to act maliciously
against your systems and can come externally or internally.

Respond

You also need to Developing an incident response plan, identifying roles
and responsibilities to ensure you can operate normally even after a
cyber-attack.

Recover

Ability to quickly store digital and technology platforms and adapt and
recover mission-critical systems to avoid disruption

Anticipate

You want to rely on automation, machine learning, and adaptive
cyber-threat detection to address future threats

A digital transformation mindset

Cyber resilience goes hand in hand with digital transformation. Both
require a similar way of thinking. Cyber resilience recognizes that the
outdated notion of SMBs having impenetrable defenses be abandoned. Cyber
resilience assumes that attackers will be successful, so measures must
be in place to prevent, respond, and recover from these attacks.

For those measures to be successful, cybersecurity needs to be
everybody's responsibility, and cyber best practices need to be inserted
into all aspects of the organization.

As the pandemic has changed all aspects of your business, it has
accelerated the need for digital transformation in SMBs. As digital
transformation has accelerated, so too have efforts to boost
cybersecurity. Businesses realize that cyber-resilience is critical if
they are to survive the effects of COVID.

Digital transformation requires a greater dependency on IT. Because SMBs
are more dependent on IT, they need strong cyber resiliency. Without it,
a business can't be confident of its ability to continue operations when
faced with increased cyber threats that accompany increased dependence
on IT.

Do you put cyber-security first?

Is cyber-security front and center of your strategies, or are you just
paying it lip service? Do you have a security-first culture, and does
your leadership put cyber resilience in the same "box" as operational
performance?

Like measuring your business's ROI and profitability, cyber-security and
cyber resilience must be a strategic priority that you track and
measure.

Closing thoughts:

[[Cyber resilience is an organization-wide strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}
that actively monitors threats, risks, and weak points. It is a
collaborative strategy that extends to everyone your company connects
with.

Organizations should keep in mind that [[cybersecurity is **not the same
as** cyber resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[When cybersecurity fails,
you must have a plan]{.underline}]{.mark} in place to assess the problem
and have the ability [[to recover quickly]{.underline}]{.mark} back to
pre-cyber-event status.

As panic surrounding job loss due to artificial intelligence reaches new
levels, experts have clarified that [[AI will not take away jobs from
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}. Experts revealed that [[artificial
intelligence is actually **supplementing** human
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} all across the spectrum, and it will
actually make the life of humans easy.

In a recent post written on Science Focus, [[Dr Peter
Bentley]{.underline}]{.mark}, a British author and computer scientist
based at University College London [[revealed that artificial
intelligence is **not the same** as factory automation or
robots]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bentley believes that AI is very similar to
the internet, and [[it is basically an **enabling
technology**]{.underline}]{.mark} which creates new jobs in various
industries.

#### B The plan increase security cooperation in the field of robotic technology

#### C. Standards.

#### 1. Limits- Robots do thousands of tasks without developing the capacity to learn -- the plan's precedent makes any mechanical or industrial process topical.

#### 2. Core NEG ground- the NEG should be able to get links related to autonomous machine learning policy, but those links don't apply to old school robotics.

#### D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and iterative testing.

### Substantially 80%

#### A. "Substantially\" means 80 to 90%---government definitions prove.

**Curtin, 2003** (John T. Curtin, Judge, United States District Court
for the Western District of New York, Gateway Equipment Corp. -vs-
United States of America, United States District Court for the Western
District of New York, lexis)

#### B. The plan names a subset under bio/cyber/AI -- far less than the whole category

#### C. Standards.

#### 1. Limits- Allowing minor aff means cases can be about any desk or program in NATO -- some have under 100 people assigned. The number of small tweaks is infinite.

#### 2. Core NEG ground- the NEG should be get DA links from NATO dramatically increasing its security cooperation, not limited to links specific to the aff's content.

#### D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and iterative testing.

### Increase (previously existing 1NC)

#### A. Increase requires making something previously existing greater.

**Buckley et al., 2006** (Jeremiah, attorney, Amicus Curiae Brief,
Safeco Ins. Co. of America et al v. Charles Burr et al., google)

#### B. Violation: the AFF creates a NEW form of security cooperation -- it doesn't exist now

#### C. Standards.

#### 1. Limits- previously existing forms of assistance create a stable, finite literature base, which increases argument depth and clash. New forms of security cooperation could include new enemies, new NATO members, new non-geopolitical threats, or new solutions to any known problem.

#### 2. Core NEG ground- the NEG should be able to reform current programs, to test the word "increase" in the resolution. These CPs are key to topic education and specific NEG strategy.

#### D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and iterative testing.
