reading is broadly in line with economists' expectations in a poll by

drama in Washington and ahead of further debt ceiling negotiations. CEOs
say it's the uncertainty of the situation more than specific issues that
is driving their forecast down, although the list of concerns they
shared continues to grow each month. Among those: market volatility, a
chaotic geopolitical scene, uncontrolled inflation, record-high oil
prices, and continued labor and supply chain shortages are all adding to
the mix fueling doubts over the future. "The economy runs on oil, and
until we get more, things are not getting better," said Darrel Box, CEO
at Lafayette Regional Health Center in Lexington, Missouri, who also
lists labor and supply costs and shortages as reasons for his 4 out of
10 rating of business conditions 12 months from now (considered "Weak"
according to our 10-point scale points). "Supply chain issues remain and
do not seem to be getting any better," said the CEO of an electronic
component manufacturer participating in the poll. "Finding people is
another major problem, so even if we find the parts, we will still have
issues executing."

considered strong by multiple measurements, 56% of small-business owners
say the economy has worsened since January this year. As small
businesses grapple with inflation -- it\'s adding to other challenges
they\'re already facing. At the top of the list, hiring and retaining
qualified workers remains the top challenge cited by small-business
owners, the survey found, as job openings remain near a record high with
more than 11 million as of the end of February

[[The economic and financial fallout from the war]{.mark}, and the

benchmark---will strongly affect U.S. crude oil (West Texas
Intermediate) prices. Yes, the U.S. is now a minor net energy exporter;
however, the macro-distribution of the shock will be negative. While a
small cohort of energy firms will reap higher profits, households and
[[businesses will experience a massive price shock]{.underline}]{.mark},
leading them to reduce spending. Given these dynamics, [even an

Commentators make the constant mistake of saying the ANZ survey is a
business confidence survey. The same applies to the NZIER's QSBO. They
are surveys of business views across an array of key indicators
including prospects for growth, hiring, whether firms are planning to
invest and experiences with inflation / costs. These indicators matter.
Business confidence is one question.

The so-called "soft" or "perception" indicators are the hard data of
tomorrow. They are estimates and view based but you can't ignore them.
They are well correlated with growth.

In a perfect world we'd have timely "hard" official data and statistics.
We don't. Official data comes with a lag. So, we need to rely on
sentiment-based indicators if we want timely readings on the economy and
a guide as to the year ahead.

The likes of the ANZ survey are showing a sombre mood when it comes to
indicators that matter. The ANZ survey asks key questions about
activity, employment, investment and profitability. When these
indicators head to zero, which they have done now, growth can do the
same. Those indicators were weak in 2000 during the so-called winter of
discontent -- and growth slowed to 0.9% year on year.

Growth did rebound. But back then the economy was early in the economic
expansion. The economy is late in the business cycle this time around.
The [economy]{.underline} has [[tend]{.mark}ed [to go through
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ten-year cycle]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [so
businesses are]{.underline} **[naturally]{.underline}**
[looking]{.underline} more [nervously over their shoulders]{.underline}
at present. The [economy is going [through]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[substantial]{.underline}**]{.mark} [economic
[change]{.mark}]{.underline} too [and businesses are]{.underline}
**[wary]{.underline}**. There is little argument over the need to change
the economy. However, there are serious questions about the actual
economic plan and what the new economy looks like. That is a key issue
that needs addressed.

Some of the [[weakness in]{.underline} **[survey]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[measure[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** could [be [put down to the
way]{.mark} survey [questions are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[phrased]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Firms are asked their view and given
three options; will conditions improve, stay the same, or worsen. For a
lot of firms' things are damned good. It's telling that finding skilled
staff is the biggest problem firms are facing. Businesses are facing
capacity constraints. So, zero readings may reflect a levelling out at a
high base.

### Econ defense

#### No Econ Impact 

**Walt 20** -- Stephen M, the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University. "Will a Global Depression
Trigger Another World War?", Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
05-13-2020

One familiar argument is [the]{.underline} so-called
**[[diversionary]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or "scapegoat") [theory of
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [suggests]{.underline} that
[leaders]{.underline} who are worried about their popularity at home
[will]{.underline} try to **[divert attention]{.underline}** from their
failures [by **provoking a crisis**]{.underline} with a foreign power
and maybe even using force against it. Drawing on this logic,
[some]{.underline} Americans now [worry]{.underline} that President
Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [will decide to **attack**]{.underline} a
country like [**Iran** or **Venezuela**]{.underline} in the run-up to
the presidential election and especially if he thinks he's likely to
lose. [This]{.underline} outcome [[strikes me as **unlikely**, even if
one ignores]{.mark} the **logical** and **[empirical flaws]{.mark}** in
the theory **itself**. War is **always a gamble**, and should things go
**badly**---even a **little bit**---it would **hammer the last nail** in
the **coffin** of **Trump's declining fortunes**]{.underline}. Moreover,
none of the countries Trump might consider going after pose an imminent
threat to U.S. security, and even [his **staunchest supporters** may
wonder why he is **wasting time** and **money** going after Iran or
Venezuela]{.underline} at a moment [when **thousands of Americans** are
**dying preventable deaths**]{.underline} at home. [Even a successful
military action won't **put Americans back to work**]{.underline},
[create]{.underline} the sort of **[testing-and-tracing]{.underline}**
regime that competent governments around the world have been able to
implement already, [or **hasten**]{.underline} the development [of a
**vaccine**]{.underline}. [The **same logic** is likely to guide the
decisions of **other world leaders** too.]{.underline} Another familiar
folk theory is "military Keynesianism." War generates a lot of economic
demand, and it can sometimes lift depressed economies out of the
doldrums and back toward prosperity and full employment. The obvious
case in point here is World War II, which did help the U.S economy
finally escape the quicksand of the Great Depression. Those who are
convinced that great powers go to war primarily to keep Big Business (or
the arms industry) happy are naturally drawn to this sort of argument,
and they might worry that governments looking at bleak economic
forecasts will try to restart their economies through some sort of
military adventure. I doubt it. [It takes a **really big war** to
generate a **significant stimulus**]{.underline}, and [[it is hard to
imagine]{.mark} any country launching [a]{.mark} **[large-scale
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}---with all its attendant risks---at a moment
[[when **debt levels** are]{.mark} **already
[soaring]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More importantly, [[there are
lots]{.mark} of **[easier]{.mark}** and more **direct [ways]{.mark}**
[to **stimulate the economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}---infrastructure
spending, unemployment insurance, even "helicopter payments"---and
[**launching a war** has to be one of the least **efficient methods
available**]{.underline}. The threat of war usually spooks investors
too, which any politician with their eye on the stock market would be
loath to do. Economic [[downturns can encourage war in]{.mark} some
**[special circumstances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially when a war
would enable a country facing severe hardships to capture something of
immediate and significant value. Saddam Hussein's decision to seize
Kuwait in 1990 fits this model perfectly: The Iraqi economy was in
terrible shape after its long war with Iran; unemployment was
threatening Saddam's domestic position; Kuwait's vast oil riches were a
considerable prize; and seizing the lightly armed emirate was
exceedingly easy to do. Iraq also owed Kuwait a lot of money, and a
hostile takeover by Baghdad would wipe those debts off the books
overnight. In this case, Iraq's parlous economic condition clearly made
war more likely. Yet [I cannot think of **any country** in **similar
circumstances today**. Now is **hardly the time** for **Russia** to try
to **grab**]{.underline} more of **[Ukraine]{.underline}**---[if it even
**wanted** to]{.underline}---[or for China to **make a play for
Taiwan**]{.underline}, [because the **costs** of doing so would
**clearly outweigh the economic benefits**]{.underline}. [Even
conquering an **oil-rich country**]{.underline}---the sort of greedy
acquisitiveness that Trump occasionally hints at---[**doesn't look
attractive** when there's a **vast glut on the market**]{.underline}. I
might be worried if some weak and defenseless country somehow came to
possess the entire global stock of a successful coronavirus vaccine, but
that scenario is not even remotely possible. If one takes a longer-term
perspective, however, a sustained economic depression could make war
more likely by strengthening fascist or xenophobic political movements,
fueling protectionism and hypernationalism, and making it more difficult
for countries to reach mutually acceptable bargains with each other. The
history of the 1930s shows where such trends can lead, although the
economic effects of the Depression are hardly the only reason world
politics took such a deadly turn in the 1930s. Nationalism, xenophobia,
and authoritarian rule were making a comeback well before COVID-19
struck, but the economic misery now occurring in every corner of the
world could intensify these trends and leave us in a more war-prone
condition when fear of the virus has diminished. **[On
balance]{.underline}**, however, [I do not think that even]{.underline}
the **[extraordinary economic conditions]{.underline}** we are
witnessing today are going to [have **much impact** on the **likelihood
of war**]{.underline}. Why? First of all, [if depressions **were** a
**powerful cause of war**, there would be a **lot more** of the
**latter**]{.underline}. To take one example, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has suffered
**40**]{.mark} **or more [recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the
country was founded, [[yet]{.mark} it has [fought]{.mark} perhaps
[20]{.mark} interstate [wars]{.mark}, most of them **[unrelated
to]{.mark} the state of [the economy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To
paraphrase the economist Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock
market, [if recessions were a **powerful cause of war,** they would have
predicted "**nine out of the last five** (or fewer)."]{.underline}
Second, [[states **do not start wars** unless they believe they will win
a **quick** and]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively **[[cheap
victory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As John Mearsheimer showed in his
classic book Conventional Deterrence, [national leaders **avoid** war
when they are convinced it will be **long, bloody, costly**, and
**uncertain**]{.underline}. To choose war, political leaders have to
convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive
victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost. [**Europe** went
to war in **1914**]{.underline} [with each side believing it would win a
**rapid and easy victory**]{.underline}, and Nazi Germany developed the
strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as quickly and
cheaply as possible. [**Iraq** attacked **Iran** in 1980]{.underline}
[because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in **disarray** and
would be **easy to defeat**]{.underline}, and George W. [Bush **invaded
Iraq** in 2003 convinced the war would be **short, successful**, and
**pay for itself.** The fact that each of these leaders **miscalculated
badly** does not alter the **main point**: **No matter** what a
country's **economic condition** might be, its leaders **will not go to
war** unless they think they can do so **quickly, cheaply**, and with a
**reasonable probability of success.**]{.underline} Third, and most
important, [[the]{.mark} primary [**motivation** for]{.mark} most [wars
is]{.mark} the desire for **[security]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[not
**economic gain**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For this reason, the odds of war
increase when states believe the long-term balance of power may be
shifting against them, when they are convinced that adversaries are
unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when they are
confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish a secure
position if they act now. The historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that
"[**every war** between **Great Powers**]{.underline} \[between 1848 and
1918\] ... [started as a **preventive** war, not as a **war of
conquest**]{.underline}," and [that **remains true**]{.underline} of
most wars fought since then. The bottom line: **[Economic
conditions]{.underline}** (i.e., a depression) may affect the broader
political environment in which decisions for war or peace are made, but
they [are only **one factor among many** and **rarely** the most
significant]{.underline}. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic has large,
lasting, and negative effects on the world economy---as seems quite
likely---it is not likely to affect the probability of war very much,
especially in the short term. To be sure, I can't rule out another
powerful cause of war---stupidity---especially when it is so much in
evidence in some quarters these days. So there is no guarantee that we
won't see misguided leaders stumbling into another foolish bloodletting.
But given that it's hard to find any rays of sunshine at this particular
moment in history, I'm going to hope I'm right about this one.

[on]{.mark} the [macro variables]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The

on geopolitical risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nonetheless, in Section
A.4 in the Appendix we explore robustness to an alternative Cholesky
ordering, as well as to alternative specifications of the baseline VAR
model.

The solid lines in Figure 9 show the median impulse responses to an
exogenous increase in the GPR index of 167 points, while the light- and
dark-shaded areas represent the corresponding 68 percent and 90 percent
pointwise credible bands, respectively. The size of the shock equals the
average change in the index following the nine episodes of largest
increases in the GPR index.29 The rise in the GPR index induces a small
and short-lived increase in the EPU index and a decline in consumer
sentiment. Intuitively, geopolitical risk can induce some economic
policy uncertainty on items such as national security and the fiscal
budget and negatively weigh on consumer sentiment. On the real side, IP
declines quickly, bottoming out at negative 0.9 percent after about 6
months, before reverting back to trend. The deterioration in labor
market conditions is substantial but more gradual, with payroll
employment reaching a trough of negative 0.4 percent a year after the
shock. Gross trade also drops, with U.S. imports and exports falling
nearly 2 percent relative to the baseline. Figure A.7 in the Appendix
plots the response of private investment to a GPR shock, based on an
extension of the baseline model estimated on quarterly data. The
economically significant decline in investment following a GPR shock,
together with the decline in employment, is consistent with models of
investment under uncertainty a la Dixit and Pindyck (1994).30

On the financial side, the response of the stock market is economically
and statistically significant. Stock prices drop by almost 3 percent on
impact and remain below baseline for a little over three months. The
increase in the GPR leads to a decrease in oil prices, which bottom out
at 7 percent below baseline after three months. This result stands in
contrast with much of the conventionally held view that higher
geopolitical risk drives up oil prices persistently---a view that might
reflect a selective memory that confounds all geopolitical tensions with
oil supply shocks driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
Finally, the yield on two-year Treasuries declines by about 20 basis
points, indicating both a worsening of the macroeconomic outlook and a
loosening of the monetary policy stance.

One useful way to assess the exposure to GPR of various sectors of the
U.S. economy is depicted in Figure 10. We add to the VAR model the
cumulative excess return of firms in given industries relative to the
S&P 500.n The solid lines show the excess return for 6 industries. The
defense industry, which is perhaps directly exposed to geopolitical
risk, records a positive but short-lived excess return; by contrast,
industries that are exposed to the overall U.S. economy---such as
aircraft, steelworks, and mining---display somewhat persistent negative
returns. The oil industry, which some commentators argued could benefit
from wars, especially in the Middle East, displays an initial positive
excess return followed by a persistent decline, a response that mimics
the path of oil prices. Finally, the insurance industry moves in sync
with the overall U.S. stock market.

4.2 Threats versus Acts

Next, we evaluate the difference between innovations in the two broad
components of the GPR index, the GPA geopolitical acts index and the GPT
geopolitical threats index, by replacing the GPR index with the GPA and
GPT indexes in the benchmark VAR. To achieve identification, we use a
Cholesky ordering, with the GPA index ordered first and the GPT index
ordered second. We interpret the first shock the GPA shock -as the
realization of some adverse geopolitical events that could induce an
increase in geopolitical threats; we interpret the second shock the GPT
shock -as capturing geopolitical threats that are not contemporaneously
associated with geopolitical acts, such as tensions building up before
wars or after terrorist attacks.

The impulse responses to the GPA and GPT shocks are shown for selected
variables in Figure 11. In presenting the results, we adopt the
following exposition scheme, which is best viewed in color.
Specifically, the responses to the GPA shock are plotted using a
green-based color motif, while the responses to the GPT shock are
plotted using a red-based color motif.

Starting from the responses of the three uncertainty proxies, a GPA
shock of size 288---a shock sized to be equal to the 7 largest spikes in
GPA, shown in panel (a)---induces an initial increase in the GPT and EPU
indexes, followed by a period of below-average GPT and EPU that lasts
for about a year. Thus, these responses are consistent with the
realization of acts leading to the resolution of threats and
uncertainty. By contrast, a GPT shock---shown in panel (b)---leads to a
persistent increase in GPT which remains elevated for over a year- and
in EPU. The GPA index, which by assumption does not move on impact,
increases for about one year, as in our sample many geopolitical threats
precede geopolitical acts.

The responses of activity, trade, and the stock market show that the GPA
and GPT shocks have asymmetric effects on the U.S. economy. A shock to
the GPA leads to a small but short-lived decline in economic activity
and trade, whereas the stock market rises sharply one month after the
shock. By contrast, a shock to the GPT induces large and protracted
recessionary effects, as well as a decline in stock prices.
Incidentally, the response of the stock market lends support to the old
idea, attributed to London financier Nathan Rothschild, that one should
buy stocks "on cannons," and sell them "on trumpets."

Figure 12 further elaborates on the asymmetric response of the stock
market by depicting the response of cumulative excess returns in six
industries to GPA and GPT shocks. Excess returns in all industries
feature an asymmetric response, albeit to a various degree. The defense
industry features the largest asymmetry: defense companies, on average,
earn an excess return of about 5 percent for more than two years
following a GPA shock, while they earn only a modest and shortlived
excess return following a GPT shock. Excess returns in the steel and
mining industries are also asymmetric---positive when geopolitical acts
materialize and negative when threats are high. By contrast, the
asymmetry in excess returns for insurance companies is economically
modest.

One possible interpretation of the asymmetric effects of shocks to acts
and threats is that the act component of GPR leads to a resolution of
the uncertainty around a particular set of events, as well as to a
coordinated policy response that ends up giving protection on the worst
possible outcomes. By contrast, threat shocks depress asset prices and
economic activity because they increase uncertainty and send signals
about future adverse events. 2 The finding that the realization of the
event has only modest economic consequences compared to the threat
echoes the findings of theoretical models where agents form expectations
using a worst case probability, as for instance in lint and Schneider
(2014).

5 International Effects of Higher Geopolitical Risk

This section characterizes the international effects of rising
geopolitical tensions. We first estimate a battery of structural VAR
models, which we use to track the macroeconomic implications of an
exogenous rise in geopolitical risk on real activity. We then test
whether global stock market returns depend on geopolitical risk.
Finally, we estimate panel regressions to unveil whether geopolitical
risk affects international capital flows.

5.1 Geopolitical Risk and Real Activity

We first study whether GPR shocks have adverse consequences on the real
economy outside the United States. We start by looking at the response
of world IP and IP in advanced and emerging economies. Importantly, the
emerging economies' IP index includes mostly Asian, European, and Latin
American countries. Reliable data on IP in major oil producing
countries---which are likely to be highly exposed to the geopolitical
risks captured by our index---are not available. We then estimate the
response of real activity in three countries: Canada and the United
Kingdom---as we used newspapers from these two countries in the
construction of the index---and Mexico, an emerging economy selected for
its large exposure to the U.S. economy.

We estimate a battery of VAR models consisting of the GPR index, the EPU
index for the United States, and IP.\'14 As for the U.S. model, we
identify a GPR shock ordering the GPR index first in a Cholesky
decomposition of the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals. The black
lines in Figure 13 depict the median responses of IP for the six
countries and regions listed above. These impulse responses suggest that
a GPR shock has global consequences---world IP declines by about 0.5
percent one year after the shock---but its effects are mostly
concentrated in advanced economies. By contrast, the emerging economies
included in our index, on average, do not respond to geopolitical risks.
Yet, Mexico---possibly through its large exposure to U.S.
trade---experiences a modest but persistent decline in real activity.\
5.2 Geopolitical Risk and Stock Returns

We now turn to examining the reaction of stock market returns to changes
in geopolitical risk. We do so both for the sample covered by the
historical GPR index and for the sample covered by the benchmark GPR
index.

The baseline econometric specification echoes the work of Berkman,
Jacobsen, and Lee (2011). These authors find that disaster risk
depresses stock returns. They measure disaster risk by counting the
number of active crises recorded in the International Crisis Database
discussed in Section 3 and plotted in Figure 7. Since their measure of
disaster risk is tightly linked to geopolitical events, in this section
we ask if our proxy, which displays only a weak correlation with their
crisis index, can help us uncover a significant relationship between
geopolitical risk and stock returns.

We obtain data on monthly stock returns based on general market price
indexes from Global Financial Data. Our sample ranges from 1900 to 2016,
although data availability varies by country, and the world stock price
index is available starting in 1919. We select 17 countries---all
countries that are currently classified as advanced economies, with the
exception of India, Peru, and South Africa---for which data before World
War II are available. The world stock price index is the Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) index from 1970. Prior to 1970, world
returns are calculated using the weighted average of country-specific
returns. Nine countries have data starting before World War I. Many
countries included in our regressions have gaps in the coverage that
range from one month to over a year. Since these gaps partly coincide
with World War II---as some stock markets did not operate in those
years---we follow Berkman, Jacobsen, and Lee (2011) and use all
available information.

We start by estimating the following regression:

rwtd,t --- fa + otwidQPRSHOCKt + PnijCRISESt + £wid,t\>

where rw\[jt is the world stock market return in month t, GPRSHOCKt is
the residual of an autoregressive process of order one estimated for the
GPR index, and CRISESt is the crisis index constructed by Berkman,
Jacobsen, and Lee (2011). In columns (1) and (3) of Table 2 we report
results for two samples, starting in 1919 and 1985, respectively. To
compare the impact on the GPR and on the crisis index, the coefficients
measure the impact on stock returns of a one standard deviation shock in
the GPR, and of having 2.41 active crises per month, the average number
of crises over our sample.

For the historical sample, we find that a 1 standard deviation increase
in the GPR induces a statistically significant decline in monthly stock
returns of 0.5 percent. The sensitivity of world stock returns to
geopolitical risk is larger after 1985, with an estimated drop of 0.75
percent. Interestingly, the coefficient on the crisis variable is
negative for the historical sample---albeit not statistically
significant---and becomes positive and not significant in the post-1985
sample. Thus, the GPR index correlates with negative stock returns
controlling for the realizations of international crises. Moreover, the
result over the post-1985 sample suggests that an advantage of the GPR
index over the crisis index is that, having substantially more time
variation, allows for the estimation of the impact of geopolitical
events on stock returns over relatively short samples.

World stock returns react more to threats about geopolitical events than
their realizations. This result is based on a modified version of
equation (1), where we replace GPRSHOCKt with the residuals of AR(1)
processes estimated for the GPR acts and threats indexes. As tabulated
in column (2) of Table 2, for the historical sample, world stock returns
decline in response to both GPA and GPT shocks, but the response to the
former is small and not statistically significant. By contrast, in the
post-1985 sample, stock returns rise in response to a positive GPA
shock, while they experience a large and statistically significant
decline in response to a GPT shock. Thus, as in the United States, world
stock returns respond asymmetrically to the threats and realizations of
geopolitical events.

We also estimate the following regression on country stock returns data:

rM = p, + aMGPRSHOCKt + eM,

where ri t is the stock market return in country i and month t. We
exclude the crisis index from the country regressions because for the 11
countries we have stock returns data starting prior to 1919, the first
year the crisis index is available. Table 3 tabulates the results for
the historical and the post-1985 samples.

Three results emerge from this exercise. First, both in the historical
and post-1985 sample, geopolitical risk depresses stock returns in all
but one of the countries included in our regressions--- the only
positive coefficient is estimated for Japan and is close to zero.
Second, on average, the sensitivity of stock returns to geopolitical
risk is larger in the post-1985 sample relative to the historical
sample, with countries like the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain having
a coefficient about 3 times larger in the short sample. Third, the
response of stock returns varies substantially across countries. For the
historical sample, the response ranges from about negative 0.9 for Italy
and South Africa, to 0 for countries like Japan and Germany. Similarly,
for the post-1985 sample, coefficients range from negative 1.50 for
Italy and Germany, to negative 0.3 for Australia and Japan. Furthermore,
while stock returns in some countries have remained particularly
responsive (such as Italy or South Africa) or unresponsive (such as
Japan) over time, stock returns have become more sensitive in others
most notably in Germany.

5.3 Geopolitical Risk and Capital Flows

Finally, we present additional evidence on the global economic
consequences of changes in geopolitical risk by showing how geopolitical
risk affects capital inflows in a sample of advanced and emerging
economies. The procyclical and volatile nature of capital flows makes
them a leading policy concern, especially in economies that rely heavily
on foreign sources of financing. We use country-level, quarterly data on
capital inflows from the IMF's Balance of Payments Statistics database.
Our sample consists of 22 advanced economies, 23 emerging economies, and
the United States, and covers the period from 1986:Q1 through 2015:Q4.36

Our baseline specification tests whether movements in geopolitical risk
have explanatory power for gross capital inflows. We choose gross
inflows---net purchases of domestic assets by foreign residents
excluding official reserves---in line with a large and growing body of
empirical evidence that shows that gross capital flows respond
systematically to changes in global conditions, and in line with the
notion that our measure of geopolitical risk is more likely to matter
for the economic-decisions of global investors on where to allocate
capital across countries. \*7

Our regression takes the form:

Vi,t --- ai + PDi.t-i + PGP Rt + rXt + Uit,

where yi t --- inflowsi t/GDP,t are gross capital inflows divided by
annualized GDP, a, are country fixed effects, GPRt is our geopolitical
risk index, and Xt is a vector of control variables. We estimate
equation (3) separately for emerging economies, for advanced economies
excluding the United States, and for the United States. Throughout, we
assume that the effect of the GPR index on capital inflows is equal
within each group of countries. Following the work of Ahmed and Zlate
(2014), our model specification includes the VIX to control for global
economic risk, lagged capital flows to control for persistence in
capital flows, as well as country-specific GDP growth to capture
demand-side factors that could drive capital flows towards one country.

Table 4 reports regressions coefficients scaled to denote the impact of
a 1 standard deviation increase in the GPR index and the VIX. Comparing
columns (1) and (2) of the table, an increase in GPR produces different
effects on capital inflows in emerging versus advanced economies. In
emerging economies, high GPR reduces capital inflows by 0.23 percentage
points, while an equally sized increase in the VIX reduces capital
inflows by more than one percentage point. By contrast, in advanced
economies, increases in GPR lead to a sizable increase in capital
inflows--- about one percentage point---whereas increases in the VIX
reduces capital inflows by 1.5 percentage points. GPR and VIX also have
opposite effects on inflows for the United States: as tabulated in
column (3), the effect of an increase in geopolitical risk is negative
(albeit the coefficient is not statistically different from zero) while
the effect of an increase in the VIX is positive and statistically
significant. In all specifications, the coefficient on lagged GDP growth
is positive, confirming the findings in Broner, Didier, Erce, and
Schmukler (2013) that a better investment climate (as proxied by GDP
growth) leads to larger inflows in both advanced and emerging economies.

In additional regressions results, we have verified that the asymmetric
effect of geopolitical risk on capital inflows for emerging and advanced
economies is present for all three subcomponents of capital inflows:
portfolio flows, foreign direct investment, and other investments.38
However, such effects are especially pronounced for portfolio flows and
other investments compared to foreign direct investment.

All told, the results suggest a marked difference between the effects on
capital flows of global economic risk (as measured by the VIX) and
geopolitical risk. While higher economic uncertainty leads to a
repatriation of foreign capital across the board, increases in
geopolitical risk appear to shift purchases of foreign capital away from
emerging and toward advanced economies, consistent with a
flight-to-safety hypothesis.311 However, the relatively small estimate
of the effect of GPR on emerging economies\' inflows suggests that
adverse geopolitical events fall short of causing full-blown sudden
stops in these economies. This finding mirrors our international VAR
evidence showing little effects of higher geopolitical risk on activity
in emerging economies.
