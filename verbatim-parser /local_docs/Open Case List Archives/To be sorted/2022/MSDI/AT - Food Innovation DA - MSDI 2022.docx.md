All of the stars are aligned for there to be a flurry of deals activity
across all areas of the sector despite the [slow start to the year so
far.]{.underline} Many large pharma players are flush with cash
(particularly those that have COVID-19 treatments in their arsenal),
**[[biotech valuations have been normalizing after years of a boom
market]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the 2025 patent cliff is rapidly
approaching]{.underline}, all making for a strong deal environment.
[[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[broader labor changes, supply
shortages and constantly changing supply chain
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} and [operations]{.underline}, the focus
on [[quality can be challenging to sustain]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet the
downside can **[[have massive impacts on
businesses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[including the potential inability
to manufacture products]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [long litany of
macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds]{.underline} has CEOs looking for
transactions that are easily integrated and will get cash off their
balance sheet as inflationary pressures mount. Pharmaceutical & life
sciences deals outlook [[Increased scrutiny from]{.underline}]{.mark}
the US Federal Trade Commission ([[FTC]{.underline}]{.mark}) around
larger deals could mean that 2022 will be a year of bolt-on transactions
in the \$5 to \$15 billion range as pharma companies take multiple shots
on goal in order to make up for revenues lost to generic competition in
the remainder of the decade. However, don't rule out the potential for
larger deals ⁠--- consolidation is good for the health ecosystem and
drives broader efficiency. Expect to see big pharma picking up earlier
stage companies to try and fill the pipeline gaps that are likely to
start in 2024. While market conditions suggest bargain prices for
biotech are possible, recent transactions indicate that pharma companies
are still paying significantly above current trading prices (ranging
from approximately 50 to 100% of current trading), but below the peak
valuations of recent memory. In the first few months of the year,
semi-annualized deal value was down 58% from the same period last year,
with companies investing just \$61.7 billion so far. Only 137 deals were
announced during that time, compared to 204 in the year-prior period.
[[Talk of drug pricing regulations]{.underline}]{.mark} continues in
Washington as Congress bats around a pared down version of the Build
Back Better plan. Expect some of that tension to ease in the fall if a
new Congress takes on a different agenda. Other areas of the sector like
[medical devices face similar headwinds from regulators]{.underline},
and continue to deal with a **[greater impact from semiconductor
shortages.]{.underline}** Even though semi-annualized deal value in the
medical device space is down 85% from the same period the prior year,
expect these companies to remain focused on M&A as the subsector
searches for alternative forms of revenue ⁠--- particularly from new
consumer-centric technologies. **[[Macroeconomic headwinds and
geopolitical tensions have created volatility]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
spending at CDMOs and CROs, limiting their willingness to deploy capital
as the uncertainty persists.

**[Pharma]{.underline}**

[[Deal activity in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[pharma]{.underline}]{.mark} space [[is down by
30%]{.underline}]{.mark} on a semi-annualized basis. Yet, deal values
have dropped about 50% in that time period, reflecting pharma's appetite
for smaller deals around a single asset or bolt-on deals, **[as the
industry attempts to stay below the radar of regulators at the
FTC]{.underline}**. Like most other sectors, [[pharma continues to
experience labor shortages, supply chain snags and higher input
costs]{.underline}]{.mark} ⁠--- particularly around packaging ⁠--- [[due
to inflationary pressures]{.underline}]{.mark}. In an effort to stay
nimble in a rapidly changing environment, pharma companies are
re-examining capital allocation strategies, as well as considering
alternative options for their supply chains. Even as uncertainty
persists, expect [pharma to focus on inorganic growth ahead of some of
the world's largest drugs going]{.underline} off patent later this
decade.

[[Pharma mergers might boost short-term profits. But long-term value?
Think again, because everyone knows that **big mergers hurt
innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That's the claim, at least, repeated
by critics every time a major pharma combo hits the news. Problem is,
those complaints tend to be based on anecdotal evidence, from scientists
who've seen their work hit the slough of despond as one big R&D
operation integrated with another. But now, the Harvard Business Review
has some
[empirical](https://hbr.org/2016/08/research-innovation-suffers-when-drug-companies-merge)
[evidence](https://hbr.org/2016/08/research-innovation-suffers-when-drug-companies-merge).
Two researchers from the Institute for Competition Economics in Germany
set out to address drug mergers from an antitrust perspective. All well
and good for competition watchdogs to look at overlaps in companies'
marketed products and pipelines, they figured. What about the drugs that
might have The researchers analyzed 65 pharma deals, comparing the
participating companies before and after they combined. They also
analyzed companies that were developing drugs in similar therapeutic
areas, but hadn't merged. "Our results very clearly show that R&D and
patenting within the merged entity decline substantially after a merger,
compared to the same activity in both companies beforehand," the
authors, Justus Haucap and Joel Stiebale, wrote in the HBR. That's to be
expected, the authors posit, because merger-minded companies often
target rivals with similar pipeline assets, to gain strength in
particular drug markets. But here's what else the authors found: "On
average, patenting and R&D expenditures of non-merging competitors also
fell\--by more than 20%\--within four years after a merger. Therefore,
pharmaceutical mergers seem to substantially reduce innovation
activities in the relevant market as a whole.\" Haucap and Stiebale's
[paper](https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/dicedp/218.html) includes patent
counts and R&D spending numbers, and they conclude that "innovation
output" by the merged company decreases, on average, by more than 30%.
Among the merged company's competitors, output declined by 7%, on
average, they found. The men's research "is the first to show that there
are follow-on effects across the industry,"
[wrote](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/08/24/drug-mergers-hurt-in-every-direction-save-one)
Derek Lowe at In The Pipeline, which has sliced and diced pharma M&A for
years. "[[Inside the merged companies, there's a great deal of
disruption]{.mark}, as many readers here can testify,"]{.underline} Lowe
wrote. "But across the industry as a whole, things get less competitive
the fewer players there are and the fewer the approaches being tried."
As for the business effects? Profitability increased post-merger, for
the merged companies and for their competitors, too. For the merged
company, the profits may depend on cost cuts; in integrating, the
post-merger company "decreases its scale" compared to the two merger
partners, pre-acquisition. For "non-merging rivals," profits tended to
grow on increased sales. "**[[What we have, then, is probably a perverse
incentive\--companies can improve their numbers by doing mergers and
acquisitions, but that very activity hurts their long-term prospects and
those of the entire industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Lowe observes.
McKinsey & Co. analysts
[emphasized](http://www.fiercepharma.com/m-a/thumbs-up-or-down-on-megamergers-depends-on-your-point-of-view)
the "shareholder value" effects of megamergers in a 2014 study, and they
found that, reductively speaking, the deals worked. Lowe picked apart
that research, as did ex-Pfizer R&D chief John LaMattina, who wrote up
his own

out of research, as focus and energy go into logistical decisions,
layoff worries, and the like\--and away from science.\\

#### Trends prove that the chemical industry's fate is sealed

Four chemical industry trends to watch [[There are four broad
trends]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[defining the
chem]{.underline}]{.mark}ical [[industry,]{.underline}]{.mark} each
affecting a different element of business, from operations through
production and compliance.

**[Mergers and acquisitions]{.underline}**: The last couple of years saw
[[notable consolidation in the form of multiple mergers and
acquisitions]{.underline}]{.mark}. A result of slow overall industry
growth and a desire to consolidate resources and capabilities in the
areas with the most promising growth, M&A is also being driven by
growing pressure to gather the resources needed for digital
transformation. Mega [[mergers are radically altering
the]{.underline}]{.mark} top of the [[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}­­--a
fact that has not escaped the attention of farmers, legislators, and
regulatory bodies.

**[A new regulatory environment]{.underline}**: Governments and
[[regulatory bodies around the world are overhauling chemical
regulations]{.underline}]{.mark} for the first time in decades. Both
environmental and industry groups note that [[these changes could signal
a kind of détente between the chemical industry and its
watchdogs]{.underline}]{.mark} over the next few years. In other parts
of the world, however, the relationship between the industry, activist
groups, and regulatory bodies remains more acrimonious.

**[Investment]{.underline}**: After decades of taking a back seat to
emerging markets, [**[North America saw a significant wave of
investments in]{.mark}** new multi-billion-dollar **[production
facilities from]{.mark}**]{.underline} a number of [[chemical
manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Factors involved]{.underline} in
this growth **[include the considerable size and strength of the
regional market, and favorable political and regulatory environments in
American states with significant chemical production
segments]{.underline}**.

**[Digital transformation]{.underline}**: [[Rising demand
and]{.underline}]{.mark} growing [[competition]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[pressure on]{.underline}]{.mark}
all [[chem]{.underline}]{.mark}ical m[[anufacturers to adopt advanced
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} and transform their operations and
structures. **[[Improved efficiencies, safety, and reliability can be
realized through implementation of advanced
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology--[[all of which]{.underline}]{.mark}
can **[[reduce costs for the manufacturer]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These
transformations are also [enabling new business models that could bring
chemical manufacturers closer to their suppliers, their direct
customers, and even their end customers.]{.underline}

set, replacing any competing genes and also ensuring that all of the
organism's offspring receive the drive.]{.underline}]{.mark} Within
those offspring, the drive will again replace any competing genes,
ensuring that all of the next generation receives the gene. If a species
reproduces rapidly, it might be possible to quickly alter the whole
species. Mosquitoes could be altered so that they can no longer transmit
malaria or dengue, for example.

It's no secret that [[the Trump admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration has
[[fostered a culture of corruption]{.mark} in which special interests
and big donors advance their interests at the expense of everyday
people. Perhaps [no policy area exemplifies this corruption more than
the issue of drug pricing]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Trump has long
promised to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and lower
prescription drug prices, but he has avoided taking serious action to
drive down prices while at the same time filling top spots in his
administration with industry insiders. [[This administration's culture
of corruption, which continues a decadeslong practice of political
pandering to the pharmaceutical industry, carries a real cost; Americans
spent \$535 billion]{.mark}1 [on prescription drugs in 2018, an increase
of 50 percent since 2010. These price increases far surpass inflation,
with Big Pharma increasing prices on its most-prescribed medications by
anywhere from 40 percent to 71 percent from 2011 to
2015]{.mark}.2]{.underline} Moreover, [pharmaceutical companies receive
substantial U.S. government assistance in the form of publicly funded
basic research and tax breaks, yet they continue to charge exorbitant
prices for medications. But the issue goes beyond cost]{.underline}. In
America, more than 1 million individuals suffer from Type 1 diabetes3, a
condition where the body cannot make insulin, which is essential for
getting glucose (also known as blood sugar) into cells from the
bloodstream. Without insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream4,
causing dangerously high blood sugar levels. Among all Americans
suffering from diabetes, at least 1 in 45 have said that they engaged in
insulin rationing---a tactic of using less insulin than is needed in
order to make the doses last longer---as a direct result of the
skyrocketing price of the drug. A vial of insulin, which is the only
life-sustaining option for Type 1 diabetics, retails at around \$300.6 A
2018 study commissioned by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus found that
the price of insulin has doubled since 20127; in the 10 years prior, the
price of insulin nearly tripled. Despite the dangers of insulin
rationing, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a fatal condition,
many Americans have no other choice. That was the case for Antroinette8,
whose daughter was rationing insulin due to the high cost and died at
the age of 22 as a result. Insulin facts Access to insulin for patients
with Type 1 diabetes is a matter of life or death.9 While insulin has
existed since the1920s10, the price since then has skyrocketed,
especially in recent years. Prices for insulin increased by 197 percent
between 2002 and 2013, from \$4.34 per milliliter to \$12.92 per
milliliter.11 There are three insulin manufacturers serving the United
States: Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S, and Sanofi SA. Eli
Lillyannounced12 in March 2019 that it would begin selling a generic
version of its Humalog insulin at half the price. The medication, known
as lispro, will cost \$137.35 per vial. To compare pricing, a 2018
study13 estimated that the cost of making a year's worth of insulin for
one patient ranges from \$78 to \$133. Ahead of its hearing on drug
pricing in February 2019, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance sent
aletter14 to Eli Lilly asking why insulin is priced so astonishingly
high. A vial of NovoLog, one type of insulin, costs15 anywhere from \$14
to \$300 in the United States but only \$48 in Singapore, \$14 in India,
\$6 in Austria, and \$0 in Italy. American taxpayers fund basic research
Billions of taxpayer dollars go into the creation and marketing16 of new
drugs. The Los Angeles Times reports that, "Since the 1930s, the
National Institutes of Health has invested close to \$90017 billion in
the basic and applied research that formed both the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology sectors." Despite taxpayers' crucial investment, U.S.
consumers are increasingly paying more for their prescription drugs. A
2018 study18 on the National Institute of Health's (NIH) financial
contributions to new drug approvals found that the agency "contributed
to published research associated with every one of the 210 new drugs
approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010--2016." More than
\$100 billion in NIH funding went toward research that contributed
directly or indirectly to the 210 drugs approved during that six-year
period. The NIH Research Project Grant (R01)19---which supports
health-related research---was by far the most common kind of grant used
to fund the science that supported the new drugs. In all, NIH gave out
nearly 118,00020 R01 grants related to those drugs from 2010 to 2016.
Federal perks for Big Pharma add up **[[Pharmaceutical companies also
benefit from research and development tax
credits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The federal R&D tax credit was first
introduced in 1981 to encourage private sector investment in pioneering
research.21 This tax credit is available to businesses that attempt to
develop new, improved, or technologically advanced products or trade
processes.22 In 2015, former President Barack Obama signed into law the
Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act23, which made these tax credits
permanent and extended them to small businesses and startup companies.
Pharmaceutical industries also receive a tax deduction for their
marketing and advertising expenses. According to a report in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, "From 1997 through 2016, medical
marketing expanded substantially, and spending increased from \$17.7 to
\$29.9 billion,24 with direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription
drugs and health services accounting for the most rapid growth, and
pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals accounting for most
promotional spending." The report also found that from 1997 through
2016, "the number of advertisements ... increased from 79,000 (including
72,000 television commercials) in 1997 to 4.6 million (663,000
television25 commercials) in 2016." Big Pharma's drug pricing maximizes
profits Despite these taxpayer subsidies, prescription drug prices are
nonetheless increasing at an alarming rate. In 2019, price increases
from drug manufacturers affected more than 3,40026 drugs. For example,
Allergan, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, raised prices on 51
drugs, just more than half its portfolio. Some medications that Allergan
manufactures saw a 9.5 percent jump in cost, while others saw a 4.9
percent increase in cost.27 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the
largest generic drug manufacturer in the world, increased its drug
prices by more than 9 percent.28 These sharp increases in price occur as
companies continue to report millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018,
Allergan reported \$15.8 million29 in revenue, while Teva
Pharmaceuticals reported \$18.8 million30 in revenue. Pharmaceutical
companies' profit margins receive significant bumps when they launch new
drugs, specifically specialty drugs, used to treat life-threatening
conditions. These drugs often cost more than most Americans can afford.
Pharmaceutical companies have stated that the prices are high because
the drugs are difficult to manufacture. In 2013, for example, industry
giant Gilead Sciences launched Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug, at \$1,000
per pill31, or \$84,00032 per treatment, which could last 12 to 24
weeks.33 After an 18-month investigation into the company's pricing, the
Senate Finance Committee concluded that Gilead had pursued a marketing
and pricing strategy designed to "maximize revenue with little concern
for access or affordability."34 [[Drug companies also benefit from
patents, which give them monopoly power for their on-patent products.
These patents ensure that prices remain high by reducing competition.
Drug patents last for 20 years after the filing date. Pharmaceutical
companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing
to prolong a drug's exclusivity]{.mark}.]{.underline} When evergreening,
pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as
changing its35 chemical composition slightly or making an external
change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill36 in order to preserve
their patents. A 2018 study in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences
found that 78 percent37 of new drug patents awarded in the past decade
went to drugs that already existed. Seventy percent 38 of the nearly 100
bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once,
and 50 percent extended their patents more than once. The second
tactic---thicketing---involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it
difficult for competing firms to secure patents. These tactics help
preserve pharmaceutical companies' monopolies and ensure that drug
prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday
Americans. While consumers continue to pay the price of this market
manipulation, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the
pharmaceutical industry found that these unfair practices are
significantly enriching manufacturers. As the report stated, "Among the
largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between 15
and 20 percent."39 The GAO contextualizes these profits by comparing the
pharmaceutical industry's profits with those of its counterparts,
stating that "the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies
among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent." In
2018 alone, the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies Allergan, Johnson
& Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. made a total of \$90 million.40 Meanwhile,
according to a CBS News report, Americans spent \$535 billion41 on
prescription drugs in 2018---an increase of 50 percent since 2010.42 As
pharmaceutical industry profits increase43, everyday Americans---whose
tax dollars play a critical role in funding the research and development
of these medications---are not receiving anything close to a fair return
on their investment. A recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found that
Americans spent \$65.8 billion44 out of pocket in 2016 for retail
prescription drugs, up from \$59.5 billion in 2012. The high cost of
prescription drugs is a significant driver of medical debt45 because
Americans are increasingly reliant on medication to manage long-term
chronic conditions.46 Additionally, the high cost of prescription drugs
has forced many Americans to take drastic measures, including foregoing
taking their medications as prescribed or traveling abroad in order to
save on medications. A 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
study found that 11.4 percent47 of adults aged 18 to 64 did not take
their prescription drugs as prescribed in order to reduce how much they
spent on their medications. And, as NPR recently reported, "The U.S
government estimates that close to 1 million48 Americans in California
alone go to Mexico annually for health care, including to buy
prescription drugs." In May 2019, a group of Americans49 living with
Type 1 diabetes traveled to Canada to purchase insulin and call on the
U.S. government to regulate the cost of lifesaving drugs. The costs
associated with traveling abroad make it logistically and financially
impractical for most Americans. Further, traveling abroad presents
certain health risks given that some countries have lax drug
certification standards compared with FDA standards. President Trump's
broken promises on drug pricing In an interview with Time magazine ahead
of being chosen as its Person of the Year in 2016, Trump said, "I'm
going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what's happened with drug
prices."50 He promised to bring Americans' drug spending down to \$0 by
negotiating drug prices.51 Trump made grandiose promises on drug pricing
but almost three years later has only managed to deliver a handful of
half-measures, illustrating his administration's lack of commitment to
lowering drug prices. One of Trump's proposals from his so-called
presidential blueprint52 included eliminating some rebates paid by drug
companies53 that hide the true cost of drugs. However, the Congressional
Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal
spending on Medicare and Medicaid by \$177 billion.54 The Trump
administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for
drugs to include the list price.55 Some experts believe this policy will
be ineffective56 at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or
end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers
rather than help them.57 These half-measures, combined with Trump
surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly
communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs
for Americans. Congress has done little to address the problem of high
drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy cozy relationships
with the pharmaceutical industry. The industry spent more than \$62
million in the 2016 congressional elections---the most it has ever spent
on political campaigns.58 The massive influx of campaign cash benefited
members of both parties, including those that sit on committees with
jurisdiction over drug pricing.59 Big Pharma's investment has paid off
as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to
pass an amendment on the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of
2019, which would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with
manufacturers.60 Medicare's ability to negotiate on drug prices, which
is currently prohibited by law, "would provide the leverage needed to
lower drug costs."61 Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma,
President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry. Big Pharma
officials have filled at least 1662 current or former positions in the
Trump administration, and many of Trump's top health advisers have been
industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies. Trump's
first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price
(R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry63 in Congress, where he
not only pushed Big Pharma's agenda but also benefited from it
financially.64 Price, who drew scrutiny for more than \$300,000 in
health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 201765 as a
result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers' dime. In
2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan66 to a top position at the U.S. Office
of Management and Budget. Grogan spent five years as a lobbyist for
Gilead---the pharmaceutical company that is infamous for its sky-high
prices on a cure for hepatitis C.67 Since joining the administration,
Grogan has led drug-pricing proposals and participated in Trump's Drug
Pricing and Innovation Working Group."68 However, the working group has
proposed pharma-friendly measures such as implementing monopoly rights
outside of the United States, speeding up approval from the FDA for new
drugs, and eliminating price cuts for hospitals in impoverished areas.
President Trump chose to replace Price with Alex Azar, the former
president of Eli Lilly---one of the companies that is working to keep
drug prices high while everyday Americans suffer---to oversee his
efforts to address drug pricing as secretary of health and human
services. In 2018, pharmaceutical companies spent more than \$283
million in lobbying dollars69, with Eli Lilly spending just less than
\$6.8 million in 2018.70 While Azar, Trump's chief health adviser, was
president of Eli Lilly, the company drastically increased insulin
prices. Eli Lilly is currently defending itself against a class-action
lawsuit71 accusing the company of colluding with pharmacy benefit
managers---individuals who negotiate drug pricing and availability with
drug companies for the government and other insurance plans---to
increase prices. Big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers have been
playing a blame game72 while lawmakers---who have held several hearings
in the U.S. House of Representatives73 and the U.S. Senate74---try to
find the source of America's drug pricing problem. Given the sway that
Big Pharma has with the administration, the industry has no plans to
reduce prescription drug prices or reverse past price gouging. For his
part, President Trump tried but failed to pass the American Health Care
Act of 2017, which would have hurt millions of Americans while
benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, among others. However, he was
successful in signing into law a new tax bill that lowered the corporate
tax rate by 14 percent, allowing pharmaceutical companies, including
those with ties to the Trump administration, to save a total of \$76
billion.75 After the tax law was enacted, Eli Lilly received a tax cut
of nearly \$4.5 billion on offshore profits.76 Instead of using these
tax savings to lower drug prices, big pharmaceutical companies such as
Eli Lilly together used \$45 billion of their total tax savings77 to
benefit shareholders via stock buyback programs. After President Trump
helped Eli Lilly save billions, Azar, the company's top executive, was
confirmed to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services78 at
the beginning of the following year. Conclusion Although the Trump
administration keeps promising to lower drug prices, [[drug costs
continue to climb as Americans su]{.mark}ffer and pharmaceutical
companies profit and their CEOs line their pockets. [The
government-funded research and major tax benefits that these
pharmaceutical companies enjoy help them stay profitable. Meanwhile,
they continue to hike up the costs of drugs, particularly
life-sustaining drugs such as insulin. **Big Pharma can play this game
indefinitely, benefiting from this culture of
corruption**]{.mark}]{.underline}, using allies in the administration
and in Congress to grow their profit margins while everyday people
suffer. But there are steps lawmakers can take to reduce the influence
of special interests, including Big Pharma.79 For example, lobbyists are
currently allowed to fundraise for candidates for federal office---and
many of them provide far more financial support beyond the \$2,800 per
candidate limit by hosting fundraising events and bundling
contributions. Banning lobbyists from fundraising80 for candidates would
reduce special-interest influence over the legislative process. Another
way to limit corrupting conflicts of interest is to ban members of
Congress from accepting campaign donations from entities under the
jurisdiction of the committees on which the serve. It is understood that
conflicts can easily arise from committee contributions, which explains
why 88 percent of voters support this prohibition.81 Additionally,
Washington's infamous revolving door between private industry and
government must be closed. Proposals to do so include a lifetime
lobbying ban on members of Congress and a five-year lobbying ban on
senior congressional staffers.82 As Americans are caught trying to
decide whether to pay for rent or medicine, pharmaceutical companies
continue to reap government benefits. Reducing drug prices and the costs
that everyday people must pay is not possible without fixing the broken
system in Washington.

It is perhaps surprising, then, that [there is [**little scholarly
merit**]{.mark} in the notion [that a]{.mark} short-term
[reduction]{.mark} in access to **[food increases]{.mark} the
[probability]{.mark} that [conflict]{.mark}** will [break
out.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is because [[to start]{.mark} or
participate in violent [conflict requires]{.mark} people to have both
the [means and]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}. Most [people on the **brink of
starvation are not in the position to resort**]{.mark} **to violence**,
whether against the government or other social groups]{.underline}. In
fact, [the urban middle classes tend to be the most likely to protest
against rises in food prices, since they often have the best
opportunities, the most energy, and the best skills to coordinate and
participate in protests.]{.underline}

Accordingly, [there is a **[widespread misapprehension]{.mark}** that
[social unrest in periods of high]{.mark} food [prices relates]{.mark}
primarily [to]{.mark} food [shortages]{.mark}]{.underline}. In reality,
the [[sources of discontent are]{.mark} considerably **[more
complex]{.mark}** -- linked to [**political structures**,
**land**]{.mark} ownership, **[corruption]{.mark}**, the desire for
[**democratic reforms** and]{.mark} general **[economic
problems]{.mark}** -- where the price of food is seen in the context of
general increases in the cost of living]{.underline}. Research has shown
that while the international media have a tendency to seek simple
resource-related explanations -- such as drought or famine -- for
conflicts in the Global South, debates in the local media are permeated
by more complex political relationships.

#### Worst case, [fast]{.underline} government response [stops collapse]{.underline}. 

**OECD '21** \[October 19; OECD, "Keep calm and carry on feeding:
Agriculture and food policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis,"
<https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/keep-calm-and-carry-on-feeding-agriculture-and-food-policy-responses-to-the-covid-19-crisis-db1bf302/>;\]

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [**[disruption]{.mark}** to
the agriculture and food supply chains,]{.underline} particularly in the
first half of 2020, most [**sector [shocks]{.mark}** were **[absorbed
rapidly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with trade and markets recovering during
the year. Average gross farm receipts for OECD and emerging economies
actually increased in 2020, and the sector was the best performing or
least affected economically in several countries. At the same time,
restricting measures impacted the food security of many low income or
unemployed consumers.

This relative [**economic [resilience]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[ag]{.mark}riculture]{.underline} and food sector [was largely [due
to]{.mark}]{.underline} sector specific policy measures undertaken by
governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
restrictions. Many [[governments **moved**]{.mark} **swiftly** [to
keep]{.mark} agricultural [supply chains]{.mark}
functioning]{.underline}, including by [[designating ag]{.mark}riculture
and food as an **[essential]{.mark} sector**]{.underline} and by
ensuring international co-operation to limit trade disruptions.

An estimated 776 unique policy response measures were adopted by
governments of 54 OECD and emerging economies in 2020. These measures
were widely diverse, highlighting the breadth and responsiveness of
public actions to address the impact of the crisis. Close to 20% of the
total were urgent measures, adopted in order to contain the pandemic
while keeping food and agriculture supply chains working. Just under 70%
of measures took the form of temporary relief, seeking to contain the
impact of the crisis on agriculture and food sector actors, and should
be phased out as the crisis recedes. Most of the remaining measures
(10%) were "no regrets" policies with the potential to improve the
long-term resilience of the agro-food sector, and which have the
potential to be scaled up further. At the same time, 11% of measures had
the potential to distort markets or be harmful to the environment.

A first assessment of budgetary expenditures in response to the COVID-19
crisis suggests that a [minimum of USD [157 billion]{.mark} was
[**earmarked** in funding]{.mark} or]{.underline} offered in
[financing]{.underline} means [to the sector]{.underline} in 2020,
including USD 75 billion in OECD countries and USD 82 billion in
emerging economies. [Actual disbursements have so far been
**lower**]{.underline}, partly [[reflecting]{.mark} the **overall
[resilience]{.mark}** of agriculture]{.underline} to the COVID-19 shock,
and the fact that recovery packages in several countries include
multi-year investments.

#### \--Ukraine thumps

[The [blood on Putin's **hands** is]{.mark} not only from **Ukraine**
and **Russia**]{.underline}, [but [from countries]{.mark} around the
world [that rely on **imports** for their **food
security**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[consequences]{.mark} of Putin's
war [will]{.mark}]{.underline} [[play out in regions]{.mark} already
[experiencing acute **food insecurity** and]{.mark} in food-importing
countries that are [most vulnerable to **supply shocks** and **price
increases**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Buried in today's headlines, an
underreported reality is that global food insecurity is already at a
10-year high. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [[the follow-on
effects of the pandemic]{.mark}---lost jobs and wages, supply chain
disruptions, food price volatility---[pushed]{.mark} the [number of
food-insecure people to record levels]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This spike
in **food insecurity** happened despite ample global **food stocks** and
**record-low fuel prices**.]{.underline} [[Russia's invasion]{.mark} has
put global [stocks of **grains** and **oilseeds** into question]{.mark}
and caused energy prices to **soar**, throwing fuel onto the fire and
risking pushing **food insecurity skyward**. Shocks to global
agriculture markets can reverberate worldwide]{.underline}. In 2007 and
2008, [decreases in production from major producers---**Australia**,
**Myanmar**, **Russia**, and **others**---led to price increases and
**riots** from Haiti to Cote d\'Ivoire to nearly 40 other
countries.]{.underline} Today[, [decreases]{.mark} in the global stocks
of **wheat** and other **grains** and **oilseeds** from Ukraine and
Russia [could **exacerbate**]{.mark} ongoing [crises]{.mark} in
**Afghanistan**, **Syria**, **Ethiopia**, [and]{.mark} other
[hotspots]{.mark} and aggravate instability in **Egypt**, **Lebanon**,
and **Syria**.]{.underline} Among Ukraine's major wheat buyers, almost
half already experience acute food insecurity; particularly vulnerable
to a decrease in Russian wheat supply are its purchasers across Asia and
Africa.

#### Increased food production is bad -- more likely to cause conflict

University of Minnesota and a Jennings Randolph Fellow at the United
States Institute of Peace., 11-23-2016, Washington Post, Food scarcity

[How can an abundance of food lead to war]{.underline}? Food scarcity,
however, is only one aspect of food security. **[[Whether people have
easy access to food resources is also important]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
So **[[even in countries where plenty of food is
available]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a **[[large share of the population
might still go hungry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Nobel Laureate Amartya
Sen notes, "[[Starvation is]{.underline}]{.mark} the characteristic of
[[some people not having enough food to eat]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[It
is not]{.underline}]{.mark}** the characteristic of **[[there being not
enough food to eat]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [[Grievances over
food]{.underline}]{.mark} and the necessity to secure access to food
resources [can [motivate marginalized groups to]{.mark} participate in
[rebellions and wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. A number of scholars are
researching how [[inequitable access to food]{.mark} affects violence
within the state]{.underline}. As Ben Bagozzi and I show in a recent
paper, armed actors worldwide are motivated to fight over local food
resources. Here's why **[[these conflicts tend to happen in regions with
more food crops, not less]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[For rebel
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, securing --- and [[controlling --- food
resources is vital for the insurgency to advance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And [when the government is slow]{.underline} or unable [to
supply]{.underline} combat [rations]{.underline}, [[state
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} also may be forced to **[[extract food
supplies from the local population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, So scarce
[[food]{.underline}]{.mark} resources in a region locked in conflict
[[act as both fuel and reward]{.underline}]{.mark} for hungry
combatants. **[[Access to more local food]{.underline}]{.mark}**
resources, [especially in the case of rebel groups]{.underline},
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be used to attract
recruits]{.underline}]{.mark}, as happened in Sierra Leone and Somalia.
Regions where wheat and barley are grown are also an important source of
support for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The focus on how the
demand for food resources influences armed conflict complements the
research done on the effects of food scarcity. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark}
also **[[explains why agricultural areas see more
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In these regions, individuals live
largely on locally grown food. If the government's safety nets are
mismanaged or weak, those who control access to food can more easily
recruit individuals and operate for a longer period of time. And this
also explains why **[[there is an uptick in violence during times of
more rainfall]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- for instance, in sub-Saharan
Africa. By [[providing armed groups with]{.underline}]{.mark} an added
[[motivation to fight]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as the ability to
expand their numbers and strength, **[[local food
security]{.underline}]{.mark}** can **[[therefore shape global conflict
patterns]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
