If US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin do
manage to hold a summit on Ukraine, [what should Biden's approach
be]{.underline}? Biden has said repeatedly that the US is open to
diplomacy with Russia, but on the issue that Moscow has most emphasised
--- Nato enlargement --- there has been no American diplomacy at all.
[Putin has repeatedly demanded that the US forswear Nato's enlargement
into Ukraine, while Biden has repeatedly asserted that membership of the
alliance is Ukraine's choice.]{.underline} If a summit does materialise
in the days ahead, and in the planned meeting this week between US
secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei
Lavrov, **[the US should propose a guarantee that Nato will not
enlarge]{.underline}** to include Ukraine in return for a full
withdrawal of Russian forces from the Donbas region and an end to
Russian support for the independence of the two Moscow-backed separatist
regions in eastern Ukraine, a demobilisation along the Russia-Ukraine
border and an assurance of Ukrainian sovereignty. [If the US won't do
this, then France and Germany should step forward instead.]{.underline}
This would inevitably lead to cries of appeasement. [Many insist that
Nato enlargement is not the real]{.underline} issue for Putin and that
he wants to recreate the Russian empire, pure and simple. [Everything
else, including Nato enlargement, they claim, is a mere distraction.
**This is utterly mistaken.**]{.underline} [Russia has adamantly opposed
Nato expansion towards the east for 30 years,]{.underline} first under
Boris Yeltsin and now Putin. Before that, [the Soviet Union largely
opposed Nato expansion, too.]{.underline} It is easy to understand why.
**[The US would not be very happy were Mexico to join a China-led
military alliance, nor was it content when Fidel Castro's Cuba aligned
with the USSR 60 years ago. Neither the US nor Russia wants the other's
military on their doorstep. Pledging no Nato enlargement is not
appeasement.]{.underline}** It [does not]{.underline} [cede]{.underline}
Ukrainian [territory]{.underline}. [It does not undermine]{.underline}
Ukraine's [sovereignty]{.underline}. **[It would in fact help to secure
it.]{.underline}** Ukraine should aspire to resemble the [non-Nato
members of the EU: Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden.
Americans can learn much from the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis]{.underline}. As the historian Martin Sherwin showed in his book
Gambling with Armageddon, [**the crisis was resolved by a deft
compromise. The Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba
while the US agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey.** The American
public never appreciated this,]{.underline} alas, [because President
John F Kennedy insisted on keeping the US removal of missiles from
Turkey secret]{.underline}. Kennedy did not want to appear to speak for
all of Nato, and sought to protect himself from charges of appeasement
from the US right. The public therefore believed that the crisis ended
with Soviet capitulation, not compromise. Despite claims to the
contrary, [the western nations offered informal assurances to the Soviet
Union that Nato would not enlarge to the east after German
unification.]{.underline} The US and allies acted deceitfully, using
sophistical arguments to claim that previous pledges were not binding.
[It was especially reckless in 2008 for President George W Bush to open
the door to Ukraine's (and Georgia's) Nato membership.]{.underline}
Biden and the US foreign policy establishment has so far refused to
reconsider Nato enlargement for three reasons. First, they fear the
charge of appeasement. Second, the US wants the prerogative to puts its
military in any country that will have it, even if that disregards the
legitimate security concerns of neighbouring states. Third, the US
foreign policy establishment has long failed to acknowledge valid
Russian security concerns that go back to the second world war and even
earlier. Russia has long feared invasions from the west, whether by
Napoleon, Hitler or latterly Nato. [For this reason, cooler and wiser US
foreign policy strategists, including Bill Clinton's defence secretary
William Perry, the great statesman and diplomat George Kennan and former
ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, argued that **Nato
enlargement to the east after the demise of the USSR was unnecessary,
reckless and provocative.**]{.underline} If war comes, Putin would of
course deserve the blame and global opprobrium. Russia's threats are
thuggish and dangerous. Yet as misguided as the Russian actions are,
American intransigence regarding **[Nato enlargement is also utterly
misguided and risky.]{.underline}** True friends of Ukraine, and of
global peace, should be calling for a US and Nato compromise with Russia
--- one that respects Russia's legitimate security interests while fully
backing Ukraine's sovereignty.

#### That decks American primacy and *[causes retrenchment]{.underline}* -- US hardline key to reliable and legitimate security commitments. 

- Defense spending, strengthening American hardpower projection is a
  necessity, not relying on NATO -- primacy key warrants

There are historical precedents for this approach. The Nixon Doctrine
and [US withdrawal from Vietnam helped Washington retreat to a more
defensible strategic perimeter in the 1970s following strategic
overstretch in the decade prior.]{.underline} More significantly,
beginning in the late-nineteenth century, the United Kingdom gradually
conducted an elegant global retreat by first relying upon rising
regional powers such as the United States and Japan to maintain
acceptable regional orders, and later encouraging Washington to shoulder
many of London's global burdens after World War II. [Graceful
retrenchment, then, is not an impossibility]{.underline}.30 **[It is,
however, extremely problematic today]{.underline}**. [This
approach]{.underline}--- particularly the more aggressive
variants---[would be enormously difficult to implement.]{.underline}
[The US commitment to the Baltic states is part of a larger commitment
to NATO; shredding the former guarantee risks undermining the broader
alliance.]{.underline} Even in Asia, where the United States has
bilateral alliances, [withdrawing the US commitment to Taipei could
cause leaders in Manila, Seoul, or Tokyo to wonder if they might be
abandoned next]{.underline}---and to hedge their strategic bets
accordingly. **[Alliances hinge on the credibility of the patron's
promises;]{.underline}** [revoking some guarantees without discrediting
others is difficult.]{.underline}31 [This]{.underline} dynamic
[underscores]{.underline} another liability---[the likelihood of
profound geopolitical instability.]{.underline} [Retrenchment works best
when the overstretched hegemon can hand off excessive responsibilities
to some friendly power]{.underline}. But [today, there is no liberal
superpower waiting in the wings.]{.underline} Rather, **[the countries
most sympathetic to America's view of the international
order]{.underline}**---Japan, the United Kingdom, and key European
allies---**[confront graver long-term economic and demographic
challenges than the United States.]{.underline}** The countries most
likely to gain influence following US retrenchment---[Russia and
China---have very different global visions.]{.underline} In these
circumstances, [US retrenchment seems unlikely to succeed]{.underline}.
Rather than simply forcing friendly local actors to do more to defend
themselves and check revisionist powers, [the outcome might easily be
underbalancing---in which collective action problems, internal political
divisions, or resource limitations prevent timely action against a
potential aggressor---or bandwagoning]{.underline}, in which expos**[ed
countries buy a measure of safety by aligning with, rather than against,
an aggressive power]{.underline}**.32 Meanwhile, although writing off
Taiwan or Estonia might produce a near-term improvement of relations
with Beijing or Moscow, the longer-term effect would be to remove a
chief constraint on the aggressive behavior these powers have been
increasingly manifesting. [If Moscow and Beijing seem eager to bring
their "near abroads" to heel now, just wait until the United States
retracts its security perimeter.]{.underline}33 If more [aggressive
variants of retrenchment are thus deeply flawed, even more limited
versions,]{.underline} such as a Middle Eastern Nixon Doctrine, [have
weaknesses.]{.underline} As Iran's military power continues to grow, and
the recent removal of nuclear-related sanctions makes this seem likely,
even [the wealthy Persian Gulf kingdoms will have great difficulty
dealing with Tehran's advanced and asymmetric capabilities without US
assistance.]{.underline} In fact, **[without US leadership, the
long-standing collection action problems between the Gulf countries are
likely to worsen]{.underline}**. Moreover, the United States essentially
tried a version of this approach by withdrawing from Iraq in late 2011.
But as soon became clear, Iraq, a vital state in a key region, could not
withstand challenges from nontraditional foes such as the Islamic State
on its own[. In fact, US retrenchment actually encouraged developments
that left Iraq more vulnerable to collapse, such as the increasingly
sectarian nature of Nūrī al-Mālikī's governance and the hollowing out of
the Iraqi Security Forces.]{.underline}34 [Retrenchment]{.underline},
then, [may narrow the gap between capabilities and commitments in the
short run, but only by inviting greater global dangers and
instability.]{.underline} VI If the United States is unwilling to spend
significantly more on defense, but does not wish to invite the
geopolitical instability associated with retrenchment, [a second option
is to live with greater risk.]{.underline} Living with greater risk
could take two different, but not mutually exclusive, forms. First, the
United States could accept higher risk [with respect to its global
commitments by wagering that even exposed commitments are unlikely to be
tested because US adversaries are risk averse and are unwilling to start
a war, even a potentially successful one, that might cause American
intervention]{.underline}. In other words, the United States might not
be able to defend Taiwan effectively, but the mere prospect of an
invasion provoking a Sino-American war would stay Beijing's hand.
Second, the United States could bridge the capabilitiescommitments gap
through riskier strategies substituting escalation for additional
resources. Most likely, this would entail relying more heavily on
nuclear warfighting and the threat of nuclear retaliation to defend
vulnerable allies in East Asia or Eastern Europe. Because US allies are
already covered by the US extended nuclear deterrent, this approach
would involve making more explicit nuclear threats and guarantees and
integrating greater reliance on nuclear weapons into US plans.
Similarly, [this approach could entail the use, or the threat of use, of
powerful nonnuclear capabilities such as strategic cyberattacks against
critical enemy infrastructure for the same
purpose]{.underline}---bolstering deterrence on the cheap by raising the
costs an aggressor would expect to pay.35 Lest these approaches sound
ridiculous, both have a distinguished pedigree. In the late 1940s, the
United States could not credibly defend Western Europe from a Soviet
invasion. But th[e Truman administration still undertook the security
guarantees associated with NATO on the calculated gamble that Moscow was
unlikely to risk global war by attacking US allies,]{.underline}
particularly during the period of the US nuclear monopoly.36 And in the
1950s, to control costs and address the continuing deficiency of US and
allied conventional forces, the [Eisenhower administration relied
heavily on nuclear threats to deter aggression]{.underline}.37
Throughout much of the Cold War, in fact, the United States compensated
for conventional inferiority---particularly in Central Europe---by
integrating early recourse to nuclear weapons into its war plans.
Accepting greater risk would mean updating Cold War-era approaches for
today's purposes. Yet substituting risk for cost entails serious
liabilities. Simply hoping exposed commitments will not be challenged
might work---for a while. But this strategy carries enormous risk of
those guarantees eventually being tested and found wanting, with
devastating effects on America's reputation and credibility. Meanwhile,
a strategy of **[bluff could weaken deterrence and reassurance on the
installment plan as allies and adversaries perceive a shifting balance
of power and understand US guarantees are increasingly
chimerical.]{.underline}** The second variant of this approach,
[embracing more escalatory approaches, lacks credibility]{.underline}.
Consider threatening to employ strategic cyberattacks against an
aggressor in a conflict over Taiwan or the Baltic states. Such threats
are problematic, because as President Obama acknowledged in 2016, "open
societies" such as the United States are "more vulnerable" to massive
cyberattacks than authoritarian rivals such as Russia or China.38
America may simply lack the escalation dominance needed to make a
strategy of cyber-retaliation believable. So too in the nuclear realm.
Threats to punish Communist aggression with nuclear retaliation might
have been credible in the 1950s, when China lacked nuclear weapons:
Washington had a massive nuclear advantage over Moscow, and neither
adversary could reliably target the US homeland. But today, both rivals
possess secure second-strike capabilities and could inflict horrific
damage on America should nuclear escalation occur. This approach thus
risks leading the United States into a trap where, if its interests are
challenged, it faces a choice between pursuing escalatory options
carrying potentially unacceptable costs and acquiescing to aggression.
**[Awareness of this dynamic may, in turn, make adversaries more likely
to probe and push.]{.underline}** Trading cost for risk may seem
attractive in theory, but in practice the risks may prove far more
dangerous than they initially seem. VII [This leaves a final
option---**significantly increasing resources devoted to defense,**
thereby bringing capabilities back into alignment with commitments
and]{.underline} **[strengthening the hard-power backbone of US
strategy.]{.underline}** Given current trends, [this strategy would
likely entail a sustained, multiyear buildup of magnitude roughly
similar to the Carter-Reagan buildup, when real defense spending
increased by around 50 percent.]{.underline} [This buildup would require
permanently lifting the Budget Control Act caps to provide increased
resources and budgetary stability.]{.underline} It would require [not
just procuring larger quantities of existing capabilities but also
investing aggressively in future capabilities geared toward defeating
great-power challengers as well as middle-tier problem countries such as
Iran and North Korea.]{.underline} And crucially, greater resources
would have to be coupled with developing innovative operational
concepts, [streamlining Defense procedures and acquisition processes,
and maximizing the Pentagon's other efforts toward effectiveness and
efficiency.]{.underline} Recent proposals demonstrate the likely
parameters of this approach. If the goal was to restore an authentic two
major regional contingency capability, [the United States might follow
the recommenda- tions issued in 2014 by the National Defense
Panel]{.underline}, which call for a force consisting, at minimum, of
490,000 active duty Army personnel and 182,000 marines, a Navy of
between 323 and 346 ships (versus 274 today), and an Air Force of
unspecified size but substantially larger than the end-strength
envisioned in late Obama-era budgets.39 If, more ambitiously, the United
States sought a two-plus or even a three-war standard, **[a more
significant buildup would be required.]{.underline}** One recent
estimate issued by Senator John McCain calls for a threetheater
force---a Navy of over 330 ships and nearly 900 frontline naval strike
fighters, an Air Force of 60 combat squadrons and 1,500 combat aircraft,
an Army of at least 490,000--500,000 active duty soldiers, and a Marine
Corps of at least 200,000 active duty marines. Because McCain's budget
reaches out only 5 years, these numbers would presumably grow further
over time.40 Another three-theater proposal by the American Enterprise
Institute advocates a 10-year expansion to 600,000 active duty Army
soldiers, over 200,000 active duty marines, a Navy of 346 ships, and an
Air Force of unspecified but significantly increased end-strength. The
number of F-22s, for instance, would rise from 185 to 450.41 [These
proposals would require significant new investments.]{.underline} The
McCain budget calls for \$430 billion in new money over 5 years,
culminating in a Fiscal Year 2022 budget of roughly \$800 billion.42 The
American Enterprise Institute proposal, issued in late 2015, calls for
\$1.3 trillion in new money over 10 years.43 All of these force
constructs reflect a high-low mix designed to enable effective
operations ranging from counterterrorism, to major conventional war
against Iran or North Korea, to high-end combat against a great-power
adversary. All the proposals include robust recapitalization of the US
nuclear triad. [And although]{.underline} these [proposals differ on
specifics,]{.underline} **[all are meant to enable a range of
investments necessary to maintaining US primacy in a more competitive
environment.]{.underline}** If [the United States were to undertake a
buildup of this magnitude, it could,]{.underline} for instance, [invest
in a more survivable, multibrigade presence in Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} [America could significantly increase investments
in capabilities]{.underline}---from additional Zumwalt-class destroyers
and nuclear attack submarines, to stealthy fighters and penetrating
long-range bombers, to vastly enhanced stocks of precision-guided and
standoff munitions, to improved air and missile defenses necessary to
retain air and sea control in high-end conflicts as well as to maintain
the upper hand in fights with Iran and North Korea.44 [This approach
would ease the tradeoffs between critical capabilities for today's
fight,]{.underline} such as the A-10, [and those critical for tomorrow's
fight]{.underline}, such as the F-35. Crucially, [this approach would
also allow aggressive development]{.underline} and production of future
technologies in areas from hypersonics to directed energy, which
currently receive seed funding but cannot be adequately fielded without
additional resources.45 Finally, this approach, particularly the more
aggressive, three-theater option, would permit the increased force
structure necessary to cover a larger number of contingencies and reduce
stress on the current force. So how viable is this option? Critics offer
four primary objections. The first critique deems this approach
unnecessary, because the Pentagon can maintain US primacy at existing
budget levels either by pursuing technological innovation and strategic
offsets or by undertaking busi- ness and acquisition reforms. The second
critique asserts a sustained, multiyear buildup will overtax the US
economy, given persistent budget deficits and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 76
percent.46 The third critique views this approach as self-defeating
because it will spur arms races with American adversaries. The fourth
critique holds this approach will incentivize continued free-riding by
US allies and partners by forcing Washington to continue subsidizing
their defense. All of these argu- ments have some logic, but none is
persuasive. The first argument---about innovation, offsets, and defense
reform---is alluring but unsatisfying. To be sure, repurposing existing
capabilities, developing high-end future capabilities to create
significant dilemmas for competitors from Iran to China, and designing
innovative operational concepts---essentially, what former Secretaries
of Defense Hagel and Ashton Carter termed the Third Offset
Strategy---are absolutely vital to restoring strategic solvency. Yet
offsets and innovation cannot by themselves compensate for the lack of
resources Washington faces in covering the range of plausible
contingencies. Moreover, any meaningful offset strategy is dependent on
significantly greater resources. As senior Pentagon officials have
acknowledged, right now the United States simply cannot field even
promising technolo- gies in numbers sufficient to have strategic impact.
"We'll do the demo, we'll be very happy with the results, \[but\] we
won't have the money to go on," Undersecretary of Defense Frank Kendall
warned in 2016.47 [Offsets and innovation are necessary for sustaining
American primacy, but they are hardly sufficient.]{.underline}
Similarly, although virtually all experts consider defense reform
essential, no one has identified a feasible reform program sufficient to
close the capabilities-commitments gap. The economic argument is also
deceptive. Although a multiyear buildup would be very expensive, it
would hardly be unmanageable. Even the most aggressive proposed buildups
would push defense spending only to 4 percent of GDP. The United States
has previously supported far higher relative defense burdens without
compromising economic performance.48 One cannot draw a perfect parallel
with earlier eras, of course, because during the 1950s America enjoyed
higher growth and lower levels of deficits and debt. But these factors
do not make a major buildup economically impossible. For one thing,
defense spending increases can actually stimulate growth. As Martin
Feldstein, a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has
noted, "Military procurement has the . . . advantage that almost all of
the equipment and supplies that the military buys is made in the United
States, creating demand and jobs here at home."49 Moreover, defense
spending simply does not drive federal spending or deficits to the
extent often imagined. In fiscal year 2016, defense consumed 16 percent
of federal spending; domestic entitlements consumed 49 percent.50 As a
result, the growth of federal debt is influenced far more by
unconstrained entitlement spending and insufficient tax revenues than by
defense outlays. Put differently, if Washington can make politi- cally
difficult decisions regarding tax increases and curbing entitlement
growth, it can spend significantly more on defense while also getting
its fiscal house in order. If, conversely, the United States is
unwilling to confront such politically difficult decisions, then the
deficit will explode, the debt-to-GDP ratio will skyrocket, and Social
Security and Medicare/ Medicaid will go bankrupt regardless of how much
or how little the country spends on defense. The third objection,
regarding intensified competition with US rivals, is also problematic.
**[It]{.underline}** **[is hard to see how increased US defense spending
could trigger an arms race with Russia or China, or Iran or North Korea,
because these countries are already developing significant military
capabilities aimed at the United States]{.underline}**. China, for
instance, has averaged double-digit annual defense spending increases
for two decades. Strenuous military competition is already underway; US
adversaries are just the ones competing most seriously. Moreover,
although increased US defense efforts, particularly if paired with
additional forward presence in Eastern Europe or East Asia, might cause
increased near-term tensions with Moscow or Beijing, over the
longer-term, failure to counter Russian and Chinese buildups and limit
their opportunities for successful coercion might well prove more
destabilizing. To be sure, Russia and China, or even Iran and North
Korea, are not powerless to respond to US capability enhancement, and
[there may come a time when Washington simply cannot preserve the
desired level of overmatch at an acceptable cost]{.underline}. [Yet in
light of the significant internal challenges---political, economic,
demographic, or all of the above--- facing each of America's
adversaries]{.underline}, [the passing of US primacy is hardly
inevitable.51]{.underline} **[Given how advantageous US primacy has
proven over the decades, America's goal should be to push that point of
unsustainability as far into the future as possible]{.underline}**. The
fourth and final objection, regarding allied free riding and the need
for a collective approach, can also be answered. US strategy has always
been a concert strategy, and so this approach certainly requires
enhanced allied efforts. Countries from Japan and Taiwan to Poland and
the Baltic states will have to spend more on defense if their situation
is not to become untenable. They will, in many cases, also have to adopt
more cost-effective and realistic defense strategies.52 But because the
United States cannot simply make this decision for its allies, the
question is which US approach will best encourage constructive changes.
And although advocates of retrenchment often argue allies will only do
more if the United States does less, [the United States has been most
successful at securing increased allied contributions when it, too, has
been willing to do more. In previous instances when NATO allies
collectively increased military spending---during the early 1950s or
under the long-term defense program of the Carter-Reagan years---they
did so as part of a broader program in which Washington also
significantly increased its contributions to European
security]{.underline}.53 Likewise, the United States elicited the best
performance from the Iraqi military and government when the American
commitment to Baghdad was greatest, during the surge of 2007--8. The
performance declined rather than improved as the US commitment was
subsequently reduced.54 In sum, [the United States may actually get the
most out of its allies and partners when those countries are reassured
of the American commitment and thus prepared to take risks of their
own.]{.underline} As the principal objections to increasing defense
resources fall away, the advantages and logic become clearer. This
approach recognizes, for instance, how beneficial US military primacy
has been in shaping a relatively stable, prosperous, and congenial
international order, and it makes the investments necessary to sustain
as much of this order as possible. [This approach provides the United
States with greater ability to meet aggression from a range of enemies
and rivals without resorting to dangerously escalatory strategies in the
most operationally demanding scenarios.]{.underline} As a result, this
approach is arguably best suited to avoid the use of force over the long
term, by averting situations in which American adversaries from Iran and
North Korea to Russia and China think aggression might pay. "Peace
through strength" is not a meaningless catchphrase; it is good strategy.
Closing the capabilities-commitments gap by dramatically increasing the
former therefore represents the best available approach.

A core premise of [deep engagement is that it prevents the emergence of
a far more dangerous global security environment.]{.underline} For one
thing, as noted above, [the United States' overseas presence gives it
the leverage to restrain partners from taking provocative
action.]{.underline} Perhaps more important, its core alliance
commitments also [deter states with aspirations to regional
hegemony]{.underline} from contemplating expansion and make its partners
more secure, reducing their incentive to adopt solutions to their
security problems that threaten others and thus stoke security dilemmas.
The contention that engaged U.S. power dampens the baleful effects of
anarchy is consistent with influential variants of realist theory.
Indeed, arguably the scariest portrayal of [the war-prone world that
would emerge absent the "American Pacifier"]{.underline} is provided in
the works of John Mearsheimer, who forecasts [dangerous multipolar
regions replete with security competition, **arms races, nuclear
proliferation** and associated preventive war temptations, regional
rivalries, and even runs at regional hegemony **and full-scale great
power war**.]{.underline} 72 How do retrenchment advocates, the bulk of
whom are realists, discount this benefit? Their arguments are
complicated, but two capture most of the variation: (1) U.S. security
guarantees are not necessary to prevent dangerous rivalries and conflict
in Eurasia; or (2) prevention of rivalry and conflict in Eurasia is not
a U.S. interest. Each response is connected to a different theory or set
of theories, which makes sense given that the whole debate hinges on a
complex future counterfactual (what would happen to Eurasia's security
setting if the United States truly disengaged?). Although a certain
answer is impossible, each of these responses is nonetheless a weaker
argument for retrenchment than advocates acknowledge. The first response
flows from defensive realism as well as other international relations
theories that discount the conflict-generating potential of anarchy
under contemporary conditions. 73 Defensive realists maintain that the
high expected costs of territorial conquest, defense dominance, and an
array of policies and practices that can be used credibly to signal
benign intent, mean that Eurasia's major states could manage regional
multipolarity peacefully without the American pacifier. [Retrenchment
would be a bet]{.underline} on this scholarship, particularly [in
regions where the kinds of stabilizers that nonrealist theories point
to---such as democratic governance or dense institutional linkages---are
either absent or weakly present.]{.underline} There are three other
major bodies of scholarship, however, that might give decisionmakers
pause before making this bet. First is regional expertise. Needless to
say, [there is no consensus on the net security effects of U.S.
withdrawal.]{.underline} Regarding each region, there are optimists and
pessimists. Few experts expect a return of intense great power
competition in a post-American Europe, but many doubt European
governments will pay the political costs of increased EU defense
cooperation and the budgetary costs of increasing military outlays. 74
[The result might be a Europe that is incapable of securing itself from
various threats that could be destabilizing within the region and
beyond]{.underline} (e.g., a regional conflict akin to the 1990s Balkan
wars), [lacks capacity for global security missions in which U.S.
leaders might want European participation, and is vulnerable to the
influence of outside rising powers.]{.underline} What about the other
parts of Eurasia where the United States has a substantial military
presence? Regarding the Middle East, the balance begins to swing toward
pessimists concerned that states currently backed by Washington---
notably [Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia---might take actions upon U.S.
retrenchment that would intensify security dilemmas]{.underline}. And
concerning East Asia, pessimism regarding the region's prospects without
the American pacifier is pronounced. Arguably the principal concern
expressed by area experts is that **[Japan and South Korea are likely to
obtain a nuclear capacity and increase their military commitments, which
could stoke a destabilizing reaction from China.]{.underline}** It is
notable that during the Cold War, both [South Korea and Taiwan moved to
obtain a nuclear weapons capacity and were only constrained from doing
so by a still-engaged United States. 75]{.underline} The second body of
scholarship casting doubt on the bet on defensive realism's sanguine
portrayal is all of the research that undermines its conception of state
preferences. Defensive realism's optimism about what would happen if the
United States retrenched is very much dependent on its particular---and
highly restrictive---assumption about state preferences; once we relax
this assumption, then much of its basis for optimism vanishes.
Specifically, the prediction of post-American tranquility throughout
Eurasia rests on the assumption that security is the only relevant state
preference, with security defined narrowly in terms of protection from
violent external attacks on the homeland. Under that assumption, the
security problem is largely solved as soon as offense and defense are
clearly distinguishable, and offense is extremely expensive relative to
defense. Burgeoning research across the social and other sciences,
however, undermines that core assumption: [states have preferences not
only for security but also for prestige, status, and other aims, and
they engage in trade-offs among the various objectives.]{.underline} 76
In addition, [they define security not just in terms of territorial
protection but in view of many and varied milieu goals.]{.underline} It
follows that [even states that are relatively secure may nevertheless
engage in highly competitive behavior. Empirical studies show that this
is indeed sometimes the case.]{.underline} 77 In sum, a bet on a benign
post-retrenchment Eurasia is a bet that leaders of major countries will
never allow these nonsecurity preferences to influence their strategic
choices. To the degree that these bodies of scholarly knowledge have
predictive leverage, U**[.S. retrenchment would result in a significant
deterioration in the security environment in at least some of the
world's key regions.]{.underline}** We have already mentioned the third,
even more alarming body of scholarship. **[Offensive realism predicts
that the withdrawal of the American pacifier will yield either a
competitive regional multipolarity complete with associated insecurity,
arms racing, crisis instability, nuclear proliferation, and the like, or
bids for regional hegemony, which may be beyond the capacity of local
great powers to contain (and which in any case would generate intensely
competitive behavior, possibly including regional great power
war).]{.underline}** Hence it is unsurprising that retrenchment
advocates are prone to focus on the second argument noted above: that
avoiding wars and security dilemmas in the world's core regions is not a
U.S. national interest. Few doubt that [the United States could survive
the return of insecurity and conflict among Eurasian powers, but at what
cost]{.underline}? Much of the work in this area has focused on the
economic externalities of a renewed threat of insecurity and war, which
we discuss below. Focusing on the pure security ramifications, there are
two main reasons why decisionmakers may be rationally reluctant to run
the retrenchment experiment. First, **[overall higher levels of conflict
make the world a more dangerous place]{.underline}**. [Were Eurasia to
return to higher levels of interstate military competition, one would
see overall higher levels of military spending and innovation and a
higher likelihood of competitive regional proxy wars and arming of
client states---all of which would be concerning, in part because it
would promote a faster diffusion of military power away from the United
States.]{.underline} [Greater regional insecurity could well feed
proliferation cascades, as states such as Egypt, Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan, and Saudi Arabia all might choose to create nuclear
forces.]{.underline} 78 It is unlikely that proliferation decisions by
any of these actors would be the end of the game: [they would likely
generate pressure locally for more proliferation]{.underline}. Following
Kenneth Waltz, many retrenchment advocates are proliferation optimists,
assuming that nuclear deterrence solves the security problem. 79 Usually
carried out in dyadic terms, the debate over the stability of
proliferation changes as the numbers go up. Proliferation [optimism
rests on assumptions of rationality and narrow security preferences. In
social science, however, such assumptions are inevitably probabilistic.
Optimists assume that most states are led by rational leaders, most will
overcome organizational problems and resist the temptation to preempt
before feared neighbors nuclearize,]{.underline} and most pursue only
security and are risk averse. Confidence in such probabilistic
assumptions declines if the world were to move from nine to twenty,
thirty, or forty nuclear states. In addition, many of the other dangers
noted by analysts who are concerned about the destabilizing effects of
nuclear proliferation---including the risk of accidents and the
prospects that some new nuclear powers will not have truly survivable
forces---seem prone to go up as the number of nuclear powers grows. 80
Moreover, **[the risk of "unforeseen crisis dynamics" that could spin
out of control is also higher as the number of nuclear powers
increases]{.underline}**. Finally, add to these concerns the enhanced
danger of **[nuclear leakage]{.underline}**, and a world with overall
higher levels of security competition becomes yet more worrisome. The
argument that maintaining Eurasian peace is not a U.S. interest faces a
second problem. On widely accepted realist assumptions, acknowledging
that **[U.S. engagement preserves peace]{.underline}** dramatically
narrows the difference between retrenchment and deep engagement. For
many supporters of retrenchment, the optimal strategy for a power such
as the United States, which has attained regional hegemony and is
separated from other great powers by oceans, is offshore balancing:
[stay over the horizon and "pass the buck" to local powers to do the
dangerous work of counterbalancing any local rising power.]{.underline}
The United States should commit to onshore balancing only when local
balancing is likely to fail and a great power appears to be a credible
contender for regional hegemony, as in the cases of Germany, Japan, and
the Soviet Union in the midtwentieth century. The problem is that
China's rise puts the possibility of its attaining regional hegemony on
the table, at least in the medium to long term. As Mearsheimer notes,
"[The United States will have to play a key role in countering China,
because its Asian neighbors are not strong enough to do it by
themselves."]{.underline} 81 Therefore, unless China's rise stalls,
"[the United States is likely to act toward China similar to the way it
behaved toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War."]{.underline} 82 It
follows that [the United States]{.underline} should take no action that
would compromise its capacity to move to onshore balancing in the
future. It [will need to maintain key alliance relationships in Asia as
well as the formidably expensive military capacity to intervene
there.]{.underline} The implication is to get out of Iraq and
Afghanistan, reduce the presence in Europe, and pivot to Asia--- just
what the United States is doing. 83 In sum, the argument that U.S.
security commitments are unnecessary for peace is countered by a lot of
scholarship, including highly influential realist scholarship. In
addition, the argument that Eurasian peace is unnecessary for U.S.
security is weakened by the potential for a large number of nasty
security consequences as well as the need to retain a latent onshore
balancing capacity that dramatically reduces the savings retrenchment
might bring. Moreover, switching between offshore and onshore balancing
could well be difficult. Bringing together the thrust of many of the
arguments discussed so far underlines the degree to which the case for
[retrenchment misses the underlying logic of the deep engagement
strategy. By supplying reassurance, deterrence, and active management,
the United States lowers security competition in the world's key
regions, thereby preventing the emergence of a hothouse atmosphere for
growing new military capabilities.]{.underline} [Alliance ties dissuade
partners from ramping up and also provide leverage to prevent military
transfers to potential rivals.]{.underline} On top of all this, **[the
United States' formidable military machine may deter entry by potential
rivals.]{.underline}** Current great power military expenditures as a
percentage of GDP are at historical lows, and thus far other major
powers have shied away from seeking to match top-end U.S. military
capabilities. In addition, they have so far been careful to avoid
attracting the "focused enmity" of the United States. 84 [All of the
world's most modern militaries are U.S. allies]{.underline} (America's
alliance system of more than sixty countries now accounts for some 80
percent of global military spending), [and the gap between the U.S.
military capability and that of potential rivals is by many measures
growing rather than shrinking. 85]{.underline}

## Uniqueness

### Uniqueness -- Generic/AT Expansion High

#### NATO structural inefficiencies deck effective co-op efforts now -- guarantees regional challenges and US leadership collapse.

**Deni 19** -- John Deni is a Professor of Joint, Interagency,
Intragovernmental, and Multinational Security Studies at the USAWC SSI,
\["*Staying Alive by Overeating? The Enduring NATO Alliance at 70,"*
Journal of Transatlantic Studies, 2019\]RA

Over the last 30 years[, NATO's evolving mission]{.underline} growth has
[exhibited]{.underline} two of the most commonly cited typologies of
organizational change---adaptive learning and [incremental
growth]{.underline}.35 The former is rational, empirically driven, and
usually efficient---organizations change by carefully studying and
modifying ends, ways, and means. The latter [may be rational but it is
**typically not efficient**]{.underline}---[new tasks are simply added
on to old ones, without any critical appraisal of purpose or
goals.]{.underline} With specific regard to the post-Cold War period, or
roughly 1990 until 2014, both of these typologies were evident. In some
cases during the 1990--2014 time period, [the alliance engaged in a
well-informed, almost methodical shift away from collective defense and
toward crisis management and cooperative security]{.underline}. For
example, NATO developed the Membership Action Plan (MAP) to build norms,
establish guidelines, and manage the admission of new member states from
Eastern Europe.36 In a similar way, [the alliance developed a robust
force generation system to manage the challenge of providing continuous
force rotations for operations in Afghanistan during an era of shrinking
resources]{.underline}.37 [In other instances]{.underline} during the
1990--2014 time period, [it seems clear that NATO's post-Cold War shift
toward crisis management and cooperative security was characterized by
incremental growth, with member states pushing tasks onto the alliance's
plate without a knowledge-mediated approach.]{.underline} For example,
**[the addition of energy security to the alliance's agenda made little
sense]{.underline}** at a time when there was (and still is) significant
divergence among the member states over what role NATO should play in
this issue area, or when there was little understanding of what
capabilities or capacity NATO could actually bring to the table.38 In
contrast to the post-Cold War 1990--2014 time period, [since Russia's
invasion of Crimea in 2014 NATO appears to have whole-heartedly
**resorted to incremental growth**]{.underline}. It has done so [by
recommitting itself to collective defense while also maintaining or even
augmenting its work in crisis management and cooperative security.
Notably, there has been no significant strategic-level reassessment of
NATO's mission set and no new Strategic Concept published since the last
was released in 2010. The alliance's embrace of an all-of-the-above
approach is largely a function of the unique principal--agent dynamic at
work within NATO and among its member states, and the complex array of
member state interests.]{.underline} As noted briefly earlier in this
article, in contrast to an international organization like the United
Nations, [NATO's potential for action independent of the interests of
its largest member states is extraordinarily limited.]{.underline}
Certainly, there are instances when NATO's international secretariat or
its Secretary General show signs of autonomy. However, [the alliance
organization's ability to exploit its limited autonomy and truly
counteract the desires of its member states is limited by several
factors]{.underline}. First, [the Secretary General's position is not a
permanent one but rather a rotating one]{.underline}---most NATO
Secretary Generals serve a single 4-year term---and the nominees are
subject to the unanimous approval of all member states. This [prevents
the development of an entrenched leader capable of making decisions
against the wishes of most member states.]{.underline} In contrast, UN
Secretary Generals are nominated by a minimum of 9 members of the UN
Security Council, including no vetoes by the five permanent members, and
then subject to a majority vote of the General Assembly. UN Secretary
Generals normally hold two consecutive 5-year terms. Second, while it is
true that the NATO International Staff consists of many permanent civil
servants[, it also is comprised of staff members temporarily assigned
there by individual allied governments.]{.underline} [This limits the
autonomy that the International Staff might otherwise
develop]{.underline} since temporarily assigned employees usually fail
to develop strong biases toward the institution they work for, or biases
that would displace their loyalties to their permanent employer back
home.39 Moreover, the International Military Staff (IMS) is comprised
almost entirely of military officials on temporary assignments. The same
holds true with regard to the Allied Command Operations based in Mons,
Belgium and the Allied Command Transformation based in Norfolk,
Virginia. At the same time, the array of sometimes disparate interests
among the various alliance member states drives much of NATO's
all-of-the-above approach. NATO exists for several reasons, such as the
fact that the alliance is a community of (mostly) liberal democracies
that share similar values. What is arguably more critical though is the
fact that the alliance continues to exist because it provides more
benefits than costs to its members---in short, it meets their security
needs, at least in part, in an efficient and effective way relative to
other options.40 Among other ways of meeting these needs, the alliance
satisfies the demands of its member states by engaging in issue areas of
interest to those member states. For instance, Spain wants security in
the Mediterranean Sea and stability in northwest Africa. Italy desires
the same as well as capacity-building in Africa. Meanwhile, Germany
wants a framework for the further development of its political and
economic power that reassures its neighbors as well as itself. France
wants increased intelligence sharing to mitigate the challenge of
returning foreign fighters. Poland wants reassurance against domination
from the East (Russia) and possibly from the West (Germany). Farther
east, the Baltic States want protection against an existential enemy.
The United States wants political legitimacy and military burden sharing
for operations near and far. The point is, [NATO's member states often
have different security interests, threat perceptions, and strategic
objectives, and yet they all look to NATO as a primary means of
fulfilling their interests and meeting their objectives.]{.underline}
Accordingly, [the alliance responds by pursuing a broadening
agenda]{.underline}. Arguably, this tendency on the part of the alliance
to pursue a broadening agenda to satisfy the sometimes disparate
interests of its member states has only gotten worse with enlargement.
Since 1997, [the alliance has steadily grown, and it seems that trend
will continue albeit at a slower rate.]{.underline} In July 2018, the
alliance decided to begin accession talks with Macedonia, and it is
possible Kosovo may follow. Less likely but still possible is membership
for Sweden or Finland, as addressed by Anna Wieslander elsewhere in this
special issue. As membership grows, definitions of 'why NATO matters'
may grow as well, and with it NATO's agenda. 39 **[The primary challenge
confronting the alliance today is that it lacks the capability and the
capacity to fulfill all of the various missions and activities that
member states wish to saddle it with]{.underline}**. European defense
budgets, on average, steadily declined through most of the post-Cold War
period, and trends have only reversed since 2014. Despite the
turnaround, that acquisition accounts are struggling to keep pace with
demand, many military units remain whole on paper only, and [readiness
continues to be underfunded.]{.underline} Additionally, even though
spending increases have been broad based, they have also been uneven.
The most significant increases have come from those countries with
relatively small military forces, while the 'big four' European NATO
members---France, Germany, Italy, and the UK, which together account for
roughly two-thirds of European NATO military spending---have been
increasing at a slower pace. [Until]{.underline} these [countries pick
up their defense spending pace, and until all of the European allies are
able to acquire the equipment, manpower, and training necessary to
fulfill their agreed upon defense plans, the alliance will continue to
struggle in its effort to achieve 'all of the above.']{.underline}

#### Increasing cooperation with NATO has grave repercussions on American foreign policy and ensures security dilemmas. It's the sole security concern -- historically proven.

University, \["*The US should compromise on Nato to save Ukraine*,\" The

If US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin do
manage to hold a summit on Ukraine, [what should Biden's approach
be]{.underline}? Biden has said repeatedly that the US is open to
diplomacy with Russia, but on the issue that Moscow has most emphasised
--- Nato enlargement --- there has been no American diplomacy at all.
[Putin has repeatedly demanded that the US forswear Nato's enlargement
into Ukraine, while Biden has repeatedly asserted that membership of the
alliance is Ukraine's choice.]{.underline} If a summit does materialise
in the days ahead, and in the planned meeting this week between US
secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei
Lavrov, **[the US should propose a guarantee that Nato will not
enlarge]{.underline}** to include Ukraine in return for a full
withdrawal of Russian forces from the Donbas region and an end to
Russian support for the independence of the two Moscow-backed separatist
regions in eastern Ukraine, a demobilisation along the Russia-Ukraine
border and an assurance of Ukrainian sovereignty. [If the US won't do
this, then France and Germany should step forward instead.]{.underline}
This would inevitably lead to cries of appeasement. [Many insist that
Nato enlargement is not the real]{.underline} issue for Putin and that
he wants to recreate the Russian empire, pure and simple. [Everything
else, including Nato enlargement, they claim, is a mere distraction.
**This is utterly mistaken.**]{.underline} [Russia has adamantly opposed
Nato expansion towards the east for 30 years,]{.underline} first under
Boris Yeltsin and now Putin. Before that, [the Soviet Union largely
opposed Nato expansion, too.]{.underline} It is easy to understand why.
**[The US would not be very happy were Mexico to join a China-led
military alliance, nor was it content when Fidel Castro's Cuba aligned
with the USSR 60 years ago. Neither the US nor Russia wants the other's
military on their doorstep. Pledging no Nato enlargement is not
appeasement.]{.underline}** It [does not]{.underline} [cede]{.underline}
Ukrainian [territory]{.underline}. [It does not undermine]{.underline}
Ukraine's [sovereignty]{.underline}. **[It would in fact help to secure
it.]{.underline}** Ukraine should aspire to resemble the [non-Nato
members of the EU: Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden.
Americans can learn much from the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis]{.underline}. As the historian Martin Sherwin showed in his book
Gambling with Armageddon, [**the crisis was resolved by a deft
compromise. The Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba
while the US agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey.** The American
public never appreciated this,]{.underline} alas, [because President
John F Kennedy insisted on keeping the US removal of missiles from
Turkey secret]{.underline}. Kennedy did not want to appear to speak for
all of Nato, and sought to protect himself from charges of appeasement
from the US right. The public therefore believed that the crisis ended
with Soviet capitulation, not compromise. Despite claims to the
contrary, [the western nations offered informal assurances to the Soviet
Union that Nato would not enlarge to the east after German
unification.]{.underline} The US and allies acted deceitfully, using
sophistical arguments to claim that previous pledges were not binding.
[It was especially reckless in 2008 for President George W Bush to open
the door to Ukraine's (and Georgia's) Nato membership.]{.underline}
Biden and the US foreign policy establishment has so far refused to
reconsider Nato enlargement for three reasons. First, they fear the
charge of appeasement. Second, the US wants the prerogative to puts its
military in any country that will have it, even if that disregards the
legitimate security concerns of neighbouring states. Third, the US
foreign policy establishment has long failed to acknowledge valid
Russian security concerns that go back to the second world war and even
earlier. Russia has long feared invasions from the west, whether by
Napoleon, Hitler or latterly Nato. [For this reason, cooler and wiser US
foreign policy strategists, including Bill Clinton's defence secretary
William Perry, the great statesman and diplomat George Kennan and former
ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, argued that **Nato
enlargement to the east after the demise of the USSR was unnecessary,
reckless and provocative.**]{.underline} If war comes, Putin would of
course deserve the blame and global opprobrium. Russia's threats are
thuggish and dangerous. Yet as misguided as the Russian actions are,
American intransigence regarding **[Nato enlargement is also utterly
misguided and risky.]{.underline}** True friends of Ukraine, and of
global peace, should be calling for a US and Nato compromise with Russia
--- one that respects Russia's legitimate security interests while fully
backing Ukraine's sovereignty.

Both Finland and Sweden are applying to join NATO. [The
Blob,]{.underline} as the foreign policy establishment has come to be
known, is ecstatic. It [cannot conceive of saying no to any alliance
applicant, no matter how insignificant or irrelevant. Once upon a time,
serious nations defended themselves, rather than begging faraway great
powers to do the job for them.]{.underline} And no serious great power
would do so unless it believed the other state to be essential for its
own security. As Great Britain's Lord Palmerston remarked, [countries
had no permanent friends, only permanent interests. **Even serious
defensive alliances could drag members into war, often against their
interests, when deterrence failed. World War I provides the most
dramatic modern example.**]{.underline} [Serbia committed an act of
state terrorism against the Austro‐​Hungarian Empire. When the latter
threatened Belgrade, Imperial Russia stood by its Slavic brethren, lest
Vienna establish dominance in the Balkans. Imperial Germany backed
Austria‐​Hungary with the infamous "blank check." France supported its
ally Russia. Great Britain feared a rising Berlin and joined its
historic enemies Paris and St. Petersburg. Other states, either feeling
threatened (Ottoman Empire) or perceiving a chance for territorial gain
(Italy) later joined in.]{.underline} [The result was continent‐​wide
catastrophe, and another much worse war just a generation later. The
latter turned America into a global power and left Washington to play
leader of "the free world," defending Western Europe and Asian
dependencies amid fears of Soviet aggression and threats posed by the
newly created People's Republic of China]{.underline}. The policy made
sense as a temporary expedient, protecting vulnerable states as they
recovered and became able to defend themselves. [**If the U.S. wants to
remain a superpower and defend its own citizens' interests, it must
learn to say no.** It wasn't just the Old Right which feared "allies"
becoming permanent defense dependents. So did Dwight Eisenhower, World
War II allied commander, first NATO military head, and U.S. president.
He warned against acting like "a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers
with our legions."]{.underline} Instead, he advocated helping "these
people \[to\] regain their confidence and get on their own military
feet." Foreign policy scholar Mark Sheetz explained that "[The purpose
of America's 'temporary' intervention in Western Europe was to eliminate
the need for 'permanent' intervention."]{.underline} However, Ike's
admonitions were forgotten as U.S. policymakers came to enjoy America
acting as the "essential power." Moreover, [foreign
governments---whether of allies, partners, friends, or otherwise
connected states---learned the useful arts of deception and
flattery.]{.underline} Defense dependents promised to do more while
planning to do less, sure that Washington would forgive them, no matter
how loud U.S. officials whined and wailed. [Allies also insisted that
freedom would disappear, a new Dark Ages would descend, and the world
would end if the U.S. ever did anything less, an argument
enthusiastically repeated by the Blob.]{.underline} Yet the
transatlantic alliance's spell over U.S. foreign policy appeared broken
when the Warsaw Pact dissolved, followed by the Soviet Union. Even
NATO's most loyal retainers feared that the alliance's time was coming
to an end, proposing that the organization shift over to handling
student exchanges and fighting the drug war. But **[creative policy
entrepreneurs came up with "out‐​of‐​area" activities, which essentially
meant bombing, invading, and occupying more distant nations which
weren't threatening NATO members.]{.underline}** Of course, [the U.S.
would do the real war‐​making, while the allies would pretend that their
assistance was essential.]{.underline} It was difficult to discern
America's interest in Serbia and Libya and Europe's interest in
Afghanistan, but all went forward as alliance campaigns. Although
European NATO members suffered casualties in the latter, none of these
wars could have been prosecuted except by Washington. Indeed, [the
Europeans ran out of missiles when fighting Libya.]{.underline} All the
while [the transatlantic alliance abandoned its role as continental
guardian and became a militarized Welcome Wagon for the detritus of the
Soviet empire. The European Union was better suited to that task, but
the U.S. did not control the E.U. Hence, Washington's preference was to
use NATO to extend America's reach.]{.underline} Unfortunately, **[this
process violated a multitude of assurances given Moscow that the
alliance would not advance ever eastward]{.underline}**. The alliance
also shifted from defense to offense, most importantly against
Yugoslavia (an enhanced Serbia, for which Russia went to war in WWI).
Although Vladimir Putin started out inclined to do business with the
West, by 2008 his patience was gone and he turned toward confrontation,
starting with Georgia. [Although NATO expansion continued, even alliance
members recognized that adding Georgia and Ukraine were steps too far:
For 14 years the allies prevaricated, simultaneously reiterating and
then ignoring promises to Tbilisi and Kyiv.]{.underline} Yet when the
Ukraine crisis began last fall, the U.S. and European NATO members
refused to state the obvious, that Kyiv would not be joining the
alliance. Doing so might have forestalled Putin's invasion. Of course,
allied irresponsibility did not justify Moscow's invasion, but
Washington and Brussels share blame for the tragic war. [With conflict
raging in Ukraine, Finland and Sweden decided that they want formal U.S.
protection as well. That comes as no surprise:]{.underline} Countries
and even movements around the world eagerly seek the great superpower's
assistance. Years ago, I was asked by ethnic Karen insurgents in
Burma/​Myanmar why Washington did not sent troops there to do what it had
recently done in Kosovo. If I faced such a regime, I also would want the
U.S. to eliminate the brutal, oppressive Tatmadaw, as the Burmese
military is known. However, [the U.S. government is not the world's 911
number]{.underline} [and should stop treating its defense guarantees as
a matter of charity.]{.underline} Sweden, in its (long ago) day a great
power, perceived no threat and reduced its military. Finland retained
tough armed forces, which proved their worth---and the Finns'
determination to protect their nation---during the infamous "Winter War"
from November 1939 to March 1940. The Soviet Union triumphed, but only
at great cost; rather than occupy Finland, like the Baltic states,
Moscow accepted territorial concessions and a pledge of neutrality.

expand in the future]{.underline}," Stoltenberg said. The technology
accelerator will be a new NATO body, tasked to bring innovative civilian
and military organizations closer together to develop cutting-edge
solutions in the realms of emerging and disruptive technologies, said
David van Weel, NATO assistant secretary general for emerging security
challenges. [The plan is for allies to agree upon a new strategic
direction every two years]{.underline}, [which will then dictate
critical defense and security problems as well as the desired
solutions.]{.underline} "This provides strong signals of market demand

so-called challenge [programs]{.underline} that work to solve real-world
problems --- such as operating in a GPS-denied environment --- [and
submit proposals]{.underline} to participate in DIANA's accelerator
effort. [Member nations submitted proposals for more than 90
institutions to be part of the DIANA footprint; after
evaluations]{.underline}, NATO pared it down to more than 10 accelerator
sites and over 50 test centers, with many already in existence, van Weel
said. [Among those selected sites are the Niels Bohr Institute at the
University of Copenhagen in Denmark, which will focus on quantum
technologies, and a new site in Turin, Italy, which will be dedicated to
the space domain. Imperial College London will host the European
headquarters]{.underline} along with a DIANA accelerator, in a space
currently housing the U.K.'s Defence and Security Accelerator, according
to the British government. [The U.K.'s program will be "twinned" with a
new accelerator based in Tallinn, Estonia]{.underline}, to help share
expertise, test cyber innovations and explore the viability of "virtual
sites" to trial new tech such as autonomous vehicles. "The UK and
Estonia are two of the most innovative countries in NATO, and our
hosting of DIANA will harness that innovation for the benefit of all
allies tackling future military threats," British Defence Secretary Ben
Wallace said in a news release. While the centers on the European side
have all been selected, the North American footprint will be announced
at the NATO Summit in June in Madrid, Spain. The goal is to have DIANA
reach its full operational capability by 2025, said van Weel. Alongside
the tech accelerator is a nascent venture capital fund, dubbed the NATO
Innovation Fund. "Ultimately, reimagining NATO's engagement with
civilian innovators is only credible if we also provide the right
funding mechanisms," van Weel noted. [Twenty-one members worked together
to establish the underlying framework of the fund]{.underline} ---
outlining the investment strategy, the pool of capital, and determining
the fund's structure and governance. They also provided initial
financial support. The Innovation Fund will invest €1 billion into
"deep-tech startups" over 15 years. These are public funds that
participating nations can allocate, either from their existing defense
budgets or established innovation funds, a senior NATO official said
Tuesday. The [participating nations]{.underline} in DIANA's innovation

Maintaining America's Biotechnology Advantage [Biotechnology in the
United States is a significant contributor to the economy. By one
estimate, in 2017, U.S. biotechnology revenues exceeded \$400 billion,
or 2 percent of gross domestic product,]{.underline} substantially
surpassing better-measured sectors such as mining. Bioeconomy revenues
have grown at an average rate of 10 percent annually for two decades.
Notably, [U.S. biotechnology revenues alone were approximately equal to
worldwide semiconductor revenues for 2017.]{.underline} [Biotechnology
now supplies critical medicines, and, as more than 90 percent of the
corn and soy grown in the United States is genetically modified,
biotechnology feeds the armed forces.]{.underline} Industrial
biotechnology is responsible for upward of 20 percent of chemicals
produced in the United States, suggesting a similar proportion of
chemicals used in the military are also biologically derived. And these
impressive figures may still be significant underestimates: Using a
different methodology, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences recently
concluded that [the biotechnology industry contributes 5 to 7 percent of
U.S. gross domestic product. Biotechnology, therefore, may already
constitute an even larger share of the military supply
chain.]{.underline} As biotechnology continues to mature[, its
contribution to physical and economic security will become even more
significant.]{.underline} Tools are now being deployed that enable the
engineering and biomanufacturing of materials that will eventually not
only displace petrochemicals but also surpass them in production scale
and performance. Over the next ten to twenty years, biological
production could soon supply up to 60 percent of physical inputs across
the global economy, and [biotechnology could have a "direct economic
impact of up to \$4 trillion a year."]{.underline} While [the United
States]{.underline} is arguably still leading in biotechnology, it
[risks losing this lead to China. In China, biotechnology is a national
development and a security matter.]{.underline} China's Innovation
Driven Development Strategy emphasizes biotechnology's essential role in
the country's economic development, while [the Military-Civil Fusion
Development Strategy seeks to ensure that biotechnology research is also
oriented toward the country's military and broader security
goals.]{.underline} Chinese biotechnology revenues are reported to be of
a similar size to those in the United States, although they are subject
to even lesser clarity in reporting. While China continues its licit and
illicit acquisition efforts targeting the U.S. biotechnology sector, it
is also shifting its attention to domestic innovation. In time, this
will provide the People's Liberation Army with new capabilities and
increase both America's and the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese
biotechnology products. Recommendations As early as 1958, the Department
of Commerce was tracking the economic contribution of semiconductors,
even though they made up less than 0.1 percent of the gross domestic
product. Yet, today, [the U.S. government has made no equivalent effort
to track the much more significant role of biotechnology. **This
illiteracy is a national security issue.**]{.underline} [American and
Chinese bioeconomies are in competition, and Beijing asserts that it is
investing with the intent to take, and to then maintain, the
lead.]{.underline} To sustain America's advantage, [the U.S. Department
of Defense should better understand its reliance on biotechnology and
increase investment in it accordingly]{.underline}. [The Pentagon's
recent investment in the BioIndustrial Manufacturing and Design
Ecosystem is a notable step in the right direction.]{.underline}
However, the seven-year budget for this project is approximately the
cost of a single F-35A. For an investment that could impact the entire
defense supply chain, this is inadequate. We recommend the following
plan of action for the Department of Defense to take its place alongside
the Departments of Commerce and State in the broader interagency effort
to secure America's biotechnology advantage. First, in close
coordination with the Department of Commerce, [the Department of Defense
should make a systematic effort to better understand the role of
biotechnology in the economy,]{.underline} supply chains, and
manufacturing. This, in turn, should inform additional oversight and
regulatory controls. The responsibility to understand, prepare for, and
respond to biotechnology threats is balkanized, spread across at least
nine departments and agencies. [Vulnerabilities in the bioeconomy will
affect the Department of Defense in terms of readiness, soldier health,
and the ability to fulfill missions. Addressing those vulnerabilities
begins with a sustained, comprehensive effort to understand the role of
biotechnology in industry today]{.underline}, as well as how that
industry contributes to defense supply chains, and how military
acquisition policy shapes biotechnology. To that end, the Pentagon
should work with the Department of Commerce to create domestic reporting
codes for biotechnology revenues and employment for the quarterly and
annual economic census, and further incorporate those codes into the
North American Industrial Classification System. Institutionalizing the
gathering of these data is the first step toward sustainable
policymaking and rational spending. [The Department of Commerce should
then consider adding import/export controls on
biotechnology,]{.underline} while avoiding overly broad restrictions
that suffocate innovation. [Protecting foundational
technologies]{.underline} using the Foreign Investment Risk Review
Modernization Act and Export Control Reform Act [will be critical for
securing biotechnology]{.underline}. However, biotechnology competition
is not exclusive to commercial activities. The Pentagon should assess
critical vulnerabilities and dependencies to assist the other agencies
in bringing China's foreign biotechnology access in line with standards
in other major markets. [The Department of Defense has been asked to
document and secure supply chains critical to defense applications and
to the overall U.S. economy. This should also apply to
biotechnology.]{.underline} Current Pentagon efforts to expand domestic
biological manufacturing capabilities are an important start, but a
broader effort is needed. An empowered deputy national security adviser
could help oversee the relationship between the Pentagon and the
National Economic Council to promote and secure the military's broader
technology needs. Second, the Department of Defense should better study
the accomplishments and intent of China, especially the Chinese
military, in developing biotechnology as a strategic technology. Once
the Department of Defense better understands critical U.S. biotechnology
dependencies on China, it can begin the work of reducing them. This
requires an interagency examination to identify cross-cutting resources,
develop mitigation strategies, formulate best practices to bolster
innovation, and expand outreach to allies and partners to reduce
systemic gaps China could exploit. Partnership with industry and allies
will allow the U.S. government to understand and counter Beijing's
efforts to distort commercial activity in its favor. To this end, [the
Department of Defense should mirror the National Security Council's
effort by creating an emerging technology portfolio within Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense-Policy.]{.underline} While other technology
offices in the Department of Defense are internally focused, an entity
in this office that concentrates externally on foundational technology
competition is required. Such an office may be able to address
uncertainties in assessments of Chinese biotechnology revenues and
capabilities. Finally, in coordination with the Department of State, the
Department of Defense should identify opportunities for dialogue with
the People's Liberation Army about biotechnology-related security
issues.

Independent Cyber Force,\"* War on the Rocks, 5-4-2021,

[Cyber is now the oxygen upon which the U.S. military depends for almost
literally every element of its vast warfighting capabilities. No
military service today can function without reliable, resilient cyber
capabilities for everything from command and control, to intelligence
analysis, to the routine functioning of every weapon system from tanks
and ships to aircraft and satellites.]{.underline} [Take away that
oxygen]{.underline}, disrupt its availability, or sow mistrust in its
integrity, and **[the whole global system of U.S. military power may
catastrophically malfunction, if not collapse.]{.underline}** What is
more, [almost every element of government, business, and civil society
today also depends on cyberspace to enable every imaginable function.
Disrupt cyberspace, and our entire society risks a plunge into
chaos.]{.underline} Yet despite this existential reliance by both
American society and the U.S. military, the nation's cyber defense,
deterrence, and offense capabilities today are fragmented and
disjointed. While the Department of Defense cannot and should not take
ownership of every aspect of this ubiquitous challenge that spans the
public and private sector alike, it must bring new focus, capacity, and
transformative change to effectively address the military dimensions of
this challenge. To do so, it needs to establish the U.S. Cyber Force as
a new military service. Two recent reports highlight the alarming perils
facing the nation from the cyber domain. [In March 2020, the
Congressionally mandated Cyber Solarium Commission framed its final
report by arguing "the status quo is not getting the job done. The
status quo is inviting attacks on Americans every second of the day. The
status quo is a slow surrender of American power and responsibility."
And this past March, the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence concluded that "America is not prepared to defend or
compete" in the era of artificial intelligence, and that the country
"will not be able to defend against AI-enabled threats without
ubiquitous AI capabilities and new warfighting paradigms."]{.underline}
Taken together, these two bipartisan efforts sound urgent alarm bells
about the ability of the United States to defend itself against the
burgeoning dangers in the virtual world, which threaten to undermine
traditional U.S. deterrence and military dominance. [The chilling
findings and wide-ranging recommendations of these two
commissions]{.underline} --- over 150 in total --- provide many
arguments that buttress the case for an independent U.S. Cyber Force
within the Department of Defense. They both highlight the need to
fundamentally rethink how wars will be fought in this century, and flag
the U.S. military's continued reliance on legacy platforms and systems
that are not AI-capable and were not designed for warfare in a digital
world. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, for
example, observes that "a new warfighting paradigm is emerging," and
pointedly states that the [Department of Defense "should not be a
witness to the AI revolution in military affairs, but should deliver it
with leadership from the top, new operating concepts, relentless
experimentation, and a system that rewards agility and
risk."]{.underline} As currently structured, the Pentagon simply cannot
meet this transformative challenge. Like the other unified combatant
commands, U.S. Cyber Command and its Cyber Mission Force draw their
personnel solely from the existing military services, each of which has
its own cyber missions and responsibilities. The services should retain
many of those personnel, since they will need to continue protecting
their own cyber networks and providing tactical cyber support to their
units on the battlefield. But the [cyber warfare domain is entirely
different from the physical domains of air, land, sea, and space that
shape the focus and warfighting priorities of the services.]{.underline}
Too often, [the services treat cyber as an enabler of more conventional
military operations in their respective domains, rather than an entirely
new and unique domain of warfare. The nation needs more capacity and
more finely honed skills in the cyber domain than the traditional
services can contribute.]{.underline} In many ways, this dynamic
parallels the struggle for an independent U.S. Air Force in the first
half of the 20th century. In that era, the Army and Navy used newly
invented airplanes to support their units and ships, rather than
exploring how airpower might be used as a separate, even decisive,
instrument of war. They successfully blocked attempts to create a
separate Air Force until 1947, after the monumental contributions of
American airpower to winning World War II were finally recognized. This
pattern is largely repeating itself today, as the services continue to
treat cyber principally as a means of advancing their legacy warfighting
capabilities rather than think imaginatively about the necessity for a
new paradigm that focuses on the revolutionary impacts of the cyber
domain on warfare. Yet at a broader level, [when no service is
specifically charged with the responsibility for thinking solely about
fighting in the cyber domain, the nation's ability to leverage its full
cyber warfare potential will forever remain fragmented and inevitably
incomplete.]{.underline} A separate U.S. Cyber Force would deeply
transform the Department of Defense and prepare it more effectively for
the challenges of future warfare. The nascent state of strategic
thinking about cyber conflict today shares many similarities with the
early days of the nuclear age, when concepts of nuclear deterrence and
warfighting were just forming. Establishing a new Cyber Force would
speed that process by catalyzing new and truly innovative thinking,
without the constraints of other service cultures, doctrine, legacy
programs, and bureaucratic preferences. [Consolidating and focusing the
Pentagon's expertise, energy, and budgetary power in a separate cyber
service would promote new thinking on cyber warfare, cyber deterrence,
and cyber defense. It would accelerate the development of AI and a range
of other cyber-specific tools and doctrines for deterrence and
warfighting in ways that the traditional armed services simply cannot
replicate. And it would create a distinct cyberspace culture inside the
U.S. military that can be both a lodestar and incubator of cyber talent
in the force, distinct from the strong service cultures associated with
war on land, in the air, and at sea.]{.underline}

After the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, [NATO expanded
eastward, eventually taking in most of the European nations that had
been in the Communist sphere. The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia, once parts of the Soviet Union, joined NATO, as did Poland,
Romania and others. As a result, NATO moved hundreds of miles closer to
Moscow, directly bordering Russia.]{.underline} And in 2008, it stated
that it planned --- some day --- to enroll Ukraine, though that is still
seen as a far-off prospect. **[Mr. Putin has described the Soviet
disintegration as one of the greatest catastrophes of the 20th century
that robbed Russia of its rightful place among the world's great
powers.]{.underline}** He has spent his 22 years in power rebuilding
Russia's military and reasserting its geopolitical clout. **[The Russian
president calls NATO's expansion menacing, and the prospect of Ukraine
joining it a major threat.]{.underline}** [As Russia has grown more
assertive and stronger militarily, his complaints about NATO have grown
more strident. He has repeatedly invoked the specter of American
ballistic missiles and combat forces in Ukraine, though U.S., Ukrainian
and NATO officials insist there are none. Mr. Putin has also insisted
that Ukraine is fundamentally parts of Russia, culturally and
historically. East-West relations worsened drastically in early 2014,
when mass protests in Ukraine forced out a president closely allied with
Mr. Putin.]{.underline} Russia swiftly invaded and annexed Crimea, part
of Ukraine. [Moscow also fomented a separatist rebellion]{.underline}
that took control of part of the Donbas region of Ukraine, in a war that
still grinds on, having killed more than 13,000 people. What does Putin
want? Mr. [Putin appears intent on winding back the clock more than 30
years, establishing a broad, Russian-dominated security zone resembling
the power Moscow wielded in Soviet days.]{.underline} Now 69 years old
and possibly edging toward the twilight of his political career, he
clearly wants to draw Ukraine, a nation of 44 million people, back into
Russia's sphere of influence. [Russia presented NATO and the United
States in December with a set of written demands that it said were
needed to ensure its security. Foremost among them are a guarantee that
Ukraine would never join NATO, that NATO draw down its forces in the
Eastern European countries that have already joined, and that the 2015
cease-fire in Ukraine be implemented]{.underline} --- though Moscow and
Kyiv disagree sharply on what that would mean. The West dismissed the
main demands out of hand. [Moscow's aggressive posture has also inflamed
Ukrainian nationalism, with citizen militias preparing for a drawn-out
guerrilla campaign in the event of a Russian occupation.]{.underline}
[The Russian leader may also want to energize nationalists at home by
focusing on an external threat, as he has in the past]{.underline}.

tough armed forces, which proved their worth---and the Finns'
determination to protect their nation---during the infamous "Winter War"

at great cost; rather than occupy Finland, like the Baltic states,
Moscow accepted territorial concessions and a pledge of

understandably unsettled Europe, [Moscow never demonstrated any interest
in reviving hostilities with Helsinki or threatening
Sweden.]{.underline} And Russia's poor military performance demonstrates
that, contra its pre‐​conflict reputation, [Moscow could not conquer its
many neighbors, let alone the entire continent, even if it desired to do
so.]{.underline} The two countries' desire to join appears to be an
attempt to get an insurance policy at America's expense, expanding still
further Washington's already lengthy list of defense dependents. If the
Duchy of Grand Fenwick was available, it would join NATO as well.
Instead, [the U.S. should be shifting responsibility for Europe's
defense to Europe, which far outranges Russia in economic strength,
population, and military outlays.]{.underline} While America patrols the
entire globe, the Europeans (and America's Asian allies as well) scrimp
on their armed forces---for instance, 19 NATO members spend less than
two percent of their GDP on defense. Today, Washington is hurtling
toward insolvency. The national debt is 100 percent of GDP, nearing the
record set after World War II. Even as the Covid‐​19 pandemic recedes,
the U.S. is running trillion‐​dollar annual deficits, with the red ink
set to increase as the Baby Boomers continue to retire, inflating
medical and retirement outlays. The Congressional Budget Office warns
that the debt to GDP ratio could hit 200 percent by mid‐​century. And now
Washington is going to subsidize Finland's and Sweden's security? The
U.S. also loses by further contributing to Russian paranoia. The
invasion of Ukraine should make obvious that Putin's oft‐​repeated
concerns about NATO expansion were real. Overturning the peaceful
Scandinavian status quo and creating another allied front just a few
score miles from St. Petersburg will encourage a response likely to
further unsettle regional security. Of course, there is little that
Russia can do directly against Helsinki and Stockholm. However, Moscow
is likely to further rely on nuclear weapons to bolster deterrence.
Putin ally (and former stand‐​in president) Dmitry Medvedev warned: "[If
Sweden and Finland join NATO, the length of the land borders of the
alliance with the Russian Federation will more than double. Naturally,
these boundaries will have to be strengthened." It would be one thing to
accept enhanced nuclear risks as a response to necessary defense
measures. But should we do so because two more wealthy European
countries desire a share of America's defense subsidy?]{.underline}
Simply joining the alliance might be only the start. [Who will help
Finland cover its 810 mile border with Russia? Already, U.S. forces in
Europe have jumped 20 percent since January to their highest level since
2005]{.underline}. Among Europe's NATO members, only the U.K. has made a
measurable, though still modest, troop contribution over the same
period. Yet Poland and the Baltic states are not satisfied with NATO's
Article 5 guarantee. They also want American (not European) garrisons to
create tripwires guaranteeing U.S. involvement in any war. Playing to
President Donald Trump's perceived vanity, Warsaw lobbied the last
administration to establish a permanent base, proposing the name "Camp
Trump." Helsinki might not want to be left out the great garrison game.
Instead of waving more applicants through NATO's door, [**Washington
should end expansion**. Nothing in the alliance or its founding
documents requires the organization to accept applications, let alone
grant them.]{.underline} To the contrary, Article 10 provides: "The
Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in
a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to
the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty." The
transatlantic alliance is supposed to take the initiative and act for
the benefit of existing members. That is, NATO was created to promote
security, not extend charity. Instead of expanding the antiquated U.S.
defense dole, the European security system should be reconstructed and
placed in European hands. [Russia's invasion of Ukraine should remind
Washington policymakers that alliances are serious commitments, which in
the past have expanded as much as diminished conflict. Equally
important, the U.S. should go to war only when forced to do so, to
defend itself.]{.underline} That was not the case with Kiev, which is
why America neither forced Ukraine's inclusion in NATO nor joined in
Ukraine's defense against Russia. If the U.S. wants to remain a
superpower and able to care for its own citizens, it must learn to say
no.

[Russian leaders and several Western policy experts were warning more
than two decades ago that NATO expansion would turn out badly---ending
in a new cold war with Russia at best, and a hot one at
worst.]{.underline} Obviously, they were not "echoing" Putin or anyone
else. [George Kennan, the intellectual architect of America's
containment policy during the Cold War, perceptively warned in a May 2,
1998 New York Times interview what NATO's move eastward would set in
motion. "I think it is the beginning of a new cold war," he stated. "I
think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will
affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake."]{.underline}
U.S. and European officials blew through one red light after another.
Kennan was speaking of [the first round of enlargement that brought into
the Alliance Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Later rounds, which
added the Baltic Republics and other East European countries, were
considerably more abrasive, and Washington's subsequent attempt to make
Ukraine and Georgia members was contemptuous of Russia's core security
interests. Moscow's complaints and warnings were becoming increasingly
sharp as well.]{.underline} Yet U.S. and European officials blew through
one red light after another. George W. Bush began to treat Georgia and
Ukraine as valued U.S. political and military allies, and in 2008, he
pressed NATO to admit Ukraine and Georgia as members. French and German
wariness delayed that endeavor, but the NATO summit communique affirmed
that both countries would eventually achieve that status. In his 2014
memoir, Duty, [Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of defense in
both Bush's administration and Barack Obama's, conceded that "trying to
bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO was truly
overreaching."]{.underline} [That]{.underline} initiative, he concluded,
[was a case of "recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their
own vital national interests."]{.underline} Indeed it was, and Moscow
began to push back. [Putin exploited a foolish provocation by Georgia's
pro‐​Western government to launch a military offensive that penetrated
deeply into the country. Upon its victory, Russia permanently detached
two secessionist‐​minded Georgian regions and put them under permanent
Russian control.]{.underline} The Kremlin's decisive action should have
alerted even slow‐​learning U.S. leaders that the days of Russian
officials merely issuing verbal protests about the West's steady
encroachment into Russia's security sphere were over. Amazingly, though,
[the Obama administration still sought to turn Ukraine into a NATO
political and military asset. In late 2013 and early 2014, the United
States and several European governments meddled shamelessly to support
the efforts of demonstrators to unseat Ukraine's generally pro‐​Russia
president, Victor Yanukovych, some two years before the expiration of
his term.]{.underline} That campaign was especially inappropriate since
Yanukovych became president in 2010 as the result of an election that
even the European Union and other international observers acknowledged
was reasonably free and fair. In a democratic system, the legal way to
remove a president from office is, depending on a specific country's
constitutional rules, through a parliamentary vote of no‐​confidence,
impeachment, or defeat in the next election. Angry street demonstrations
do not fit into any of those categories, yet the United States and its
allies backed that illegal process. A recording of the infamous leaked
telephone call between Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and
U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt confirmed the extent of
Washington's meddling in the affairs of a sovereign country. [The
Ukraine episode proved to be an intolerable provocation to neighboring
Russia. Putin responded by annexing the strategic Crimea peninsula and
the United States and its NATO partners then imposed economic sanctions
on Russia. The new cold war was on in earnest. Yet Washington still
refused to back off. Instead, the Trump and Biden administrations poured
weapons into Ukraine, approved joint military exercises between U.S. and
Ukrainian forces, and even prodded the allies to include Ukraine in NATO
war games]{.underline}. In late 2021, it became clear that the Kremlin's
restraint had run dry. Moscow issued demands for security guarantees,
including a draw‐​down of military forces already deployed in NATO's
eastern members. With respect to Ukraine, [the demand was very clear and
uncompromising: Not only would Kyiv never receive a membership
invitation, but NATO weapons and troops would never be deployed on
Ukrainian soil. When the West failed to provide those guarantees, Putin
launched his devastating, full‐​scale war. Moscow's cruel overreaction
deserves emphatic condemnation. However, the culpability of the United
States and its NATO allies also is sizable. Moving an alliance that one
great power dominates to the border of another major power is inherently
destabilizing and provocative.]{.underline}

[China warned the U.S. against trying to build what it called a Pacific
version of NATO, while declaring that security disputes over Taiwan and
Ukraine were "not comparable at all."]{.underline} Foreign Minister
[Wang Yi told his annual news briefing Monday that the "real goal" of
the U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy was to form Asia's answer to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. China has often accused the U.S. of trying
to form blocs to suppress its growth, a complaint that's likely to
attract greater attention after President Vladimir Putin cited similar
grievances before his invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} "[The perverse
actions run counter to the common aspiration of the region for peace,
development, cooperation and win-win outcomes]{.underline}," Wang added.
"They are doomed to fail." Complaints about U.S. efforts to strengthen
its alliance network in Asia were among several points of contention
raised by Wang in the almost two-hour briefing on the sidelines of the
National People's Congress in Beijing. [The senior diplomat repeatedly
alluded to the U.S. as the source of problems with countries around the
globe and issued some of China's most pointed warnings yet against calls
to expand U.S. ties with Taiwan.]{.underline} "[This would not only push
Taiwan into a precarious situation, but will also bring unbearable
consequences for the U.S. side]{.underline}," Wang said on the sidelines
of the National People's Congress in Beijing, later adding: "Taiwan will
eventually return to the embrace of the motherland." Several Asian
nations \-- like their counterparts on Russia's European frontier \--
have sought closer security ties with the U.S. to keep from being
dominated by the region's biggest player. [China has active border
disputes with neighbors including Japan, India and Vietnam and has
stepped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, sending
warplanes on some 960 forays through the island's air defense
identification zone last year.]{.underline} The Biden administration
outlined efforts to push back against growing Chinese clout in its
Indo-Pacific strategy released last month[. The U.S. has sought to build
a coalition of democracies around the world, including both traditional
treaty partners such as Japan and new grouping such as the Quad,
including also Australia and India.]{.underline} U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken criticized China in a news conference Monday hosted by
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, whose Baltic nation
has been embroiled in a dispute with Beijing over Taiwan opening a
representative office in its capital. "Beijing talks a lot about the
importance of upholding international order, stability, respecting
sovereignty," Blinken said. "But from its coercion of Vilnius to its
failure thus far to condemn Moscow's flagrant violation of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, today and in 2014,
Beijing's actions are speaking much louder than its words," he added,
referring to Moscow's earlier seizure of Crimea. Russia's attack on
Ukraine has undermined confidence that world powers would be able to
prevent a crisis from similarly erupting over Taiwan, a democratically
governed island of more than 23 million people and key global source of
semiconductors. Wang dismissed the comparisons, arguing that Taiwan is
part of Chinese territory \-- a claim President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei
has rejected. "Some, while being vocal about the principle of
sovereignty on the Ukrainian issue, have kept undermining China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan question \-- this is
a blatant double standard," Wang said. Russia launched its action in
Ukraine weeks after President Xi Jinping hosted Putin in Beijing and
publicly declared their friendship had "no limits." China has sought to
avoid taking a position in the conflict, as it attempts to balance
support for Russian efforts to challenge U.S. dominance with its
interest of being regarded as a responsible major power.

### Turns Case -- Russia Relations

#### NATO fails to solve international crisis while making relations with Russia worse 

**Cohen 17** -- Stephen Cohen is Professor Emeritus of Russian Studies
and Politics at NYU and Princeton, \["*Have 20 Years of NATO Expansion
Made Anyone Safer?"*, 10/18/2017, The Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/have-20-years-of-nato-expansion-made-anyone-safer\]

[The expansion of the US-led military alliance]{.underline}, which began
in Germany with 13 member states and now stretches to Russia's borders
with 29, [is the largest and fastest growth of a "sphere of
influence]{.underline}" (American) in modern peacetime history.
Throughout the process, [Russia has been repeatedly denounced for
seeking any sphere of security, even on its own borders. NATO expansion
included two broken promises to Russia]{.underline} that the Kremlin has
never forgotten. In 1990, [the Bush administration]{.underline} (and the
West Germany government) [assured]{.underline} Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev that, in return for Russia's agreeing to a united Germany in
[NATO]{.underline}, the alliance [would "not expand one inch to the
east."]{.underline} (Though denied by a number of participants and
commentators, the assurance has been confirmed by other participants as
well as by archive researchers.) [The other broken promise is unfolding
today as NATO builds up permanent land, sea, and air forces near Russian
territory, along with missile-defense installations. NATO "enlargement,"
as it is sometimes benignly termed by its promoters,
continues.]{.underline} Montenegro became a member in 2017 and the "door
remains open," officials say repeatedly, to the former Soviet republics
of Georgia and Ukraine. 2. NATO is more than the world's most powerful
military alliance. With lavishly funded offices, representatives, think
tanks, and other advocates not only in Brussels but in many Western
capitals, it is also a powerful political-ideological-lobbying
institution---perhaps the world's most powerful corporation, also taking
into account its multitude of bureaucratic employees in Brussels and
elsewhere. In the United States alone, scarcely a week passes without
media "news" and commentary produced by NATO-affiliated authors or based
on NATO sources. (See, among other examples, the Atlantic Council and
Newsweek.) 3. Asking whether "enlarged" NATO has resulted in more
insecurity than security requires considering the consequences of
several wars it led or in which several of its member states
participated since 1997: § The Serbian war in 1999 resulted in the NATO
occupation and annexation of Kosovo, a precedent cited by subsequent
secessionists and occupiers. § The 2003 Iraq War was a catastrophe for
all involved and a powerful factor behind expanding organized terrorism,
including the Islamic State, and not only in the Middle East. The same
was true of the war against Libya in 2011, no lessons having been
learned. § NATO promises that Georgia might one day become a member
state was an underlying cause of the Georgian-Russian war of 2008, in
effect a US-Russian proxy war. The result was the near ruination of
Georgia. NATO remains active in Georgia today. § Similar NATO overtures
to Ukraine also underlay the crisis in that country in 2014, which
resulted in Russia's annexation of Crimea, the still ongoing Ukrainian
civil war in Donbass, and in effect another US-Russian proxy war.
Meanwhile, US-backed Kiev remains in profound economic and political
crisis, and Ukraine fraught with the possibility of a direct
American-Russian military conflict. § Meanwhile, of course, there is
Afghanistan, initially a NATO war effort but now the longest (and
perhaps most un-winnable) war in American history. Any rational
calculation of the outcomes of these wars, Cohen points out, reveals far
more military and political insecurity than security, which is mainly
pseudo-security or simmering crises. 4. [NATO expansion has also bred
political-ideological insecurities. NATO's]{.underline} incessant,
ubiquitous media saturation and [lobbying in Western
capitals,]{.underline} particularly in the United States, [has been a
major driving force behind the new Cold War and its rampant Russophobia.
One perilous result has been the near-end of American diplomacy toward
Russia and the almost total militarization of US-Russian relations. This
alone is a profound source of insecurity---indeed of possible war with
Russia.]{.underline} 5. Meanwhile, [the vast resources devoted to NATO
expansion have scarcely contributed anything to resolving real
international crises, among them economic policies in
Europe]{.underline} that have helped inspire secessionist movements;
[international terrorism]{.underline} in the Middle East [and the
refugee crisis; the danger of nuclear proliferation, which NATO has
abetted by spurring a new nuclear arms race with Russia]{.underline};
and others. [Nor does NATO's vast expansion resolve its own internal
crises, as,]{.underline} for example, the [growing alliance between NATO
member Turkey and Russia; and undemocratic developments in other member
states such as Hungary and Poland. And this leaves aside the
far-reaching implications of an emerging anti-NATO alliance centering
around Russia, China, and Iran---itself a result of NATO's 20-year
expansion.]{.underline} 6. Cohen ends by considering the
counter-arguments made by NATO expansion promoters over the years: §
They say the small Baltic and other Eastern European countries
previously victimized by Soviet Russia still felt threatened by
post-Soviet Russia and therefore had to be brought into the alliance.
This makes no empirical sense. In the 1990s, Russia was in shambles and
weak, a threat only to itself. And if any perceived or future threat
existed, there were alternatives: acting on Gorbachev's proposed "Common
European Home"---that is, a security agreement including all of Europe
and Russia; bilateral security guarantees to those once-victimized
nations, along with diplomacy on their part to resolve any lingering
conflicts with Russia, including the endangered status of their own
ethnic Russian citizens. This argument makes no historical sense either:
The tiny Baltic states near Russia were among the last to be granted
NATO membership. § It is also said that every qualified nation has a
"right" to NATO membership if it wishes to join. This too is illogical.
NATO is not a non-selective fraternity or the AARP. It is a security
organization whose sole criterion for membership should be whether or
not membership enhances the security of its members. From the outset, it
was clear, as many Western critics pointed out, it would not. § Later,
it is belatedly argued, Russia did become a threat under its leader
Vladimir Putin. But as the British academic specialist Richard Sakwa has
compellingly argued, any threat Russia now poses was created by NATO
itself, by Moscow's reactions to NATO expansion. Cohen puts this
somewhat differently: Much of what is today denounced as "Putin's
aggression" abroad has been his responses to US and NATO policies. There
is also another negative consequence. Moscow's perception that it is
being increasingly encircled by an "aggressive" US-led NATO has had
lamentable, and predictable, influence on Russia's domestic politics.
[For the sake of international security, NATO expansion must end
now.]{.underline} But is there a way back from the 20-year folly, Cohen
asks. Member states taken in since the late 1990s cannot, of course, be
expelled. But NATO expansion could be demilitarized, its forces
withdrawn back to Germany, from which they crept to Russia. This may
have been possible in the late 1990s or early 2000s, as promised in
1997. Now it is mostly a utopian idea, but one without which the world
is in ever graver danger---a world with less and less real security.

[President Vladimir Putin accused Western nations of ignoring key
Russian security concerns, following the U.S.′ refusal last week to
concede to Moscow's demands over Ukraine and NATO. "It's already clear
now \... that fundamental Russian concerns were ignored]{.underline},"
Putin said at a press conference Tuesday, according to a Reuters
translation. **[Putin said that the U.S. wanted to "contain Russia" and
that it was using Ukraine to do that, as he reiterated Russia's position
that any possible membership of Ukraine in NATO would "undermine
Russia's security."]{.underline}** "[Let's imagine that Ukraine is a
NATO member, it is fully packed of weapons, it gets advanced attack
means like those in Poland and Romania and it starts an operation in
Crimea,"]{.underline} Putin said, describing Crimea, a part of Ukraine
annexed by Russia in 2014, as a "sovereign Russian territory." ["Let's
imagine that Ukraine is a NATO member state and it initiates a military
operation. What should we do then, \[should we\] fight against the NATO
bloc? Did anyone think at least something about that? Apparently
not."]{.underline} Nonetheless, [Putin said he hoped dialog over Ukraine
would continue and that a way needed to be found to, as he put it,
"protect everyone's security."]{.underline} His comments followed talks
with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, with whom Putin shares
friendly ties, in Moscow. It's the first time that Putin has commented
publicly about the geopolitical crisis in weeks, despite a flurry of
diplomatic meetings and calls between Russian and Western officials.
While over 100,000 Russian troops remain stationed at various points
along Russia's border with Ukraine, there remains heightened concerns
that Putin could be poised to give his troops a greenlight to invade
Ukraine. Russia has denied it is planning an invasion, but trust in
Russia's word has been low ever since it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in
2014, and supported pro-Russian separatists in the Donbass region in
eastern Ukraine. [Political analysts believe that Russia wants to
maintain its sphere of influence and power over former Soviet states and
to stop Ukraine's gravitation toward the West. **Russia has insisted
that it just wants to protect its security interests, particularly in
the face of an expanded NATO that has deployed military hardware to
eastern Europe**]{.underline}. On the build-up of troops along its
border with Ukraine, Putin has previously insisted late last year that
Russia has a right to move its troops wherever it likes within its
territory. The Kremlin has accused the West of stirring up "hysteria"
over Ukraine. Putin's comments comes after Russia made a series of
security proposals to the U.S. in December, including its main demands
that NATO does not expand further to the east or admit Ukraine to the
military alliance. It would also like to see NATO rollback its military
deployments in eastern Europe. Putin echoed that position on Tuesday,
stating that missile launchers in Romania and Poland, both of whom are
NATO members, "are a threat to Russia." Last week, [the U.S. responded
to those demands, refusing to accept Russia's key proposals over Ukraine
and NATO.]{.underline} Still, it signaled a willingness to continue
discussions aimed at calming tensions, and said there could be room for
compromise in some areas potentially. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Antony Blinken was due to speak to Russia's Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov. Russia's official response to the U.S. remains unknown,
at this point, although it has reportedly delivered a written response
to the U.S. Putin's meeting with Orban Tuesday comes as European leaders
step up their engagement with Moscow with Putin already having spoken to
French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi
this week. On Wednesday, he is due to speak to British Prime Minister
Boris Johnson, who was visiting Ukraine Tuesday. Putin has not publicly
commented on Ukraine since Dec. 23, according to the New York Times,
which noted that he had chided a British journalist who asked, during
Putin's annual news conference, whether he would guarantee that Russia
would not invade Ukraine. ["It was the United States that came with its
missiles to our home, to the doorstep of our home," Putin
said.]{.underline}

Did the United States promise the Soviet Union that it would freeze NATO
expansion? [Russian officials say that the U.S. government made a pledge
to Soviet leaders not to expand the alliance's eastern borders, a
commitment they say came during the flurry of diplomacy following the
fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and surrounding the reunification of
Germany in 1990.]{.underline} Proponents of this narrative often cite
the words that U.S. Secretary of State James A. [Baker said to Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in February 1990, that "there would be no
extension of NATO's jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the
east." They say the United States and NATO have repeatedly betrayed this
verbal commitment in the decades since, taking advantage of Russia's
tumultuous post-Soviet period and expanding the Western alliance several
times, all the way to Russia's doorstep in the case of the Baltic
states.]{.underline} However, many Western analysts and former U.S.
officials involved in these discussions dispute what they say is a
selective view of history. They point out that, in early 1990, the focus
of the diplomacy between the so-called Two Plus Four (East and West
Germany plus the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and the United
Kingdom) was the future of Germany and the question of whether the
soon-to-be unified country would be part of NATO. (West Germany was
already an alliance member, while East Germany was part of the
Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact.) They say that the discussions were not
about NATO's long-term plans for eastward expansion, which would have
made little sense at that time; the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union
still existed, and there was scant indication they would dissolve as
quickly as they did, in a matter of months. In a 2014 interview,
Gorbachev said as much: "The topic of 'NATO expansion' was never
discussed. It was not raised in those years." [The diplomacy between
U.S. and Soviet leaders during this period focused on Germany and
included discussions of various post-unification security options,
including the potential for Germany to become part of both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact, for Germany to be nonaligned, and even for the Soviet Union
to join NATO.]{.underline} Early in the talks, Soviet leaders insisted
that a unified Germany never become part of NATO, though they eventually
accepted Germany's right to decide for itself. Similarly, the United
States stepped back from Baker's initial language on not expanding
"NATO's jurisdiction," which he reportedly used only in the discussion
about whether NATO troops would be based in what was then East Germany.
In the end, the treaty recognizing German unification that the Two Plus
Four powers signed in the summer of 1990 stipulated that only German
territorial (non-NATO) forces could be based in East Germany while
Soviet forces withdrew. After that, only German forces assigned to NATO
could be based there, not foreign NATO forces. The treaty doesn't
mention NATO's rights and commitments beyond Germany. How did NATO
feature in diplomacy between U.S. and post-Soviet Russian leaders? Some
experts point to another pivotal moment to help explain the mistrust
between Russia and NATO today: the 1993--94 discussions between the Bill
Clinton administration and the Russian government led by Boris Yeltsin.
By this point, the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union had collapsed, and the
Clinton administration was seeking to craft a new security architecture
in Europe that would help foster and fortify the continent's fledging,
post-Soviet democracies, including Russia. Some in the Clinton
government, as well as Central European countries such as the Czech
Republic and Poland, wanted to move quickly and start expanding NATO's
membership eastward. However, most Clinton officials reportedly did not,
being wary that expansion would rankle Russian leaders at a fragile,
transitional moment and detract from other U.S. foreign policy
objectives, such as nuclear arms control. Instead, Clinton chose to
develop a new NATO initiative called the Partnership for Peace (PfP),
which would be nonexclusive and open to all former Warsaw Pact members,
as well as non-European countries. Seeing this non-membership framework
as a compromise of sorts, in October 1993, U.S. diplomats proposed it to
Yeltsin, who eagerly accepted. (Just days before, Yeltsin, with the
Russian military's support, forcefully put down an attempt by parliament
to oust him.) NATO launched PfP at its annual summit in January 1994,
and more than two dozen countries, including Georgia, Russia, and
Ukraine, joined in the following months. However, [Clinton soon began
speaking publicly \[PDF\] about expanding NATO's membership, saying in
Prague just days after the launch of PfP that "the question is no longer
whether NATO will take on new members but when and how."]{.underline}
[Yeltsin warned Western leaders at a conference in December of that year
that "Europe, even before it has managed to shrug off the legacy of the
Cold War, is risking encumbering itself with a cold peace."]{.underline}
Clinton subsequently made efforts to allay Yeltsin's concerns: pushing
off enlargement until after the Russian leader was reelected in 1996,
inviting Russia to join the Group of Seven, and establishing a formal,
non-adversarial forum for Russia-NATO diplomacy. B[ut analysts say that
NATO's expansion in the ensuing years would leave deep scars on the
Russian psyche. "For many Russians, most importantly Vladimir Putin, the
1990s were a decade of humiliation, as the United States imposed its
vision of order on Europe]{.underline} (including in Kosovo in 1999)
[while the Russians could do nothing but stand by and
watch,"]{.underline} James Goldgeier, an expert on NATO-Russia
relations, wrote for War on the Rocks. [The Russian government, led by
Putin, continued to be wary of NATO expansion in the 2000s.]{.underline}
Putin expressed doubts that the alliance, which grew its fastest in
2004, would be effective in tackling the security challenges of the day,
including international terrorism and the conflict in Afghanistan. [Many
new members, particularly the Baltic countries, saw NATO membership as a
shield against their former Soviet rulers.]{.underline} In the years
that followed, [Putin grew increasingly outspoken in his displeasure at
NATO's inroads into Eastern Europe, saying at a high-profile speech in
Munich in 2007 that "it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any
relation with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring
security in Europe. On the contrary, it represents a serious provocation
that reduces the level of mutual trust."]{.underline} In the summer
following NATO's 2008 Bucharest Summit, where NATO stated its intent to
admit Georgia and Ukraine, Russia invaded the former. [Six years later,
as Kyiv stepped closer to an economic partnership with another Western
bloc, the European Union, Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed
Crimea.]{.underline}

A **[return to multi-polarity will therefore imply more instability
among great powers]{.underline}**. But [great power rivalry will not be
the only source of possible instability for the future multi-polar
world]{.underline}. [The current distribution of power allows not only
great powers but also middle, **small powers and non-state actors** to
have military capabilities that could threaten the global
security]{.underline}. In particular, the presence of nuclear weapons
constitutes a further reason of concern and implies that the future
world could carry not only the potential instability of multi-polarity
and great powers rivalry, but also the dangers entailed in nuclear
proliferation. [The future multi-polar world will thus be potentially
more unstable than all the other multi-polar periods history has
experienced until nowaday]{.underline}s: [for the first time in history,
the world could become both multi-polar and nuclear.]{.underline} While
some scholars argue that nuclear deterrence "could reduce the
war-proneness of the coming multi-polar system" (Layne, 44-45), [the
majority of them consider]{.underline} [the presence of nuclear weapons
as a source of instability]{.underline} (McNamara; Rosen; Allison). In
particular, regional powers and states that are not great powers armed
with nuclear capabilities could represent a cause of concern for global
security. [A **nuclear Iran** could for example attack -- or be attacked
-- by Israel and easily involve in this war the rest of the
world]{.underline} (Sultan; Huntley). [A **war between Pakistan and
India**,]{.underline} both nuclear states, [**could result in an**
**Armageddon**]{.underline} for the whole Asia. [An attack]{.underline}
from the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Japan or South
Korea [will trigger an immediate reaction from the US and "a nuclear
proliferation 'domino effect']{.underline} in East Asia" (Huntley, 725).
[**Terrorists armed with nuclear weapons** could wreak havoc and target
the heart of the most powerful countries]{.underline} of the world (Bunn
and Wier). Iran, Pakistan, DPRK, terrorist groups will rarely be great
powers or poles in a future multi-polar world. [Nevertheless, the
effects of their actions could easily reverberate all over the globe and
represent another cause of potential instability]{.underline}. For the
first time in history, the stability of the future world will therefore
depend not only on the unpredictable effects of the rivalry among great
powers, but also on the dangerous potential of middle and small powers
and non-state actors armed with nuclear weapons.

In [1990, Charles Krauthammer declared a "[unipolar
moment](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1991-02-01/unipolar-moment),"
arguing that "the center of world power is the unchallenged superpower,
the United States." To many observers, the word "moment" (or
"[illusion](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/is3102_pp007-041_layne.pdf)")
seemed an apt description of the durability of U.S.
hegemony.]{.underline} International Relations (IR) theory---especially
[neorealism](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/sipa/U6800/readings-sm/Waltz_Structural%20Realism.pdf)---predicts
that the unbalanced power of a unipolar international system should
catalyze the emergence of new great powers and a quick return to
balance-of-power politics, in order to limit the power of the preeminent
state and restore the system to its "natural" state of multipolarity.
Today,
[[many](https://www.amazon.com/Post-American-World-Fareed-Zakaria/dp/039306235X)
[analysts](https://www.amazon.com/No-Ones-World-Council-Relations/dp/0199325227)

unipolarity is [coming to an
end](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/is3102_pp007-041_layne.pdf)]{.underline}---even
if the "moment" lasted longer than originally expected. The 2008 global
financial crisis revealed cracks in the [economic
foundations](https://www.amazon.com/The-Rise-Fall-Great-Powers/dp/0679720197)
of U.S. hegemony, especially when compared to a number of more spritely
"emerging economies." The United States also shows signs of "[war
weariness](http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lang=en&id=134242)"
after over a decade of military escapades in Afghanistan and
Iraq---evidenced by its more restrained military policy with respect to
political instability in the Middle East (e.g. Libya and Syria), and the
transition of its "War on Terror" into a [drone
war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/somalia/2013-06-11/why-drones-work)
waged from a Nevada bunker. Most importantly, [the long-awaited return
to balance-of-power politics has finally arrived: two champions, China
and Russia, have emerged to counter-balance the United States and
restore proper equilibrium to the international system.
Right?]{.underline} Wro[ng. Despite the "[rise and fall of the unipolar
concert](https://www.ciaonet.org/catalog/33648)," China and Russia's
balancing strategies have backfired: they are not leading to
multipolarity, but are actually **reinforcing
unipolarity**.]{.underline} The reason is [that China and Russia's
balancing strategies have focused on regional
"revisionism,]{.underline}" which has [provoked powerful responses in
East Asia and Europe to contain th]{.underline}em. This [modern version
of
[containment](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/1947-07-01/sources-soviet-conduct)
is a diffuse reaction by China and Russia's threatened neighbors, but it
has centered on strengthening the U.S.-led alliance systems in East Asia
and Europe in order to maintain the regional status quos. The United
States is therefore the main strategic beneficiary of Chinese and
Russian balancing, which is likely to lead to a long "unipolar
moment."]{.underline}

### Unipolarity Key

#### unipolarity generates great power peace 

Daniel W. **Drezner 14**, professor of international politics at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, nonresident
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, 2014, "Bucks for the Bang?
Assessing the Economic Returns to Military Primacy," in A Dangerous
World?: Threat Perception and U.S. National Security, ed. Preble and
Mueller, p. 201-205

William [Wohlforth has made the strongest theoretical
argument]{.underline} for that position in the post-Cold War era. He
argues, contrary to balance-of-power theorists, [that]{.underline}
[unipolarity is the most stable and peaceful of all possible
international systems]{.underline}: \"[Unipolarity favors]{.underline}
the [absence of war among the great powers and comparatively low levels
of competition for prestige or security]{.underline} for two reasons:
[the leading state\'s power advantage removes the problem of hegemonic
rivalry from world politics, and it reduces the salience and stakes of
balance of power politics]{.underline} among the major states.\"47
Wohlforth has expanded on that argument in later work, applying social
identity theory to explain the durability and peaceful nature of
unipolarity.48 Regardless of the causal mechanism, [once a military
hegemon emerges]{.underline}, all of those [international relations
theories posit]{.underline} that [the world should be much more secure,
peaceful, and prosperous]{.underline}. [With a preeminent military
superpower, other states have less incentive to engage in arms
races]{.underline}, brinksmanship, [or security rivalries]{.underline}.
Consequently, [more resources are allocated for economic growth, which
creates a]{.underline} [virtuous circle of greater growth and greater
peace]{.underline}.

The empirical evidence for that causal mechanism is stronger than for
the imperial rents argument---although there are significant qualifiers.
On one hand, the literature rejects the notion that hegemony is a
necessary condition for an open global economy.\'1\" Indeed, the
existence of a liberal hegemon alone is not even necessarily a
sufficient condition; supporter states also play a crucial role in the
spread of economic openness.50 Although the precise causal mechanisms
remain disputed, it is, nevertheless, true that hegemonic eras are
strongly correlated with lower trade barriers and greater levels of
globalization.51

Furthermore, [there is direct evidence that the exercise of military
power to protect sea-lanes boosts global trade
flows]{.underline}---though the magnitude of the effect is disputed. The
presence of naval forces during times of militarized disputes has
reduced market expectations of supply disruptions.52 It could be argued
that concerns about energy disruptions have been overstated, however;
world oil markets have rapidly adjusted to price spikes, even when U.S.
military intervention was absent.33 [The benefits of hegemonic military
power can]{.underline} also [be seen when analyzing the naval reaction
to the post-2008 surge in Somali piracy]{.underline}. Attacks spiked
after the financial crisis and peaked in 2011. Attacks remain at an
elevated level after peaking in 2011, but their success rate has fallen
markedly. Between 2011 and 2012, the number of successful global piracy
attacks declined by 67 percent. The presence of multinational naval
patrols---including the U.S. Navy---in the most vulnerable sea-lanes has
helped matters. Improved private security on board commercial tankers
appears to have helped even more, however.54

The [historical evidence]{.underline} further [suggests]{.underline}
that [global and regional systems with a sole superpower
have]{.underline} [lower levels of arms races and violent
conflict]{.underline}. In [one empirical review of the
literature]{.underline}, Daniel Geller [concluded]{.underline}, \"[The
only polar structure that appears to influence conflict probability is
unipolarity.]{.underline} Examinations of pre-Westphalian regional
systems also support that finding.56 For example, the East Asia region
had a clear hegemon in China from the start of the Ming dynasty to the
peak of the Manchu dynasty. The result was a period of remarkable
political stability. Countries in the region refrained from attacking
China and each other; Beijing refrained from converting its hegemony
into an expanding empire.\" Except for moments of Chinese stagnation,
war was extremely rare during that period; indeed, it was so rare that
Chinese international relations scholars now extol that tianxia era as a
model for the future of global order.58

[The post-Cold War era offers further evidence for]{.underline} [reduced
security rivalries and greater stability in a hegemonic world
order]{.underline}. The [Human Security Report Project]{.underline} has
tracked violent conflict in the post-1945 era, and its [data are
incontrovertible]{.underline}---[there has been a marked and secular
decline in interstate violence since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}.31\' [There has been a further decline in other forms
of violence]{.underline}, such as civil war and extrajudicial killings.
[Consistent with the logic of unipolarity]{.underline}, [global military
expenditures declined dramatically following the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}. Global expenditures on defense as a percentage of
global output averaged 5.1 percent between 1972 and 1990. Over the past
decade---despite the global \"war on terror\"---defense expenditures as
a percentage of global output have averaged only 2.5 percent.60 [The
peace dividend from the shift to unipolarity has been
significant]{.underline}.

[Military primacy alone is not the sole cause]{.underline} [of that
decline]{.underline}. [A growing body of work suggests that the
post-Cold War decline is merely the continuation of a long-term secular
trend toward less violence]{.underline}.61 Still, even scholars
advancing that long-term argument acknowledge the role that U.S.
military hegemony plays. Joshua Goldstein, for example, attributes part
of the decline in violent conflict to \"the end of the cold war, and to
a unipolar world order with a single superpower to impose its will in
places like Kuwait, Serbia, and Afghanistan. . . . \[A\] unipolar world
is inherently more peaceful than the bipolar one where two superpowers
fueled rival armies around the world.\"62

There are two significant caveats, however. The first reservation is
that eventually the cost of maintaining global public goods catches up
to the sole superpower. Other countries will free-ride off the hegemon,
allowing them to grow faster. Technologies diffuse from the hegemonic
power to the rest of the world, facilitating catch-up. Chinese analysts
have posited that those phenomena are occurring right now, allowing
China to outgrow the United States.6\"1

The absence of burden sharing is particularly acute on the military side
of the public goods equation. Eugene Gholz and Daryl Press argue that
the costs of a forward military presence outweigh the gains to the
United States from global stability.64 Nuno Monteiro observes that the
United States has been at war in 13 of the 22 post-Cold War years---a
marked contrast to pre-1989 levels.65 Those military operations might
have prevented wider wars from breaking out, but the United States pays
the price in blood and treasure. The costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan
operations have exacted a significant toll on America\'s fiscal
health---more than \$3 trillion to date, with an estimated \$4-\$6
trillion total for those conflicts.66

The second caveat is whether military power alone is the primary driver
for the public goods benefits of unipolarity. [Most scholars
who]{.underline} attempt to [determine the presence of unipolarity do
not rely solely on military measures to make that
assertion]{.underline}. [The literature on measuring state power relies
on multiple metrics]{.underline}. Joseph Nye has repeatedly referred to
power in world politics as a \"three-dimensional chessboard\" that
comprises military, economic, and \"soft power\" dimensions. Scholars
who debate the persistence of American unipolarity include, at a
minimum, both economic and military measures of power.67

[Hegemony relies on multiple channels of power. That]{.underline} fact
[matters because the]{.underline} [primary causal mechanism]{.underline}
[through which unipolarity leads to peace and prosperity is the
elimination of uncertainty]{.underline}.68 [When hegemony is
uncontested]{.underline} and is acknowledged by all major actors,
[secondary states have less of a need to attempt to balance or to engage
in status-seeking behavior.]{.underline} Indeed, even scholars who argue
for the persistence of unipolarity acknowledge the importance of
preeminence across a variety of power metrics. Wohlforth notes:

The theory suggests that it is not just the aggregate distribution of
capabilities that matters for status competition but also the evenness
with which key dimensions---such as naval, military, economic, and
technological---are distributed. Uneven capability portfolios---when
states excel in different relevant material dimensions---make status
inconsistency more likely. [When an actor possesses some attributes of
high status but not others, uncertainty and status inconsistency are
likely]{.underline}. The more a lower-ranked actor matches the
higher-ranked group in some but not all key material dimensions of
status, the more likely it is to conceive an interest in contesting its
rank and the more likely the higher-ranked state is to resist.\"9

[If Wohlforth\'s logic is accurate, then]{.underline} [military power
alone does not explain the reduction of conflict]{.underline} [or
security rivalries in the post-Cold War era. It is the]{.underline}
[combination]{.underline} [of military and]{.underline} [economic
supremacy]{.underline} [that leads to]{.underline} [peace and
prosperity. For unipolarity to yield]{.underline} positive economic
benefits through [systemic stability]{.underline}, [it must
be]{.underline} [full-spectrum unipolarity]{.underline}.

That observation is problematic for the present and future. As
previously noted, [a broad-based consensus holds that the military
primacy of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will remain
uncontested]{.underline} for the next decade at least; indeed, even
extrapolating current trends, it is far from clear whether Chinese
military spending will catch up with the United States in the next
generation.70 [U.S. economic primacy is another question
entirely]{.underline}, however. Multiple private-sector and
public-sector estimates assert that China will overtake the United
States within the next decade. The International Monetary Fund projects
that China\'s GDP will overtake that of the United States, as measured
using purchasing power parity, by the year 2016. At least one estimate
posits that China has already overtaken the U.S. economy in purchasing
power parity.71 China has been increasingly willing to use its economic
power to influence its near abroad, such as withholding rare-earth
exports to Japan after a Chinese fishing boat captain was seized in
disputed territorial waters.72 It has also attempted to use its economic
power to influence U.S. economic policy.73

[China\'s economic rise has reintroduced uncertainty into assessments
about the global distribution of power]{.underline}. That perceptual gap
is revealed in the different national responses to the April 2012 Pew
Global Attitudes survey.74 On the one hand, when asked to name \"the
world\'s leading economic power,\" only Turkey and Mexico had a majority
of respondents name the United States. On the other hand, in five of the
original G-7 economies, strong majorities or pluralities named China as
the world\'s leading economic power. In other words, an increasing
proportion of the developed and developing world thinks that economic
primacy has shifted to China. One could argue that elites are immune
from mass misperceptions; U.S. policymakers interpret China\'s rise
differently.7. But that does not appear to be the case here. Both public
rhetoric and private diplomatic discourse suggest that U.S. policymakers
share that view of China\'s new economic status with the global
public.76

That perception is wrong. [By any objective assessment]{.underline},
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [remains the world\'s
largest and most powerful economy]{.underline}; [it is]{.underline} also
[more appropriate to measure economic power by market exchange rates
rather than by purchasing power parity]{.underline}.77 Furthermore,
[there are excellent reasons to doubt the straight-line extrapolation of
China\'s economic ascent.]{.underline}78 Still, according to
Wohlforth\'s logic, the shift in perceptions alone should lead to
increases in status-seeking behavior by China. And, indeed, that
argument parsimoniously explains the Sino-American relationship since
the start of 2009.7P In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis,
China challenged the security status quo. In early 2009, Chinese ships
engaged in multiple skirmishes with U.S. surveillance vessels in an
effort to hinder American naval intelligence-gathering efforts.80
Beijing responded angrily and forcefully to the awarding of the 2010
Nobel Peace Prize to activist Liu Xiaobo. China reacted to routine U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan with extremely hostile rhetoric and threats to
sanction U.S. firms. China refused to condemn North Korea for sinking
the South Korean ship Cheonmi, frustrating Japan and South Korea. In
response to pushback from the United States and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations on the South China Sea at the 2010 ASEAN
Regional Forum, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi responded by
lecturing other participants that \"China is a big country and other
countries are small countries, and that\'s just a fact.\"81

### No Alt to Heg 

#### Decline causes war---Thucydides' trap

**Allison 15** -- Graham Allison is a former director of the Harvard
Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and
a former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for policy and plans,
\["*The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?*", 2015,
<https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/>\]

[And yet 100 years on, World War I offers a sobering reminder of man's
capacity for folly. When we say that war is "inconceivable," is this a
statement about what is possible in the world---or only about what our
limited minds can conceive? In 1914, few could imagine slaughter on a
scale that demanded a new category: world war]{.underline}. When the war
ended four years later, Europe lay in ruins: the kaiser gone, the
Austro-Hungarian empire dissolved, the Russian tsar overthrown by the
Bolsheviks, France bled for a generation, and England shorn of its youth
and treasure. A millennium in which Europe had been the political center
of the world came to a crashing halt. [The defining question about
global order for this generation is whether China and the United States
can escape Thucydides's Trap. The Greek historian's metaphor reminds us
of the attendant dangers when a rising power rivals a ruling power---as
Athens challenged Sparta in ancient Greece, or as Germany did Britain a
century ago. Most such contests have ended badly, often for both
nations, a team of mine at the Harvard Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs has concluded after analyzing the historical
record. In 12 of 16 cases over the past 500 years]{.underline}, the
result was war. When the parties avoided war, it required huge, painful
adjustments in attitudes and actions on the part of not just the
challenger but also the challenged. Based on the current trajectory,
[war between the United States and China in the decades ahead is not
just possible, but much more likely than recognized at the moment.
Indeed, judging by the historical record, war is more likely than not.
Moreover, current underestimations and misapprehensions of the hazards
inherent in the U.S.-China relationship contribute greatly to those
hazard]{.underline}s. A risk associated with Thucydides's Trap is that
business as usual---not just an unexpected, extraordinary event---can
trigger large-scale conflict. When a rising power is threatening to
displace a ruling power, [standard crises that would otherwise be
contained,]{.underline} like the assassination of an archduke in 1914,
[can initiate a cascade of reactions that, in turn, produce outcomes
none of the parties would otherwise have chosen.]{.underline}

[The liberal world order is **under assault**]{.underline}. Polls
suggest an American ambivalence about upholding the rules-based global
system. Populists are besieging governing elites in the West while
Russia works strategically to destabilize European and American
governments through propaganda and proxies. [A rising China wants to
create a global system that is not U.S.-centric]{.underline}, one [in
which]{.underline} [smaller powers defer to bigger ones]{.underline} and
norms of democracy and rule of law do not prevail. Meanwhile, the U.S.
alliance system looks adrift while competitors in China and Russia
appear to be on the march. If it holds, [this trend could produce a
**spheres-of-influence world**]{.underline} --- [which]{.underline}
many, including the current presidents of the United States,
[China]{.underline}, [and Russia]{.underline}, [find **intuitively
attractive**]{.underline}. But were such an order to replace one based
on global integration and American leadership in the geopolitical
cockpits of Europe and Asia, [it would only engender **insecurity** and
**conflict**]{.underline}. [In a spheres-of-influence

United States would go back to a "Monroe Doctrine" version of grand
strategy; [Russia would dominate]{.underline} the [former Soviet
space]{.underline}; [China would govern East Asia]{.underline}, [and
India South Asia]{.underline}. The problem with this kind of order,
however, is several-fold. Too many **[spheres overlap]{.underline}** [in
ways that would **generate conflict**]{.underline} [rather than clean
lines of responsibility]{.underline}. [Japan would oppose Chinese
suzerainty in East Asia, including by **developing nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}; [India and China would **compete
vigorously**]{.underline} [in Southeast Asia]{.underline}; [Russia and
China would **contest the resources** and loyalties of Central
Asia]{.underline}; [Europe and Russia would clash over primacy of
Central and Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [The Middle East would be an
even more likely arena for **hot war** between Saudi Arabia and
Iran]{.underline}, [and Turkey would contest regions]{.underline} also
[claimed by Russia]{.underline}, [Europe]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
possibly [China]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline}, like the Soviet
Empire before it, [would keep pushing west until it met enough hard
power to stop it]{.underline}. [A spheres of influence
world]{.underline} [would]{.underline} also **[sharpen great power
competition]{.underline}** [outside of each region]{.underline}.
[Regional hegemony is a **springboard** for global
contestation]{.underline}. [China would be more likely to challenge the
United States out-of-area if it had subdued **strategic
competition**]{.underline} in its own region. [Russia]{.underline}, like
the Soviet Empire before it, [would keep pushing west until it met
enough hard power to stop it]{.underline}. (The fact that Russian troops
marched through Paris during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the
limits of Russian power need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact).
American leaders have long understood that a "Fortress America" approach
is a source of national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in
a series of "fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in
World War II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters. A [spheres-of-influence
world would]{.underline} also **[crack up]{.underline}** [the integrated
global economy]{.underline} that underlies the miracle in human welfare
that has lifted billions out of poverty in past decades. [It would
replicate the **exclusive economic blocs**]{.underline} [of the
1930s]{.underline}, [including an East Asia]{.underline} "co-prosperity
sphere," [seeding conflict and undercutting prosperity]{.underline}. A
real-world and real-time example of what happens when American power
retreats in an effort to encourage regional powers to solve their own
problems is the mess in Syria. It has produced the greatest refugee
crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the consciousness of human
civilization --- and has led many to conclude that the Middle Eastern
order of states dating to the end of World War 1 is collapsing.
President Obama pursued an express policy of retracting American
military power from the Middle East, including withdrawing all troops
from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily when President Assad used
chemical weapons against his own people, despite a red-line injunction
from the United States not to do so. Obama and his White House political
advisors believed that American withdrawal from the Arab Middle East (if
not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel) would lead a new
balance of power to form, one policed by regional powers rather than by
America. [This flawed]{.underline}, amoral, and **[un-strategic approach
has led to a series of hot wars ]{.underline}**--- in
[Syria]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[Yemen]{.underline} --- the [collapse of Arab allies' confidence in the
United States as an ally]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} an
[**intensified cold war** with Iran]{.underline}. [Despite the

[Iran's support for terrorism and hostile insurgencies targeting
American allies across its region actually intensified during this
period]{.underline}. A [spheres-of-influence]{.underline} world [leaves

[aggressive ones]{.underline}, and [it seeds insecurity by]{.underline}
[removing the reassuring variable of American military guarantees and

[become arenas of great-power conflict]{.underline} (like the South
China Sea already has thanks to China's militarization and unilateral
assertion of sovereignty over it) [as leading states seek to incorporate
them into their privileged zones of control]{.underline}, [economic
globalization would **collapse**, harming the economies of every major

a world that is an idealized vision of America itself --- one ruled by
laws, norms, institutions, markets, and peaceful settlement of disputes.

### Heg Solves Conflict

#### Wars only escalate in a multipolar world.

**Nilsson 21** -- Marcon Nilsson is an Associate Professor of political
science at the School of Education and Communication at Jonkoping
University, \[*"The Magnitude of Warfare Revisited---System Polarity and
War Duration"*, 2021
<https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1885&context=jss>,
acc 7/18/21\]

21 Accordingly, this article presents the first theoretical discussion
of the connection between polarity and war duration. Contrary to Haas
and Levy, it argues that multipolarity is more likely to be associated
with increasing war duration. The argument is based on a two-stage
process derived from the realist and rational-choice perspectives. [The
first stage determines what types of wars are likely to emerge given
different forms of systemic polarity, while the second stage determines
how fast a bargaining space potentially emerges to resolve these
conflicts. In the first stage, systemic polarity has an impact on what
types of wars are likely to erupt. As Monteiro pointed out, unipolarity
often produces conflict "between the unipole and recalcitrant minor
powers."]{.underline} 22 [Such a selection bias is likely to create an
imbalance in the belligerents' military capabilities, which makes it
easy for the unipole to defeat the minor power.]{.underline}
[Example]{.underline}s of such asymmetric confrontations that give rise
to short wars [include]{.underline} the [Kuwait]{.underline} War of 1991
[and]{.underline} [the Iraq War of 2003]{.underline}. This [selection
bias is unlikely to be as great in bipolarity because of the strict
alliance structures]{.underline} or spheres of interest that the two
poles' conflicting interests can create. For example, [an attack on Iraq
and the Kuwait War became possible only after the weakening of the
Soviet Union led to a foreign policy change in Moscow and ultimately to
the end of the Cold War. However, with more poles, external balancing by
means of alliances becomes more flexible as the number of available
alliance partners increases. As Snyder argued, "in a multipolar system,
who allies with whom is structurally indeterminate...each state is
logically eligible to be either friend or enemy of any other
state."]{.underline} 23 [Indeed, if unipolarity increasingly brings
asymmetric conflicts, the role of a balancer becomes more prominent in
multipolarity, which creates symmetric wars. Especially after the
Napoleonic wars, and even earlier, Great Britain played the role of a
balancer within the European multipolar system and could throw its
support behind one side at one time, and behind another side at another
time.]{.underline} 24 [Such balancing]{.underline} in multipolarity
[increases war duration]{.underline} by creating symmetric conflicts in
which the warring parties are more equal in power and find it difficult
to quickly defeat each other. [While asymmetric conflicts can end
without long negotiations, as the stronger side can quickly override the
weaker side, symmetric conflicts more often involve the process of
creating a bargaining space, that is, finding a mutually acceptable
negotiated solution. Polarity can affect the duration of this process,
as the amount of information that the systemic structure provides about
the expected outcome of a war varies. Mearsheimer argued that the
international state system "is peaceful when it is obvious that the
costs and risk of going to war are high, and the benefits of going to
war are low" and that the distribution of power between states "is at
the heart of this incentive structure]{.underline}." 25 Fearon further
developed this rational-choice perspective, claiming that as fighting is
costly and risky, "rational states should have incentives to locate
negotiated settlements that all would prefer to the gamble of war." 26
[His answer to this puzzle of why rational states start wars relies on
the widespread uncertainty in anarchy: Rational state leaders start wars
when they miscalculate due to both a lack of information and
disagreement about relative power.]{.underline}

[Despite living in a time where there is a global surplus of food,
millions of people around the world are still suffering from
famine]{.underline}. If you follow [mainstream media]{.underline}
coverage about these humanitarian disasters, they're most likely
[presented through the lens of climate change, high food prices and
taxes.]{.underline} But in places like Yemen, South Sudan, the Lake Chad
basin of West Africa and Somalia, where images of skeletal children have
become commonplace several countries in Africa and the Middle East, [it
is perhaps no coincidence that the epidemic of famine is directly linked
to modern-day colonialism and imperialism led by the U.S.]{.underline}
[It is in this part of the world where resource exploitation, the war on
terror, military occupation and destabilization combine to create one of
the most dire humanitarian crises of the modern era.]{.underline} While
environmental factors do play a role, [policies set by powerful oil
companies and state actors have created and reinforced the present
situation]{.underline}. In Somalia, where the U.S. has been waging a
covert drone war, people have become accustomed to famine. In a span of
just one year, [between 2011 and 2012, over 260,000 people
died]{.underline}, [half of them under the age of 5, marking the worst
famine in the last 25 years]{.underline}. According to data from
Somalia's Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU), [4.6
percent of the total population and 10 percent of children under 5 died
in southern and central Somalia alone]{.underline}. The organization
Somalia's Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) found that
["the result was widespread livestock deaths, the smallest cereal
harvest since the 1991-94 civil war, and a major drop in labor demand,
which reduced household income."]{.underline} [Compounding environmental
burdens were the wider impacts of British colonialism in Somalia, as
well as U.S. militarism]{.underline}. While the United States plundered
Somalia for resources by way of mineral excavation and so-called oil
exploration, past and present administrations have also applied their
full military might. [In 1993, during the Clinton presidency, images of
famine and war were used to convince Americans that U.S. military
efforts were necessary.]{.underline} "We went \[to Somalia\] because
only the United States could help stop one of the great human tragedies
of this time," Clinton said. "In a sense, we came to Somalia to rescue
innocent people in a burning house." [What Bill Clinton didn't disclose
was that the United States was one of the reasons why the house was on
fire to begin with, and military efforts would not help to put out the
flames.]{.underline}

https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security\]RA

The Alliance's Achievements in Cyber So Far [Over the past fifteen
years, NATO's approach to cyber issues has evolved from addressing cyber
defense in primarily technical terms to viewing it as essential to the
alliance's strategic context]{.underline}. **[The need to "strengthen
capabilities and to defend against cyberattacks" was first acknowledged
by allied leaders at their 2002 summit meetings in
Prague.1]{.underline}**919NATO, Prague Summit Declaration, November 21,
2002. However, [after Estonia's digital infrastructure was hit by
cyberattacks in 2007, NATO admitted that a confrontation between states
might involve a cyber dimension, and at the Bucharest Summit in 2008
adopted its first cyber-defense policy]{.underline}. The 2008 conflict
between Russia and Georgia demonstrated that cyberattacks have the
potential to become a major component of conventional warfare. In
parallel[, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE)]{.underline} was accredited as a NATO Centre of Excellence in
2008. Since then, it [has grown into a strong, international knowledge
hub for cyber defense, bringing together top cyber experts across
fields---government, military, industry, and academia---from 29 nations
for interdisciplinary research, training, and exercises in four focus
areas: technology, strategy, operations, and law. The]{.underline}
[center connects a trusted community of like-minded states who wish to
share information and expertise in cyber security. CCDCOE's best-known
projects are Locked Shields, one of the world's largest and most
comprehensive cyber-defense exercises; the annual cyber conference
CyCon; and the Tallinn Manual, which looks at cyber operations within
the context of international law. At the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago,
allied leaders reaffirmed their commitment to improving the alliance's
cyber defenses by bringing all of NATO's networks under centralized
protection.]{.underline} At the 2014 Wales summit, [**NATO recognized
that international law applies in cyberspace and declared that, since
the impact of a cyberattack could be as harmful to modern societies as a
conventional attack, cyber defense is a part of NATO's collective
defense mandate. Thus, NATO acknowledged that cyberspace is an
operational domain for potential adversaries.** NATO's 2016 Warsaw
summit resulted in a declaration recognizing that cyberspace has evolved
into a separate domain of military operations,]{.underline} in which the
alliance "must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on
land, and at sea." The subsequent roadmap included the drafting of a
NATO cyber operations doctrine, as well as the development of military
cyber capabilities. In January 2020, the Allied Joint Doctrine for
Cyberspace Operations was published "to plan, execute, and assess
cyberspace operations in the context of allied joint
operations."2020NATO, Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations,
January 2020. At the Warsaw summit, [NATO]{.underline} heads of state
and government [signed a Cyber Defence Pledge, in which they outlined
how nations protect their cyber networks]{.underline}. NATO developed
detailed questionnaires and metrics related to the pledge and uses them
to regularly report on how each nation delivers on its cyber
commitments. Allies also discussed how to strengthen the cyber component
of NATO's Command Structure. The Command Structure is the military
backbone of the alliance; it is what makes NATO unique. NATO has
continuously adapted its Command Structure over the past decades to take
account of a changing security environment. In February 2018, NATO
defense ministers established the Cyberspace Operations Centre (CyOC) as
part of NATO's SHAPE Command Structure, with the aim of integrating the
allies' cyber capabilities into NATO military-operations planning. The
"eyes and ears" of the respective commanders in cyberspace, CyOC aims at
enhancing situational awareness in cyberspace and helping integrate
cyber into NATO's planning and operations at all levels. [CyOC is the
first cyber-dedicated entity within the Command Structure. The "eyes and
ears" of the respective commanders in cyberspace, CyOC aims at enhancing
situational awareness in cyberspace and helping integrate cyber into
NATO's planning and operations at all levels.]{.underline} While CyOC
operates within the existing NATO frameworks, its main aim is to equip
the Supreme Allied Commander Europe with any necessary tools to operate
in cyberspace.2121Wiesław Goździewicz, "Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided
Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA)," Cyber Defense, November 11, 2019. As
CyOC moves toward initial then final operating capacity, it will be
critical that it is staffed with sufficient---and sufficiently
expert---personnel.2222NATO, NATO\'s Role in Cyberspace, February 19,
2019. [During NATO's July 2018 summit, the allies affirmed, for the
first time, their determination "to employ the full range of
capabilities, including cyber, to deter, defend against, and counter the
full spectrum of cyber threats," shifting away from securing cyberspace
with defensive measures only.]{.underline} The "full range" of cyber
capabilities means that both defensive and offensive capabilities can be
deployed by NATO, in line with its defensive mandate and in accordance
with international law. As NATO will not develop or acquire any
offensive capabilities, it will rely, like in other operational domains,
on the voluntary contributions of allies. [In late 2020, a team of
experts appointed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and chaired
by Thomas de Maiziere of Germany and Wes Mitchell of the United States
gave their recommendations on how NATO could enhance its political role
and better coordinate military tasks and political strategies among its
members. In 2021, Stoltenberg's NATO 2030 included eight of those
recommendations to guide the revision of NATO's Strategic
Concept.23]{.underline}

#### The link is not unique or NATO's quantum and DIANA plans should have caused the impact -- affects entire emerging tech sector

**Naujokaityte and Burke 22** - Goda Naujokaitytė and Fintan Burke are
frequent contributors to Science\|Business and emerging technology
analysts, \[*"NATO to launch €1B fund for high tech start-ups in dual
use technologies,\"* Science\|Business, 4/1/2022,
https://sciencebusiness.net/news/nato-launch-eu1b-fund-high-tech-start-ups-dual-use-technologies\]RA

[NATO has launched a new research programme called DIANA to bring
industry, start-up companies and academia together to research new
dual-use technologies that address both societal problems and national
security issues. The Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic (DIANA) is focusing on technologies such as artificial
intelligence, big data processing, quantum-enabled technologies,
autonomy, biotechnology, novel materials and space.]{.underline} In its
initial stage[, DIANA will run a network of more than 10 accelerator
sites and over 50 test centres in innovation hubs across NATO alliance
countries.]{.underline} [The aim is to give innovators the means to
bring dual use technologies closer to the market. No budget for the
network has been announced yet, but pilot activities will start as early
as summer 2023, with the aim of being fully up and running in 2025.
There is also a complementary €1 billion venture capital fund for early
stage start-ups.]{.underline} Tomas Jermalavičius, head of studies at
the Estonia-based think tank International Centre for Defence and
Security (ICDS), says this marks a notable shift in the alliance's
stance on innovation. "[It's almost a revolutionary step. Creating this
NATO structure shows flexibility and ability to take advantage of all
the capacities that exist in the private sector, where innovations are
born]{.underline}," he said. [Until this point, the alliance has only
supported applied research through the Collaboration Support Office in
Paris, leaving a gap in support for translating technologies to the
market.]{.underline} The bid to spruce up its innovation capabilities
predates the Russian invasion and was agreed on at the 2021 NATO Summit
in Brussels. The fleshed out plans for DIANA were published last week,
following a meeting of NATO defence ministers. This is not the only
military research announcement to pop up in the past weeks, with the US,
Australia and UK setting out the AUKUS Quantum arrangement which eyes
expanded quantum, hypersonic and other joint weapons research.
Technology dominance [**The nine technologies NATO wants to advance are
AI; data and computing; autonomy; quantum-enabled technologies;
biotechnology and human enhancements; hypersonic technologies; space;
novel materials and manufacturing; and energy and propulsion.** These
are all strategic for NATO if it is to maintain technological dominance.
Losing grip was one of the drivers for DIANA]{.underline}, Jermalavičius
says. [The bid for technology dominance over countries like China and
Russia is also a driver for DIANA's goal of shortening the technology
development cycle, especially when it comes to software, AI and
quantum.]{.underline} "It's a long horizon, but capabilities do not
appear overnight," said Jermalavičius. The plan is for DIANA to launch
challenge calls for non-dilutive financing that does not require
start-ups to give up equity or ownership in their company. Mentoring,
technology testing and potential contract opportunities will be
available to go hand in hand with the financing. This will be delivered
through network of innovation hubs across the alliance. One such site is
the Big Data for Smart Society Institute (GATE) based in Bulgaria. An
official at GATE said that the institute's work in DIANA will focus on
digital health, intra governmental communications and using data in
industry and city infrastructure. One focus will be on disinformation
research. However the official noted [DIANA is still in its early
stages]{.underline}. Talks are ongoing with NATO to flesh out exactly
how cooperation will work between research centres, the national
government, and the NATO secretariat. The approved charter stipulates
some details, though others are still to be discussed, for example the
affiliated centres of the network and the points of contact between
them. [The official said that many of these are likely to be finalised
at a meeting at the end of June.]{.underline} Host institutions Last
week, **[the UK and Estonia were announced as the hosts of the European
part of DIANA.]{.underline}** The Estonian accelerator will be based in
Tallinn, while Imperial College London will host the UK headquarters at
its Translation & Innovation Hub, from where the Institute for Security
Science and Technology will lead Imperial's work in DIANA. The UK
headquarters is also supported by the UK Defence and Security
Accelerator (DASA), which funds projects that have uses in defence and
security. The accelerator works with major defence companies and the US
Department of Defence's Tri-Service Office. [The UK and Estonian
accelerators are to support start-ups working on dual-use technologies
with funding and expertise.]{.underline} Researchers will also be able
to use facilities such as the Defence BattleLab in Dorset, UK, a test
centre that has air and sea ranges to test defence equipment. A DASA
representative said research at the UK headquarters is likely to focus
first on AI and autonomy, which is a focus of DIANA as a whole. Over
time the UK site could to expand into biotechnology and materials. Nine
accelerators are foreseen in Portugal, UK, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia,
Italy, Turkey, Greece, and Czech Republic. Most European NATO members
will host test sites, of which there will be 47 in total, except for
France, Lithuania, and five Balkan countries, Slovenia, Croatia,
Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia. Quantum in Denmark **[Denmark
is leading DIANA's quantum bid, with an accelerator to be located at the
Niels Bohr Institute at Copenhagen University]{.underline}**. The
Technical University of Denmark, Aarhus University and the Danish
National Metrology Institute will also provide test centres and
manufacturing facilities. For now, the goal is to augment the overall
quantum capacities in the alliance, rather than focus on dual-use
technologies. "The main mission here is to augment the entire NATO
alliance within quantum technology," said Jan Westenkær Thomsen, head of
the Niels Bohr Institute. [Denmark has been one of the leaders in
quantum physics since the 1920s,]{.underline} when Bohr and his
colleague Max Planck put forward the quantum theory. This deep expertise
in quantum has resulted in many spin out companies, Thomsen noted. In
the coming months, Thomsen and his colleagues will be hashing out the
details of the centre with NATO. One of the universities' goals is to
use the know how of Denmark's biotechnology accelerator at the
Copenhagen Bio Science Park to reinforce the quantum counterpart. [There
will also be cooperation with other DIANA centres.]{.underline} "This
was already an integral part. I'm hoping this will be a main theme in
negotiations with NATO," said Thomsen. Thomsen hopes the DIANA project
will start delivering in five to ten years time, and he is positive
about its potential. "It's of course difficult to say at this stage, but
it's a great idea to pull resources from the whole NATO alliance
together," he said. "I'm pretty sure this will really change something
for the better." Multi-sovereign venture capital Before DIANA is up and
running, the €1 billion Innovation Fund is expected to start making
awards to start-ups developing dual-use technologies at the beginning of
next year. **[NATO says the fund will be, "the world's first
multi-sovereign venture capital fund".]{.underline}** It will be a
patient investor, giving companies uninterrupted support for 15 years to
scale up innovations. [NATO also intends to invest in the funds of
venture capital firms that are already investing in technologies the
alliance wants to promote.]{.underline}

Trump's diatribes are not the only cause of the unease[. A broadening
chorus of realist strategists claims that the United States is overdue
for]{.underline} a major strategic [retrenchment and that it is past
time for Europe to tend its own garden]{.underline}. Even staunch
defenders of NATO express doubts about its future. Some worry that the
growing U.S. preoccupation with East Asia will lure the United States
away from its Atlantic calling and generate transatlantic tensions over
how to deal with the rise of China. Others fear that democratic
backsliding among members is compromising the alliance's values-based
solidarity. Close NATO watchers are concerned that EU efforts to more
deeply integrate European foreign and defense policy could ultimately
weaken the Atlantic link. And debate rages on both sides of the Atlantic
as to whether NATO enlargement has enhanced or eroded European stability
and whether to continue expansion despite the costs to the West's
relationship with Russia. [These worries are unwarranted]{.underline}:
[NATO at 70 is actually in remarkably good shape]{.underline}. [Yes,
European allies have been laggards on defense spending]{.underline}, and
some members---Hungary, Poland, and Turkey in particular---have
tarnished democratic credentials. [But NATO has demonstrated an
impressive ability to adapt to the changing geopolitical
environment]{.underline} since the Cold War's end, [ensuring that the
United States and Europe remain each other's go-to
partners]{.underline}. The alliance opened its doors to the new
democracies that emerged from the former Soviet bloc, helping to anchor
security and democracy in a wider Europe. Since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014, members have taken important steps to strengthen
deterrence against the Kremlin's adventurism. NATO has struck
partnerships across the globe and carried out ambitious missions well
beyond the territory of member states---most notably in the Balkans,
Afghanistan, and Libya. All the while, [the alliance has retooled to
address new hazards such as cyberthreats, terrorism, hybrid warfare, and
migration]{.underline}. Precisely because NATO has been so nimble and
effective, it enjoys strong political support on both sides of the
Atlantic, leaving Trump virtually alone as a vociferous critic.

This assumption contradicts events of recent months and the historical
record. While Vladimir Putin has claimed that his goal is keeping
Ukraine out of NATO, he also insisted that he was just conducting
military exercises. Instead, he is invading Ukraine again. He likewise
insisted in 2014 that he wasn't capturing Crimea, despite the presence
of his unidentified "Little Green Men" and his subsequent annexation of
the peninsula, or that he was not fighting in Ukraine's Donbas area in
the east all these years, despite all evidence to the contrary. [There
is no reason to take Putin at his word. His Feb. 21 diatribe conferring
Russian recognition of independence for the two eastern Ukrainian
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and his order for Russian troops to move
in as ostensible "peacekeepers" shows clearly his disdain for diplomatic
resolutions.]{.underline} Moreover, **[this is not even primarily about
NATO.]{.underline}** NATO's eastward expansion may have played a role in
straining the relationship between Russia and the West, but mainly
because, for Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly abandon it for the
greener pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung. However, [Putin's
rhetoric and actions over almost two decades reveal that his goals
extend beyond imposing neutrality on Ukraine or even staving off further
NATO expansion.]{.underline} **[The larger objective is to re-establish
Russian political and cultural dominance over a nation that Putin sees
as one with Russia, and then follow up by undoing the European
rules-based order and security architecture established in the aftermath
of World War II.]{.underline}** Given these goals, Ukrainian neutrality
is a woefully insufficient concession for Putin. [If Russia's main
concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have reacted with rhetoric
and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after each step in the NATO
expansion process.]{.underline} [The largest wave of NATO's eastward
expansion took place in March 2004,]{.underline} when seven Eastern
European countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic states.
Russia "grumbled," as the New York Times put it then, by adopting a Duma
resolution criticizing the expansion, but [no hostile and sustained
rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement as a Western plot against
Russian interests.]{.underline} In 1997, [Ukraine's President Leonid
Kuchma signed the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and
Ukraine, and in 2002, he publicly declared Ukraine's interest in NATO
membership, to little opposition from Russia]{.underline}. The NATO
membership issue has ebbed-and-flowed within Ukraine, as presidents
alternated in power who were either more pro-Western or more
pro-Russian. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko advocated during his
2005-2010 tenure for Ukraine to be granted a NATO membership action plan
(MAP), a program of preparation for entry into the alliance, while
successor President Viktor Yanukovych backed away from the idea after
2010. Russia did not respond to any of these pro-NATO moves by Ukrainian
presidents with military threats and aggression. [Russia knows further
NATO expansion to the east is highly improbable because certain alliance
members have long balked at the prospect]{.underline}, making the
required consensus impossible to attain. [Russia also has an
authoritarian ally within NATO, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán,
who can help stave off any future consensus]{.underline}, and other NATO
members such as Germany and France do not support membership for
Ukraine, Georgia, or other post-Soviet states. [The security guarantee
that Russia demands now goes much further than membership
issues]{.underline}. Putin's Feb. 21 speech shows he perceives any
security cooperation between Ukraine and NATO, from modernization of
airports to training exercises, as a "knife to \[Russia's\] throat."
Even after a new pro-Western government in Ukraine that followed the
2014 incursions again embraced the goal of NATO membership and Ukrainian
public support for such a move rose, Ukraine's accession was that much
more unlikely because of the alliance's reluctance to embrace new
members embroiled in territorial disputes**[. If Putin's main concern
now was to keep Ukraine out of NATO, he had nothing to fear in 2014,
when he first invaded Ukraine and had even less to fear in 2021, when he
embarked on the current escalation.]{.underline}** If Not NATO, What is
Putin's Escalation About? A longer look at [Putin's]{.underline} two
decades in power shows that, above all, he [fears political competition
in the neighborhood.]{.underline} W[hen mass protests over rigged
elections swept across the post-Soviet space in 2003-2005,]{.underline}
toppling the Georgian and Kyrgyz incumbents and preventing the
pro-Russian candidate from taking office in Ukraine, [the Kremlin
exploded with fiery rhetoric about Western-backed anti-Russian
plots.]{.underline} A recent book on conspiracy theories in the Russian
media since 1995 shows that the 2003-2005 "color revolutions" were the
top source of conspiratorial, anti-Western narratives. All 1997-2002
NATO enlargement summits are lower in the ranking of analyzed events.
American realists have long argued that Russia was too weak to strike
back with actions, but evidence shows that the Kremlin did not react
with strong rhetoric either. [Instead of decrying NATO expansion, Russia
prioritized complaints about Western political "meddling" in its
neighboring countries, by which Russia meant U.S. and European support
for domestic democratization drives.]{.underline} In 2014, when Russia
annexed Crimea and instigated an armed insurgency in eastern Ukraine,
NATO membership for Ukraine hadn't even been on the agenda. Rather, the
spark for Russia was the ouster of the increasingly authoritarian
pro-Russian President Yanukovych, following months of street protests.
Those "Euromaidan" protests had erupted after Yanukovych backpeddled,
following pressure and bribery from Russia, from signing a trade
agreement with the European Union. So why was 2014 so concerning to
Russia that it chose to invade[? Given Putin's rhetoric]{.underline}

Russian society and destabilize Putin's increasingly consolidated
authoritarianism]{.underline}. Research on the color revolutions and on
the third wave of democratization in the region shows that this
neighborhood effect was real. In other words, **[it's not NATO at its
doorsteps that's so concerning to the Kremlin, but political
competition, because it threatens authoritarian stability and introduces
prospects of democratization.]{.underline}**

China Is Not Russia Russia under Putin has repeatedly dispatched its
armed forces for combat missions overseas to a range of countries,
including Georgia, Syria and Ukraine, as well as conducted major
military interventions against other states, most recently Kazakhstan
(albeit at the invitation of that country's president). [Moscow has also
actively supported armed groups and militias in some of these same
countries and others.]{.underline} [Although China has also been active
and assertive in the use of its armed forces beyond its borders in
recent years,]{.underline} **[Beijing has eschewed large-scale combat
operations]{.underline}**. Around its periphery, China has engaged in
provocations, confrontations and even violent clashes[. But
China,]{.underline} unlike Russia, [has refrained from massive
interventions, invasions or occupations of other countries since it
invaded Vietnam in 1979. China's largest deployments of troops overseas
in the post-Cold War era have been on U.N. Peacekeeping
missions.]{.underline} Whereas Russia has more than 20 military
installations beyond its borders, to date, **[China has only one
official military base on foreign soil]{.underline}** --- in Djibouti
(established in 2017) --- and a handful of other facilities it does not
formally acknowledge. Of course[, Beijing has a history of using its
potent armed forces and muscular coercive apparatus within China's
borders]{.underline} to repress vigorously peaceful protesters,
political dissidents and disaffected ethnic minority peoples. The
locations of these operations include Beijing, Tibet and Xinjiang, as
well as Hong Kong. China has also not hesitated to employ armed force
and a wide array of coercive instruments around its periphery. This
includes building roads and bunkers in remote frontier areas of the high
Himalayas along its contested border with India and constructing
artificial islands and military installations in disputed waters of the
South China Sea. In recent years, [China's armed forces have also
engaged in deadly clashes and violent confrontations with Indian army
units along the disputed Line of Actual Control and harassed and rammed
the fishing boats and coast guard vessels of Vietnam, the Philippines
and other countries.]{.underline} Putin appears to relish projecting the
image of a strongman who is routinely willing to thumb his nose at the
rest of the world. By contrast, Xi --- at least to date --- has mainly
sought to cultivate a statesmanlike image on the global stage. At times
he has given speeches attempting to cast China as a more responsible,
less meddlesome and values-free version of the United States. And Xi has
invested a lot of time and resources in promoting a set of high-profile
international efforts intended to demonstrate that China is a
constructive and proactive great power. Employing positive rhetoric
touting "win-win" solutions and aspirations to build a "community with a
shared future for mankind," [China under Xi's leadership has launched
ambitious efforts such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Putin, by contrast, has made no
real effort to offer an alternative to U.S. global leadership beyond
delivering vague grandiose declarations]{.underline} (often in tandem
with Xi) and has offered the world little in the way of economic
stimulus beyond the prospect of more energy exports and hype about the
Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Despite consisting of only a handful of
Soviet successor states, the EAEU is touted as Russia's answer to
China's BRI. In terms of geostrategic activism, Russia's major
multilateralist initiatives have tended to involve China. These include
the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 and
the formation of the BRICS grouping in 2010. The former is a security
community with a Central Asian focus consisting of Russia, China and
four Central and two South Asian states. The latter is a loose
association of some of the world's largest "emerging economies": Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa. However, Moscow's most
significant geostrategic maneuver under Putin has been to strengthen
Russia's strategic partnership with China. Both Beijing and Moscow
insist that their relationship is not an alliance and their 2001 treaty
of friendship --- which was renewed in 2021 --- does not commit either
signatory to come to the defense of the other in case of military
conflict. Yet, the Sino-Russian relationship is a clearly consequential
alignment that has grown closer in recent years, particularly as their
respective relationships with the United States have deteriorated.
[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put China in a very uncomfortable
position: Beijing does not want to antagonize Moscow but neither does it
want to damage its relations with Washington and European
capitals.]{.underline} Consequently, China has equivocated in its
statements and actions. [Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for
peace but has stopped short of condemning Russia or calling upon Moscow
to withdraw its military.]{.underline} The lengthy joint statement of
February 4, 2022, issued by Putin and Xi during the Russian leader's
visit to Beijing on the eve of the Winter Olympics, makes no mention at
all of Ukraine --- and [China has pointedly abstained on all U.N.
Security Council resolutions related to Russia's invasion. Xi appears to
have asked Putin to delay any military action against Ukraine until
after the Olympics.]{.underline} Russia's invasion poses other
difficulties for China both in terms of running counter to Beijing's
long espoused principles in foreign affairs and its adverse impact on
China's national interests in Ukraine. Russia's actions clearly
contradict China's cornerstone foreign policy principles of
noninterference in other countries' affairs and respecting territorial
integrity. Moreover, China has sizable economic investments in Ukraine
and is a good customer of Ukraine's armaments industry. In 2020, Ukraine
signed the BRI cooperation agreement, which further bolstered the
economic relationship between the two countries and marked Ukraine as an
important partner in Beijing's signature foreign policy and economic
initiative. [**Taiwan Is Not Ukraine** The fact that Ukraine is not a
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was almost
certainly a decisive factor in Putin's calculus to invade
Ukraine.]{.underline} Russia's commander in chief knew that his invading
forces would likely not have to contend with the militaries of any other
countries. And if there were any lingering doubts in the Kremlin about
the disposition of the most powerful member of NATO, U.S. President Joe
Biden stated publicly that the United States would not send military
forces to help defend Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Biden administration
has taken strong steps to reinforce NATO allies in Eastern Europe and
provide robust military assistance to Ukraine. By contrast, [Xi and his
Politburo colleagues have long been convinced that Taiwan has the
resolute support of the world's most capable military.]{.underline} [The
People's Liberation Army]{.underline} --- as all branches of China's
armed forces are known --- [continues to assume that if it launches an
invasion of Taiwan, the U.S. military will swiftly and decisively
intervene.]{.underline} **[The U.S.-Taiwan relationship, while
technically "unofficial" due to the One China policy, has strengthened
in recent years.]{.underline}** On February 28, the Biden administration
sent an unofficial delegation of former U.S. defense and national
security officials to Taiwan as a signal to China of that commitment.
[It remains true that the greatest deterrence to a massive Chinese
military attack on the island is Beijing's assumption that war with
Taiwan also means a war with the United States.]{.underline} However,
**[there is no formal military alliance between the United States and
Taiwan]{.underline}**. [The defense pact binding Washington to Taipei
was formally abrogated in 1979.]{.underline} So why is Beijing convinced
that Washington has an ironclad alliance-like relationship with Taiwan?
There are at least two reasons. First, successive U.S. administrations
have publicly committed themselves to support Taiwan against Chinese
aggression and have regularly sold arms to the island's armed forces.
Second, although there is no language in the1979 Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) that explicitly commits the United States to come to Taiwan's
defense in the event of an attack on the island by China, many in
Washington believe that such a commitment exists. While there are
different interpretations as to what the TRA means, the most significant
fact is that the vast majority of U.S. political and military leaders
are fully convinced that this legislation binds the United States to a
de facto alliance with Taiwan. [China's increased military assertiveness
and greater level of armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait and
elsewhere around China's periphery in recent years have only served to
strengthen the conviction in Washington that the island is a staunch
democratic partner worthy of U.S. support as it tries to defend tiny
Taiwan against efforts by Beijing to coerce the island into unwanted
unification with China.]{.underline} However, [Taiwan]{.underline},
unlike Ukraine, [is not a member of the United Nation]{.underline}.
While Ukraine has ambassador-level diplomatic relations with more than
180 countries, including China and the United States, Taiwan only has
full diplomatic ties with approximately a dozen countries and none of
these are major powers. Yet, thanks to the TRA, Taipei enjoys robust
quasi-diplomatic relations with Washington, and thanks to Taiwan's
pragmatic ingenuity, the island possesses a vibrant worldwide network of
de facto diplomatic missions. [Although Ukraine's diplomatic standing is
far superior to Taiwan's, the European country's military alliance
status is less impressive]{.underline} --- Ukraine is not a member of
NATO, although it is a very active member of NATO's Partnership for
Peace initiative. While Taiwan also has no formal military allies, the
island has several close and consequential security partners, most
notably the United States.

How the United States Should Compete Today [The United States is
competing with China in technology with one hand tied behind its back.78
While the United States has leading technology companies, the government
is underperforming in its role as a critical catalyst of S&T
innovation]{.underline}. The federal government has played a more active
role in protectionist measures relating to Chinese tech in recent years,
including export controls, investment screening, and executive orders
banning Chinese firms, but the government has yet to bring to bear its
substantial tools to help stoke the fires of American innovation. For
the first time in nearly a century, the United States confronts a
strategic rival that is capable of overtaking it as the world's leading
economic, military, and technological power, and one that is
economically entangled with the United States. [Policymakers in Congress
and the White House need to recalibrate U.S. government involvement in
the country's innovation ecosystem to maximize advantages and
opportunities and to successfully address the challenges that the United
States will face in the global technology contest.]{.underline} The
nature of this competition is fundamentally different from what America
has faced since the 1940s. For the first time in nearly a century the
United States confronts a strategic rival that is capable of overtaking
it as the world's leading economic, military, and technological power,
and one that is economically entangled with the United States. [China is
leveraging comprehensive state-directed efforts such as Made in China
2025, Standards 2035, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Digital Silk
Road to guide its technology development at home and push its goals of
making Chinese technology and technology standards dominant
worldwide.]{.underline} Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian
President Vladimir Putin attend a meeting during the Belt and Road
International Forum, an initiative aimed at pursuing dominance in a
number of key technology areas. The United States must respond with
policies that focus on research and development, patenting, and standard
setting. (The Russian Presidential Press and Information
Office/Wikimedia) [The hallmarks of these initiatives include strategic
goals and plans backed with substantial financial resources for R&D,
patenting, and standard setting.]{.underline} [Neither the United States
nor any of the tech-leading democracies has anything equivalent, setting
the stage for an uneven competition where Beijing is better positioned
to have the upper hand over the long term]{.underline}. This is not to
say the United States should emulate China's top-down approach. Many
aspects of China's approach, such as the creation and promotion of
national champions; the coddling of inefficient state-owned enterprises;
export subsidies, forced technology transfers, and other illiberal trade
practices; and the lack of accountability and oversight are anathema to
the American system. At the same time, Beijing's policies have had
impressive results. China is the world's largest trader, accounting for
12.4 percent of global trade in 2018.79 [China's R&D spending has grown
at an average of 15 percent annually since 1998. It is on track to
overtake the United States in total R&D spending by the mid-2020s and is
at the forefront of foundational technologies such as AI, 5G, and
quantum computing.80]{.underline} The U.S. response has been largely
protectionist and unilateral, focused on export controls, tariffs, and
repatriation of manufacturing, while R&D spending remains flat as a
percentage of GDP and policies to attract and retain high-skilled
foreigners become increasingly restrictive. American policymakers must
emphasize what is lacking so far: the proactive policies American
policymakers can put in place to bolster America's ability to
outcompete. [To effectively compete with China, the United States needs
a technology strategy for the 21st century and a new approach to
multilateral cooperation and collaboration. **The United States has an
unmatched strategic advantage over China in this technology competition:
a global network of allies and partners.**]{.underline} **[Harnessing
this network for multilateral collaboration is critical to the success
of a national technology strategy.]{.underline}** [The United States
does not enjoy a monopoly over the technologies that will drive the
21st-century economy, but the United States also does not have to go it
alone]{.underline}. [**By partnering with other tech-leading nations,
the United States and its allies and partners can bring far more
financial and human resources to bear in this competition than China can
alone.** Opportunities for multinational collaboration on technology
policy abound. The United States could look to existing groupings such
as the Five Eyes, the National Technology and Industrial Base, and the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to enhance such
collaboration.]{.underline} There are also proposals to create new
groupings: U.K. government officials have proposed a "Democracy 10" to
tackle 5G and other technology issues; and former U.S. government
officials have proposed alliance frameworks to tackle a range of
technology policy issues.81 A recent CNAS report by an international
group of researchers lays out what countries should comprise such a
grouping, how it should be organized and structured, how it should
function, and what its top priorities should be.82 Recommendations A
strategy's success hinges on implementation. No expression of strategic
direction is complete without actionable recommendations. As the initial
framing document for a series of publications that will define and
outline a U.S. national technology strategy, this report lays out the
four pillars that comprise the actions necessary to execute it. The
pillars are to promote America's ability to compete; protect key U.S.
technological advantages; partner with allies to maximize success; and
plan effectively to reevaluate and adjust the strategy as needed. This
section offers recommendations for each pillar. They include the highest
priority actions U.S. policymakers should undertake to safeguard
long-term U.S. technological competitiveness. It is by no means an
exhaustive list. Rather, it is an opening salvo meant to underscore the
scope and scale of the challenge, highlight the urgency with which the
United States must act, and stimulate ideas for a broader set of
necessary actions. Taken together, these pillars and the recommendations
that underpin them are guidelines for a 21st-century industrial policy.
The American experience with industrial policy throughout its history
shows that it is beneficial and necessary to have government involvement
in technology development and that it is feasible to do so in a manner
that encourages rather than constrains innovations by the private
sector. The recommendations that follow are crafted with that spirit in
mind and are the baseline for American success in the global technology
competition. Promote America's Capacity to Compete The U.S. government
needs to take comprehensive and urgent action to lay the groundwork for
long-term and comprehensive structural improvements to its science and
technology base. There are four categories of recommendations to promote
U.S. competitiveness: 1. Increase investments in research and
development in the United States. While tech-leading countries around
the world have increased their R&D spending, the United States has kept
steady as a percentage of GDP for decades. The U.S. share of global R&D
fell from 69 percent in 1960 to 28 percent in 2016.83 During that
period, the share of R&D investments by the federal government shrank by
more than half, meaning that private industry is now driving R&D to a
much greater extent. In response, Congress should act by: Raising
federal government spending on R&D to at least 2 percent of GDP by 2030,
up from around 0.7 percent in 2020. This spending is critically
important to maintaining long-term capacity for technological leadership
and innovation. The U.S. government remains the largest funder of basic
research, which is foundational to game-changing technological
achievements.84 Promoting an increase of total national (public and
private) R&D expenditures to at least 4.5 percent of GDP by 2030, from
under 3 percent in 2020, to keep in line with other leading technology
nations. Tax incentives, targeted grants and contracts, and prize
competitions all serve to stimulate private-sector investments.

[NATO brought peace to the most violent continent on the planet by
binding its states together in a collective security pact that forbid
them from fighting each other and committed them to coming to one
another's defense.]{.underline} In this way, the emphasis on [NATO as a
hedge against Russian aggression]{.underline} overlooks its role in
bringing peace to its member states and gives the false impression of a
zero-sum relationship wherein Russia can win only if Europe loses. Since
its establishment in 1949, NATO has created a hedge against potential
Russian aggression[, but it is far from its only purpose.]{.underline}
In keeping Europeans from killing one another, [NATO opened the
continent to trade and the free movement of peoples, thereby paving the
way for the European Union]{.underline}, as Timothy Andrew Sayle points
out in his epic history of NATO, Enduring Alliance. [It made
social-democratic institutions like universal health insurance and paid
family leave possible by sharing the costs of defense among a multitude
of states.]{.underline} [It helped spread democracy by demonstrating
that democracies are safe and secure, prosperous and peaceful, in their
relations with one another. Thus, an ever increasing array of states
sought entry into the club of wealthy democracies as a refuge from
violence and disorder. And in bringing such a diversity of peoples
together, NATO helped transform some of the most militaristic and
nationalistic societies in the world into some of its most peaceful and
cosmopolitan.]{.underline} In this way, [it probably also played a part
in transforming colonial regimes like Britain and France, Portugal and
Spain, into normal nation states.]{.underline} If the vast majority of
us have forgotten what a danger European states were to one another and
how militaristic European societies could be, it is largely due to the
way collective security arrangements allowed them to let their guards
down. Thus, [the idea that NATO is an imperialistic military
organization bent on expansion misses the point.]{.underline} NATO was
always a critical hedge against the Soviet Union, but when the Berlin
Wall fell it remained essential to the institutional architecture at the
heart of the European Union. Its [abandonment would have come coupled
with dramatic increases in military budgets and corresponding decreases
in social safety net programs.]{.underline} And it would have [brought
about the remilitarization of Europe's most vulnerable states, which it
would have set on a quest for new protectors, thereby spurring the
creation of new power blocks. **In so doing, it might have spelled an
end to the fledgling European Dream.**]{.underline} Of course,
[collective security pacts also send a signal to would be aggressors
that if they ever did attack, they would be up against several states at
once, and in the case of NATO dozens.]{.underline} [But NATO has been an
astonishingly peaceful military pact.]{.underline} Over the course of
its near three-quarters of a century existence, it has carried out only
three military interventions, a statebuilding mission in Afghanistan,
and a small counter-terrorism operation in Iraq[. It stopped the Bosnian
Genocide]{.underline}, which had already killed well over hundred
thousand people, through a limited bombing campaign in 1995, which
killed only 27 civilians. [It halted the ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo]{.underline}, which threatened to displace hundreds of thousands
of people, through a more extensive bombing campaign in 1999, which
according to Human Rights Watch killed up to 529 Serbian civilians.
Finally, [NATO helped bring down the Gaddafi regime]{.underline} after
he embarked on the most intensive killing spree of any leader in the
Arab Spring and then threatened to go "door to door" hunting down the
rest. According to Libya's own ambassador to the United Nations, who
Secretary General Ban Ki Moon described as begging the U.N. to intervene
in an unprecedented display of sobbing before the General Assembly,
Gaddafi had just given the signal for his troops to commit genocide.
According to Gallup, 75 percent of Libyans told pollsters a year after
the intervention that they had wanted NATO to intervene, in spite of the
intervention having killed 60 civilians, according to the UN Human
Rights council. It was only three years later in 2014, following the
degeneration of the world order brought about by Putin's unanswered
theft of the Crimea and Assad's unanswered obliteration of his own
country, that Britain and France would allow the Libyan statebuilding
mission to fall apart as the country slipped into civil war. All in all,
over the course of its three-quarter century history, [NATO military
missions were probably directly responsible for less than a thousand
civilian deaths spread out over three humanitarian
interventions]{.underline}, the vast majority of which involved a state
that is now an associate of NATO, which is on track for entry into the
European Union in three years. [The only other major campaign it engaged
in was a humanitarian mission in Afghanistan]{.underline}, where member
states mostly helped with statebuilding, police trainings, financial
management, and the provision of aid following the United States'
unilateral invasion in 2001. In a remarkable act of coordination, NATO
member states each took on a different element of the statebuilding
mission in Afghanistan, with only the United Kingdom engaging in heavy
fighting in one small province, which they had committed to keeping
secure. [If these campaigns are remembered as being vastly more violent,
and if a narrative has emerged that sees NATO as an expansionist
imperial force, it is mostly because NATO missions are often confused in
our collective memory with those of the United States and the former
empires of Europe.]{.underline} It is also the result of Russian
propaganda, which claims a "sphere of influence" tied to its former
imperial possessions, many of which have joined NATO. And this points to
another misunderstanding about how NATO actually works. [Potential
members request to join it, and far from being pressured, they have to
demonstrate a commitment to democracy and the rule of law if they are to
be let in. States have the right to join whatever international
associations they want, and spheres of influence are a dated claim
seldom invoked today outside of the Putin regime and Trump
administration.]{.underline} Meanwhile, states on the periphery of
Russia have a better reason for seeking entry into NATO than ever
before. Yet, in overlooking the way collective security pacts foster the
peaceful relations and prosperity of their member states, we help foster
a narrative that sees NATO as an expansionist military organization
locked in a zero-sum competition with Russia. Yet, [Russians will only
win when they establish genuinely democratic institutions, the rule of
law, and the domestic respect for human rights]{.underline}. [If Putin
has overplayed his hand as much as it seems, they might soon find
themselves lining up for NATO membership as well]{.underline}. And if
that turns out to be the case, it would not be a reason to disband NATO
but rather extend the order it has brought to Europe to Russia as well.
[This vision of a liberal internationalist order, wherein democratic
states extend the rule of law and a respect for human rights to an ever
increasing array of voluntary members, may appear utopian amid the
threats and crimes against humanity of autocrats today. But it is no
more fantastic than the "European Dream" of a peaceful continent of
democratic states would have appeared at the end of the Second World
War.]{.underline} Stranger things have been known to occur than
democracy breaking out following the downfall of fascist strongmen and
peace breaking out after war.Published 2 weeks ago on June 4, 2022By

health because it succeeds admirably in advancing the shared interests

focus NATO's traditional mission of territorial defense. At its 2016

augmented its presence on the eastern flank, and the Trump

What Trump fails to understand is that [the disparity in spending, with
the U.S. paying more than its allies, is not a bug of the system. It is
a feature. This is how the great postwar statesmen designed it, and this
immensely foresighted strategy has ensured the absence of great power
conflict---and nuclear war---for three-quarters of a
century.]{.underline} [The open, liberal world order we know today was
built in the wake of World War II and expanded after the collapse of the
Soviet Union]{.underline}. **[By design, it is led by the United States;
by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military hegemony over Eurasia
while uniting Europe under the U.S.' protection.]{.underline}** [The
goal of this American grand strategy is to prevent any single power from
dominating the region and turning on the United States and its allies.
American hegemony serves, too, to quell previously intractable regional
rivalries, preventing further world wars.]{.underline} Dean Acheson,
George Marshall and the other great statesmen of their generation
pursued this strategy because they had learned, at unimaginable cost,
that [the eternal American fantasy of forever being free of
Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in other words---was just
that: a fantasy.]{.underline} Four hundred thousand American men lost
their lives in the European theaters of the First and Second World Wars.
(American fatalities in all of the other 20th-century
conflicts---including Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total
one-quarter of that number.) [Our postwar statesmen were neither weak
nor incompetent. They were the architects of the greatest foreign policy
triumph in U.S. history. So successful was this policy that Americans
now---most of whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of these
wars---see peace, unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's natural
state.]{.underline} This is an illusion. For centuries, Europe was the
fulcrum of global violence. With the age of global exploration, it
became the globe's primary exporter of violence, the tempo and horror of
the carnage rising every century with improvements in technology for
violence. The Scramble for Africa, the division and colonization of that
continent by Europe, is a case in point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa
Conference, which assembled the representatives of 13 European powers to
settle their colonial claims to Africa by diplomacy in place of arms,
did lead to peace in Europe for several years. Africans, however, would
not recall these years for their exceptional comity. For example, the
conference indulged King Léopold II's claim that the Congo Free State
was his private property. Ten million Congolese souls perished under his
ministrations. In recognizing this history of blood, however, we must
recognize something equally true: In the wake of World War II, liberal
democracy saw its fullest realization in the West. This flourishing of
peace and human rights cannot be explained by a sudden outbreak of
European pacifism. (Consider the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an
infuriated President Dwight Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian
War.) It happened because during World War II, Europe destroyed itself,
leaving the United States overwhelmingly powerful by comparison, its
only rival the Soviet Union. Through the application of economic,
diplomatic and military force majeure, the United States suppressed
Europe's internal security competition. This is why postwar Europe
ceased to be the world's leading exporter of violence and became,
instead, the world's leading exporter of luxury sedans. Only America,
and massive power as the U.S. exercised it, could have pacified and
unified Europe under its aegis. No other continental country possessed
half the world's GDP. No other country had enough distance from Europe
to be trusted, to a large extent, by all parties and indifferent to its
regional jealousies. [No other country had a strategic, moral and
economic vision for Europe that its inhabitants could be persuaded
gladly to share.]{.underline} Indeed, **[Europeans cooperated with the
U.S. program because it created conditions under which both the United
States and Europe flourished]{.underline}**. The United States assisted
Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13 billion of aid in the form
of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars, roughly \$113 billion.) It
midwifed the groupings and treaties that would become the European
Union. It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella with the NATO
treaty. Article V of the treaty, its most important element, declares
that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. These
policies were intended not only to counter the Soviet Union, but to
condition Europe's prosperity upon its integration into a single market,
with free movement of goods, capital and labor. [The founders of these
institutions fully intended them to be the foundations of a United
States of Europe, much like the United States of America.]{.underline}
[Profound economic interdependence, they believed, would make further
European wars impossible. At the same time, the United States built an
open, global order upon an architecture of specific institutions: the
United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the International
Court of Justice.]{.underline} This order is in many respects an
empire---a [Pax Americana]{.underline}---but it [is more humane than any
empire that preceded it, with institutions that are intended to benefit
all parties. Postwar U.S. statesmen believed that prosperous, liberal
democracies that traded freely with each other would neither go to war
with each other nor the United States.]{.underline} They ascribed, in
other words, to the so-called Democratic Peace theory---a theory with
overwhelming empirical support. [The U.S. military was always an
integral part of the plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the
rubble.]{.underline} Since World War II, U.S. troops have been deployed
in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot be dominated by a single power
capable of monopolizing its resources and turning them against [the U.S.
The United States has built overwhelmingly massive military assets there
to deter local arms races before they begin, and it has simultaneously
assured those under U.S. protection that there is no need to begin local
arms races, for their safety is guaranteed. American grand strategy
rests upon the credibility of its promise to protect American allies;
this credibility rests, in turn, upon U.S. willingness to display its
commitment.]{.underline} (The Berlin Airlift, when U.S. troops airlifted
supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade, was precisely such a
display.) In return for the United States' commitment, U.S. allies have
accepted America's dominant role in the international system. In the
postwar era, just as now, the enemies of liberal democracy sought to
undermine the order the U.S. was building. Precisely because [the
Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West under the United
States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda organs cranked into
overdrive to denounce it.]{.underline} A cartoon, for example, published
in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's administrator, Paul
Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on destroying the sovereignty of
European nations. The French paper L\'Humanité, which reliably parroted
Moscow's line, wrote, "After disorganizing the national economies of the
countries which are under the American yoke, American leaders now intend
conclusively to subjugate the economy of these countries to their own
interests." [The Soviet Union's criticism of the Marshall Plan and other
American involvement in Europe was eerily similar to the language
Russia's now uses in its campaign to undermine NATO and the EU. The
vocabulary and tropes of Russian propaganda are widely echoed, wittingly
or unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and other antiliberal
politicians, parties and movements throughout the West.]{.underline}
With the men who built the postwar world order now in their graves, and
the memory of carnage and horror buried with them, a very sizable
constituency of Americans has forgotten that their country built this
system for a reason---that the United States does not maintain its
alliances as an act of foolish largesse. [The loudest exponent of the
idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the European Union was
"created to destroy us," and that multilateral institutions such as the
World Trade Organization assault the "sovereignty" of the nations
concerned is, unfortunately, the president of the United States. It's
hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are. History
can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is never so
cooperative]{.underline}. [Global free trade sustains modern economic
life. An interruption to this trade---carried out chiefly on global
shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S. military---would bring modern
life to an end. The Second World War proved not only that isolationism
and American-Firstism were fantasies, but exceptionally childish and
dangerous ones, at that. In the age of hyperglobalized trade,
international air travel, the internet, nuclear weapons and
intercontinental ballistic missiles, these fantasies are even more
childish and dangerous. The U.S. may be on another continent, but it is
not on another planet. It is true that the U.S. spends more on its
military, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of GDP, than any
European country. That was always part of the deal. The U.S. is a global
superpower. It can fight a war anywhere in the world, invade any country
at will, and (at least in theory) fight multiple simultaneous major
wars---even in space.]{.underline} Of course this costs more. It is in
America's advantage to be the only power on the planet that can do this.
Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage for other
countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do. Europe is
America's biggest export market, as designed. We want Europeans to spend
their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not razing Flanders to the
ground yet again. Yet Trump's refusal to deter our shared enemies and
protect our allies risks provoking a regional European arms
race---exactly what the U.S. has sought to avoid for 74 years. It is an
invitation to adventurism from Putin. Trump's refusal to adopt the
encouraging language of past presidents toward European integration,
language that until now has been transformed into policy by professional
and experienced State Department employees, puts further strain on an
already-weakened Europe. Above all, Trump's overt support for sordid,
Kremlin-backed actors who seek to undermine Europe's unity is
unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's interest, or in ours, for the
American president to lend the United States' prestige and support to
Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal Marxists, populists,
authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists, particularly since all of them
are ideologically hostile to the United States? The damage Trump has
deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability comes at a uniquely
dangerous time[. Democracy's so-called third wave---the global
blossoming of open political systems after the Cold War---has long since
receded. A threat to liberal democracy, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology---illiberal democracy---is ascendant. We see it today in Russia
and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and hollow form of
democracy that spreads and consolidates itself through the new
technologies of the 21st century. The global order the U.S. built was
based on the principle that only a world of liberal democracies can be
peaceful and prosperous. That principle is correct. Should the
unraveling of the order the U.S. built proceed at this pace, the world
will soon be neither peaceful nor prosperous. Nor will the effects be
confined to regions distant from the United States. America will feel
them gradually, and then, probably, overnight---in the form of a
devastating, sudden shock.]{.underline}

#### Abandonment/unilateralism Wrecks US hegemony -- removes *[network]{.underline}* of diplomatic and military capabilities and *[forecloses agenda-setting power]{.underline}* to new regional blocs

The decline of American hegemony has been proclaimed many times, but the
US has continued to be the sole superpower on the block. [Yet the 2016
election might go down in history as the turning point -- if the new
administration follows through with its plan to put 'America First' and
withdraws from international responsibilities. This policy change puts
European collective action capacity to a test, leaving the EU to carry
on the torch of liberal values and democracy in the global world
order.]{.underline} Following the Brexit shock, EU leaders agree on a
communications and legitimacy offensive to fend off populist movements
in the wake of Brexit. Europe's foreign policy apparatus evolves. As the
EEAS gains experience and fine-tunes its working relationship with
member states and the EU Commission, the changes intended by the Lisbon
treaty begin to materialize in practical terms. [The center of gravity
for day-to-day foreign policy moves to the European level, not least
because EU mxembers are happy to consolidate expensive foreign
operations. At the same time, the United States decrease their footprint
in terms of both diplomatic and military capabilities abroad. US foreign
policy focuses on core regions and tasks, which means cutting back on
large-scale diplomatic initiatives, early warning and conflict
resolution, or intelligence analysis]{.underline}. These policy shifts
draw heavy criticism from European allies and the transatlantic
relationship suffers − also because the new US administration uses a
different tone and style towards the old allies. These organizational
and strategic changes are reflected in policy choices. [In United
Nations negotiations on climate change, the EU is the only actor that
comes close to China's willingness and capacity for leadership.
Participants in transatlantic working groups discover that their goals
are not aligned.]{.underline} In addition, US negotiators are much less
enthusiastic about investing political capital and resources in global
governance. UN operational budgets across the board are sharply reduced
reflecting a reduction in US contributions that cannot be compensated by
others. Thus, while the UN remains a forum for deliberation, its
agencies lose practical relevance in global governance. [At the same
time, the member states of the European Union come to terms with the
fact that their transatlantic partner seems less willing to assume a
leadership role. A number of governments and the foreign-policy
institutions in Brussels take on more responsibility in regional and
global affairs. As a result, EU policymakers focus more heavily on
inter-regional cooperation with organizations from Africa, Latin America
and Asia. A number of so-called 'intensive partnership' treaties with
regional blocs and individual emerging powers address cross-border
issues, such as migration and the fight against crime. In trade and
investment, regional arrangements increasingly replace the WTO, which is
in hibernation due to the United States' refusal to champion further
trade liberalization on a global scale. NATO suffers from funding cuts
and is strictly limited to its core mandate for territorial defense,
while the UN Security Council drops from gridlock to
paralysis]{.underline}. Military interventions still take place -- but
only based on ad-hoc coalitions. [For the EU this means creating a more
deeply integrated but still voluntary defense framework with a focus on
security in the near abroad and African countries of strategic interest.
A first indicator for this scenario is a shift in US foreign policy from
a global leadership role to a few selected initiatives. American
agenda-setting power on the global stage is reduced as foreign-policy
priorities change, but also because European allies in turn focus on
other partners and opportunities.]{.underline} EU-internal changes in
the institutional setup and practice of foreign policy are another
indicator to consider. The clearest sign of this scenario, however,
would be bolder and more controversial European actions on the global
arena -- both diplomatically and militarily.

**[relish]{.underline}** [the prospect of the country's **roaring
return**]{.underline} [to the global stage. But attempting a **full-on

**strategic pullback**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** [has initiated **needs to
continue**]{.underline}---albeit in a more coherent and judicious
manner. Much of the debate surrounding the next administration's foreign
policy has focused on boldly reasserting U.S. leadership in the world.
And it's true: Global interdependence and upheaval do require steady
U.S. leadership and engagement. [What's been]{.underline} largely
**[missing]{.underline}** from this debate, however, [are the challenges
facing the next president when it comes to **right-sizing U.S.
engagement abroad**]{.underline}---[especially **military
involvement**]{.underline}---[and bringing the nation's **strategic
commitments** back into line with it **means** and **purposes**. The
American electorate has turned **sharply inward**]{.underline}

East**]{.underline}, [the **economic dislocations**]{.underline}
[brought about by **innovation** and **globalization**]{.underline},
[and the **national calamity** caused by **COVID**]{.underline}-19. [The
nation's **next president** would]{.underline} be wise to take
note---and [craft a brand of global statecraft that is **effective** but
also]{.underline} politically **[sustainable]{.underline}**. [Otherwise,
the **strategic pullback** that needs to take place will occur **by
default rather than by design**]{.underline}, [risking]{.underline} that
**[U.S. overreach]{.underline}** could turn into even more dangerous
underreach. Indeed, that's what's been happening during Trump's
presidency. He seems to have understood the need to retrench. But his
troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Germany have been
haphazard, making a hash of the effort. Retrenchment cannot be done by
tweet, in unpredictable fits and starts, and couched in an abrasive
"America first" unilateralism that has alienated allies and set the
world on edge. Democratic candidate Joe [**Biden** is]{.underline} far
better [suited to restore an **equilibrium**]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} the nation's [**foreign policy** and]{.underline}
its **[political will]{.underline}**. [Throughout his career, he has
been a **pragmatic** and **prudent internationalist**]{.underline};
[looking forward, pragmatism and prudence will require a more
**selective** and **discriminating internationalism**]{.underline},
**[not]{.underline}** **[restoration of the s]{.underline}**tatus
**[quo]{.underline}** ante. Three-quarters of the American public want
U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan and Iraq---[it is time to downsize the
U.S. footprint in the Middle East. U.S. foreign policy has become
**over-militarized**]{.underline}---[the next administration should
**reallocate priorities** and **resources**]{.underline}, [putting more
emphasis on **diplomacy**]{.underline}, cybersecurity, global public
health, and climate change. Washington should also return to being a
team player if it is to lighten its load; [**retrenchment** and
**multilateral engagement** go hand in hand. Meeting the threat posed by
**China**]{.underline}, managing international **[trade]{.underline}**
and finance, [preventing]{.underline} nuclear
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [addressing]{.underline}
**[pandemics]{.underline}**---[these]{.underline} and other urgent
challenges [all require broad **international

[S]{.underline}tates **[pulls back]{.underline}** from its role as
global policeman, [it will want **like-minded partners** to help **fill
the gap**]{.underline}. These partnerships become stronger through
diplomacy and teamwork. [The **top priorities** of the next president
will be **at home**: **taming the pandemic**, **repairing the economy**,
and reviving **democratic institutions**]{.underline} and norms. Only if
the country's democratic lights come back on can it effectively deal
with the rest of the world. In the meantime, [the next
admin]{.underline}istration [needs to **continue Trump's effort** to
**downsize** the nation's foreign **entanglements**]{.underline}---but
[in a **smart** and **measured** way]{.underline}. The United States
needs to step back without stepping away. "Build back better" applies
abroad just as much as it does at home.

NEW YORK -- American foreign policy is at a crossroads. The United
States has been an expanding power since its start in 1789. It battled
its way across North America in the nineteenth century and gained global
dominance in the second half of the twentieth. But now, [facing China's
rise, India's dynamism, Africa's soaring populations and economic
stirrings, Russia's refusal to bend to its will, its own inability to
control events in the Middle East, and Latin America's determination to
be free of its de facto hegemony,]{.underline} **[US power has reached
its limits]{.underline}**. One path for the US is global cooperation.
The other is a burst of militarism in response to frustrated ambitions.
The future of the US, and of the world, hangs on this choice. [Global
coop]{.underline}eration [is doubly vital]{.underline}. [**Only**
**coop**]{.underline}eration [can deliver peace and the escape
from]{.underline} a useless, **[dangerous]{.underline}**, and ultimately
bankrupting **[new arms race]{.underline}**, [this time including

face up to urgent planetary challenges, including **the destruction of
biod**iversity, the poisoning of the **oceans**, and the threat posed by
**global warming**]{.underline} to the world's food supply, vast
drylands, and heavily populated coastal regions. [Yet **global
coop**eration means the willingness to reach **agreements**]{.underline}
with other countries, [not]{.underline} simply to [make]{.underline}
unilateral [demands]{.underline} of them. And **[the US is in the habit
of making demands]{.underline}**, not making compromises. When a state
feels destined to rule -- as with ancient Rome, the Chinese "Middle
Kingdom" centuries ago, the British Empire from 1750 to 1950, and the US
since World War II -- compromise is hardly a part of its political
vocabulary. As former US President George W. Bush succinctly put it,
"You're either with us or against us."

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/case-offshore-balancing)

HEGEMONY\'S HOLLOW HOPES Defenders of liberal hegemony marshal a number
of unpersuasive arguments to make their case. One familiar claim is that
only vigorous U.S. leadership can keep order around the globe. But
[**global leadership is not an end in itself**; it is desirable only
insofar as it benefits the United States directly. One might further
argue]{.underline} that [U.S. leadership is necessary to overcome the
**collective-action** problem]{.underline} of local actors failing to
balance against a potential hegemon. Offshore balancing recognizes this
danger, however, and [calls for Washington to step in **if needed**. Nor
does it prohibit Washington from giving friendly states]{.underline} in
the key regions [advice or material aid]{.underline}. Other [defenders
of liberal hegemony argue]{.underline} that [U.S. leadership is
necessary to deal with new, transnational threats]{.underline} that
arise [from failed states, terrorism, criminal networks, refugee
flows]{.underline}, and the like. Not only do the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans offer inadequate protection against these dangers, they claim,
but modern military technology also makes it easier for the United
States to project power around the world and address them. Today\'s
\"global village,\" in short, is more dangerous yet easier to manage.
**[This]{.underline}** view exaggerates these threats and **[overstates
Washington\'s ability]{.underline}** to eliminate them. Crime,
terrorism, and similar problems can be a nuisance, but they are hardly
existential threats and rarely lend themselves to military solutions.
Indeed[, constant interference in the affairs of other states-and
especially repeated military interventions- generates local resentment
and fosters corruption]{.underline}, thereby **[making]{.underline}**
these **[transnational dangers worse]{.underline}**. [The long-term
solution to the problems can only be competent local governance, not
heavy-handed U.S. efforts to police the world]{.underline}.

### Offense -- Heg is Violent

#### The legacy of American hegemony is endless rivers of blood and feedback loops of sustained conflict **Morefield 19** (Jeanne Morefield, Professor of Politics at Whitman College, Professorial Fellow at the Institute for Social Justice at Australian Catholic University, PhD from Cornell University, January 8, 2019, "Trump's Foreign Policy Isn't the Problem," Boston Review, <https://bostonreview.net/politics/jeanne-morefield-trump%E2%80%99s-foreign-policy-isn%E2%80%99t-problem>) gz

After two years of [President Donald Trump]{.underline}, critics and
commentators are still struggling to make sense of his foreign policy.
Despite some hopes that he might mature into the role of commander in
chief, he has continued to thumb his nose at most mainstream academic
frameworks for analyzing and conducting foreign policy. Indeed, what
makes Trump's interactions with the rest of the world so confusing is
the way he flirts with, and then departs from, the script. He may issue
policies and give speeches that include words such as "sovereignty,"
"principled realism," and "peace through strength," but they frequently
appear cheek by jowl with racist rants, crass opportunism, nationalist
tirades, and unrestrained militarism. It is [this uncomfortable mixture
of familiar and jarring that has proven disconcerting for many
mainstream international relations scholars, particularly those
"intellectual middlemen" who straddle the realms of academia, policy
think tanks, and major news outlets. Yet rather than ask how U.S.
foreign policy might have contributed to the global environment that
made Trump's election possible, most have responded to the
inconsistencies of Trump's world vision by emphasizing its departure
from everything that came before and demanding a return to more familiar
times. International relations experts thus express nostalgia
for either the "U.S.-led liberal order"]{.underline} or the Cold War
while, in [outlets such as *Foreign Affairs* and the *New York
Times*, they offer selective retellings of the country's past foreign
policies that make them look both shinier and clearer than they
were]{.underline}. These responses do not offer much insight into Trump
himself, but they do have much to tell us about [the discourse of
international relations in the United
States]{.underline} today [and]{.underline} the way [its mainstream
public analysts---liberals and realists alike---continue to disavow U.S.
imperialism. ]{.underline}For example, [liberal internationalists such
as John Ikenberry argue that Trump is guilty of endangering the U.S.-led
global order. That system, according to Ikenberry and Daniel Deudney,
emerged after World War II, when the liberal democracies of the world
"joined together to create an international order that reflected their
shared interests," while simultaneously agreeing, as Ikenberry once put
it, to transfer "the reins of power to Washington]{.underline}, just as
Hobbes's individuals . . . voluntarily construct and hand over power to
the Leviathan." [The vision of cooperating nation-states may have
originated in values that first "emerged in the West," they argue, but
these values have since "become universal." In this accounting, Trump
threatens the stability of U.S. liberal hegemony in two ways: by
retreating from multilateral agreements such as the Iran nuclear deal,
and by refusing to participate in the narrative of enlightened U.S.
leadership. Future great threats to global stability, Ikenberry
grumbled, were supposed to come from "hostile revisionist powers seeking
to overturn the postwar order." Now a hostile revisionist power "sits in
the Oval Office." ]{.underline}By contrast, [when realists such as
Stephen Walt or John Mearsheimer criticize Trump, they start from the
position that the liberal world order is a delusion,
perpetuated]{.underline} most recently [by]{.underline} post--Cold War
members of [the "elite foreign policy establishment."]{.underline} Walt
and others rightly point to the baseline hypocrisy of a "liberal
Leviathan," noting that [the current fury over Russian election
tampering and cyber espionage rings hollow given the long U.S. reliance
on both strategies. This view accompanies a wistful longing for
the putatively gimlet-eyed realism of the Cold War, a time when U.S.
presidents understood that their role was to deter the Soviet Union,
prevent the emergence of dangerous regional hegemons, and preserve "a
global balance of power that enhanced American
security."]{.underline} Seen thus, [Trump's hyperbolic and embarrassing
nationalism is a symptom of the abandonment of great power politics,
while his fawning treatment of Vladimir Putin shatters any remaining
hope that his self-styled "principled realism" might take us back to a
more strategically realistic time. In the words of former Secretary of
Defense Ash Carter, watching the Trump--Putin news conference was like
"watching the destruction of a
cathedral."]{.underline} [But]{.underline} what is Trump actually doing
to destroy this cathedral? What makes Trump's words and behavior so
objectionable? Previous presidents have pulled out of multilateral
agreements, entered into disputes with allies, and engaged in
protectionism and trade wars. The majority of the Trump administration's
planned and ongoing military deployments are in regions where the
military was already deployed by previous administrations in the name of
the War on Terror. Moreover, [Trump's national security and national
policy statements are littered with the vocabulary of the very experts
who find him so terrifying. What]{.underline}, then, [makes Trump's
foreign policy such a singular threat? Trump's foreign policy is
disturbing because it is uncanny---both grotesque *and* deeply familiar.
Like a funhouse mirror, Trump's vision of the world reflects back a
twisted image of U.S. global politics that *is* and *is not* who we are
supposed to be. For instance, deterrence strategy may require the rest
of the world to believe that the U.S. president might use nuclear
weapons, but the president is *not* supposed to hint that he might
actually do so. The president is supposed to be concerned with
regulating the flow of immigrants but not reveal that race plays a role
in these calculations by blurting the phrase "shithole countries." The
president is supposed to believe that the United States is the most
blessed, exceptional country on Earth]{.underline}---as Barack Obama put
it, "I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my
being"---[but *not* engage in excessive nationalism by making "total
allegiance" the "bedrock" of his politics, or combine it with a
commitment to "make our Military so big, powerful & strong that no one
will mess with us."]{.underline} Sometimes Trump's utterances hit so
close to home that they surpass uncanniness. In an essay by Sigmund
Freud on the uncanny, Freud says dolls and mannequins unsettle precisely
because of the possibility that they might actually be alive, a
discomfort that has inspired nightmares, works of literature, and horror
movies. [Trump]{.underline}, by contrast, [is a living nightmare. He
opens his mouth and the things-which-must-never- be-said simply fall
out]{.underline}. Thus, [when Bill O'Reilly asked him why he supported
Putin even though he is a "killer," Trump shot back, "There are a lot of
killers. You think our country's so innocent?" Trump's willingness to
say such things has precipitated an existential crisis in the
international relations world. U.S. foreign policy, as an academic
discourse and political practice, is built on the delicate foundation
of]{.underline} what Robert Vitalis has called [the "norm against
noticing," This deflective move has long been the gold standard of
international relations; under its rules of play, IR experts act as if
the United States has never been an imperial power and that its foreign
policy is not, and has never been, intentionally racist. The norm
against noticing thus distinguishes between the idea of the United
States as a necessary world-historical actor and the reality of how the
United States acts.]{.underline} [In that reality, the United States has
long been an imperial power with white nationalist aspirations. Given
the racialized nature of U.S. imperial expansion, it makes sense
that]{.underline} Alexis de [Tocqueville predicted, in a chapter
entitled "The Three Races of the United States," that the United States
would one day govern "the destinies of half the globe."
In ]{.underline}its early days, [while still a slave-holding country,
the United States asserted its sovereignty through genocide on a
continental scale and annexed large portions of northern
Mexico. The country went on to overthrow the independent state
of Hawaii, occupied the Philippines and Haiti, exerted its regional
power throughout Latin America, expanded its international hegemony
after World War II, and became what it is today: the world's foremost
military and nuclear power with a \$716 billion "defense" budget that
exceeds the spending of all other major global powers
combined.]{.underline} "Taking over from the British Empire in the early
twentieth-century," argues James Tully, [the United States has used its
many military bases located "outside its own borders"---now nearly 800
in over 80 countries--- to force open-door economic policies and
antidemocratic regimes on states throughout the formerly colonized
world. An extremely partial list of sovereign governments that the
United States either overthrew or attempted to subvert through military
means, assassinations, or election tampering since 1949 includes Syria,
Iran, Guatemala, Lebanon, the Congo, Cuba, Chile, Afghanistan,
Nicaragua, Grenada, Cuba, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq, Yemen,
Australia, Greece, Bolivia, and Angola. Such interventionist policies
have contributed substantially to today's inegalitarian world in which
an estimated 783 million people live in profound poverty. In sum, for
untold millions of humans in the Global South, the seventy years of
worldwide order, security, and prosperity that Ikenberry and Deudney
associate with Pax Americana has been anything but ordered, secure, or
prosperous.]{.underline} And yet [the norm against noticing prevents
foreign policy analysis from even acknowledging---let alone grappling
with---the relationship between race and imperialism that has
characterized U.S. international relations from the country's earliest
days. This regime of politely un-seeing---of deflecting---connections
between U.S. foreign policy, race hierarchy, and colonial
administration]{.underline} was clearly not in effect when *Foreign
Affairs* was released under its original name: the *Journal of Race
Development*. This began to change, however, in the 1920s. Among other
contributing factors, World War I, the rise of anti-colonial
revolutions, and the emergence of liberal internationalism as a popular
ideology [helped convince foreign policy experts in the United States
and Europe to adopt a policy language oriented toward "development"
rather than imperialism or racial difference. Mainstream international
relations scholarship today remains committed to a narrative in which
the discipline itself and U.S. foreign policy has always been and
remains race blind, concerned solely with the relationship between
sovereign states who cooperate, deter, or compete with one another in a
global system in which the United States is]{.underline} simply, like
Caesar, [the "first citizen" (Ikenberry) or "the luckiest great power in
modern history" (Walt). For liberals, this involves a studied erasure of
the imperial origins of twentieth-century internationalism in the League
of Nations' Mandate system and the complicity of
Woodrow Wilson in preserving, ]{.underline}as Adom Getachew puts
it, ["white supremacy on a global scale." For realists, it requires both
forgetting the anti-Enlightenment origins of postwar realist thought and
reinserting the "security dilemma" back into history so
that]{.underline}, with the help of Thucydides, Machiavelli, and
Hobbes, [the world can]{.underline}---as Slavoj Žižek says---["become
what it always was." International relations experts will acknowledge
U.S. violence and overreach when necessary, but routinely read the
illiberalism of U.S. foreign policy as an exception that is not at all
representative]{.underline}, in Anne Marie Slaughter's words, of "the
idea that is America." Slaughter, with Ikenberry, can consider bad
behavior only briefly and only in the service of insisting that what
matters most is not what the United States actually does with its power
but what it intends to do. Yes, "imperialism, slavery, and racism have
marred Western history," Ikenberry and Deudney argue, but what matters
is that liberalism "has always been at the forefront of efforts---both
peaceful and militant---to reform and end these practices." Indeed, even
those public intellectuals such as Niall Ferguson and Michael Ignatieff
who, after September 11, called for the United States to embrace its
status as an imperial power, framed their arguments in deflective,
liberal terms. By contrast, [because realists project the security
dilemma retroactively into history (while also simultaneously excising
imperialism) they can only see the U.S. destabilization of Third World
economies, assassinations, and secret bombings as tragic
necessities (great powers, claims Mearsheimer, "have little choice but
to pursue power and to seek to dominate the other states in the system")
or as the result of liberals' ill-advised desire to force "our" values
on other nations. Both of these deflective strategies reinforce the
illusion that we live]{.underline}, in Nikhil Pal Singh's words, [in an
"American-centered, racially inclusive world, one organized around
formally equal and independent nation states" where some states just
happen to have more power than others, and where the
alternative---Russian or Chinese hegemony---is too frightening even to
contemplate. That deflection would play such an outsized role in
supporting the ideological edifice of international relations today is
hardly surprising]{.underline}. Turn-of-the-century British liberals who
supported their empire also drew upon a variety of different deflective
strategies to reconcile the violence and illiberalism of British
imperial expansion with the stated liberal goals of the Empire.
Such [deflection made it impossible for these
thinkers]{.underline}---many of whom would go on to work as some of the
first international relations scholars in Britain and help found The
Royal Institute of International Affairs---[to link the problems of
empire with the violence and disruption of
imperialism. ]{.underline}Similarly, [deflection within international
relations today obscures the U.S. role in maintaining the profoundly
hierarchical, racist, insecure, deeply unjust reality of the current
global order. It also makes it impossible to address how U.S. foreign
policy (covert and overt) has contributed to the destabilization of that
order by creating the circumstances that give rise to "failed
states," "rogue regimes," and "sponsors
of terrorism."]{.underline} Moreover, [it impedes any theorizing about
how the widespread appeal of Trump's xenophobia at home might, in
part, be the product of U.S. foreign policy abroad, the bitter fruit of
the War on Terror and its equally violent predecessors. In other words,
in the grand tradition of liberal empire, U.S. foreign policy deflection
actively disrupts the link between cause and effect that an entire
science of international relations was created to explain. What
makes Trump's attitude toward foreign policy so uniquely unhinging for
international relations experts, then, is the fact that it is
essentially undeflectable. When he explains to Theresa May that refugees
threaten European culture or calls Mexican immigrants killers, he lays
bare the meant-to-be unutterable fear of nonwhite migration that has
haunted British, U.S., and European imperialists and foreign policy
experts for over a century. When he summons the fires of nationalism to
demand an unprecedented increase in the military budget, and then gets
it with the overwhelming support of House and Senate Democrats, he
reveals that constitutional checks on the commander in chief are only as
good as the willingness of Congress to resist jingoism. When he calls
nations populated by brown and black people shitholes, he openly
advertises the unspoken white supremacist edge that has informed U.S.
economic, development, energy, and foreign policies since the late
nineteenth century. Trump's Muslim ban is simply the War on Terror on
steroids.]{.underline} In short, Trump's foreign policy is unprecedented
not because of what it does, but because Trump will openly say what it
does---and because of what that then says about us as a nation. [The
discomfort Trump provokes ought to prompt international
relations experts to reflect on the failings of their discipline to
reckon with the relationship between U.S. imperialism, U.S. foreign
policy, and the constellation of xenophobia, militarism, racism, and
nationalism that haunts our days. The fields of intellectual and legal
history and political theory are far ahead of international relations in
their critical interrogation of the ideologies that sustain empire at
home and abroad]{.underline}. In addition, Trump's election has
emboldened activists to make increasingly explicit the connections they
see between a racialized, anti-immigrant politics of domestic
dispossession and violence and the history of U.S. imperialism in the
world. Unfortunately the same does not appear to be true for the
majority of intellectual middlemen who set the public tone for U.S.
foreign policy. Trump is, finally, both the emperor with no clothes and
the pointing child, begging to hold a big military parade so we can
collectively acknowledge the naked imperialist power at the heart of
U.S. foreign policy. Trump practically screams at the United States to
look at itself. And yet, the more he screams, the more the intellectual
enablers avert their eyes. They are busy looking elsewhere---anywhere
really---except at that nakedness.

[IV. Growth of Regional Economy Although a significant share of East
Asia's trade is in intermediate manufactured goods for final destination
export to the USA, Europe and Japan, it has allowed for technology
transfers and has stimulated endogenous growth factors in East Asia
region.]{.underline} **[The other dimension is regionalisation and the
intensification of transnational trade and investment flows among the
developing countries. Regionalisation has been an important feature of
East Asian re-emergence. Initiated by the relocation of Japanese
manufacturing capacities in the 1980s, which generated a concatenated
division of labour in East Asia, regional economic integration has
deepened over the past decade and a half. Intra-regional trade as a
share of total trade has thus risen constantly over past decades by 20%
in 1970, 32% in the early 1980s, 47% in the early 1995, 54.8% in 2000
and nearly 60% in 2012.]{.underline}** The Chinese government appears to
be only focusing on building its economy and the living conditions of
its people. [China has become the world's largest economy, but it has a
population of 1.4 billion, which is more than four times larger than the
US.]{.underline} Having an economy the size of the US means that average
living standards are far lower than in the US and at present, per capita
income is one-fourth than of the US. It means that [China still has a
long way to go to become a rich country. **Chinese annual GDP growth
averaged over 9% between 1997 and 2019 and, in the aftermath of the East
Asian crisis, trade and investment flows between China and the rest of
Asia grew significantly. Since the late 1990s, regional trade with China
has been growing faster than with the US. For instance, Japan's imports
from China already exceed those from the US, and Japanese exports to
China have been steadily rising. This same trend is apparent in South
Korean, Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean trade flows**]{.underline}
(Amsden, 2001; Siddiqui, 2020a). Chinese leaders thus interpret the 1997
East Asian financial crisis as a turning point: '**[The process of the
East Asian cooperation has been consolidated day by day since then \[and
is now\] based on a multi-layered, multi-faceted
structure'.]{.underline}** [Recent moves to gradually internationalise
the Renminbi and use it in regional transactions, such as the June 2012
Japanese--Chinese accord to trade in their currencies rather than the
dollar, represent a further step in this direction.]{.underline}
(Siddiqui, 2020d) [Trade between China and all other developing
countries grew significantly over the past two decades. While the share
of South America, Africa and South Asia in China's total trade remains
relatively small, it is steadily growing]{.underline}, but **[China's
share in their total trade has become strategically
important.]{.underline}** [The space is not available for a
comprehensive review of the new transcontinental flows, but the pattern
is clear even when we look at the data. Over the past two decades Asia
has become Brazil's main trading partner, accounting for 30% of its
exports and 31% of its imports. Exports to China, as a share of total
exports, have risen from 0.9% in 1992 to over 17%. China has thus become
Brazil's second trading partner, just behind the European Union (21%)
but well ahead of the US (10%). Argentina's exports to China, as a share
of total exports, have likewise risen from 1.1% to 9.7%. Similar
patterns are apparent for Africa, where South Africa's export share to
China has risen from 1.8% in 1998 to over 12% in 2018, while imports
rose from 3% to 15%, and Nigeria's exports from 0.5% to 6.9%. In South
Asia the share of Indian exports to China has risen from 2.9% to over
10%, and imports from 2% to 12% during the same period.]{.underline} V.
Restructuring Global Capitalism **[It seems that the historic
pendulum,]{.underline}** which had swung to the 'West' i**[n the late
18th century, is swinging back to Asia, which is reclaiming the leading
economic role it held for a very long period before the Age of the
Western Empire. The movement towards a polycentric and plural world
system has indeed quickened over the past quarter century, as major
Asian regions have consolidated their position as a dynamic growth
region]{.underline}** of the world capitalist economy, **[developing
regional and transcontinental linkages that are reconfiguring global
trade, investment and financial flows.]{.underline}** First in the
1960s, economic changes began in the East Asian region and later on in
the 1990s, growth spread to other developing countries like Brazil,
China, India, South Africa and Turkey. **[The systemic restructuring has
primarily been driven by East Asia, which has experienced a process of
economic expansion, the duration of which have been remarkable by
historic standards. Beginning with Japan's rapid economic transformation
in the 1950s and 1960s, a regional development dynamic was set into
motion that spread successively, in wave-like formations, to the Newly
Industrialised Countries and moreover, over the last four decades, to
spectacular growth in China.]{.underline}** [Varying initial conditions,
historic pathways and a combination of both state and markets have
produced positive results in East Asia. There are uneven
country-to-country developmental outcomes, distinguishing first and
second wave industrialising from third and fourth wave countries that
are climbing the ladder but are not far from catching-up with the most
developed economies]{.underline}. (Siddiqui, 2020c) Growing financial
power derived from cumulative surpluses is another important feature of
the rebalancing of the world economy, which has been accentuated by the
deepening economic crisis in the European Union, Brexit and in the USA.
Nonetheless, [a coherent process has been at work, unfolding over time
and space to most of the region, with global effects. East Asia's
aggregate share of constantly increasing world GDP (in PPP), which was
negligible in the 1950s, has thus risen from around 10% in 1980 to 30%
in 2015. China's share has grown from 2% to over 18%. Over the same time
period PPP per capita GDP in current international dollars was
multiplied by 14 in South Korea, by over seven in Singapore and
Thailand, by six in Malaysia and Indonesia, and by 39 in China (from
US\$250 to US\$9380 in 2019)--a spectacular increase that reflects the
intensity of growth and its cumulative impact. By the end of 2020 East
Asia's share of world GDP (in PPP) is expected to reach 32%, with China
accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total. In South Asia, India's
world share has risen from 2.5% to 5.5%, and per-capita GDP has
increased by a factor of 14, from \$419 dollars to \$3800 dollars today
(in current US dollars). Asia's aggregate share of world GDP (in PPP) is
thus projected to approach 46% in a few years. When other major
re-emerging countries and world regions -- **Brazil, India, Turkey,
Mexico, and South Africa are taken into account, despite the Covid-19
setback, their world output share in 2020 is expected to exceed 55%.
Over the past two decades, East Asia region has thus been the main
source of world growth and has emerged as increasingly trade and
investment linkages. Growing financial power derived from cumulative
surpluses is another important feature of the rebalancing of the world
economy, which has been accentuated by the deepening economic crisis in
the European Union, Brexit and in the USA. We are witnessing the end of
the long historical cycle during which wealth and power were
concentrated in the hands of a small number of countries in Europe,
North America and Japan.**]{.underline} (Siddiqui, 2019a; also Siddiqui,
2012b) [The hierarchical international system constructed in the last
three hundred years, that was centred in Europe, and which instituted a
global division of labour dividing the world into dominant cores and
dependent peripheries, is giving way to a multi-polar
world.]{.underline} In fact, the USA's Cold War strategy required a few
regions of secure and prosperous states in Northeast Asia to contain the
Soviet Union and China, until the late 1960s Sino-Soviet border tension,
and to minimise any possibility of radical movement in the region.
(Siddiqui, 2017b) This is also true of China, which, because of its
scale, nonetheless constitutes a special case. Gradual integration into
the world capitalist economy and export-led industrialisation modelled
on the neo-mercantilist strategies of earlier East Asian developmental
states has generated intense growth and real GDP gains over long
periods. The capitalist transformation has simultaneously led to spatial
polarisation, large-scale continental mass migrations, sharp new social
stratifications and major problems of environmental sustainability
linked to energy use and urbanisation. Sustained growth, fuelled by
transnational investment flows, has been made possible by the
mobilisation and exploitation of a vast subordinate labour force,
notably women concentrated in low value-added activities, raising
crucial issues of gender and class. While they highlight the need for
vigorous corrective measures, without which a country's development is
likely to be compromised, these problems do not call into question the
fact that the strategy followed since 1978 has been broadly successful.
China's pathway bears some analogies to US economic expansion in the
19th century, which was fostered by transnational flows and relied on
the exploitation of slave labour until the mid-19th century, and of low
wage immigrant labour in the latter part of the century. This comparison
is not meant to justify disciplinary Chinese labour policies, although
there are currently some signs of relaxation, much less the
authoritarian regime that is engineering capitalist transformation. It
merely points to the fact that China, through the exploitation of its
rural and most backward regions, is following the path of earlier
successful European Capitalism. Soon after the communist revolution in
China in 1949, the country faced enormous challenges, seeking to
overcome severe underdevelopment, widespread malnutrition and
illiteracy, and the Western monopoly over technology. It promoted
reforms to encourage growth and economic development such as the
government's introduction of radical land reforms, compulsory primary
education, and the availability of primary health care for all its
citizens. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of the 'open policy towards
the West' expressed this as: "Our country must develop. If we do not
develop then we must be bullied. Development is the only hard truth."
China's political orientation has been shaped by its history of
subjugation by foreign powers since the mid-19th century, also known as
the "century of humiliation", and anti-imperialist struggles for
national liberation. In the 1950s and 1960s, China extended support to
developing countries due to the collective struggle of formerly
colonised and oppressed nations against global inequality brought by the
West. Four decades later, [the success of the Chinese economic reform is
undeniable, and it is even noted that such a rapid economic
transformation has never happened in human history in such a short
period. According to the World Bank, China has lifted nearly 800 million
people out of poverty, more than ever happened in human history, and
generated "the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in
history". China's GDP growth has averaged 10% annually for over forty
years, without crises, with the country becoming a world leader in
manufacturing, technology and innovation. In mater of just two life
spans, from being extremely poor to an international power, China is now
predicted to overtake the US in GDP terms in the next fifteen years.
Measured in terms of PPP, China's economy already surpassed the US in
2018.]{.underline} Since the last decade, **[the US-China trade
imbalance has been rising against the US as shown in Figure
1.]{.underline}** The US has blamed China and claimed it is due to the
Chinese policy of currency manipulation. (Siddiqui, 2020b) After Donald
Trump became President of the US in 2017, he initiated a rise in tariffs
against certain Chinese products and also threatened more trade
sanctions against China and Russia. However, a number of studies have
pointed out that the US trade deficit rose not only with China but with
Europe and Japan as well (see Figure 2). Therefore, the persistence of
trade imbalances trends must be seen as a US domestic policy, rather
than putting the blame on others. I argue that a disparity in real costs
is the root cause of the US-China trade imbalance. [Figure 1, which
shows the trade in goods between the US and China, indicates that the US
has had trade deficits in goods with China since the early 1990s, which
has grown substantially. For example, the deficit was only US\$10
billion in 1990, but by 2000 had reached US\$100 billion; by 2005 it had
risen further to US\$200 billion, by 2012 it was US\$ 315 billion, and
by 2017 it had reached US\$376 billion. The sharpest rise was since
2001, which also coincided with China joining the WTO. For example,
China's exports to the US increased from US\$125 billion to US\$505
billion, while US exports to China increased only US\$19 billion to
about US\$130 billion for the same period.]{.underline} ![Figure
1](media/image2.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.3944444444444444in"}
Figure 2 indicates that China is an important trading partner for the
US, but that **[China still has less than half of the US's overall trade
deficits]{.underline}**. For example, in 2017 the US's trade deficit
with China was US\$ 375 billion; however, its overall trade deficit was
US\$ 775 billion. This means that **[even if the US were to eliminate
its trade deficit with China, its trade imbalance problems would still
exist.]{.underline}** ![Figure 2](media/image3.jpeg){width="6.5in"
height="2.6381944444444443in"} The US trade deficit and also external
payments kept on rising as shown in Figure 3, and has grown remarkably
over the last two decades. This was coincident with the period when
China joined WTO, which appears to have given the US an excuse to blame
China for raising its trade deficits. The US trade deficit with China
and other countries are shown in Figure 2. Since 1990, the labour and
total factor productivity in the advanced economies has witnessed
negative growth, while in the emerging economies including China it has
grown steadily, as indicated in Figure 5. ![Figure
3](media/image4.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.8868055555555556in"} The
US-China trade war has facilitated the establishment of Russia as
China's top strategic partner. This also led Russian oil to be
redirected from European countries to China. Chinese President Xi
Jinping announced in Russia in 2019 the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
both countries signed to develop bilateral trade and cross-border
payments using the Rouble and Renminbi, bypassing the US dollar.
(Siddiqui, 2020d) ![Figure 4](media/image5.jpeg){width="6.5in"
height="4.257638888888889in"} As China overtook the US as the worlds'
largest economy, a multi-polar world could be a welcome development for
all, especially the developing countries. According to Fortune 2018,
[among global 500 top businesses, the China has moved into second
position only behind the US (see Figure 4). The IMF has said that in
2019 China displaced the US as the world's largest economy. The IMF's
estimation is made on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, meaning
that it takes into account the differing prices in both countries.
Therefore, if at present 1 US\$ is worth Chinese 6.1 Renminbi on the
foreign exchange market, it means that 6.1 Renminbi can buy much more in
China than one dollar can buy in the US market. Hence, the PPP
comparison makes adjustments for this, and this is why the Chinese
economy is much larger than the measure most commonly used by
international organisations and media, which simply converts China's GDP
to US dollars at the official exchange rate.]{.underline} ![Figure
5](media/image6.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.6486111111111112in"}
[China is playing a very assertive and leading role in global affairs.
It has launched the trillions of dollars on 'Belt and Road Initiative'
-- called "the largest single infrastructure programme in human
history]{.underline}." The BRI involves over 70 countries and 1700
developmental projects, connecting Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin
America (Siddiqui, 2019c), while the US is facing economic stagnation
and decline, and is losing international control. The US President
Donald Trump in 2019 increased military spending rapidly to US\$ 716
billion and has brought into his cabinet extreme hawks and anti-China
hardliners such as Mike Pompeo and Peter Navarro. For US policy makers
and elites, rather than accepting this new challenge, they see it as a
threat to their world domination, and have formulated a recent policy
known as the "containing China" policy. Similarly, three-quarters of a
century earlier, the US took over as the leader of the capitalist world,
declared the Soviet Union as its main enemy, and began an arms race with
the Soviet Union. However, at that time the Soviet economy was
one-quarter of the size of the US. But now the situation is very
different, the Chinese economy is currently bigger than the US and also
has huge amounts of trade and a current account surplus. Even [after the
Covid-19 set back, the Chinese economy has not only recovered, but began
growing into the fastest economy in the world. Moreover, China has
emerged as the top investor country in the world in recent years. China
is a rising power, but they do not seem to be interested in building an
empire. For example, China's billon US dollar investment commitment to
'one belt one road', and it becoming the largest investor in Africa,
while the West has still not recovered from the 2008 financial crisis
and the more recent Covid-19 epidemic.]{.underline} It seems that due to
the long-term consequences of the COVID crisis, public debt in most
developed economies will rise sharply. In fact, the 2008 financial
crisis increased government debt in the US and EU. (Siddiqui, 2020c;
also Siddiqui, 2019b) We think of the financial crisis as a temporary
shock that the developed economies barely recovered from, but as we look
at the current crisis, it will increase government debt greatly compared
to the GDP. This is a legacy that will remain for a long time and will
pose very pressing policy questions. As we think about the future of
developed economies, in the US and EU, we have to ask ourselves how we
will be dealing with a level of government debt that will exceed, as a
share of GDP, the amount we had at the end of World War II. The
management of this new massive debt through the policy response in the
aftermath of the crisis will shape Western society, determining the
economic balance between generations, the actual opportunities for
future generations, and the technological disruption and transformation
that was already in place before this outbreak. VI. Conclusion As we
have discussed, **[the new globalisation cycle that began in the late
20th century has led to an unexpectedly rapid, albeit still incomplete,
rebalancing between emerging and advanced economies. East Asia has been
the main driver of a systemic change that is leading to new
transnational linkages between Asia, Africa and Latin America. These new
patterns of interaction are part of a broad process of gradual
decentring and restructuring of the world economy that, at the political
level, is leading to a diffusion of power. Domestic or international
events, for instance a hypothetical but not unthinkable Chinese
overreach in the South China Sea leading to sustained inter-state
tensions, might slow but are unlikely to halt a transformation that is
embedded in globalisation and has become one of its driving
forces.]{.underline}** The rapid economic development in the emerging
economies has been dynamically restructuring world capitalism from
within. It conforms to one of the historic aims of generations of
anti-colonial leaders and thinkers, gaining upward mobility and
achieving sovereign equality, the way in which it is occurring
represents a rather sharp break with the past. But unlike the first
generation of postcolonial leaders, who aimed for revolution or sought
to invent a 'Third Way' between capitalism and communism, and the
framers of the NIEO who challenged the intellectual and material
foundations of the post-1945 world order, the actors of the current
shift in global power relations are claiming a central competitive place
in the world capitalist system that their predecessors had attempted to
either reform or supplant. (Dos Santos, 1970) The success of that claim,
and their consequent implications for current and future global system
management, has dampened and in some cases entirely submerged the
broader emancipatory or universalistic dimensions of the long struggle
for independence, equality and justice. The rapid economic development
in the emerging economies has been dynamically restructuring world
capitalism from within. It conforms to one of the historic aims of
generations of anti-colonial leaders and thinkers, gaining upward
mobility and achieving sovereign equality, the way in which it is
occurring represents a rather sharp break with the past. It has now been
sixty-five years since the historic Bandung Conference of 1955, rightly
regarded as a milestone in the formation of SSC as a global political
movement. The SSC as a movement intended to challenge the
Northern-dominated political and economic system and, from the 1950s to
the present, has been through a series of starts and stops, surges and
retreats. As expressed at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung
in 1955, the newly decolonised countries of the global South emphasised
economic and political cooperation, human rights, and the promotion of
world peace. This emergent movement of solidarity among the developing
countries thereby sought to challenge global power relations. The
'Bandung Spirit' henceforth came to encapsulate policies of
non-interference and developing economic cooperation among the former
colonies to end global inequality while lessening their economic and
political dependence on the West. While Bandung and the NAM embodied the
political dimensions, the Group of 77, named after the number of
countries present at the founding of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), called for the establishment of a NIEO.
The NIEO was to be achieved through tackling structural unequal
exchanges through 'a just and equitable relationship' between the goods
exported by developing countries and the goods imported, with an
emphasis on sovereignty over natural resources and the right to
nationalise key industries and to formulate their own domestic economic
policies as sovereign nations. By the 1980s, however, the developing
countries' debt crisis and the rise of neoliberalism had served to
eclipse the NIEO project. The retreat of developing countries'
solidarity was given no clearer indication than at the 1992 UNCTAD
summit, when UNCTAD dropped its demands for the adjustment of the
international patent system to the developmental needs of the global
South, and adopted a statement expressing the belief that the adoption
of adequate and effective International Patent Protections and related
efforts in the World Intellectual Property Organization and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would facilitate technological
transfers to developing countries. Henceforth, UNCTAD had been sidelined
by GATT, and its successor the WTO. **[The study finds that people have
nothing to fear from a multi-polar world. And today it seems that the
time is ripe for emerging economies to stand up and demand a greater
role in the international arena related to the formulation of politics
and economics, and in support of its historic promise to transform the
world order. There has been a historically significant global shift in
production and manufacturing from the advanced economies to the emerging
economies, altering the economic geography of the world. The tendency
over the past several decades to greatly intensify the globalisation of
production, trade and financial flows was advocated primarily as a
systemic solution to underlying structural problems in the international
political economy, including growth, terms of trade, and productivity.
But these same globalising tendencies have also enhanced the historical
potential of economic growth and industrialisation in the emerging
economies, although currently limited to only a few regions, but
expected to spread in the coming decades.]{.underline}**

[IV. Growth of Regional Economy Although a significant share of East
Asia's trade is in intermediate manufactured goods for final destination
export to the USA, Europe and Japan, it has allowed for technology
transfers and has stimulated endogenous growth factors in East Asia
region.]{.underline} **[[The other dimension]{.mark} is regionalisation
and the intensification of transnational trade and investment [flows
among the developing countries]{.mark}. Regionalisation has been an
important feature of East Asian re-emergence. Initiated by the
relocation of Japanese manufacturing capacities in the 1980s, which
generated a concatenated division of labour in East Asia, regional
economic integration has deepened over the past decade and a half.
[Intra-regional trade as a share of total trade has thus risen
constantly over past decades]{.mark} by 20% in 1970, 32% in the early
1980s, 47% in the early 1995, 54.8% in 2000 and nearly 60% in
2012.]{.underline}** The Chinese government appears to be only focusing
on building its economy and the living conditions of its people. [China
has become the world's largest economy, but it has a population of 1.4
billion, which is more than four times larger than the US.]{.underline}
Having an economy the size of the US means that average living standards
are far lower than in the US and at present, per capita income is
one-fourth than of the US. It means that [China still has a long way to
go to become a rich country. **[Chinese]{.mark} annual GDP [growth
averaged over 9% between 1997 and 2019 and,]{.mark} in the aftermath of
the East Asian crisis, [trade and investment flows between China and the
rest of Asia grew significantly]{.mark}. Since the late 1990s, regional
trade with China has been growing faster than with the US. For instance,
Japan's imports from China already exceed those from the US, and
Japanese exports to China have been steadily rising. This same trend is
[apparent in]{.mark} [South Korean]{.mark}, Thai, [Malaysian]{.mark}
[and Singaporean trade]{.mark} flows**]{.underline} (Amsden, 2001;
Siddiqui, 2020a). Chinese leaders thus interpret the 1997 East Asian
financial crisis as a turning point: '**[The process of the East Asian
cooperation has been consolidated day by day since then \[and is now\]
based on a multi-layered, multi-faceted structure'.]{.underline}**
[Recent moves to gradually internationalise the Renminbi and use it in
regional transactions, such as the June 2012 Japanese--Chinese accord to
trade in their currencies rather than the dollar, represent a further
step in this direction.]{.underline} (Siddiqui, 2020d) [Trade between
China and all other developing countries grew significantly over the
past two decades. While the share of South America, Africa and South
Asia in China's total trade remains relatively small, it is steadily
growing]{.underline}, but **[[China's share in their total trade has
become strategically important]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The space is not
available for a comprehensive review of the new transcontinental flows,
but the pattern is clear even when we look at the data. Over the past
two decades Asia has become Brazil's main trading partner, accounting
for 30% of its exports and 31% of its imports. Exports to China, as a
share of total exports, have risen from 0.9% in 1992 to over 17%. China
has thus become Brazil's second trading partner, just behind the
European Union (21%) but well ahead of the US (10%). Argentina's exports
to China, as a share of total exports, have likewise risen from 1.1% to
9.7%. Similar patterns are apparent for Africa, where South Africa's
export share to China has risen from 1.8% in 1998 to over 12% in 2018,
while imports rose from 3% to 15%, and Nigeria's exports from 0.5% to
6.9%. In South Asia the share of Indian exports to China has risen from
2.9% to over 10%, and imports from 2% to 12% during the same
period.]{.underline} V. Restructuring Global Capitalism **[It seems that
the historic pendulum,]{.underline}** which had swung to the 'West'
i**[n the late 18th century, is swinging back to Asia, which is
reclaiming the leading economic role it held for a very long period
before the Age of the Western Empire. [The movement towards a
polycentric and plural world system has indeed quickened over the past
quarter century, as major Asian regions have consolidated their position
as a dynamic growth region]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the world
capitalist economy, **[developing regional and transcontinental linkages
that are [reconfiguring global trade]{.mark}, investment [and financial
flows]{.mark}.]{.underline}** First in the 1960s, economic changes began
in the East Asian region and later on in the 1990s, growth spread to
other developing countries like Brazil, China, India, South Africa and
Turkey. **[The systemic restructuring has primarily been driven by East
Asia, which has experienced a process of economic expansion, the
duration of which have been remarkable by historic standards. Beginning
with Japan's rapid economic transformation in the 1950s and 1960s, a
regional development dynamic was set into motion that spread
successively, in wave-like formations, to the Newly Industrialised
Countries and moreover, over the last four decades, to spectacular
growth in China.]{.underline}** [Varying initial conditions, historic
pathways and a combination of both state and markets have produced
positive results in East Asia. There are uneven country-to-country
developmental outcomes, distinguishing first and second wave
industrialising from third and fourth wave countries that are climbing
the ladder but are not far from catching-up with the most developed
economies]{.underline}. (Siddiqui, 2020c) Growing financial power
derived from cumulative surpluses is another important feature of the
rebalancing of the world economy, which has been accentuated by the
deepening economic crisis in the European Union, Brexit and in the USA.
Nonetheless, [a coherent process has been at work, unfolding over time
and space to most of the region, with global effects. East Asia's
aggregate share of constantly increasing world GDP (in PPP), which was
negligible in the 1950s, has thus risen from around 10% in 1980 to 30%
in 2015. China's share has grown from 2% to over 18%. Over the same time
period PPP per capita GDP in current international dollars was
multiplied by 14 in South Korea, by over seven in Singapore and
Thailand, by six in Malaysia and Indonesia, and by 39 in China (from
US\$250 to US\$9380 in 2019)--a spectacular increase that reflects the
intensity of growth and its cumulative impact. By the end of 2020 East
Asia's share of world GDP (in PPP) is expected to reach 32%, with China
accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total. In South Asia, India's
world share has risen from 2.5% to 5.5%, and per-capita GDP has
increased by a factor of 14, from \$419 dollars to \$3800 dollars today
(in current US dollars). Asia's aggregate share of world GDP (in PPP) is
thus projected to approach 46% in a few years. When other major
re-emerging countries and world regions -- **[Brazil, India, Turkey,
Mexico, and South Africa are taken into account, despite]{.mark} the
[Covid-]{.mark}19 setback[, their]{.mark} world [output]{.mark} share in
2020 [is expected to exceed 55%.]{.mark} Over the past two decades, East
Asia region has thus been the main source of world growth and has
emerged as increasingly trade and investment linkages. Growing financial
power derived from cumulative surpluses is another important feature of
the rebalancing of the world economy, which has been accentuated by the
deepening economic crisis in the European Union, Brexit and in the USA.
[We are witnessing the end of the long historical cycle during which
wealth and power were concentrated in the hands of a small number of
countries]{.mark} in Europe, North America and Japan.**]{.underline}
(Siddiqui, 2019a; also Siddiqui, 2012b) [The hierarchical international
system constructed in the last three hundred years, that was centred in
Europe, and which instituted a global division of labour dividing the
world into dominant cores and dependent peripheries, [is giving way to a
multi-polar world.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, the USA's Cold War
strategy required a few regions of secure and prosperous states in
Northeast Asia to contain the Soviet Union and China, until the late
1960s Sino-Soviet border tension, and to minimise any possibility of
radical movement in the region. (Siddiqui, 2017b) This is also true of
China, which, because of its scale, nonetheless constitutes a special
case. Gradual integration into the world capitalist economy and
export-led industrialisation modelled on the neo-mercantilist strategies
of earlier East Asian developmental states has generated intense growth
and real GDP gains over long periods. The capitalist transformation has
simultaneously led to spatial polarisation, large-scale continental mass
migrations, sharp new social stratifications and major problems of
environmental sustainability linked to energy use and urbanisation.
Sustained growth, fuelled by transnational investment flows, has been
made possible by the mobilisation and exploitation of a vast subordinate
labour force, notably women concentrated in low value-added activities,
raising crucial issues of gender and class. While they highlight the
need for vigorous corrective measures, without which a country's
development is likely to be compromised, these problems do not call into
question the fact that the strategy followed since 1978 has been broadly
successful. China's pathway bears some analogies to US economic
expansion in the 19th century, which was fostered by transnational flows
and relied on the exploitation of slave labour until the mid-19th
century, and of low wage immigrant labour in the latter part of the
century. This comparison is not meant to justify disciplinary Chinese
labour policies, although there are currently some signs of relaxation,
much less the authoritarian regime that is engineering capitalist
transformation. It merely points to the fact that China, through the
exploitation of its rural and most backward regions, is following the
path of earlier successful European Capitalism. Soon after the communist
revolution in China in 1949, the country faced enormous challenges,
seeking to overcome severe underdevelopment, widespread malnutrition and
illiteracy, and the Western monopoly over technology. It promoted
reforms to encourage growth and economic development such as the
government's introduction of radical land reforms, compulsory primary
education, and the availability of primary health care for all its
citizens. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of the 'open policy towards
the West' expressed this as: "Our country must develop. If we do not
develop then we must be bullied. Development is the only hard truth."
China's political orientation has been shaped by its history of
subjugation by foreign powers since the mid-19th century, also known as
the "century of humiliation", and anti-imperialist struggles for
national liberation. In the 1950s and 1960s, China extended support to
developing countries due to the collective struggle of formerly
colonised and oppressed nations against global inequality brought by the
West. Four decades later, [the success of the Chinese economic reform is
undeniable, and it is even noted that such a rapid economic
transformation has never happened in human history in such a short
period. According to the World Bank, China has lifted nearly 800 million
people out of poverty, more than ever happened in human history, and
generated "the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in
history". China's GDP growth has averaged 10% annually for over forty
years, without crises, with the country becoming a world leader in
manufacturing, technology and innovation. In mater of just two life
spans, from being extremely poor to an international power, China is now
predicted to overtake the US in GDP terms in the next fifteen years.
Measured in terms of PPP, China's economy already surpassed the US in
2018.]{.underline} Since the last decade[, **[the US-China trade
imbalance has been rising against the US]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[as
shown in Figure 1.]{.underline}** The US has blamed China and claimed it
is due to the Chinese policy of currency manipulation. (Siddiqui, 2020b)
After Donald Trump became President of the US in 2017, he initiated a
rise in tariffs against certain Chinese products and also threatened
more trade sanctions against China and Russia. However, a number of
studies have pointed out that the US trade deficit rose not only with
China but with Europe and Japan as well (see Figure 2). Therefore, the
persistence of trade imbalances trends must be seen as a US domestic
policy, rather than putting the blame on others. I argue that a
disparity in real costs is the root cause of the US-China trade
imbalance. [Figure 1, which shows the trade in goods between the US and
China, indicates that the US has had trade deficits in goods with China
since the early 1990s, which has grown substantially. For example, the
deficit was only US\$10 billion in 1990, but by 2000 had reached US\$100
billion; by 2005 it had risen further to US\$200 billion, by 2012 it was
US\$ 315 billion, and by 2017 it had reached US\$376 billion. The
sharpest rise was since 2001, which also coincided with China joining
the WTO. For example, China's exports to the US increased from US\$125
billion to US\$505 billion, while US exports to China increased only
US\$19 billion to about US\$130 billion for the same
period.]{.underline} \[figure omitted\] Figure 2 indicates that China is
an important trading partner for the US, but that **[China still has
less than half of the US's overall trade deficits]{.underline}**. For
example, in 2017 the US's trade deficit with China was US\$ 375 billion;
however, its overall trade deficit was US\$ 775 billion. This means that
**[even if the US were to eliminate its trade deficit with China, its
trade imbalance problems would still exist.]{.underline}** \[figure
omitted\] The US trade deficit and also external payments kept on rising
as shown in Figure 3, and has grown remarkably over the last two
decades. This was coincident with the period when China joined WTO,
which appears to have given the US an excuse to blame China for raising
its trade deficits. The US trade deficit with China and other countries
are shown in Figure 2. Since 1990, the labour and total factor
productivity in the advanced economies has witnessed negative growth,
while in the emerging economies including China it has grown steadily,
as indicated in Figure 5. \[figure omitted\] The US-China trade war has
facilitated the establishment of Russia as China's top strategic
partner. This also led Russian oil to be redirected from European
countries to China. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced in Russia in
2019 the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), both countries signed to
develop bilateral trade and cross-border payments using the Rouble and
Renminbi, bypassing the US dollar. (Siddiqui, 2020d) \[Figure Omitted\]
As China overtook the US as the worlds' largest economy, a multi-polar
world could be a welcome development for all, especially the developing
countries. According to Fortune 2018, [among global 500 top businesses,
the China has moved into second position only behind the US (see Figure
4). The IMF has said that in 2019 China displaced the US as the world's
largest economy. The IMF's estimation is made on a purchasing power
parity (PPP) basis, meaning that it takes into account the differing
prices in both countries. Therefore, if at present 1 US\$ is worth
Chinese 6.1 Renminbi on the foreign exchange market, it means that 6.1
Renminbi can buy much more in China than one dollar can buy in the US
market. Hence, the PPP comparison makes adjustments for this, and this
is why the Chinese economy is much larger than the measure most commonly
used by international organisations and media, which simply converts
China's GDP to US dollars at the official exchange rate.]{.underline}
\[figure Omitted\] [China is playing a very assertive and leading role
in global affairs. It has launched the trillions of dollars on 'Belt and
Road Initiative' -- called "the largest single infrastructure programme
in human history]{.underline}." The BRI involves over 70 countries and
1700 developmental projects, connecting Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin
America (Siddiqui, 2019c), while the US is facing economic stagnation
and decline, and is losing international control. The US President
Donald Trump in 2019 increased military spending rapidly to US\$ 716
billion and has brought into his cabinet extreme hawks and anti-China
hardliners such as Mike Pompeo and Peter Navarro. For US policy makers
and elites, rather than accepting this new challenge, they see it as a
threat to their world domination, and have formulated a recent policy
known as the "containing China" policy. Similarly, three-quarters of a
century earlier, the US took over as the leader of the capitalist world,
declared the Soviet Union as its main enemy, and began an arms race with
the Soviet Union. However, at that time the Soviet economy was
one-quarter of the size of the US. But now the situation is very
different, the Chinese economy is currently bigger than the US and also
has huge amounts of trade and a current account surplus. Even [after the
Covid-19 set back, the Chinese economy has not only recovered, but began
growing into the fastest economy in the world. Moreover, China has
emerged as the top investor country in the world in recent years. China
is a rising power, but they do not seem to be interested in building an
empire. For example, China's billon US dollar investment commitment to
'one belt one road', and it becoming the largest investor in Africa,
while the West has still not recovered from the 2008 financial crisis
and the more recent Covid-19 epidemic.]{.underline} It seems that due to
the long-term consequences of the COVID crisis, public debt in most
developed economies will rise sharply. In fact, the 2008 financial
crisis increased government debt in the US and EU. (Siddiqui, 2020c;
also Siddiqui, 2019b) We think of the financial crisis as a temporary
shock that the developed economies barely recovered from, but as we look
at the current crisis, it will increase government debt greatly compared
to the GDP. This is a legacy that will remain for a long time and will
pose very pressing policy questions. As we think about the future of
developed economies, in the US and EU, we have to ask ourselves how we
will be dealing with a level of government debt that will exceed, as a
share of GDP, the amount we had at the end of World War II. The
management of this new massive debt through the policy response in the
aftermath of the crisis will shape Western society, determining the
economic balance between generations, the actual opportunities for
future generations, and the technological disruption and transformation
that was already in place before this outbreak. VI. Conclusion As we
have discussed, [**[the new globalisation cycle]{.mark} that began in
the late 20th century [has led to an unexpectedly rapid]{.mark}, albeit
still incomplete, [rebalancing]{.mark}** between emerging and advanced
economies. East Asia has been the main driver of a systemic change that
is leading to new transnational linkages between Asia, Africa and Latin
America. These new patterns of interaction are part of a broad process
of gradual decentring and restructuring of the world economy that, at
the political level, is leading to a diffusion of power. Domestic or
international events, for instance a hypothetical but not unthinkable
Chinese overreach in the South China Sea leading to sustained
inter-state tensions, might slow but are unlikely to halt a
transformation that is embedded in globalisation and has become one of
its driving forces.]{.underline} The rapid economic development in the
emerging economies has been dynamically restructuring world capitalism
from within. It conforms to one of the historic aims of generations of
anti-colonial leaders and thinkers, gaining upward mobility and
achieving sovereign equality, the way in which it is occurring
represents a rather sharp break with the past. But unlike the first
generation of postcolonial leaders, who aimed for revolution or sought
to invent a 'Third Way' between capitalism and communism, and the
framers of the NIEO who challenged the intellectual and material
foundations of the post-1945 world order, the actors of the current
shift in global power relations are claiming a central competitive place
in the world capitalist system that their predecessors had attempted to
either reform or supplant. (Dos Santos, 1970) The success of that claim,
and their consequent implications for current and future global system
management, has dampened and in some cases entirely submerged the
broader emancipatory or universalistic dimensions of the long struggle
for independence, equality and justice. The rapid economic development
