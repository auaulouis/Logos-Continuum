#### Cooperation with NATO is an extension of Western IRs colonial project of maintain European supremacy -- it creates the conditions for violence and war against the periphery

In the celebratory events to memorialize the founding of
[NATO]{.underline} in 1949, it is usually forgotten that when the North
American Treaty was signed in April 1949 most of the [founding members
were colonial overlords. Colonialism and imperialism took a new form
under the leadership of US capitalists]{.underline} defending the dollar
and Wall Street. At that historical moment in 1949, the justification
for starting this organization was that it constituted a system of
collective defense whereby its member states agreed to mutual defense in
response to an attack by any external party. The external party in
question at that time was the USSR; insofar as NATO had been formed as
an alliance ostensibly to defend Western Europe against 'communist
expansion'. In the Treaty's renowned Article 5, the new Allies agreed
"an armed attack against one or more of them... shall be considered an
attack against them all." [The US military]{.underline} and industrial
leaders [studied]{.underline} the terror and propaganda tactics of [the
Nazis]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} learn the lessons of how to
[develop an efficient military machine.]{.underline} James Whitman in
the book, Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of
Nazi Race Law, outlined what the fascists had learnt from the eugenics
movement in the United States.\[10\] Although many anti-fascist
scientists from Germany had found a place in the US academy, the top
[planners of the Cold War linked]{.underline} the [US primacy
to]{.underline} the global history of [racism]{.underline} to the
efficient, bureaucratic and professionalism of conservative Germany. One
of the unspoken aspects of the first years of NATO was the question of
containing the possible revolutionary impulses of the German working
peoples. To forestall such a possibility, the thinkers and [planners of
NATO collaborated wit]{.underline}h the former [fascists to learn their
skills.]{.underline} The details of this alliance have been spelt out in
the book on the CIA by David Talbot in the book, The Devil's Chessboard:
Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's Secret Government. [The
merging of fascist ideas with]{.underline} the ideas of [Jim
Crow]{.underline} in the United States [were refined in]{.underline} the
secret operation called, [Operation Paperclip.]{.underline} Anne
Jacobsen, Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to Bring
Nazi Scientists to America, \[11\] elaborated in great detail the secret
program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely
carried out by Special Agents of Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC),
in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians,
such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from
Germany to America for U.S. government employment, primarily between
1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders,
of the Nazi Party. These elements were the foundation of a military
program that has brought us the weaponization of space. The creators of
[NATO]{.underline} simultaneously [mobilized the colonial and fascist
elements in Belgium, Spain, Italy and France.]{.underline} Of the twelve
founding members, six were outright colonial powers and at that moment,
countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and Portugal
looked to the USA to support their plunder of colonial societies. In the
specific case of France, [in order to assist French colonialism, Algeria
was named as a territory of NATO.]{.underline} Sixty years later when
the President of France, Macron, apologized for the crimes of [killing
more than one million]{.underline} Algerians, [there is no reflection
inside western]{.underline} academic [institutions on this role of NATO
in Africa.]{.underline} Currently, the French have been the most
aggressive in promoting the fiction that the defense radius of Europe
stretches 4000 kilometers out from Brussels, up to the arctic, well
across the Russian frontier and down into central Africa. It is not
widely known that, initially, the [Portuguese fascists were]{.underline}
some of the principal [beneficiaries of]{.underline} the membership of
[NATO, with]{.underline} major [deployment of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in the Azores [as reward for]{.underline} the NATO
[support for colonialism]{.underline} in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and
other Portuguese outposts of colonial domination. Prior to the formation
of NATO in 1949, the 1947 document of the State Department on
Cooperative Development of Africa had stipulated that colonialism would
assist the recovery of European capitalism. \[12\]The State Department
had been explicit in outlining how cheap foodstuffs and raw materials
from Africa would assist Europe's recovery and create the basis for
unity and economic regeneration. [The USA set about
creating]{.underline} a number of [international institutions to
guarantee the survival of]{.underline} Europe and [of
capitalism]{.underline}, the IMF, IBRD (World Bank), the NATO, GATT, to
guarantee the strength of the USA in international trade and finance. By
the time NATO was formed in 1949, the [US planners]{.underline} had
already made their plans with Britain and France to e[xtend]{.underline}
their [military control over Africa.]{.underline} France was bequeathed
the task of maintaining order in western Africa while the British sought
to maintain naval power incorporating the British facilities from the
Suez Canal down through Aden (Yemen), to Mombasa (Kenya), Simons town
South Africa across to Malaysia. \[13\] The racist apartheid regime had
persuaded NATO that it was necessary to integrate the South African
military into the western defense planning in order to protect the 'Cape
route.' After the Suez crises of 1956 and the 1967 war this alliance
with the racist regime deepened. Throughout its existence NATO assisted
in the refinement of the racial status hierarchy in which whites are
dominant and people of color are subordinate. \[14\] [This incorporation
of racist ideas into western defense continued a long tradition that
shaped the outlook of NATO]{.underline} and reinforced the outlook of
Frantz Fanon: "Colonialism is violence in its natural state." France and
Britain excelled in this violence with the Belgians cementing their
communications and logistics coordination to kill Patrice Lumumba and
later support the killing of the Secretary General of the United Nation,
Dag Hammarskjold. \[15\]

#### Their theory of IR is [wrong]{.underline} and [racist]{.underline} -- it relies on Western conceptions of sovereignty, and assumes a White, rational neoliberal subject at the core of decision making -- this propagates both [instability]{.underline} and [imperialism]{.underline} through the cloak of liberal restraint.

Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose1: Racism as shapeshifter -- The
polymorphous cycles of racism in everyday life and world politics

[While liberal conceptions construct a progressive-evolutionary vision
of world politics wherein racism gradually evaporates as the bright
sunlight of modernity intensifies, nevertheless, numerous critical race
scholars point to a recurring dark cycle of racial control that marks
the long history of modernity]{.underline} (e.g. Alexander, 2012:
20--58; Bonilla-Silva, 2018: 17--52; Omi and Winant, 2014: 84--91;
Perry, 2007). Focusing on the United States, Michelle Alexander (2012:
21) asserts that

> [racial history . . . is highly adaptable \[or polymorphous\]. The
> rules and reasons the political system employs to enforce]{.underline}
> status relations of any kind, including [racial hierarchy,
> evolve]{.underline} and change as they are challenged. The valiant
> [efforts to abolish slavery and Jim Crow]{.underline} and to achieve
> greater racial equality [have brought about]{.underline} significant
> changes in the legal framework of American society -- [new 'rules of

> and]{.underline} a new [social consensus,]{.underline} while producing
> many of the same results. [This dynamic,]{.underline} which legal
> scholar Reva Siegel has dubbed ['\[racist\] preservation through
> transformation,' is the process through which white privilege is
> maintained, though the rules and rhetoric change.]{.underline}

[This 'Groundhog Day' cycle entails pyrrhic moments of black victory
being subsequently rolled back by a white backlash whereby white racial
control is reasserted once more]{.underline}, albeit [in a new
guise]{.underline}, thereby [rendering the liberal conception of a
temporal movement of linear progress towards black liberation/justice as
but a Whiggish construct.]{.underline} For racism is a polymorphous
shapeshifter, crystallizing in different guises over time but retaining
its oppressive properties. Accordingly, [it is not that racism is
progressively undermined over time but that its outward appearance
becomes progressively more hidden]{.underline}, camouflaged or
sublimated -- at least [in the eyes of white people.]{.underline}

In the United States, the era of Reconstruction entailed the end of
slavery in 1865, together with the 14th Amendment (prohibition of states
from denying due process and equal protection under the law), the 15th
Amendment (the right to vote regardless of race) and the Ku Klux Klan
Acts (which declared interference with voting regardless of race as a
federal offence). But these progressive initiatives led on directly to a
white backlash. In particular, the Southern states sought to circumvent
these progressive initiatives while the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan
(KKK) backed up the states' reactionary activities through the
organization's sustained campaign of racist terrorism. Woodrow Wilson
(1901: 11) typified this racist episteme when he argued that 'the first
practical result of the Reconstruction under the Acts of 1867 was the
disenfranchisement . . . of the better whites and the consequent giving
over of the Southern governments into the hands of the negroes'.
Moreover, he dog-whistled to the KKK when he asserted that 'the white
men of the South were aroused by the mere instinct of self-preservation
to rid themselves, by fair means or foul, of the intolerable burdens of
governments sustained by the votes of ignorant negroes and conducted in
the interests of \[Negro\] adventurers' (Wilson, 1902: 58).

It was not long before the North retreated from the South to leave black
people at the mercy of the white backlash via the Jim Crow era of racial
segregation. Nothing changed until after World War II, with the next
transformational-moment-cum-pyrrhic-victory coming exactly 100 years
after the 13th Amendment (the abolition of black slavery) through the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. But the death of Jim Crow was followed by a
renewed white backlash that forged a New Jim Crow era that has remained
up to the present (Alexander, 2012; Bonilla-Silva, 2018). And this 'new'
era gained its legitimacy by dressing racism in more neutral cultural
clothing while maintaining racial oppression. Thus, in this New Jim Crow
era, the matrix of white power ensured that the black man would be held
back not because of his inferior genes but by his inferior culture,
though the 'invisible empire' of the KKK remained intact, albeit much
diminished.

[This American racial cycle comprises a microcosm of the wider cycle
that has played out across the West.]{.underline} Thus, in the 18th and
19th centuries, [the entwined discourses of scientific racism and
manifest cultural racism underpinned the identity of the
West,]{.underline} with both developing during and especially after the
Atlantic slave trade. Liberal visions emphasize the 'benign' Western
humanitarian drive, with the British termination of the slave trade in
1807 constituting the inception of a long, progressive process of black
liberation from racial oppression. But this is problematic because
Britain is celebrated for in effect putting out a fire that the British
and other Europeans had started. Even so, the British did not put out
the fire, because the ensuing white backlash saw racism and racist
imperialism deepen after the end of the British slave trade, while the
latter morphed into the highly oppressive indentured labour trade.

For many liberals at the time (e.g. Mitrany, 1933), the Paris Peace
Conference and the creation of the League of Nations Mandate System was
viewed as another turning point in the progressive liberation of black
and brown people. However, in addition to Woodrow Wilson's well-known
rejection of the Japanese delegation's proposal for a racial-equality
clause, his prior enunciation of the principle of sovereignty in his
(1918) Fourteen Points speech that triggered emancipatory hopes in the
hearts of the colonized peoples turns out to have applied only to
Eastern Europe and Wilson was categorically opposed to awarding
sovereignty to non-Western polities. Surely, though, Wilson stood behind
the 'humanitarian' Mandate system? Indeed he did, but only because the
system was founded on the racist-imperial idea of 'trusteeship' that had
first been explicitly conceived at the 1884 Berlin conference as the
guiding principle of European imperialism in Africa. For this conception
rested on the paternalist-racist assumption that the uncivilized races
were not yet ready to rule themselves and therefore must be held under
imperial trusteeship until they had 'grown up' (i.e. become Western).
Once again, the Western mandate of racial-imperial oppression remained
fully intact during the interwar period.

The next key 'turning point' occurs in the 1945--1960 period, when
decolonization was allegedly bequeathed by the gracious hand of the
benign West. Apart from the fact that decolonization was won by the
nationalist movements against the resistance of the colonial powers, the
subsequent postcolonial era has witnessed a continuation of racist
practices, albeit in the camouflaged guise of subliminal cultural-racist
concepts such as US hegemony and Western humanitarian intervention. But
while one might anticipate that the task of (orthodox) international
relations/international political economy scholars should be to
deconstruct such subliminal cultural racism, it turns out that they
have, albeit unwittingly, given it succour, as the next two sections
explain.

Cycles of racism in orthodox international relations theory

The core point is that [racism is a shapeshifter in that its outward
expression or modality changes over time while its underlying structure
remains the same.]{.underline} Before 1945 both scientific racism and
'manifest' cultural racism focused explicitly on race as a core
category, while after 1945 race disappears from international relations
theory's gaze and its conceptual repertoire. In particular, 1945 is
conventionally viewed as the watershed moment when international
relations jettisoned scientific and manifest cultural racism. In this
narrative, [the West's]{.underline} ensuing ['colonial racist guilt
syndrome' prompted the social sciences to 'make amends' by replacing the
dark old racist Weltanschauung with a bright new non-racist worldview in
which]{.underline} the post-1945 [i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations discipline [came to embrace a value-free,
positivistic posture through which the pernicious phenomena of racial
hatred and imperialism are thought to have been finally and mercifully
exorcized**. But the reality saw the creation of a**]{.underline}
**[brave new worldview in which explicit racism]{.underline}**
(scientific and manifest cultural racism) indeed died out in the halls
of the academy and **[were replaced]{.underline}** not by 'non-racist
cultural pluralism' but **[by subliminal cultural-racist
monism]{.underline}** that appears on first blush as socially acceptable
given that it no longer talks about race and its associated tropes
(Hobson, 2012: 185186, 319--322). Thus, **[in subliminal cultural
racism, Western academics did indeed distance themselves from the old
explicit racist tropes but reaffirmed them in whitewashed terms that
dare not speak their name.]{.underline}**

Thus, ['white supremacism' was replaced by]{.underline} the core modus
operandi of [Western universalism]{.underline} (a.k.a. 'Western
superiority') [and]{.underline}, albeit implicitly, [white
normality]{.underline}; racial hierarchy alongside the racial standard
of civilization were replaced by the proxies of cultural-institutional
hierarchy and [the Western market standard of civilization]{.underline};
'civilization versus barbarism/savagery' [was replaced by 'tradition
versus modernity' or 'developed versus undeveloped economies'; 'barbaric
Oriental despotisms' morphed into]{.underline} the tropes of '[rogue
states' and the 'axis of evil']{.underline} on the basis that such
states would not reciprocate according to the 'civilized norms' of
(Western) international law and (Western-based) 'international society',
[while 'savage anarchies' morphed into 'failed states']{.underline} on
the basis that they could not reciprocate. And last, but not least, the
old colonial denial of non-Western state sovereignty was replaced by the
construct of 'conditional sovereignty' in the postcolonial era, while
[imperial intervention was replaced by (the 'civilizing mission' of) US
hegemony, intervention by international financial institutions and
humanitarian intervention.]{.underline}

Accordingly, orthodox [international relations scholars have mistaken
the shift from explicit racism to subliminal cultural racism for one
that marks the transition from racism to non-racist, value free
'scientific positivism'. Critical race theorists view this transition as
one in which cultural difference masquerades as tolerant cultural
pluralism but that, in reality, is 'racism in disguise']{.underline}
(Balibar, 1991; Barker, 1981; Bonilla-Silva, 2018; Henderson, 2013;
Hunt, 1987; McCarthy, 2009; Miles, 1993; Omi and Winant, 2014; Perry,
2007; Salter, 2002; Vitalis, 2000, 2015). Thus, speaking of the
post-1945 substitution of cultural difference for racial difference,
Richard Perry (2007: 216) concludes that **['the terms may change,
perhaps giving the impression that the old \[racial\] problems have
disappeared, when in fact they have merely acquired protective
coloration through semantic camouflage'.]{.underline}** Or, again**[,
'the demise of scientific racism in its evolutionary-biological form did
not mean the end of racist thinking in scholarly
discourse]{.underline}** altogether. **[A new, post-biological modality
of neo-racism is now widespread in social science']{.underline}**
(McCarthy, 2009: 91). This cultural modality has also been termed
'racism lite' or 'colour-blind racism' (Bonilla-Silva, 2018).

Thus, [the evolution of i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [theory has mirrored the generic shifts in the
practice of racism in everyday life and in world politics given that the
discipline's racism has been hidden behind a non-racist
mask]{.underline} after 1945. [Unmasking modern international relations
theory reveals its emphasis on cultural difference as a proxy for
non-white racial inferiority and white Western superiority.]{.underline}
Thus, **[white international relations theorists often wear a
'non-racist mask' in order to make their cultural-racist theories appear
socially palatable]{.underline}** in the so-called cultural-pluralist
postcolonial era. Accordingly, **[all that has]{.underline}** really
**[changed]{.underline}** since 1945 **[is that the old racist Jim Crow
laws that international theory originally conceptualized became
sublimated or 'hidden in plain sight']{.underline}** (Henderson, 2013;
Rutazibwa, 2020; Vitalis, 2000), **[having morphed into the 'New
(subliminal) Jim Crow laws' of modern analyses of the global
economy/interstate system.]{.underline}** Uncovering this long temporal
passage that links the past with the present means that **[the
discipline has a fabricated detachment with the racist ghosts of its
past]{.underline}** (as Bryony Vince put it to me in private
conversation). What, then, of the racist double move that modern
orthodox international relations theories perform when analysing world
politics/global political economy?

Revealing the racist double move of orthodox international relations
theory

**[The giveaway concerning the racist foundations of modern
international relations theory lies not simply in what it does say but
as much in what it does not.]{.underline}** Thus, to postcolonialism's
rhetorical question as to whether racism has played an important role in
structuring world politics past and present, the orthodox reply is
simply 'nothing to see here'. **[This first racist move,
which]{.underline}** evacuates and **[whitewashes the presence of racism
in world politics]{.underline}** past and present, **[is complemented by
the second, in which international relations theory advances a racist
analysis of world politics/global political economy but in subliminal
cultural language that appears as value-free and 'racially
neutral'.]{.underline}** To illustrate this double move, I shall draw on
examples from my current research (Hobson and Odijie, forthcoming) and
from elsewhere.

The neorealist vision of the Cold War comprises a Western zone of
relative peace and stability that ensues from bipolarity or US hegemony
or the logic of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). But such ['peace and
stability' was only rendered possible because of the racist decision by
the superpowers to outsource war to the 'inferior' and expendable
'wastelands' of the Global South, which constituted a safety valve that
could prevent direct nuclear conflict from erupting between the USA and
the USSR.]{.underline} Thus, 'it appears that [cold war history has a
concentric conceptual organization, consisting of a "formal" history of
relative peace in the center and "informal" violence in the
periphery']{.underline} (Kwon, 2010: 155; see also Persaud, 2016).
Moreover, 'in a historical sense -- and especially when seen from the
South -- the Cold War was a continuation of colonialism through slightly
different means. . [. For the Third World, the continuum of which the
Cold War forms a part did not start in 1945]{.underline}, or even 1917,
[but in 1878 -- with the \[Congress\] of Berlin that divided Africa
between European imperialist powers']{.underline} (Westad, 2007: 396).
[This Western neo-imperialism also takes us back to the future of
America's racist-colonial drive in the 19th and early 20th
centuries]{.underline} (see Go, 2011; Hunt, 1987). **[But all of this
necessarily flies under neorealism's ontological radar scanner given its
evacuation of social process through its reification of the structural
logic of anarchy that is coupled with the deployment of the
Eurocentric/racist method of 'analytical bifurcation', wherein
racist-imperial processes are bracketed out and silenced in favour of
focusing solely on intra-Western white activities]{.underline}** (Go,
2016: 89--92, 104--110).

[This first move is complemented by neorealism's second, wherein a
subliminal cultural-racist theory is applied to analysing world
politics.]{.underline} Notable here is that European empires constituted
subsystems hierarchies in which the dominant hyper-sovereign colonial
power stood atop of the colonies that were denied sovereignty. But
Waltz's **[reification of international anarchy is triply problematic,
first]{.underline}** because **[this conception replicates the old
scientific-racist conception of 'tropical anarchy'
(]{.underline}**Henderson, 2013; Sampson, 2002; compare Lynch, 2019:
277); **[second,]{.underline}** because Waltz **[sanitizes or evacuates
hierarchy from world politics, thereby conjuring Western colonialism and
its practices of genocide, the Atlantic slave trade, land appropriation
and labour exploitation together with its neo-imperialist successor into
thin air]{.underline}** (Hobson, 2012: 203--208; Sabaratnam, 2020);
**[and, third,]{.underline}** Waltz's **[claim that sovereign states are
the dominant form of polity under modern anarchy is undermined by the
presence of colonial hierarchy]{.underline}** before the very recent era
of decolonization **[wherein the only sovereign states that existed were
Western.]{.underline}** Accordingly, Waltz's move **[serves to let
Western imperialism off the moral hook, thereby reflecting an
'epistemology of ignorance' (Sabaratnam, 2020]{.underline}**: 20--21;
see also Mills, 2007). Interestingly, we find an evacuation and
naturalization of Western empire in the classical realist work of Hans
Morgenthau (Hobson, 2012: 188--190; Salter, 2002: 117) and other
realists, which leads Nicolas Guilhot (2014) to talk of 'imperial
realism'.

By contrast, Robert Gilpin's neorealist hegemonic stability theory
embraces a normative (direct) imperialism that is dressed up in terms
that dare not speak its name (Hobson, 2012: 193--203). Gilpin (1987)
differentiates hegemons from empires, where the latter exploit
non-Western states while the former help them through the hegemon's
self-sacrificial provision of global public goods. But [the paternalist
sign of US hierarchical hegemony is that it supposedly uplifts states
around the world, with East Asian states singled out as]{.underline} the
most [egregious and ungrateful free riders]{.underline} that benefit
most from hegemonic largesse. Thus, what Gilpin misses is that [the
conception of uplift reconvenes Britain's paternalist-imperial
civilizing mission]{.underline} of the 19th century, though this elision
is inevitable given that he re-visions the British Empire as a benign
liberal hegemon. Significantly, Niall Ferguson (2004) effectively
reconvenes Gilpin's argument, though he talks explicitly about the
benign liberal imperialism of Britain and America. Moreover, **[this
benign conception that reflects an epistemology of ignorance effectively
boils off the coercive side of empire in the subliminal cultural-racist
distillation process, thereby providing an apologia for Anglo-Saxon
imperialism.]{.underline}**

[Similar cultural racist logics play out in liberalism]{.underline} (see
Hobson, 2012: 216--222, 285--310). While the normative (direct)
imperialist posture that is found in John Rawls's (1999) The Law of
Peoples is a very obvious example (Hobson, 2012: 292--295), nevertheless
the hard test-case here is that of neoliberal institutionalism. The
received wisdom is that [neoliberal institutionalism presents
a]{.underline} genuinely ['universal']{.underline} picture or [flattened
ontology of all states learning to cooperate in order to enhance their
gains. But it]{.underline} turns out that, in After Hegemony, Keohane
(1984) [confines this process to Western states]{.underline} (as did
Norman Angell before him). Moreover, [absent here is a]{.underline}
historical sociological [analysis that would reveal the]{.underline}
hierarchical-[imperial contexts that have driven both Western
unity]{.underline} (Sabaratnam, 2020: 25) [and the]{.underline} [global
process by which unequal gains accrue to the West at the expense of the
non-West.]{.underline} Paradoxically, constructivists critique
neoliberal institutionalism for its rational actor model by asserting
that interests are not a priori but are formed through socialization.
However, a close reading of Keohane's book reveals that [it is Western
norms and identity that socialize Western states into
cooperating]{.underline} (Keohane, 1984: 5--7, 43, 182). Accordingly,
Keohane not only looks specifically at Western states as the successful
actors, but argues that they take specifically Western cultural values
such as democracy and liberal capitalism to the table before they enter
iterated prisoner's dilemma games (Keohane, 1984: 182).

One of several (direct) neo-imperialist cues in Keohane's work emerges
from his approval of US hegemonic intervention and intervention by
international financial institutions in the Global South as a means of
extending complex interdependence across the world. But here the
[international financial institutions act as paternalist neo-imperial
vehicles for the cultural conversion of non-Western states along Western
neoliberal capitalist lines via the imposition of neoliberal
conditionality]{.underline} and structural adjustment programmes.
Moreover, [the notorious resentment that these programmes have invoked
in many non-Western states]{.underline}, all of which disappears in
Keohane's analysis, [takes us back to the future of the 'unequal
treaties' that emerged under]{.underline} Britain's informal
[imperialism]{.underline} in the 19th century, much as the paternalist
role of the international financial institutions finds its historical
parallel with the League of Nations Mandate System (Anghie, 2005:
245272). And, finally, Keohane's approval of Anglo-Saxon hegemony in the
19th and 20th centuries returns us to the problems that I discussed
above vis-a-vis hegemonic stability theory (see also Sabaratnam, 2020:
18--19).

A notable example of an indirect imperialist approach is found in the
[neoliberal theory of globalization,]{.underline} which rehabilitates
the classical liberalism of Adam Smith and his aversion to empire (e.g.
Friedman, 2000). But there are three subliminal neo-imperialist cues
here, the first comprising Friedman's (2000: 101--111) [argument that
non-Western states have no choice but to 'don the golden straitjacket',
which requires them to adopt Western neoliberal-capitalist
architectures. Having to become Western means that the theory smuggles
informal imperialism in through the backdoor of its Western
universalism.]{.underline} Second, [by subscribing to the ontological
proposition that 'the world is flat']{.underline} (Friedman, 2007), [the
neoliberal theory of globalization conjures Western
imperial/neo-imperial hierarchy and racial capitalism into thin air,
thereby naturalizing]{.underline} rather than problematizing these
phenomena via [the epistemology of white ignorance. And,
third,]{.underline} because Friedman [focus]{.underline}es [on rational
individuals whose interests are a priori and whose social identity is
irrelevant to individual behaviour, racism and racialized capitalism are
whitewashed from the global economy.]{.underline}

Surely [constructivism]{.underline} fares much better given its ability
to highlight international racial norms? Not only [has]{.underline} much
of it [ignored racism in world politics]{.underline} but the few
constructivists who have considered it argue that racism was left behind
in world politics after 1945 (Finnemore, 2003; Klotz, 1995), much as
imperialism was supposedly outlawed by the UN in 1960. [This
whitewashing of racism and imperialism from modern world politics not
only reflects the illusion that subliminal cultural racism projects but
is also a vital move because it allows liberal constructivists to
portray Western humanitarian interventionism and liberal
peacebuilding/state-building as a non-racist/ non-imperial project that
saves oppressed non-Western peoples.]{.underline} It is here that we
[encounter a subliminal cultural-racist paternalism that presents the
West as the white saviour of the inferior non-Western societies --
thereby]{.underline} [rehabilitating the]{.underline} 19th-century
conception of the [white man's burden and the civilizing mission -- and
where the West is (re)presented as the altruistic paternalist father of
the non-West]{.underline} (Hobson, 2012: 302--305). Moreover, [in this
liberal imaginary of ignorance, the notion that
peacebuilding]{.underline}/state-[building is initiated as a means of
eradicating the threat of the deviant non-Western Other disappears from
view, as does the legacy of Western empire that created]{.underline}
some of the core [problems in non-Western states that prompted
intervention in the first place]{.underline} (for further postcolonial
critiques of liberal constructivism, see Sabaratnam, 2020; Sampson,
2002; Vitalis, 2000).

[Liberal constructivism buys into the cultural-racist idea that all
progressive actions in the world are initiated by the universal West 'on
behalf of global humanity'. For example]{.underline}, it is [the benign
West]{.underline} that has single-handedly [brought human rights to the
world]{.underline} via the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[Here international relations' 'non-racist mask' slips conspicuously,
given that the Western great powers did their utmost at the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [to keep human rights off the
global agenda for fear of diluting white supremacy and white normality
in world politics and within Western societies. For it was]{.underline}
various [non-Western delegates at the UN that pursued human rights most
fervently while their Western counterparts mobilized the defensive
prerogative of sovereign independence to insulate their states from
future criticism given that human rights were denied to minorities
within their constituent societies, particularly native Americans and
black African Americans in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
Thus, [Western racist motivations and the progressive role of nonWestern
agency]{.underline} in advancing the cause of human rights in world
politics [have been airbrushed out of the liberal-constructivist
picture.]{.underline} And, in turn, [this serves to retain the chimera
of the purely progressive non-racist West and the regressive
non-West.]{.underline} Equally as egregious is that [the role of the
West in the denial of human rights to non-Western peoples in the first
place is somehow written out of the narrative.]{.underline} Still, much
of this is perhaps unavoidable given that liberal-constructivist
international relations tends ontologically to divorce power from norms
in world politics and epistemologically segregates power from knowledge.

Are orthodox scholars intentionally racist? Racist impact over intention

The case for intentionality is that it is no coincidence that the shift
from scientific racism to subliminal cultural racism in orthodox
international relations/international political economy theory mirrored
the trajectory of racism in everyday life and world politics. My hunch,
though, is that international relations theory's racism is unintentional
given that the overwhelming majority of orthodox international relations
scholars are most probably non-racist (but not anti-racist) in their
private lives. But orthodox **[international relations scholars have
mistaken a critique of their implication in structural racism for an
allegation of interpersonal racism. This epistemology of, or move to,
innocence links directly to the self-deluded heart of the orthodoxy. For
there are all manner of built-in cloaking devices that mask the racism
and whiteness of]{.underline}** orthodox **[international relations
theories from the eyes of their advocates. International relations'
'non-racist mask' has at least four mystificatory layers.]{.underline}**

[The first layer]{.underline} (or cloaking device) [is that racism
in]{.underline} orthodox [international relations/international
political economy theory is manifested in cultural rather than
biological terms]{.underline}, thereby appearing as outwardly non-racist
(given the mistaken popular belief that racism is inherently
biological). [The second]{.underline} layer of mystification [is that
cultural racism takes on a hidden or subliminal guise]{.underline}
(which exorcizes race as an ontological category from world politics),
[thereby making such racism much harder to detect.]{.underline}
Aggregating these two layers together leads white international
relations/international political economy scholars to buy into the
self-deluded rhetoric that their theories are racist-free. Pertinent
here is Blaut's (1992: 296) characterization of the social sciences
since 1950 as 'so much \[subliminal cultural\] racism yet so few
racists' (see also Memmi, \[1982\] 2000: 3).

[This mystification is]{.underline} ultimately [secured by the third
layer]{.underline} of the mask [that constitutes the problem
of]{.underline} blindness to [white privilege.]{.underline} For not
being on the end of racism's pernicious effects means that, unlike
non-whites, many white academics tend quite naturally to downplay its
existence (see Lake, 2016). [An]{.underline} obvious [example of this
lies with the everyday performance of driving from A to B]{.underline}.
For the vast majority of [white drivers are able to travel safe in the
knowledge that they will not be stopped by the police]{.underline}
unless they have been unlucky enough to have been caught breaking the
speed limit. [By contrast]{.underline}, many [black drivers consider
themselves lucky if they are not stopped by the police]{.underline} when
they have respected the speed limit. Such blindness to [white privilege
feeds directly into the unreflexive propensity to deny the presence of
whiteness and racism in both the theory and practice of]{.underline}
orthodox [international relations/international political
economy]{.underline} (Peterson, 2021; Sabaratnam, 2020: 5). For [the
ingeniousness of white privilege is that it renders such privilege
invisible.]{.underline} Thus, **[white people are effectively taught not
to notice racism and their role in reproducing it]{.underline}**
(McIntosh, 2020). **[Which, in turn, fuels the tendency of the
privileged to reject, if not protest vehemently, the accusation of
racism in the social sciences]{.underline}** -- as in the aforementioned
spat between Pankaj Mishra and Niall Ferguson (see Mishra, 2011). **[All
of which undermines the prospect of addressing, let alone redressing,
the problem at stake.]{.underline}**

Thus, while [a]{.underline} fifth great [debate concerning the
Eurocentric racism of]{.underline} orthodox [international
relations/international]{.underline} political economy is long overdue,
unfortunately the [chances of]{.underline} it [occurring are slim to
zero. This is]{.underline} partly [because intradisciplinary dialogue
between international relations' orthodox and critical wings has
completely broken down]{.underline} (De Carvalho et al., 2011), **[and
partly because a simmering 'white silence' of denial is the most likely
'response']{.underline}** (see, Ryde, 2019; Saad, 2020). Strikingly, it
is now some two decades since Robert Vitalis (2000) wrote his seminal
article, but still **[the tumbleweed of white silence
blows]{.underline}** deafeningly **[past my window.]{.underline}**
However, were [an explicit response]{.underline} [to]{.underline} be
forthcoming, two entwined paradoxes might emerge here, the first being
that it would most likely accuse my argument of being angry, hysterical
and outlandish, wherein ['Eurocentrism']{.underline} is deemed to be the
calm/rational 'standard of common sense' -- the paradox being that
rather than engaging with the substance of my critique, such a response
[would likely comprise an]{.underline} angry [ad hominem attack on
the]{.underline} accuser and the [journal for publishing such an
article.]{.underline} And the second paradox is that while most orthodox
scholars abhor 'cancel culture', it turns out that engaging in an ad
hominem attack serves merely to shut down debate on this vital issue.
That is, an ad hominem attack on the accuser is merely another form of
cancel culture. Still, both such 'responses' would reinforce my argument
given that **['white silence', 'white rage' and 'white denial' are
manifestations of white privilege]{.underline}** (see Ryde, 2019; Saad,
2020: 40--45; Sabaratnam, 2020; Peterson, 2021).

[A fourth cloaking device is that pre-1945]{.underline} orthodox
[international theory has been put through an ahistorical deracination
laundering process to reappear in whitewashed form]{.underline}, fit for
consumption in the 'cultural pluralist' post-1945 era. And because
post-1945 [international relations theory is (re)presented as non-racist
so the laundering of its]{.underline} pre-1945 [predecessor means that
international theory in the last three centuries is (re)presented as
universally racist-free.]{.underline} In this sleight-of-hand manoeuvre,
**[the racist underpinnings of]{.underline}** pre-1945 **[liberal and
realist theories are filtered out or conjured away, leaving only their
claims about states or geopolitics or interdependence that are
transmogrified into 'objective universalist'
propositions]{.underline}**. In the liberal pantheon, two examples are
pertinent. First is Norman Angell, who is (re)presented as a key
theorist of liberal interdependence and the peaceful benefits it
provides rather than as the paternalist-Eurocentric/cultural racist that
he was, given his fundamental belief in international hierarchy and the
positive need for the British Empire to promote harmonious global
interdependence by acting as the civilizer of the barbaric and savage
East (see Hobson, 2012: 40--45). Second is the reconstruction of Woodrow
Wilson, who is recast as the founding father of 20th-century progressive
liberal internationalism, based as 'it is' on anti-imperialism,
sovereignty and self-determination for all states rather than on what
'it was' -- a Lamarckian racist vision comprising a pro-Western
imperialist stance and a denial of nonWestern state sovereignty that was
coupled with strong racial immigration controls and anti-black
initiatives at home (see Hobson, 2012: 167--175). Similarly, pre-1945
realists typically mentioned in international relations textbooks
include Alfred Mahan and Halford Mackinder and occasionally Nicholas
Spykman, all of whom are (re)presented as geopolitical-realist thinkers
that analysed spatial conceptions of world power rather than as
Lamarckian scientific racists who advocated Western imperialism to
contain the marauding 'barbaric' non-Western peril and whose mentor was
the scientific-racist thinker Friedrich Ratzel (see Hobson, 2012:
123--130, 156--158).

Critically, this laundering process extends across all aspects of
pre-1945 international relations. Thus, it becomes (but should no longer
be) a revelation to learn that early international relations was
primarily concerned about inter-racial relations; that the claim that
international relations emerged formally in 1919 with the noble desire
to solve the problem of war elides its earlier origins, which revolved
around maintaining white Western global supremacy and racist empire
together with the normative study of 'effective' colonial
administration; that the journal Foreign Affairs was originally called
the Journal of Race Development; and that the International Studies
Conference at the League of Nations, which set up the subject matter of
international relations in the 1930s under the leadership of Alfred
Zimmern, grounded its syllabi in normative Western imperialism and
racism (see Acharya and Buzan, 2019; Ashworth, 2014; Bell, 2016; De
Carvalho et al., 2011; Henderson, 2013; Hobson, 2012; Kristensen, 2021;
Long and Schmidt, 2005; Lynch, 2019; Schmidt, 1998; Schmidt and Guilhot,
2019; Thakur and Vale, 2019; Vitalis, 2000, 2005, 2015). That orthodox
[international relations scholars persist in ignoring these]{.underline}
[arguments in the face of a now substantial body of literature that has
emerged]{.underline} over the last two decades means [that this
pervading silence can no longer be excused as the product of an innocent
'historical amnesia'**. Rather, this silence points clearly to the white
denial of international relations' racist origins wherein the non-racist
mask slips most conspicuously, thereby constituting an actual example
of**]{.underline} orthodox **[international relations' version of cancel
culture.]{.underline}**

However, except for in the above context, 'intentionality' is not the
issue that the racist charge hinges upon given that most international
relations/international political economy theorists are unintentionally
racist. **[What matters]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is racist impact
regardless of intention.]{.underline}** And to conclude this article
more generally, it would be folly to presume that if only the
Eurocentric rather than the racist charge were levied against the
orthodox mainstream then 'all would not be lost'. For the E-word cannot
be used as a 'get out of racist jail free' card.

#### "Treason to Whiteness is loyalty to humanity."

Beyond White Subject-Positioning in IR

Given this, what would it mean to re-imagine the study of IR in a way
that attempted to overcome epistemologies of immanence, ignorance, and
innocence? While it is impossible to do justice here to the wide range
of traditions that have alternative starting points, [as scholars of IR
our priorities should be to (1) 'de-mythologise']{.underline}121 [and
(2) 'de-centre' this racialised standpoint. Both require a more
sophisticated awareness of **epistemological situatedness**, a better
global-historical education and a **wider ethical and political
vocabulary**]{.underline} and universe. [It requires an
alertness]{.underline} not just [to]{.underline} the intellectual
contours of [Eurocentrism,]{.underline} but the interlocking **[moral
and epistemological consequences of White
subject-positioning.]{.underline}** They may be animated by the
abolitionist principle that **['treason to Whiteness is loyalty to
humanity'.]{.underline}**122 **[This principle does not build the
grounds for a 'redeemed' or 'modified' Whiteness but totally
deconstructs it analytically and ethically.]{.underline}**

[A 'de-mythologising' strategy challenges epistemologies of]{.underline}
immanence and ignorance -- the specific [racialised metahistorical
narratives and myths about the exceptional, vanguardist, and progressive
character of the 'West']{.underline} and its peoples [as a point of
departure for building international theory.]{.underline} Alternative
accounts are already available to us which emphasise the uneven but
interconnected ways in which the modern international system came to be.
These look at the contributions of the 'non-West' to the rise of the
'West',123 [the role of transnational networks as drivers of
development,]{.underline}124 [the enduring role of hierarchies as an
organising principle of global order,]{.underline}125 [the colonial
origins of sovereignty practice]{.underline}s126 [and the transnational
character of political thought]{.underline}.127 There is considerable
scope for more historically oriented work which excavates in particular
the relation between the 'colonial' and the 'modern'.

**[Another way of 'de-mythologising' Whiteness in IR is to re-think the
discipline's constitutive distinction between 'war' and 'violence',
particularly where the coding of historical events into one or another
category have been as a result of racialised categorisations and
thinking about whose deaths count, thus enabling an epistemology of
'innocence']{.underline}**.128 [Withholding the assumption that
'war']{.underline} (meaning wars as recognised by and between Western
powers) [rather than 'violence' should be studied in IR]{.underline} --
as in peace studies, for example129 -- [offers considerable scope for
contemplating]{.underline} the rich web of interconnections and
[entanglements that constitute the international system,]{.underline}
and [particularly its colonial, imperial and racialised inheritances**.
It is a particularly productive point of departure for conceiving of
questions of consent and sovereignty under radical
inequalities**]{.underline} of power globally, and potential shared
forms of theorising among **[feminist approaches]{.underline}**,130
critical environmentalisms,131 **[Indigenous political
thought]{.underline}**,132 and so on.

**['De-centring' Whiteness means]{.underline}** not only a regional
expansion of IR's gaze but **[more profoundly a re-locating of its
intellectual and ethical centre of gravity]{.underline}** away from its
stories of 'immanence' and 'innocence'. **[One way]{.underline}** of
doing this might be, **[as Wynter does, to re-centre Blackness as the
starting point]{.underline}** for the embrace of the 'human' in all its
multiple potentialities, **[given that Blackness has been historically
overdetermined by experiences and epistemes which locate it at the
underside of humanity.]{.underline}**133 [This radical shaking-up of
IR's epistemological orientations would be particularly productive in
dismantling the limits identified here. **This could connect them
to**]{.underline} forms of worldly **[politics rooted in experiences of
diasporic connectivity and suffering, and]{.underline}** creativity and
**[solidarity]{.underline}**.134 **[These signal different sites of
sovereignty, rights, borders, and power]{.underline}**,135 and open up
questions of historical injustice, responsibility, and reparations. [It
could conceive of more 'conventional' IR theory that began with African
presence rather than absence.]{.underline}136 Finally,
**[working]{.underline}** with and **[through Blackness would give an
important corrective to debates]{.underline}** on the 'post-human'
**[which have not always contemplated the racialisation of humanity in
depth]{.underline}**.137 The point here is not simply to 'replace'
White-centredness with Black-centredness as part of historical justice
-- but through [re-positioning]{.underline} to [reveal what has been
obscured]{.underline} about the organisation of authority,
relationality, rights, obligations, materiality, and knowledge.

Would the kind of IR theory examined here be possible with such starting
points? Absolutely. [A research programme focused on 'Great Powers'
would still be possible but]{.underline} be explicitly a study of
empires and other polities across time and space. [It would have to
embrace rather than ignore their internal diversities and forms of
interconnectedness]{.underline} -- overall, **[this might lead to an
abandonment of the 'anarchy']{.underline}** problematique **[in favour
of a more positive]{.underline}** historical **[appreciation of diverse
forms of authority and sociality.]{.underline}** For a research
programme interested in international co-operation, it would have to
take a wider understanding of the kinds of co-operation which are
possible, the kinds of political purposes that they underpin, and the
forms of exclusion, collusion, and expropriation which are likely
involved in setting them up. **[This would make it impossible to study
'institutions' or 'organisations' among powerful actors in a way which
is disembedded from their political foundations.]{.underline}**
Similarly, [for a research programme interested in]{.underline} the
emergence of [forces of socialisation]{.underline} and collective
identification, much **[more attention would need to be paid to the
political context and]{.underline}** drivers of particular forms of
sociality and the **[kinds of coercion enabled by productions of
Otherness. All such projects would be informed by that spirit of
hermeneutic suspicion with which writers not racialised as White have
often greeted projections of Western civilisation.]{.underline}**

However, it is up to the field as a whole to uphold standards of rigour
which make the persistence of racialised ignorance, immanence, and
innocence impossible. **[What has happened over the last several decades
has been a continued asymmetry]{.underline}** in the practice of our
'science', **[such that]{.underline}** the profound **[epistemological
challenges]{.underline}** presented for the field in a range of critical
writing **[have been sidelined through practices of training and
citation which]{.underline}** together **[reproduce a White
subject-position in the discipline.]{.underline}** The vast bulk of
references to ToIP, AH, and SToIP continue to treat them as
authoritative texts. **[This is an institutional problem]{.underline}**
more than an epistemological one in many respects and one that is
unlikely to be solved in the near future, or at least by this
generation. **[Identifying the logics]{.underline}** constitutive **[of
Whiteness in IR]{.underline}** theory **[is a necessary step towards
institutional change,]{.underline}** but no more than that. **[In the
absence of this change, IR theory will continue to be
White.]{.underline}**

that there is then still a genocidal potential?

MBEMBE: Perhaps more than at any other moment in our recent past, we are
increasingly faced with the question of what to do with those whose very
existence does not seem to be necessary for our reproduction; those
whose mere existence or proximity is deemed to represent a physical or
biological threat to our own life.

[Throughout history]{.underline}, and in response to this question,
[various paradigms of rules have been designed for human bodies deemed
either in excess, unwanted, illegal, dispensable, or superfluous. One
historical response has consisted in putting in place spatial
exclusionary arrangements. Such was]{.underline}, for instance, [the
case during]{.underline} the early phases of modern [settler or
genocidal colonialism in relation to Native American
reservations]{.underline} in the United States, [island prisons, penal
colonies]{.underline} such as Australia, [camps and]{.underline} even
[Bantustan]{.underline}s in South Africa.

[Two late modern examples are Gaza and the encaging of migrant children
in the context of the ongoing planetary war on mobility.]{.underline}
Gaza and the encaging of migrant children might well prefigure what is
yet to come.

In the case of Gaza, control of vulnerable, unwanted, surplus or
racialized people is exercised through a combination of tactics, chief
among which is modulated blockade or molecular strangulation. A blockade
prohibits, obstructs, and limits who and what can enter and leave the
Strip. The goal might not be to cut the Strip off entirely from supply
lines, infrastructural grids or trade routes. The Strip is nevertheless
relatively sealed off and strangulated in a way that effectively turns
it into an imprisoned territory. [Comprehensive or relative closure is
accompanied by periodic military escalations and the generalized use of
extra-judicial assassinations. Spatial violence]{.underline},
humanitarian strategies, [and a]{.underline} peculiar [biopolitics of
punishment all combine to produce]{.underline}, in turn, [a]{.underline}
peculiar [carceral space in which people deemed surplus, unwanted, or
illegal are governed through abdication of any responsibility for their
lives and their welfare.]{.underline}

But as I have intimated, [there is another, early twenty-first century
example, which consists in waging new forms of wars, which can be called
wars on speed and mobility. **Wars on mobility are wars whose aim is to
turn discounted bodies into borders.**]{.underline} They generally begin
by turning into dust and piles of ruins the milieux as well as means of
existence and survival of vulnerable people thus forced to flee in
search of a refuge. **[These kinds of wars against milieux and
ecosystems rendered toxic and uninhabitable are not accidental. They are
methodically programmed and conducted. Such]{.underline}** milieux and
**[ecosystems are sites of experimentation of new weapons. The targets
of this kind of warfare are]{.underline}** not by any means singular
bodies, but rather **[great swathes of humanity judged worthless and
superfluous.]{.underline}**

TORBJØRN: Can you elaborate a bit more on that?

MBEMBE: Let me put it differently. Nowadays [the project is to render as
many people as superfluous as possible. The novelty is the production at
a massive scale of discounted bodies, a residual humanity that is akin
to waste. With our entry into a new climatic regime, this process will
only intensify.]{.underline} As the global conditions for the production
and reproduction of life on Earth keep changing, [population politics at
a planetary level will increasingly become synonymous with excess and
waste management**. In terms of the future geopolitics of our world,
populations will be more and more treated**]{.underline} not only in the
**[Darwinian]{.underline}** terms of sexual selection, but also
**[within a utilitarian]{.underline}** and biophysiologico-organic
**[framework.]{.underline}**

Take a place such as South Africa where a very high percentage of the
total population is unemployed. This is not because there is no "work as
such". This is not because people do not want to work.

In fact, here as elsewhere in Africa and other parts of the global
South, almost everything remains to be done. [The amount of work needed
in order to create a better life for all is incalculable. **But the
structure of the economy doesn't really need us all.** Nor does it need
our time. It doesn't really need every single body, all of our muscles
or energies or even the bulk of our social and collective
intelligence**. And this will be more and more the case in the future,
as we move to a phase of human history in which only that which is
computable counts.**]{.underline} As we speak, **[many bodies already
fall beyond the scope of calculation. Unless we reinvent the terms of
what counts and, in the process, resignify]{.underline}** what
**[value]{.underline}** stands for **[as well as the procedures of
assigning value]{.underline}**, of measuring value, of exchanging value,
**[things won't change.]{.underline}** These are some of the key
questions any decolonization project worthy of its name has to address
if the injunction to decolonize is to be more than a mere ideological
phantasm.

TORBJØRN: Back to the debate on decolonization: There was a heated
debate in Norway, during the summer of 2018, about the decolonization of
academia. How can #RhodesMustFall in South Africa be relevant for
universities worldwide?

MBEMBE: **[The need for a critical re-appraisal of the relationship
between knowledge, power and institutions]{.underline}** is not an
exclusively South African preoccupation. In South Africa, the term
"decolonization" **[is one way in which concerns about "deracialization"
are expressed.]{.underline}** The imperative to "deracialize" is also
valid for Europe, for the United States, for Brazil and for other parts
of the world. **[The emergence of new varieties of racism in Europe and
elsewhere, the reassertion of global white supremacy, of
populism]{.underline}** and retro-nationalism, **[the weaponization of
difference]{.underline}** and identity **[are not only
symptoms]{.underline}** of a deep distrust of the world. **[They are
also fostered by transnational forces capable of making that same
world]{.underline}** inhospitable, **[uninhabitable and
unbreathable]{.underline}** for many of us.

All of this is of course important. But part of what truly frightens me
is the recolonization of various fields of knowledge by all kinds of
determinisms. **[What frightens me is the active confusion between
knowledge and data, the reduction of knowledge to information. It's the
idea that the world is a matter of numbers and the task of knowledge is
to handle quantities.]{.underline}** Furthermore, it's the belief that
the best way to generate information is with computers and that which is
not computable does not exist. **[It's the creeping sense that the
computer is our new brain.]{.underline}**

In such a context, **["to decolonize" must start from the assumption
that knowledge cannot be reduced to computational information
processing. There is therefore a massive need to recover the ability to
think.]{.underline}** And for me, knowledge is on the verge of being
reduced to a reified metaphor. As a result, [we are witnessing almost
everywhere a tremendous impoverishment of thought.]{.underline}

TORBJØRN: In the Norwegian debate on decolonization, one of the demands
from the young student activists was to have a more global curriculum.
What's your take on that?

MBEMBE: Right now [we are literally assaulted by forces that want
to]{.underline} retreat from the world and [rebuild a certain idea of
the nation, of the community]{.underline}, of identity and difference
[that is premised on the capacity to determine]{.underline} who belongs,
[who must be excluded and shouldn't belong]{.underline}, who can settle
where, why, how and for how long. **[Such forces are preoccupied with
the erection of all kinds of borders and how they must be policed. They
buy in the dream of a "pure" community, a community of people
who]{.underline}** look the same **[and act the same.]{.underline}**
They are sustained by the belief that we can go back to the past because
the past is, in truth, our future. **[Let me just call it the dream of
apartheid.]{.underline}**

**[There is another dream]{.underline}**, maybe not unrelated to the
first. As I have just highlighted, it's the dream of reducing knowledge
to calculation by computers. In fact, it's the dream [**of reducing
everything to calculation and explaining everything from within
biological and neurological strictures**. A planetary
library]{.underline}, archive or, for that matter, curriculum is one
[whose strategic project is to understand the incalculable and the
incomputable.]{.underline} It can only be based on the will to go beyond
cognitivism. I am not against calculation or mathematics. Nor am I
against computation. I am simply saying that [neither
calculation]{.underline}, nor mathematics, [nor computation are
sufficient for explaining life. It can't be enough to do correct
math]{.underline}ematics. **[Once we have done correct mathematics, we
still need to determine what this exercise implies for the life of
beings.]{.underline}** Pushed to a certain level, correct mathematics
alone impoverish thought and destroy theory.

Otherwise, we only have one world. We might dream about colonizing Mars
or Venus or other unknown planets in the future, but for the time being
that is not part of our actuality. **[We only have one
world,]{.underline}** one solar system **[and for this world to
last]{.underline}** as long as possible and for this solar system to not

#### The end of the world has already occurred -- its try-or-die for an alternative form of being-in-the-world 

**Death 22** -- Senior Lecturer in International Political Economy at
the University of Manchester \[Carl, "Africanfuturist Socio-Climatic
Imaginaries and Nnedi Okorafor's Wild Necropolitics," Antipode, Volume
54, Issue1 January 2022 Pages 240-258, DKP\]

Achille [Mbembe's]{.underline} (2019:7) [diagnosis of the present is
that "\[n\]early everywhere the political order is reconstituting itself
as a form of organisation for death". Even liberal
democracies]{.underline}, he argues, [are]{.underline} increasingly
[characterised by "separation, hate movements, hostility,
and]{.underline}, above all, [struggle against an enemy"]{.underline}
(Mbembe 2019:42). [War, racial hatred, the strengthening of borders and
expulsion of enemies, the extreme inequality of contemporary capitalism,
and the accelerating violence of runaway climate change
produce]{.underline} what he terms [an era of
necropolitics]{.underline}, which the Covid-19 crisis has merely
exacerbated and heightened. [He uses the term necropolitics to account
for the various ways in which diverse weapons are deployed in the
interest of destroying life, and suggests that, **"for a large share of
humanity, the end of the world has already occurred"**]{.underline}
(Mbembe 2019:29). This trenchant picture resonates strongly, as we will
see below, with the world Okorafor presents in the novel Who Fears
Death. Like Okorafor, however, Mbembe does not flinch from this
portrayal of a world characterised by violence and death, nor does he
abandon all hope of a more convivial politics. Rather, he asks: [What do
human freedom and vulnerability mean in a necropolitical context? What
alternative forms of being-in-the-world are possible?]{.underline}
Refusing the binary choice between either violence or freedom, Mbembe
(2019:92) suggests that "today's form of necropower blurs the lines
between resistance and suicide, sacrifice and redemption, martyrdom and
freedom".

Frantz Fanon (2001, 2008) wrote in the 1950s of the need for a "new
humanism" that would set mankind free and restore human dignity, love,
and understanding. This concern with the politics and possibilities of a
new humanism is central to black feminist traditions of thought, which
have done most to explore these questions precisely because [the
dominant genre of the human---Man---has always been irreducibly raced
and gendered.]{.underline} As Sylvia Wynter (2003:313) puts it:

> [This issue is that of the genre of the human]{.underline}, the issue
> whose target of abolition is the ongoing collective production of our
> present ethnoclass mode of being human, [Man: above all, its
> overrepresentation of its well-being as that of the human species as a
> whole, rather than as it is veridically: that of the Western and
> westernised (or conversely) global middle classes.]{.underline}

[This predominance of a particular conception of human existence, and
its constitutive role in carboniferous capitalism, racialised
colonialism, patriarchy, and necropower, is why it is necessary to "go
about thinking and living enfleshment otherwise so as to usher in
different genres of the human"]{.underline} (Weheliye 2014:2; see also
Jackson 2020; Mbembe 2019:2). Inspired by Fanon's (2008:180) call to
"introduce invention into existence", Wynter asks: "How do we be, in
Fanonian terms, hybridly human?" (in Wynter and McKittrick 2015:45).

[For theorists like Mbembe, Wynter, Weheliye, Jackson, and others, art
and the imagination have a crucial role to play.]{.underline} As Wynter
argues, [humans are a storytelling species:]{.underline} "the human is
homo narrans", at least since African ancestors scratched an intricate
symbol on a piece of ochre in Blombos Cave (Wynter and McKittrick
2015:25, 66). Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020:1) shows that [imaginative
work can frequently alter "the meaning and significance of being
(human)".]{.underline} Exploring the work of authors like Toni Morrison,
Nalo Hopkinson, Audre Lorde, Wangechi Mutu, and Octavia Butler, Jackson
(2020:4) explains how such texts can provoke "unruly yet generative
conceptions of being". [Reading and writing]{.underline} novels [is
itself a form of theorising about the world, and a way of practising new
modes of being and freedom]{.underline} (Ashcroft et al. 2002; Gergan et
al. 2020; Haraway 2016:12; Weheliye 2014:16).

### 2NC -- AT -- Util 

#### Everyday violence is a [massive]{.underline} impact -- you should prioritize it or risk terrible policymaking 

**Olson 15 -- prof of geography @ UNC Chapel Hill**

(Elizabeth, 'Geography and Ethics I: Waiting and Urgency,' *Progress in
Human Geography*, vol. 39 no. 4, pp. 517-526)

Though toileting might be thought of as a special case of bodily
urgency, geographic research suggests that [the body is increasingly set
at odds with large]{.underline}r [scale ethical concerns, especially
**large-scale future events of forecasted suffering**]{.underline}.
Emergency planning is a particularly good example in which the
[large-scale threats of future suffering can **distort moral
reasoning**]{.underline}. Žižek (2006) lightly develops this point in
the context of the war on terror, where in the presence of fictitious
and real ticking clocks and warning systems, [the urgent body must be
**bypassed** because there are **bigger scales to worry
about**]{.underline}:¶ What does this all-pervasive sense of urgency
mean ethically? The pressure of events is so overbearing, the stakes are
so high, that they nec essitate a suspension of ordinary ethical
concerns. After all, displaying moral qualms when the lives of millions
are at stake plays into the hands of the enemy. (Žižek, 2006)¶ In the
presence of large-scale future emergency, [the urgency to secure the
state, the citizenry, the economy, or the climate creates new scales and
new temporal orders of response]{.underline} (see Anderson, 2010;
Baldwin, 2012; Dalby, 2013; Morrissey, 2012), many of which treat the
urgent body as impulsive and thus requiring management. McDonald's
(2013) analysis of three interconnected discourses of 'climate security'
illustrates how bodily urgency in climate change is also recast as a
menacing impulse that might require exclusion from moral reckoning. The
logics of climate security, especially those related to national
security, 'can encourage perverse political responses that not only fail
to respond effectively to climate change but may present victims of it
as a threat' (McDonald, 2013: 49). [**Bodies that are currently
suffering cannot be urgent**, because they are **excluded from the
potential collectivity** that could be **suffering everywhere in some
future time**]{.underline}. Similar [bypassing of existing bodily
urgency is echoed in writing about]{.underline} violent securitization,
such as drone warfare (Shaw and Akhter, 2012), and also in [**intimate
scales** like the street and the school, especially in relation to
race]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2009; Young et al., 2014).¶ [As
**large-scale urgent concerns are institutionalized**, the urgent body
is increasingly **obscured through technical planning and
coordination**]{.underline} (Anderson and Adey, 2012). [The predominant
characteristic of this institutionalization]{.underline} of large-scale
emergency [is a '**built-in bias for action'**]{.underline} (Wuthnow,
2010: 212) **[that circumvents contingencies]{.underline}**. [The urgent
body is at best an assumed eventuality, one that will]{.underline}
likely [require]{.underline} another state of waiting, such as
**[triage]{.underline}** (e.g. Greatbach et al., 2005). Amin (2013)
cautions that in much of the West, governmental need to provide evidence
of laissez-faire governing on the one hand, and assurance of strength in
facing a threatening future on the other, produces 'just-in-case
preparedness' (Amin, 2013: 151) of neoliberal risk management policies.
In the US, 'personal ingenuity' is built into emergency response at the
expense of the poor and vulnerable for whom '\[t\]he difference between
abjection and bearable survival' (Amin, 2013: 153) will not be
determined by emergency planning, but in the material infrastructure of
the city.¶ In short, [the urgencies of the body provide justifications
for social exclusion of the most marginalized based on]{.underline}
impulse and [perceived threat]{.underline}, while **[large-scale future
emergencies effectively absorb the deliberative power of urgency into
the institutions of preparedness and risk avoidance]{.underline}**.
[Žižek references Arendt's]{.underline} (2006) [analysis of the banality
of evil to explain]{.underline} the [current]{.underline} state of
[ethical reasoning]{.underline} under the war on terror, noting that
people who perform morally reprehensible actions under the conditions of
urgency assume a 'tragic-ethic grandeur' (Žižek, 2006) by sacrificing
their own morality for the good of the state. But his analysis fails to
note that bodies are today so rarely legitimate sites for claiming
urgency. [In the]{.underline} context of the [**assumed priority of the
large-scale future emergency**, the urgent body becomes **literally
nonsense, a non sequitur** within societies, states and worlds that will
**always be more urgent**]{.underline}.¶ If the important ethical work
of urgency has been to identify that which must not wait, then the
capture of the power and persuasiveness of urgency by large-scale future
emergencies has consequences for the kinds of normative arguments we can
raise on behalf of urgent bodies. How, then, might waiting compare as a
normative description and critique in our own urgent time? Waiting can
be categorized according to its purpose or outcome (see Corbridge, 2004;
Gray, 2011), but it also modifies the place of the individual in society
and her importance. As Ramdas (2012: 834) writes, '[waiting ... produces
hierarchies which segregate people and places into those which matter
and those which do not']{.underline}. The segregation of waiting might
produce effects that counteract suffering, however, and Jeffery (2008:
957) explains that though the 'politics of waiting' can be repressive,
it can also engender creative political engagement. In his research with
educated unemployed Jat youth who spend days and years waiting for
desired employment, Jeffery finds that 'the temporal suffering and sense
of ambivalence experienced by young men can generate cultural and
political experiments that, in turn, have marked social and spatial
effects' (Jeffery, 2010: 186). Though this is not the same as claiming
normative neutrality for waiting, it does suggest that waiting is more
ethically ambivalent and open than urgency.¶ In other contexts, however,
our descriptions of waiting indicate a strong condemnation of its
effects upon the subjects of study. [Waiting can demobilize radical
reform, **depoliticizing 'the insurrectionary possibilities of the
present by delaying the revolutionary imperative to a future moment that
is forever drifting towards infinity'**]{.underline} (Springer, 2014:
407). Yonucu's (2011) analysis of the self-destructive activities of
disrespected working-class youth in Istanbul suggests that this sense of
infinite waiting can lead not only to depoliticization, but also to a
disbelief in the possibility of a future self of any value. [Waiting,
like urgency, can **undermine the possibility of
self-care**]{.underline} two-fold, first by making people wait for
essential needs, and again by reinforcing that waiting is '\[s\]omething
to be ashamed of because it may be noted or taken as evidence of
indolence or low status, seen as a symptom of rejection or a signal to
exclude' (Bauman, 2004: 109). This is why Auyero (2012) suggests that
waiting creates an ideal state subject, providing 'temporal processes in
and through which political subordination is produced' (Auyero, 2012:
loc. 90; see also Secor, 2007). Furthermore, Auyero notes, it is not
only political subordination, but the subjective effect of waiting that
secures domination, as citizens and non-citizens find themselves
'waiting hopefully and then frustratedly for others to make decisions,
and in effect surrendering to the authority of others' (Auyero, 2012:
loc. 123).¶ [Waiting can]{.underline} therefore [function as a
potentially important spatial technology of the elite and powerful,
mobilized not only for the purpose of **governing individuals**, but
also to **retain claims over moral urgency**]{.underline}. [But there is
**growing resistance** to the capture of claims of urgency by the
elite]{.underline}, and it is important to note that even in cases where
the material conditions of containment are currently impenetrable,
[arguments based on human value are at the forefront of **reclaiming
urgency for the body**. In **detention centers, clandestine prisons,
state borders and refugee camps**, geographers point to]{.underline}
ongoing struggles against [the ethical impossibility of bodily
urgency]{.underline} and a rejection of states of waiting (see Conlon,
2011; Darling, 2009, 2011; Garmany, 2012; Mountz et al., 2013; Schuster,
2011). Ramakrishnan's (2014) analysis of a Delhi resettlement colony and
Shewly's (2013) discussion of the enclave between India and Bangladesh
describe people who refuse to give up their own status as legitimately
urgent, even in the context of larger scale politics. Similarly, Tyler's
(2013) account of desperate female detainees stripping off their clothes
to expose their humanness and suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration
Removal Centre in the UK suggests that demands for recognition are not
just about politics, but also about the acknowledgement of humanness and
the irrevocable possibility of being that which cannot wait. The
continued existence of places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions
in the USA nonetheless points to [the challenge of exposing the urgent
body as a moral priority when it is so easily hidden from
view]{.underline}, and also reminds us that our research can help to
explain the relationships between normative dimensions and the political
and social conditions of struggle.¶ In closing, geographic depictions of
waiting do seem to evocatively describe otherwise obscured suffering
(e.g. Bennett, 2011), but it is striking how rarely these descriptions
also use the language of urgency. Given the discussion above, what might
be accomplished -- and risked -- by incorporating urgency more overtly
and deliberately into our discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned
bodies? Urgency can clarify the implicit but understated ethical
consequences and normativity associated with waiting, and encourage
explicit discussion about harmful suffering. Waiting can be productive
or unproductive for radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires
response. Geographers could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical
work of urgency in ways that leave it open for critique, clarifying
common spatial misunderstandings and representations. There is good
reason to be thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards
inhumanity can itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human,
dividing up 'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those
whose lives and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives
at all' (Butler, 2009: 50). But [when the urgent body is rendered as
only waiting]{.underline}, both materially and discursively, [it is just
as easily cast as impulsive, disgusting, animalistic]{.underline} (see
also McKittrick, 2006). [Feminist theory insists that the urgent body,
whose encounters of violence are 'usually framed as **private,
apolitical and mundane'**]{.underline} (Pain, 2014: 8), [are as deeply
**political, public, and exceptional** as other forms of
violence]{.underline} (Phillips, 2008; Pratt, 2005). [Insisting that **a
suffering body, now, is that which cannot wait**, has the **ethical
effect of drawing it into consideration alongside the political, public
and exceptional scope of large-scale futures**]{.underline}. [It may
help us insist on the body]{.underline}, both as a single unit and a
plurality, [as a legitimate scale of normative priority and social
care]{.underline}.¶ In this report, I have explored old and new
reflections on the ethical work of urgency and waiting. Geographic
[research suggests a contemporary popular bias towards the urgency of
large-scale futures, institutionalized in ways that]{.underline} further
**[obscure and discredit the urgencies of the body]{.underline}**. [This
bias]{.underline} also [justifies the production of new **waiting
places**]{.underline} in our material landscape, **[places like the
detention center]{.underline}** and the waiting room. In some cases,
waiting is normatively neutral, even providing opportunities for
alternative politics. In others, the technologies of waiting serve to
manage potentially problematic bodies, leading to suspended suffering
and even to extermination (e.g. Wright, 2013). One of my aims has been
to suggest that [**moral reasoning is important** both because it
**exposes normative biases against subjugated people**, and]{.underline}
because it potentially **[provides routes toward struggle where claims
to urgency seem to foreclose]{.underline}** the
**[possibilities]{.underline}** of alleviation of suffering. **[Saving
the world still should require a debate about whose world is being
saved, when, and at what cost -- and this requires a debate about what
really cannot wait]{.underline}**. My next report will extend some of
these concerns by reviewing how feelings of urgency, as well as hope,
fear, and other emotions, have played a role in geography and ethical
reasoning.¶ I conclude, however, by pulling together past and present.
In 1972, Gilbert White asked why geographers were not engaging 'the
truly urgent questions' (1972: 101) such as racial repression, decaying
cities, economic inequality, and global environmental destruction. His
question highlights just how much the discipline has changed, but it is
also unnerving in its echoes of our contemporary problems. Since White's
writing, our moral reasoning has been stretched to consider the future
body and the more-than-human, alongside the presently urgent body --
topics and concerns that I have not taken up in this review but which
will provide their own new possibilities for urgent concerns. My own
hope presently is drawn from an acknowledgement that [the **temporal
characteristics of contemporary capitalism** can be interrupted in
creative ways]{.underline} (Sharma, 2014), [with the possibility of
squaring the urgent body with our large-scale future
concerns]{.underline}. [**Temporal alternatives already exist in ongoing
and emerging revolutions** and the disruption of]{.underline} claims of
cycles and [circular political processes]{.underline} (e.g. Lombard,
2013; Reyes, 2012). [Though **calls for urgency will certainly be used
to obscure evasion of responsibility**]{.underline} (e.g. Gilmore, 2008:
56, fn 6), [they may **also serve as fertile ground for radical
critique**, a truly fierce **urgency for now.**]{.underline}

The aim of this essay is to use my individual experience as an entry
point for speaking to a structural pattern in IR scholarship. Here, I
explore how observing the scholastic process of connecting disciplinary
boundaries to real political lines demarcates an ongoing concern with
how some academics pursue a monopoly on understandings of 'the
international', treating its porous semi-arbitrary boundaries as though
they define the political issues that traverse them (Conway, 2021). Some
have described this monopoly as a form of methodological disciplinarity,
a practice where [research becomes restricted within disciplinary
borders because of scholastic endeavours to keep the discipline pure. In
this process, IR gatekeepers come to reject IR's existence as a
discipline that exists between fields, being focused on]{.underline}
metaphorically manning [the academic watchtower. By being busy
policing]{.underline} what is and what is not a global issue[,
these]{.underline} same [intellectuals miss key opportunities for
innovative knowledge production concerning the
international.]{.underline} As Annika Olsson (2015: 47) observes,
'scholars of all kinds need to cross the borders of their disciplines
more often' if they are to bring new knowledge home. Vitalis concurs in
his own exploration of the birth of American IR, where he writes that
'the boundaries of international relations theory and in particular work
in security \[...\] remain open and ripe for infiltration'(2015:180). We
indeed need to challenge 'the bodies and borders of literature' if we
are ever to truly understand the structural nature of inequities in
knowledge sharing in international studies (Olsson, 2015: 47).

On the question of whose bodies? Importantly, in the opening quote, it
appears that the editors responding to my article felt that their
contributing authors had to tick several boxes on their checklist. Not
just to earn the right to exist within the purview of the journal but
also to be considered international studies. My concern lies with how
these editors seem disconcerted by how broadly their mandate may have
been conceived instead of welcoming such breadth in conceptualisation.
In the arena of IR, post-structural scholars have long since argued that
the boundary between the international and domestic is insecure. Using
the writings of Foucault, Derrida, Lacan and Žižek, Edkins (1999), for
example, famously contested the technical arrangements that erroneously
restricted the notion of the international subject when politics was
presented as being a subsystem of social order instead of being seen as
a mirror of a society's own forgotten foundation -- cutting off human
beings from their sense of self. Others such as Charbonneau and Cox
(2010: 14), in the context of foreign policy analysis, write how it is
in locally situated security practices that scholars often find spaces
where vital 'elements of state power and global order are produced and
reproduced'. So, why were the editors I quoted uncomfortable in the case
of another break with the international--domestic divide prompted on the
basis of a race-orientated tradition? A problem is that their
[anxiety]{.underline} and discomfort [with a lack of
perimeters]{.underline} being erected in this specific instance
[may]{.underline} possibly [have been grounded in]{.underline} a
particular [epistemic genealogy where having a monopoly on how the
international is conceived also constituted a form of racial domination.
Allowing an analytical radicalism to be applied to IR problems only so
far as they do not cross Eurocentric-white boundaries for what still
constitutes intellectual respectability.]{.underline}

[As a discipline, IR has historically provided numerous sources of
intellectual rationale to justify only certain conceptions of the
international which foreground norms of white subjectivity, and that in
turn epistemically constrain the boundaries of political imagination
within the discipline. This is largely as a result of IR's origin, as a
policy science devised to resolve dilemmas 'facing the white Western
powers' because of colonial administration]{.underline} (Anievas,
Manchanda and Shilliam, 2015: 2). IR's academic conventions more often
than not still prompt recognition of how colonial histories matter yet
are muted in the politics of the present. This is so in how [these
conventions still force]{.underline} the centre of [non-Western and
non-white people's worlds to exist at the margins of the world(s)
European imperialists endeavoured to create]{.underline} (Shilliam,
2021). In this regard, calling out racial attitudes to IR expertise
necessitates drawing attention to how lines are drawn between
intellectuals who are accused of dabbling in 'selective colonial
historiography for "political" purposes', and those who are actually
seen as 'bona fide' in international studies on the basis of the way
they choose to assess what is global (Stoler, 2011:137). **[The public
performance of solidarity]{.underline}** by scholastic institutions
**[appearing to support scholars that raise]{.underline}** the issue of
**[anti-imperial perspectives, all while still preventing the
professional dispersal of their knowledge behind the scenes is
indicative of the wage of white supremacy. This is so in how these IR
gatekeepers enable perpetrators of intellectual tokenism to evade
detection and accountability for their part in furthering imperialist
ways of knowing the issues that plague the world
populations.]{.underline}** These same actors, counterintuitively,
directly ensure that a limited understanding about how different
populations experience world politics prevails.

Reflections on Black geographies and the limits of dialogue," 2018,

[It is impossible to engage with the politics of dialogue without first
situating]{.underline} ourselves---after all, these are fundamentally
[questions of power and access.]{.underline} I (Camilla) am a
first-generation university student and the first in my immediate family
to pursue a graduate degree. [As a Black woman]{.underline} geographer,
[I must continuously reckon with the fact that the university---and the
discipline of geography itself---was not made for me. Historically, the
university has been a site wherein the subjugation of women and people
of color has been articulated and legitimated.]{.underline} Still, I was
drawn to human geography because it appeared to be a capacious,
interdisciplinary field with productively porous boundaries. In other
words, geography seemed to welcome, rather than strictly regulate,
theoretical and methodological dialogue between disciplines. But when I
began my PhD program, I experienced a distinct sense of alienation as I
attempted to do research that seemed marginal to geography
(specifically, understanding how Black youth in Italy craft a sense of
place that challenges the symbolic and material boundaries of
Europeanness and Italianness). I was alarmed that the vocabulary and
rich canon shaped by my background in Africana studies (for instance,
theories of diaspora, or the works of scholars such as Paul Gilroy and
Sylvia Wynter) were not always recognized as 'formally' geographical,
even though the issues they addressed were fundamentally about space,
place, and power. [I was]{.underline} similarly [alarmed by the fact
that, in a discipline whose history is so closely tied to the violent
histories of colonialism and racism, race remained a relatively
insignificant category]{.underline} in contemporary geography, [a
'superstructural' embellishment]{.underline} atop the 'material',
clanking gears of capitalism. The questions that animated my research
and the intellectual genealogies I wanted to draw upon, were deeply
spatial but seemedillegible to geography. They were, in other words,
beyond dialogue.

As a Black woman, I (Kaily) can recall being taught from a very early
age not to fight back. When I mouthed off, I was told to sit down and
quite literally to shut up. 'Black' and 'girl' were thrown in my face as
insults, justifications for my silence. Insecure in my body, I was also
insecure in place, as I constantly moved around the country. Feeling
powerless to do much to tangibly or markedly interface with the city
streets or Midwestern fields in which I grew up, I found myself drawn to
art and photography as some of the few ways I could dialogically assert
the power of my body and represent it assuredly in place. Having
utilized this embodied knowledge in my thesis research, my advisor
proposed that I look into geography programs for my PhD. I found it to
be a thrilling and expansive field that had the capacity to engage the
language of visual representation and its materialization in structures
of race, class, and environment. Like Camilla, my enthusiasm quickly
hardened into exasperation when I found that theories of race and gender
in geography were limited to one week each in most first-year curricula.
I was, and still am, seeking to find the middle ground between the
extensive attention Black studies scholars have paid to representations
of race, and geographical scholarship on how place is epistemologically
formed. It is time that geographers utilized the interdisciplinary
nature of their field to widen dialogue formerly limited by structural
inequalities.

As Rose-Redwood et al. (2018) rightly argue, certain voices have been
systematically excluded from the physical and metaphorical spaces of
dialogue within the field of human geography. The marginalization of
Black geographic scholarship within the discipline cannot be understood
separately from the marginalization of Black scholars at all levels
within geography. This means that **[the academy can itself be a site of
violence that regulates who can participate in scholarly dialogue.
But,]{.underline}** at the same time, we want to argue that [**the
project of Black Geographies is more than simply a project of 'add Black
people and stir'.** It is about moving beyond a liberal politics of
superficial]{.underline} and provisional [inclusion]{.underline} to
think seriously about which voices, intellectual genealogies, and
traditions of thought are deemed sufficiently canonical or
scholarly---and why.

[Claims to dialogue]{.underline} within human geography, and the academy
writ large, [are]{.underline} frequently [invoked to obscure a lack of
engagement with noncanonical scholarship.]{.underline} Yet we are still
convinced that geography has important things to offer our understanding
of blackness, and vice versa---that **[centering blackness can actually
tell us important things about space and place, about power and the
politics of resistance.]{.underline}** [The Black Geographies
Symposium]{.underline}, for instance, [was centered on a shared
understanding of blackness as a fundamentally spatial relation, of space
as profoundly racialized, and of the history of geography as entangled
with racism, colonialism, and enslavement.]{.underline} What would it
mean, for instance, if geographers were to read Marx on the factory
alongside W.E.B. Du Bois and C.L.R. James on the plantation, or Jamaica
Kincaid alongside Doreen Massey on relational understandings of place? A
Black geographical scholarly praxis entails a willingness to subvert
arborescent models of intellectual lineage in favor of queerings,
rhizomes, undercommons (Harney and Moten, 2013), provincializations, or
even the Sankofa (Benjamin, 2013). These are, in other words,
nonhierarchical and nonlinear modes of study that can attend to the
complex geographical itineraries and interconnected struggles that
continue to shape our understandings of the relations of capitalism,
racism, and sexism that structure the modern world.

Perhaps, then, we should be striving for something more radical than
dialogue. Rose-Redwood et al. (2018) point toward the possibilities of
dialogue as embodied action; but [what if we instead take liberatory
knowledges as the **point of departure, rather than 'democratic'
dialogue**]{.underline} or abject embodiment? In her keynote
presentation at the Black Geographies symposium, Katherine McKittrick
suggested that [scholarly dialogue necessarily invokes the materiality
of humanness in both body and place:]{.underline}

> ['The materiality of intellectual inquiry]{.underline}, the ideas we
> share, the counsel we give each other, [is an ongoing referential
> conversation about Black humanity. \[ \...\] The materiality of
> intellectual inquiry, the ideas we share, is a referential
> conversation that begins from Black humanness'.]{.underline}

[The centrality of race]{.underline} and racism [in the foundations of
IR and their enduring impact on world affairs]{.underline} towards the
end of the millennium [contrasts with the]{.underline} relative [dearth
of]{.underline} mainstream [scholarship on the subject in
IR.]{.underline} For example, [Doty's]{.underline} (1998, 136) [survey
of mainstream journals in IR]{.underline} for the period of 1945 --1993
(World Politics, International Studies Quarterly, International
Organization, Journal of Conflict Resolution, Review of International
Studies) '[revealed only one article with the word race in the
title,]{.underline} four with the term minorities and 13 with the term
ethnicity'. Given that at its inception IR focused heavily on issues of
race and racism, the marginalization of race and racism in mainstream IR
journals (and textbooks) begs the question of what accounts for the
apparent disparity? Doty (1998, 145) argues that ['the dominant
understandings of]{.underline} theory and explanation in
[I]{.underline}nternational [R]{.underline}elations' [preclude
conceptualizations of]{.underline} 'complex issues/concepts such as
[race' and result in their marginalization]{.underline} or force them
'into constraining modes of conceptualization and explanation'. For
Krishna (2001, 401), the complexity is related less to the issue of
racism than to the [methodological orientations]{.underline} that often
[privilege abstract theorizing over historical analyses, **which allows
IR theorists to whitewash the historical content of global affairs,
especially 'the violence, genocide, and theft that marked the encounter
between the rest and the West**]{.underline} in the post-Columbian era'.
**[Ignoring the role of racism facilitates this
whitewash.]{.underline}** He adds that ['abstraction, usually presented
as the desire of the discipline to engage in theory-building rather than
in descriptive or historical analysis, is a screen that simultaneously
rationalizes and elides the details of these encounters. By encouraging
students to display their virtuosity in abstraction]{.underline} **[the
discipline brackets questions of theft of land, violence, and
slavery]{.underline}**---the three processes that have historically
underlain the unequal global order we now find ourselves in' (Krishna
2001, 401-- 402). Further, **['overattention']{.underline}** on the part
of scholars to issues related **[to racism in IR 'is disciplined by
professional practices that work as taboo']{.underline}** and may label
such orientations as 'too historical or descriptive' **[and label such
students as]{.underline}** 'not adequately theoretical' and **['lacking
in intellectual rigor']{.underline}** (Krishna 2001, 402). Moreover,
where the impact of race and racism is analysed, insufficient attention
is paid to the relevance of struggles related to race and racism to
basic conceptions of fundamental issues in world politics such as power,
war, freedom or democracy. For example, Persaud (2001, 116) maintains
that 'what needs to be underlined is that the struggle for racial
equality has been fundamental to the emergence of democracy as a whole,
not just for the colored world' (2001, 116).

Persaud and Walker (2001, 374) claim that **[race]{.underline}** has not
been ignored **[in IR]{.underline}** as much as it ['**has been given
the epistemological status of silence'.** This silence]{.underline} is
linked by Maclean (1981, 110) to 'invisibility', which ['refers to the
removal]{.underline} (not necessarily through conscious action) [from a
field of enquiry]{.underline}, either concrete aspects of social
relations, or of certain forms of thought about them'. Vitalis (2000)
also acknowledges a **['norm against noticing' white racism throughout
mainstream IR discourse]{.underline}** (also see Depelchin 2005). Each
of **[these processes perpetuates the racist assumptions embedded in the
foundations of IR theory where they serve as the 'priors' of the main
propositions.]{.underline}** These assumptions may be exposed by tracing
the racist claims that inform IR theory. This approach is different from
that undertaken in [most studies of racism in IR]{.underline}, which
usually [focus on one of four approaches]{.underline}: (1) [examinations
of]{.underline} the impact of [non-racial factors on racial outcomes,
such as]{.underline} the geographical studies of Linneaus and the
physical anthropological works of Blumenbach and Kant, which attempted
to determine the extent to which [environmental and climatic
factors]{.underline} led to the creation of different races;3 (2)
[examinations of the impact of racial outcomes on non-racial factors,
such as studies of]{.underline} the effects of racial stratification on
domestic outcomes (for example, [development or democracy]{.underline}),
or the impact of racial differences on the likelihood of violence within
or between states (for example, Deutsch 1970; Shepherd and LeMelle
1970); (3) [examinations of]{.underline} the impact of [racist practices
on the IR of states and non-state actors, such as]{.underline} studies
of diplomatic historians on racist practices such as international
slavery, imperial conquest, colonialism, [genocide,]{.underline}
apartheid, occupation, or racial discrimination, among single states,
several states, or international organizations (for example, Elkins
2004; Hochschild 1998; Tinker 1977; Vincent 1982; Winant 2001); and (4)
[examinations of]{.underline} the impact of [racist ideology on the IR
of states and nonstate actors, such as studies on the impact of racism
on foreign policy]{.underline} (for example, Hunt 1987; Lauren 1988;
Anderson 2003), imperialism (for example, Rodney 1974), state-making
(for example, Cell 1982; Fredrickson 1982; Mamdani 1996; Marx 1998),
diasporization (Harris 1982; Walters 1993) [or international
war]{.underline} (Dower 1986).

While [studies utilizing each of these approaches]{.underline} have
contributed to our understanding of the role of racism in world
politics, they **[have largely ignored]{.underline}** the issue of
primary concern to us here: **[how racism informs the major paradigms of
IR]{.underline}** theory **[such as realism and
liberalism.]{.underline}**4 **[Racism informs IR]{.underline}** theory
mainly **[through its influence on the empirical, ethical and
epistemological assumptions that undergird its paradigms.]{.underline}**
These assumptions operate individually and in combination. For example,
[racist empirical assumptions bifurcate humanity on the basis of race
and determine our view of what/whom we study and how]{.underline} we
study it/them---[privileging the experiences of 'superior'
peoples]{.underline} and their societies and institutions. [These
assumptions]{.underline} also [lead us to privilege ethical orientations
of the 'superior']{.underline} peoples which justify their privileged
status. In such a context, [epistemological assumptions
that]{.underline} reflect and [reinforce the racist dualism are more
likely to become ascendant, and 'knowledge' that supports the racist
dichotomy]{.underline}---both the privileged position of the racial
hegemon and the underprivileged position of the racial subaltern---[is
more likely to be viewed as valid. Such knowledge drawn from the
empirical domain becomes legitimized through ethical
justifications]{.underline} that 'naturalize' the racial hierarchy. In
this way, the separate dimensions often reinforce each other.

Whether or not the empirical, ethical and epistemological assumptions
operate singly or in combination, it is important to demonstrate the
role of these assumptions in IR theory today, especially given that
mainstream IR also provides prominent critiques of racism. Ignoring
these critiques would misrepresent the degree of racism in the field and
disregard the challenge to racist discourse within IR from IR theorists
themselves. For example, few IR scholars openly embrace a racist
ontology that assumes for whites a higher order of being than for
nonwhites.5 Moreover, racist ethical assumptions usually receive the
opprobrium they deserve in present IR discourse. Racist epistemological
assumptions are largely challenged by the prevalence in IR theory of the
view that our 'knowledge' of world politics usually requires us to have
something approximating evidence to determine the accuracy of rival
truth claims. Finally, racist empirical assumptions are checked by the
dominant view in IR that our theses should be broadly applicable across
states and societies and should be substantiated by crossnational and
cross-temporal tests. But **[the sanguine view of the propensity of IR
literature to check racist assumptions, or to generate non-racist
theoretical discourse]{.underline}** for the field, **[begs a fuller
exploration of how ethical, epistemological and empirical assumptions
underlie prominent theses in IR. The main sources of these racist
assumptions that inform our present IR discourse are the primary
theoretical constructs of most IR theory: the state of nature, the
social contract and the conception of anarchy that derives from
them.]{.underline}**

#### The integration of AI into Military logistics results [unchecked]{.underline} racialized necropolitics as a [value]{.underline} that informs politics and replaces human governance with AI that kill with impunity and result in [endemic warfare]{.underline}

the Hawai'i Research Center for Future Studies at the University of
Hawai'I at Mānoa, PhD in International Relations at Johns Hopkins
University \[Jairus, "From geopolitics to geotechnics: global futures in
the shadow of automation, cunning machines, and human speciation,"

[The automation of war]{.underline} and the reduction of human troop
sizes has a similar effect. Wars [aided by drones]{.underline} and as a
result significantly smaller numbers of soldier casualties
[continue]{.underline} on for decades [in a kind of sustainable
warfare.]{.underline}28 [The political and material cost of
casualties]{.underline} like the material cost of striking [are being
removed from the political equation making states less and less
accountable in the case of social justice and the pursuit of violence
outside their borders.]{.underline}

[The feedback]{.underline} between these two trends [is]{.underline}
potentially [catastrophic. At the same time that war becomes easier,
governments become less accountable to their people]{.underline}, and
people are deprived of the means to support themselves, it is also the
case that [people will matter less to their governments as they will not
possess the labor power to cause pain to the economic
productivity]{.underline} of the country [by means of striking nor the
capacity to refuse to fight.]{.underline} Zygmunt Bauman has spoken of
disposable populations, a kind of human waste or surplus where the value
of one's existence is meaningless for the state.29 However, we ought to
go further down this path by way of Achille Mbembe's creeping
necropolitics.30 [It is not merely that chronically]{.underline} or even
intergenerational [unemployed people have no value; it is that
the]{.underline} marginalization and even [murder of people can now
generate value. In what Mbembe refers to as the 'enclave economies' of
war machines:]{.underline}

> [The concentration of activities connected with the extraction of
> valuable resource around these enclaves has]{.underline}, in return,
> [turned the enclaves into privileged spaces of war and death. War
> itself is fed by the increased sales of the products
> extracted.]{.underline}31

**[In these enclave economies fueled by petroleum,
diamonds]{.underline}**, but increasingly things like
**[lithium]{.underline}** or even **[sand or water, the outright murder
of people, clearing space, generates value]{.underline}** even in the
supposedly post-resource digital economy.32 However, beyond the
instrumental value of security there is also the [explosion of security
services as its own economic sector rather than as a merely means to
secure other economic sectors. International security
corporation]{.underline}s such as Wackenhut industries, once a private
prison service provider in the U.S., [now generate profits from refugee
management]{.underline} in Australia and Europe.33 The nearly 200
billion dollar private security industry and \$1917 billion dollar
defense sector suggest that **[the economy of making death and
deprivation is more than merely a means.]{.underline}** What few
normative and [legal limitations exist on the lethality of these
corporations and institutions could disappear. This is already taking
place in the global South and amongst African-Americans and indigenous
people around the planet.]{.underline}

However, [one can foresee]{.underline}, with little imagination, [the
extreme injustices of the contemporary era as a general condition of
global life]{.underline}. What requires imagination on our part is
reaching a turning point where these crimes become themselves normative,
that is, the 'good' the state pursues. Contrary to our sensibilities
such ideologies already exist and are even gaining attention outside the
obscure chat rooms where they began.

Under the heading of 'negative messianism', Mbembe reviews [the growing
movement of the 'Dark Enlightenment', 'a political religion. . .
\[that\] calls for the exit from democratic society and total corporate
and absolute dictatorship'.]{.underline}34 The movement **[calls for a
global, racial, culling of the population in the name of 'human
biodiversity' and expounds the value of using racially inferior
populations for radical experimentation to jumpstart technological
breakthrough.]{.underline}** [If this sounds]{.underline} too
[implausible]{.underline} even for speculation **[it is worth
considering the spate of recent terrorist attacks in the U.S. by the
vanguard of the Dark Enlightenment. The mass shooter who killed 20
people in El Paso]{.underline}** Texas in August of 2019 **[posted his
Dark Enlightenment manifesto before beginning his
rampage]{.underline}**.35 In 2020, **[there have been multiple attacks
by]{.underline}** the so-called **[Boogaloos who have infiltrated the
U.S. military and police forces and seek to spark the Dark Enlightenment
by escalating the Black Lives Matter protests into a full scale civil
war.]{.underline}**36 And then there is the most famous and vocal
theorist of the Dark Enlightenment, Steve [Bannon,]{.underline} who in
addition to being a key architect of the Donald Trump administration,
[works tirelessly to build the Dark Enlightenment movement amongst the
burgeoning far right of Europe]{.underline}.37 Whether this world view
succeeds or actually becomes normative globally is not really the point.
Instead, as is the mode in the speculation here I propose that **[in
the]{.underline}** burgeoning **[Dark Enlightenment movement we can see
a political community built around necropolitics as a value rather than
a necessary evil.]{.underline}**

It would be too much to draw a direct line from the Dark Enlightenment
to all of the neo-nationalist, neo-authoritarian, and neo-fascist
movements around the planet. However, [the accelerating global right
wing has been institutionalized at the highest levels of power in
liberal democratic nation-states such as the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [U.K. and India, suggesting that liberal
institutions cannot subsist on autopilot. **Neo-authoritarian politics
have also moved from shaping domestic polities to the shaping of the
international order.**]{.underline}38

In such an order, what would liberal democratic states look like? The
[constraints on the genocidal dictatorships of the twentieth century
was]{.underline} of course that [they needed a substantial portion of
their populations.]{.underline} Genocide could only be pursued against
minority populations. State behavior even in the extremes of the Nazi
state among others still required full mobilization and therefore at
some level the necessity of willing obedience even if not quite
legitimacy that could be supplemented through terror.39

[What of the behavior of future states for whom their people are in some
sense an afterthought? At a minimum the basic conceits of survival that
underwrite practices like deterrence or coercion would change
dramatically.]{.underline} The very logic and mechanics of biopolitics
would have to change. Without a necessary or strict relationship to the
nation, would states differ significantly from some kind of corporate
entity? Would the state more closely resemble the ancien regime? What
would become of territoriality? These are the grammatical questions
raised by the dark imagination of an automated future sufficiently
comprehensive to create the material condition whereby a state could
survive without the majority of their population's cooperation.

Can **[we]{.underline}** not **[already see the outlines of such a
future in the decisions of Bolsanaro, Trump, Xi, Modi, and Duterte, who
blithely write off millions]{.underline}** of their own citizens **[in
the face of COVID-19]{.underline}** and the nearly 50 per cent
unemployment rate it has created where the virus has been allowed total
freedom of movement?40 [One need not be conspiratorial to see how quick
authoritarian leaders have been to give up on disease containment once
the data came back regarding the overwhelming racial disparity in COVID
fatalities]{.underline}.41

If we consider the ways in which the shift from coal to oil changed the
character of economic and labor relations with states in the twentieth
century, [the]{.underline} nearly [50 per cent loss of jobs due to
computerization]{.underline} in the twenty-first century,42 [combined
with a corresponding decline in the necessity of humans for military
power,]{.underline} then these new conditions [could change the very
nature of what a state is.]{.underline} The biopolitical raison d'être
of the nation-state which emerges in the nineteenth century and becomes
truly geopolitical in the twentieth century is premised on the
mobilization and securing of a national population.43 The revolutionary
states emerge from and rationalize the hyphen of the nationstate as
essential both in terms of democratic values and military-economic
necessity. What will emerge in the aftermath of such necessities and
values is the horizon of alternative futures we must consider.

--Fahrenheit 451 A Wiener Filter or The Yellow Peril

![](media/image1.png){width="4.0023709536307965in"
height="1.583992782152231in"}

The equation above is called a Wiener Filter. In mathematical terms,
Norbert Wiener used it with a number of other steps to calculate the
future. Despite the claims in the first section that the future does not
exist, the territory or probable limits of the future do, at least most
of the time. What Wiener was representing mathematically was that even
with little data on which one would normally make a prediction you can
define the space of possibility or in Wiener's terms the distribution of
probabilities even for non-linear or non-existent causal systems. In
practical terms it meant that artillery could be automated to shoot
where planes were going to be rather than where they were when the radar
signal returned. The mathematicians did this by considering and then
modeling the limits of the system being predicted.

It is impossible to predict what an individual pilot will choose to do
but it is possible to describe in mathematical terms what a pilot is
capable of doing and similarly what a plane with a particular maximum
velocity was capable of doing. The predictions made by the Wiener Filter
allowed the artillery guns to fire in a significantly more restricted
area with minimal radar information rather than just blasting away at
the sky in hopes of hitting something. According to Steve Heims, more
predictable systems like the V2 rocket could be successfully targeted
and shot down 99 out 100 times by the Wiener Filter.44 The seemingly
'dumb' artillery could adjust or read their environment and work in
concert adjusting further as information from rudimentary radar systems
or the assemblage of radar, operators, and canons. The artillery was in
the most basic sense becoming aware.

Wiener's 'solution' which made unpredictable systems targetable was
another version of what Claude Shannon very soon after solved for
communication with his theory of information. Shannon developed the
techniques which allow the efficient transmission of information through
imperfect media such as telephone lines by similarly modeling the range
of noise and compensating or repeating signal to exceed it. Rather than
predicting the noise which is impossible because of its chaotic nature
Shannon was able to treat all noise as a system rather than individual
events of noise such that the range of noise could stand in place of the
individual incidents. In both cases, the breakthroughs of Wiener and
Shannon created the world of computers, the internet, automation, and
machine learning we now inhabit. All systems after Wiener and Shannon
could be treated in some sense as information and communication problems
to be solved.45

After his experience in the war and further experiments after, Wiener
began to describe a more general principle of informatics and machine
technology. What he would later call the last science or the science of
everything saw every system, whether physical, chemical, mechanical,
biological, as computable and alterable. Following this insight Wiener
believed humanity was at the cusp of something unprecedented. In 1948,
he declared that a new kind of machine had emerged in the history of
human evolution. Although still rudimentary, cybernetic machines of the
1940s were capable for the first time of simple self-regulation based on
interactions with their external environment. Unlike thermodynamic
machines that sought equilibrium, cybernetic machines could pursue a
goal or objective in the world. Wiener referred to these new machines as
Bergsonian machines, after the French Philosopher Henri Bergson and his
idea of elan vital.46 For Wiener, machines possessed for the first time
the spark of a vital impulse. While these Bergsonian machines have so
far disappointed the expectation of those hoping for and others fearing
human-like artificial intelligence, machinic intelligence, whether
learning algorithms or self-steering and targeting weapons systems, have
exploded into a variable rainforest ecology of new species.

What is important for the purposes of this article is that Wiener was
able to demonstrate that very simple feedback mechanisms could produce
complex emergent results or what 'appeared' like intelligence even if
the machines were not conscious of that intelligence. What I explore
throughout the rest of the section is how [even small advances in
machine intelligence could produce dramatic changes in what we think of
now as human dependent drones. Already AI platforms have the capacity to
strategize and win complex games like Go, AI via drones have the
capability to target or execute operations on their own, robots can 3D
print and construct other robots, that is, a simple form of
reproduction. The only thing missing is]{.underline} what in
philosophical terms we call [will or desire.]{.underline} However, the
insight from Wiener is that the difference between rudimentary will and
a command code is insignificant in effect if a feedback exists between
the machine and the external environment which can shape or direct the
now desiring machine. To put it somewhat simply, [we do not need human
general intelligence for robots to change the world and geopolitics; the
world could change overnight if mechanical life emerged]{.underline} or
was released into the wild [and was as sophisticated, resilient and
procreative as the cockroach.]{.underline}

**[We are already experiencing the burgeoning capability of cunning
machine.]{.underline}** If one considers to the underlying political and
economic pressure to move away from human combatants not unlike the
globalization of the labor market more broadly, the incentives for
innovations continuing are difficult to deny.47 Even before 9/11 [combat
was becoming too costly in both economic and political terms and
therefore required an alternative in order for empires and smaller
states to stay afloat]{.underline} in lean times. The globally modeled
War on Terrorism brought the crises of military expenditure still
lingering after the Cold War to a head. **[However, the drive to cut
costs and political liability has not stopped at the
battlefield.]{.underline}** [Attempts to remove humans further and
further from the battlefield follows this inhuman trajectory into the
arena of decision-making and contestation.]{.underline}48 **[The
reliance on algorithmic warfare creates the opportunity for increasingly
unilateral warmaking]{.underline}**. **[Cunning machines, not machines
of reason but machines capable of hunting and trapping, represent the
possibility of the command and control developed for nuclear arsenals
with the micro-scale to pursue and kill of assassins or special
forces.49]{.underline}**

**[This process of automating politics as well as war creates further
incentive for the development of increasingly autonomous machines and
actually undermines security as it makes the capacity to wage war
cheaper and more accessible around the planet.]{.underline}** **[The
drive for]{.underline}** more autonomous machines is heading toward
**['sustainable warfare',]{.underline}** a kind of weird parallel to
sustainable development. Like sustainable development, sustainable
warfare really **[makes warfare endemic]{.underline}** rather than
providing a real alternative to war making. So war as we know it may be
coming to an end but a permeating martial transformation is just getting
started.

As the transformation in domestic policing, military planning, and
combat takes place, the tactical landscape will also mutate, amplifying
the corrosive effects on politics. A security complex indifferent to the
differences between the war and policing, battlefield and lifeworld will
increasingly target Internet exchanges, servers, monitoring, and
listening stations, civilian communication and media infrastructure. [As
populations cease to matter to states]{.underline}, either those
attacking or being attacked, [infrastructure becomes the whole of the
strategic landscape.]{.underline} Also, [as the size of autonomous
machines shrink, the incentive for hacking or indiscriminate attacks
such as electromagnetic pulse attacks will become more desirable as
drone to drone or human to drone combat will be prohibitively
difficult.]{.underline}

After all, how reliably can one expect to track a drone the size of a
dragonfly or as low to the ground as a snake? Thus, we face the
possibility of a confluence of unaccountable decision-making, even the
absence of human decisions at all with the saturation of living spaces
with the dissonance of combat, killing and destruction. **[Rather than
simply automating the 'hunt' for enemies chosen by political processes,
already reliance on things like signature strikes signal a shift to the
automation of the political decision of who is and is not an enemy in
the first place.]{.underline}** This shift from what Human Rights Watch
has termed 'human on the loop' practices to 'human out of the loop'
practices pushes the posthuman50 character of war further into the
nightmare zone in which everything is an object to be targeted but never
encountered or recognized. An algorithmic cunning replaces enmity and
martial judgment in the recognizable terms.

Furthermore, in a future with a receding human public and that states
are indifferent to moral catastrophe, these changes in machine
capability and autonomy as well as the deployment of such machines would
not be political events. **[Switches would be flipped by military
planners or software developers along technical rather than ethical or
political lines.]{.underline}** Lewis Mumford referred to this as the
advent of 'post-historic' humanity in which a process that 'began
innocently by eliminating fallible human impulses from science will end
by eliminating human nature from the whole world of reality. In
posthistoric culture life itself is reduced to predictable, mechanically
conditioned and controlled motion, with ever incalculable -- that is,
every creative -- element removed'.51 I would add that [what emerges in
its place is a mechanic creativity allowed to thrive within the
constraints of a limited martial logic.]{.underline} If we continue on
this trajectory **[practicality could replace both strategic and moral
thinking.]{.underline}**52 Further, the fora in which such decisions
will be made (if at all) are likely to be constricted as secrecy
predominates in an environment charged by a dangerous mix of paranoia
and real danger.

#### Global solidarity that converges around AI and the Internet of Things is a symbiotic end of humanism that reifies neoliberal individualism and causes mass industrialized eugenics.

Insofar as humanity dreams of life after death, [the "drone" is the
as-yet primitive technological image of that afterlife. Like the
Panopticon, the drone is a metaphor]{.underline} (Bentham 1995). [It is
the prototype of an ideal proxy by which the "human condition"
transcends its worldly **embodiment into a cosmic
internet-of-things:**]{.underline} a distributed architecture of
autopoietic, kinetic agency**[. Thought that moves
itself.]{.underline}** Yet, **[it is precisely for this reason that what
calls itself posthuman masks the return of an ever-more-apocalyptic
Humanism, wherein]{.underline}** the **[prestige]{.underline}** of what
is conserved as species unique **[is equated with the prestige of
species transcendence]{.underline}**: the (supposed) "uniquely human"
capacity to manufacture universalities---**[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, **[cybernetic machines, synthetic
DNA,]{.underline}** etc. The capacity, in other words, to project, by
way of abstraction, an all-too Humanistic teleology upon the domain of
evolution itself---and thus secure a future against human obsolescence.

This, at least, is the type of paradoxical science fiction narrative
that has prepared the way, in the West, for **[the evocation of "species
solidarity" in the face of]{.underline}** **[catastrophic imminence:
from Global Warming to Technological Singularity to Human Extinction
Event. A pseudo-solidarity bound]{.underline}**, on one hand, **[to the
advance of neo-liberal individualism and]{.underline}**, on the other,
to **[a ceaseless erosion of the collective "social
contract".]{.underline}** It does not matter that the logics of such
catastrophes broadly contradict one another: what is essential is that
the ultimate promise of business-as-usual both mitigates and masks a
whole intervening process of un-becoming.

These symbiotic "ends" of Humanism are **[previewed in the historical
convergence of two events:]{.underline}**

that technology could no longer be viewed as a human prosthesis, but
that **[the human was in fact a prosthesis of a general
technicity;]{.underline}**

**[2. the]{.underline}** contemporary **[revelation of mass
industrialised eugenics]{.underline}**

In this simple convergence, the principle that "technological progress"
was divisible from ideology---[the separation of science from
metaphysics]{.underline}, which was the very foundation of Humanist
thought---[was overthrown.]{.underline} Unable any longer to disguise
itself as universal rationality, **[Humanism was exposed as what it had
truly become: western political--economic mysticism.]{.underline}** This
did not cause Humanism to fail, but rather, **[under the liberal guise
of techno-capitalism, to re-engineer itself into an escape plan for the
end of history.]{.underline}** It was able to do this because **[the
idea of History itself]{.underline}**, as maintained **[in the
industrial imaginary, had never been anything more than a prosthesis of
Humanism to begin with.]{.underline}** In this way, posthumanism and
posthistoricism likewise come to represent something like a closed
feedback loop, whose epochal movement has been lugubriously and
hubristically fashioned as the "Anthropocene".

2 Posthuman, all‑too human In the 2002 postscript to his often-cited
thesis on the "End of History"---Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of
the Biotechnological Revolution---Francis Fukuyama advanced a line of
argument around genetic engineering and recombinant DNA, under the
rubric of an urgent need to address the "political control of
biotechnology" (Fukuyama 1992, 2002). Failure to do so, he argued, would
result in a "desperate rearguard action" for the future of humanity. A
future, after all, guaranteed solely by the prospect that "there could
be no end of history unless there was an end of science" (Fukuyama 2002:
xii). Its contemporary iteration today is [the mitigation industry of AI
"existential risk".]{.underline} What this argument [conceals behind its
tone of Humanistic panic]{.underline}, however, is
[that---]{.underline}according to its own logic---[for science to secure
the domain of the future, history must already have ended.]{.underline}
If we equate, as Fukuyama does, history with ideological struggle, then
[the future as technocracy can only be consequent upon the end of
politics]{.underline} as such. The real concern of Fukuyama's
"posthumanism" then, is not "political control of biotechnology", but
rather the contrary: biotechnology as political control---where
"[political control" means social cybernetics.]{.underline}

However, we must extend this line of thought further if we are to
perceive its fully apocalyptic character, for **[concealed within the
anxiety of an "uncontrolled" biotechnological assault upon the human, is
the implicit understanding of the human itself as biological
weapon.]{.underline}** For Fukuyama, the true meaning of "posthuman" is
thus the accomplishment of humanity's historical mission. As the "End of
History" designates an end of ideological struggle, so too the
dénouement of the Anthropocene and the "ends of man" represent the
accomplished purpose of species warfare: dominion, not simply over the
world, but over all possible worlds. The question for whom is thereby
diverted onto the abstraction of the question of control as such, as
idealised (human) agency. It represents what Baudrillard called the
"spiralling cadaver" (2006: 260) of Humanism: even in the (always
hypothetical) aftermath of humanity, the future will be human.

Responding to this strand of Fukuyamesque "scientism" in certain strands
of Accelerationist discourse, Germán Sierra has pointed to a recurrent
tendency to "reload humanist discourses", so as to "maintain the fiction
of a ghost-of-the-human-re-presenting-itself as immutable and
undisputed":

> All the current posthuman narratives, even those pointing to the
> evolution of a "radical otherness" as intended or unintended
> consequence of human action, are just modern versions of the
> extinction fables lying in the foundations of human rationality. Any
> "radical otherness" that may have a consequence for the human
> morphospace is just happening on "surface media" ... is still "our
> radical otherness". No future is still a future---very often a very
> specific one that is set in order to retro-determine present
> behaviour. (Sierra 2016)

In this retro-determined image of the future, "Extinction is unavoidable
but impossible. Like time travel, if it ever happens, it always does"
(Sierra 2016). In this way, ["Being human" means the "acceptance of
individual death in exchange for not conceiving the extinction of the
species".]{.underline} To which must be added, that [any "acceptance" of
individual death is premised not merely on the idea of species
continuance, but upon the abstract vicariousness of a collective
afterlife]{.underline}: a mode of hauntology, or telepathy, **[an
exception from the domain of finite existence by way of an access to a
future totality of human data aggregation.]{.underline}** Such totalised
futurity represents the dialectical counterpart of a radical
individualism, in whom the idea of (human) agency corresponds to the
very horizon of the impossible, beyond which there is nothing.

Yellow Peril and Techno-Orientalism

The term yellow peril emerged in the late nineteenth century in response
to Japan's arrival to the geopolitical stage as a formidable military
and industrial contender to the Western powers of Europe and the United
States.9 The concept was further elaborated and given a tangible racial
form through Sax Rohmer's series of novels and films that provided the
early content for the social imaginary of "yellow peril" along with its
personification in the character of Dr. Fu Manchu, the iconic
supervillain archetype of the Asian "evil criminal genius," and his cast
of minions.10 Strikingly, [Dr. Fu Manchu's characterization as evil,
criminal, and genius continues to inform the racial trope of the Asian
scientist spy]{.underline}; and more recently, we may add to the list
the bioengineer, the CFO, the international graduate student, to name
just a few. Moreover, the notion of the non-differentiable "yellow"
masses continues to function as a homogenizing and dehumanizing device
of Asian racialization, which makes possible the transference of
Sinophobia to Asian xenophobia.

In its inherent attempt to construct a racial other[, "yellow peril" is
more a projection of Western fear than a representation of an Asian
object/subject, and]{.underline} in this sense, [it may be better
understood as a repository of racial affect that can animate a myriad of
representational figures, images, and discourses, depending on
context.]{.underline} Indeed, the [images and discourses of yellow peril
have surfaced multiple times]{.underline} throughout the twentieth
century, [capturing]{.underline} a multitude of ever-shifting perceived
[threats that range from the danger of military intrusion]{.underline}
(i.e., Japanese Americans during WWII), [economic
competition]{.underline} (i.e., [Chinese laborers]{.underline} in the
late nineteenth century, Japan in the 1980s), [Asian moral and cultural
depravity]{.underline} (i.e., non-Christian heathens, Chinese
prostitutes, opium smokers), to [biological inferiority]{.underline}
(i.e., effeminacy, [disease carriers).]{.underline} As Colleen Lye
observes, "the incipient 'yellow peril' refers to a particular
combinatory kind of anticolonial \[and anti-West\] nationalism, in which
the union of Japanese technological advance and Chinese numerical mass
confronts Western civilization with a potentially unbeatable force."11
Arguably, [the yellow peril of today represents heightened Western
anxieties around China's combined forces of population size, global
economic growth, and rapid technological-scientific
innovation]{.underline}---all of which emerge from a political system
that is considered ideologically oppositional to ours. [The current
context]{.underline}, we suggest, [is best understood through the lens
of techno-Orientalism.]{.underline}

When the idea of techno-Orientalism first appeared in David Morley and
Kevin Robins's analysis of why Japan occupied such a threatening
position in Western imagination in the late 1980s, [techno-Orientalism
offered a framework to make sense of the technologically imbued racist
stereotypes]{.underline} of Japan/the Japanese that were [emerging
within the context of Western fears and anxieties]{.underline} around
Japan's ascendancy as a technological global power. They proposed that
if technological advancement has been crucial to Western civilizational
progress, then Japan's technological superiority over the West also
signals a critical challenge to Western hegemony, including its cultural
authority to control representations of the West and its "others." They
claimed that [the shifting balance in global power]{.underline}---the
West's loss of technological preeminence---[has induced an identity
crisis in the West.]{.underline} In response,
[techno-Orientalism,]{.underline} in which "\[idioms of technology\]
become structured into the discourse of Orientalism," [is produced in
large part to discipline]{.underline} Japan and its [rise to
techno-economic power.]{.underline}12 [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, for instance, [externalized its anxiety into
xenophobic projections of Japan as a "culture that is cold, impersonal,
and machine-like" in which its people are **"sub-human"** and
**"unfeeling aliens."**]{.underline}13 [Techno-Orientalism]{.underline},
born from the "Japan Panic," [was effectively consolidated through and
around political-economic concerns that frame]{.underline} Japanese and,
by extension, [Asian techno-capitalist progress as **dangerous and
dystopian.**]{.underline}

Extending Edward Said's concept of Orientalism,14 [techno-Orientalism
marks a geo-historical shift where the West no longer has control over
the terms that define the East]{.underline}---the "Orient"---[as weak,
inferior, and subordinate to the West.]{.underline} It marks a shift not
only in political-economic power but also in cultural authority.
[Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}, then, [is the expressive
vehicle]{.underline} (cultural productions and visual representations)
[by which]{.underline} Western and Eastern [nations articulate their
fears, desires, and anxieties]{.underline} that are [produced in their
competitive struggle to gain technological hegemony]{.underline} through
economic trade and scientific innovation.15

Analogous to Japan's position in the late 1980s, [China currently
figures into the techno-Orientalist imaginary as a powerful competitor
in mass production, a global financial giant, and]{.underline} an
aggressive [investor in technological, infrastructural, and scientific
developments.]{.underline} At the same time, [the increasing purchasing
power of China provokes American fear of a future global market that is
economically driven by Chinese consumptive desires and
practices.]{.underline} [It is this duality]{.underline}---the
domination of both production and consumption across different sectors
of the techno-capitalist global economy---**[that undergirds American
anxieties of a sinicized future]{.underline}**.16

**[Further amplifying these anxieties]{.underline}** around Chinese
techno-economic domination **[is our imagination of
China]{.underline}**/the Chinese [**as the ultimate yellow peril**,
whose state ideology is oppositional to that of the United States and
whose unmatched population size combined with its economic expansion and
technological advancements may actually pose a real challenge to U.S.
global hegemony.]{.underline} We turn now to examine how the ideology of
[yellow peril is manifesting in the current context of
techno-Orientalism, beginning first with an analysis of the racial trope
of **"Chinese as contagion"** and its connection to **anti-Asian
aggression.**]{.underline}

"Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital Subterfuge in Global Capitalism."
March 2019.

This is not the place for a detailed examination of the political
economy of \"postsocialist\" nations (Lane 2014). In the USSR, the orgy
of privatization and the chaos of shocktherapy marketization after 1991
have been followed under Putin by a new period of nationalization, in
which oligarchic capitalists operate under supervision of, and overlap
with, state elites in a context of market exchange (Worth 2005; Pirani
2010; Dzarasov 2014; Sakwa 2014). In the more complex case of the
People\'s Republic of China, the party apparatus has maintained control
of some \"commanding heights\" of the economy, even as other domains are
handed over to private ownership, including both foreign and domestic
investors. Some commentators see China\'s arrangements as tantamount to
full subsumption with the world market (Li 2009; HartLandsberg 2013);
others consider that a \"left turn\" from within the party apparatus
could reestablish a socialist project (Amin 2013). At the moment, the
latter possibility seems remote. In Russia, China, and other
postsocialist countries, the wage organizes production, the
responsibilities of the state for provision of public services have
typically been diminished, and there are vast income gulfs between
workers in and owners of the means of production. Corruption is often
rife. Political elites are either identical with, entangled in, or
dependent on capital ownership, and although these elites must in
various ways manage, mobilize, and hegemonize public opinion, their
fractions define the agenda of policy decisions, and perhaps especially
foreign policy decisions. Thus **[discussions of
international relations in terms of the ]{.underline}intentions
or desires of \"China\" or \"Russia\"** - **[as]{.underline}**, of
course, of **[the \"United States,\" \"Canada,\" \"Ukraine,\" \"Saudi
Arabia,\" or any other capitalist nation - must be understood
as ]{.underline}shorthand metonymic mystification of ruling-class
power[.]{.underline} **Cyberwar has therefore emerged as a topic of
global concern at a moment when the teleological certainties of Marxism
seem broken or reduced to cruel caricature. This is not a coincidence.
As we will argue, **[the ]{.underline}emergence of cybernetics from the
military-industrial complex[ of the United States]{.underline}** at the
end of the Second Word War **[was an important part of that nation\'s
ascent as a new imperial leader for
the]{.underline}** capitalist **[system. Computers and
networks]{.underline}**, both in their military and economic
applications, **[played an important role in eventual U.S.
victory]{.underline}** over the USSR **[in the Cold War. And
their extension into ]{.underline}electronic commodities, industrial
automation, supply-chain logistics, and financial trading[ was a crucial
part of]{.underline}** the **[globalization]{.underline}** in which a
reinvigorated capitalism from 1989 on disseminated itself around the
planet, **[under the shelter of]{.underline}** the global
hegemon\'s **[cruise missiles, smart weapons, and satellite
intelligence. This ]{.underline}armed pacification of a world
market[ has]{.underline}**, however, **[not had the finality many
expected. Rather, it has generated new wars]{.underline}**, of two major
types, both misnamed and ill defined but each a consequence of
capital\'s global triumph over its socialist opponents.** **The \"war on
terror\" is, of course, the conventional and ideologically laden name
for the protracted sequence of conflicts set in motion when mujahideen,
armed and financed by the United States and its Saudi Arabian ally to
fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, turned on its imperial patron
with the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001. **[These
conflicts, centered on the Middle East but ]{.underline}radiating across
the planet[, include the ]{.underline}invasion and occupation of
Afghanistan[; world-distributed terrorist attacks;
and ]{.underline}counterterrorist operations[ across Pakistan, Yemen,
Somalia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Mali, Libya, and many other
theaters]{.underline}**. If the \"war on terror\" is sometimes
colloquially used to include the U.S. invasion of Iraq, this craven
acceptance of the spurious rationalizations offered by the Bush
administration could be only retroactively justified, as U.S. occupation
generated first both Sunni and Shia insurgency and later, in its
aftermath, the rise of ISIS. **[This so-called war on terror
interpenetrates other regional conflicts, such as]{.underline}** those
in **[Kashmir between India and Pakistan, Russian actions in Chechnya,
and Saudi Arabia\'s intensifying clashes with Iran in Yemen and
elsewhere, and also overlaps with Israel\'s constant operations against
Palestinians, wars with neighbors, and determination to
maintain]{.underline}** its regional **[monopoly of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}** It is not our aim here to map the noxious
vectors of the \"war on terror,\" only to highlight
how **[its ]{.underline}mutating fronts[ have been a bleeding edge for
the development and use of
cyberweaponry]{.underline}**, **[in ]{.underline}counterinsurgency[ operations,
domestic ]{.underline}surveillance[, and ]{.underline}digital
strikes** and sabotage against nuclear weapons facilities.

### Link -- Cybersecurity 

#### Cyber warfare is a product of racial capitalisms unconscious -- the root cause is violence shaped by inter-capitalist rivalries that make war inevitable -- but it also is a source for revolutionary disruptions through a "cyber war on cyber war" that short-circuits capitals monopoly on violence 

**Dyer-Witherford and Mtviyenko 17** -- Nick Dyer-Witheford is an
Associate Professor in the Faculty of Information and Media Studies at
University of Western Ontario and Svitlana Matviyenko is an Assistant

\[Nick, Svitlana, "Cyber-War and Contemporary Marxism," 2017, DKP\]

**[Cyber-war could]{.underline}**, in theory **[be part of a
contemporary revolutionary war position which might
include]{.underline}** development **[militant hacking to
sabotage]{.underline}** and paralyse **[corporate operations, recovering
the worker power lost by the (cybernetic) diminishment of the power of
the mass strike]{.underline}**, etc, or disrupting the financial sector.
More loosely, as [we have already mentioned the last decades of seen
some successes in cyber-organizing of occupations, demonstrations and
riots, and one could imagine this process intensifying in future
crises.]{.underline} However, there are problems in particular to
applying cyber-war to revolutionary ends. As Hassan (2013),
Dyer-Witheford (2015) and others have argued, there is a misfit between
the speed and secrecy of cyber-war practices and the slower and social
logic that, in the long term, form radically emancipatory subjects and
movements: reliance on cyber-organizing probably account for some of the
\"up like a rocket, down like a stick\" aspect of the 2011 occupations.
Moreover, despite hacker romanticism, there is a persisting imbalance of
power between state and no-state forces even in the digital realm
(Healey 2013), and the new vulnerability of social movements to
surveillance cyber-crackdowns seriously jeopardises all sorts of
cyber-organizing hacktivism. To assess the future possibilities of
revolutionary cyber-war therefore requires an overall assessment of the
diverse factors at play in the emergence of cyber-war as a feature of
contemporary capitalism, a task to which we now turn.

3\. Cyber-War and the capitalist unconscious

**[Cyber war]{.underline}** emerges from and [**is shaped
by**]{.underline} the interaction of **[inter-capitalist rivalries,
class war, technological revolutions]{.underline}** and both progressive
and reactionary social movements, producing an extremely complex
diagram. What we might call [the horizontal axis of inter-state
conflicts]{.underline}, with which many cyber war accounts begin, [has
to be seen in relation to a vertical axis that pits these same rival
states against a seething mass of]{.underline} (often contradictory)
[digitized resistance movements]{.underline} (many of which are
supported or [co-opted by inter-state rivalries in various proxy
wars]{.underline}), with both horizontal and vertical dynamics arising
from, and [feeding into, a common origin-point in capitalism\'s most
recent technological revolution.]{.underline} These different vectors
interact to create a series of zigzagging, diagonal or swerving
alignments whose chaotic tendencies are enhanced by the
decentralization, opacity and velocity of networked interaction.

[This]{.underline} complex [pattern of conflicts can be seen as a
manifestation of global capitalism\'s \"unconscious\"]{.underline} (Tom
sic 2016; Jameson 1991). By this we mean that **[cyber-war is
symptomatic of features of the world-market]{.underline}**
unacknowledged **[in the neoliberal discourse of \"globalization\",
namely the profound aggression and destructiveness intrinsic to an order
predicated on privatized competition.]{.underline}** While
[neoliberalism]{.underline} of course not only recognises but
enthusiastically [celebrates competition]{.underline} and its associated
\"disruptions\" and \"creative destruction\" as a spur to innovation and
wealth creation[, its official message is that ultimately the
\"invisible hand\" of the market anneals this into the greater good of
optimal resource allocation.]{.underline} **[What is denied is the
possibility that this competitive agonistic system might explode into
non-creative destruction]{.underline}**, and that the ultimate
\"disruption\" is to be found in the horror of war. **[Cyber-war is a
secretive but increasingly present irruption of this possibility, a
partially contained yet intensifying expression of the world market\'s
disintegrative tendencies.]{.underline}** As aspects of the opaque and
undeclared but deeply penetrative refashioning of social subjects by
cyber-war we include the following points:

\* Cyber-war is \"crepuscular\" (Virilio 2002). [Cyber-war]{.underline}
as neither simply a fabrication of cyber-security experts (Blunden &
Cheung 2013; Rid 2013) nor the imminent equivalent of nuclear war, as
some of those experts suggest (Clark 2011). It [belongs rather neither
war nor peace, as form of shadow hostility that is compatible with and
cross cuts officially civil relations between states]{.underline} (e.g.
US relations with Russia and China) and the outbreak of kinetic
conflicts (Syria, Ukraine). [It is neither identical to nor separate
from]{.underline} either [conventional war]{.underline} or peace time
signals intelligence operations, [but is rather the persistent
background noise]{.underline} or \"ceiling\" (2013) [of
capital\'s]{.underline} new cold (and hot) wars, and its [endemic class
wars.]{.underline}

■ Cyber-war is mystifying. It is well recognized that cyber-war
operations pose an \"attribution problem\" because of the tendency to
\"obliterate proof\" (Filiol 2011) of its perpetrators. Although many of
these attribution problems are convincingly solved, sometimes
surprisingly quickly (Hansen 2013), they nevertheless invest questions
of war and peace, security and risk with a deep murkiness and
proliferating anxieties and paranoia.

[Cyber-war as marketized]{.underline} (or privatized) [war-in which the
state\'s **\"monopoly of violence\" is reinforced and undermined by
private actors, hacker armies, corporate \"hack-backs\", for profit
cyber-security firms and consultancies**]{.underline} (Harris 2014),
**[so that the \"military industrial\" complex\'s of national security
states become more and more interfaced with criminal markets and \"the
dark web]{.underline}**\", and increasingly dependent by corporate
collaborations, which can both enable and constrain state power (for
example, the PRISM compliance between the NSA and giant
info-corporations followed by \"encryption\" conflicts between FBI and
Apple etc). **[Cyber-war thus becomes a domain beyond]{.underline}**
public oversight and democratic **[control.]{.underline}**

[Cyber-war is a]{.underline} new way of [clandestine mobilization and
disciplining of populations]{.underline}. The mass mobilizations of huge
armies are thought of as past, but [cyber-war offers both states and
movements new forms of recruitment]{.underline}, beyond the professional
armies, whether by induction into patriotic hacking, [Anonymous-style
scrip- hacking]{.underline} or jihadist virtual interpellation. By the
same token it also sets in motion, through surveillance, a new
militarized panopticism, capable of both highly personalized targeting
of suspects (Duncan 2014) and the generalized repressive chilling of
networks (Deibert 2013).

[Cyber-war]{.underline} is increasingly automated, operating by malware
implantation, bot -nets, chat bots, the tweaking of algorithmic filter-
bubbles, big-data scanning surveillance and the \"kill-chains\" of
drone-warfare (Deibert 2013; Cockburn 2015; Shaw 2016). It thus [becomes
a machinic capitalist unconscious, a subterranean process in which the
participants are made unwittingly]{.underline} or at least unthinkingly
[complicit by their everyday involvement in a ubiquitously networked
social context.]{.underline}

This subterranean militarized digital environment poses contemporary
anti-capitalist movements with difficult dilemmas about how, when or if
to practice networked organization, whose speed and secrecy offer some
powerful advantages, but also confound the slower processes of mundane
organization and are intensely vulnerable to surveillance and
cyber-crackdowns. **[Future Marxist revolutionaries, operating under
conditions of surveillance and sous veillance, viral information and
disinformation, encryption and encryption-breaking, anonymization,
verification, authentication, and algorithmic digital war, will have to
make]{.underline}** constant strategic and **[tactical decisions
about]{.underline}** whether to adopt **[cyber-war
techniques.]{.underline}** The resort to cyber-war by state actors,
their proxies, and their terrorist opponents means that opposition to
militarization of the digital is an important arena of organization,
**[mobilizing popular sentiment against the enlarged scope of state and
corporate mass surveillance, viral propaganda, covert malware
operations, and]{.underline}**, more broadly pressing against the
**[aggressive disorders of the world market.]{.underline}**
Paradoxically, however, as Snowden, Wikileaks and Anonymous have shown,
revealing the scope of the destruction, actual and potential, inflicted
by global capitalism\'s new wave of wars and cyber-wars itself requires
hacker ingenuity. Therefore **[the best]{.underline}** current
**[revolutionary strategy may be the]{.underline}** paradoxical one of
(to renew another phrase from the archive of the left) \"Krieg dem
Krieg\", \"war on war\" (Nation 2009, or in this case, \"**[cyber-war on
cyber-war\".]{.underline}**

#### That has an [external impact]{.underline} of cybereugenics and nanocellular racism as the [perfection]{.underline} of [previous techniques]{.underline} elaborated during counterinsurgency wars, increasingly armed with [racial technologies of control]{.underline}

The same is true of the different ways in which living things can be
manipulated, including the hybridization of organic, animal, and
artificial elements. In fact, **[there is good reason to believe
that]{.underline}** in a more or less distant **[future genetic
techniques will be used to manage]{.underline}** the characteristics of
**[populations]{.underline}** to eliminate races judged \"undesirable\"
through the selection of trisomic embryos, or **[through
theriomorphism]{.underline}** (hybridization with animal elements)
**[or]{.underline}** \"**[cyborgization]{.underline}**\" (hybridization
with artificial elements). Nor is it impossible to believe that we will
arrive at a point where the fundamental role of medicine will be not
only to bring a sick organism back to health but to use medical
techniques of molecular engineering to refashion life itself along lines
defined by racial determinism. Race and racism, then, do not only have a
past. They also have a future, particularly in a context where **[the
possibility of transforming life and creating mutant species no longer
belongs to the realm of fiction]{.underline}**. Taken on their own, the
transformations of the capitalist mode of production during the second
half of the twentieth century cannot explain the reappearance and
various metamorphoses of the Beast. But they- along with major
discoveries in technology, biology, and genetics-do undeniably
constitute its background. **[42 A new political economy of life is
emerging]{.underline}**, one **[irrigated by international flows of
knowledge about cells, tissues, organs, pathologies, and therapies
as]{.underline}** well as about **[intellectual
property]{.underline}**.43 **[The reactivation of the logic of
race]{.underline}** also **[goes hand in hand with the increasing power
of]{.underline}** the ideology of security and the installation of
mechanisms aimed at **[calculating and minimizing risk]{.underline}**
and turning protection into the currency of citizenship. This is notably
the case in regard to the management of migration and mobility in a
context in which terrorist threats are believed to increasingly emanate
from individuals organized in cells and networks that span the surface
of the planet. In such conditions the protection and policing of
territory becomes a structural condition for securing the population. To
be effective, such protection requires that everyone remain at home,
that those living and moving within a given national territory be
capable of proving their identities at any given moment, that the most
exhaustive information possible be gathered on each individual, and that
the control of foreigners\' mobility be carried out not only along
borders but also from a distance, preferably within their countries of
departure. **[The massive expansion of digitization under way nearly
everywhere in the world partly adheres to this logic, with the idea that
optimal forms of securitization]{.underline}**￼necessarily
**[require]{.underline}** the creation of **[global systems of control
over individuals conceived of as biological bodies that are both
multiple and in motion.]{.underline}** Protection itself is no longer
based solely on the legal order. It has become a question of
biopolitics. **[The new systems]{.underline}** of security **[build on
various elements of prior regimes]{.underline}** (the forms of
punishment used within slavery, aspects of the colonial wars of conquest
and occupation, legal- juridical techniques used in the creation of
states of exception) **[and incorporate them]{.underline}**, **[on a
nanocellular level]{.underline}**, into the techniques of the age of
genomics and the war on terror. But **[they]{.underline}** also **[draw
on techniques elaborated during the counterinsurgency wars of the period
of decolonization and the \"dirty wars\" of the Cold War]{.underline}**
(**[in Algeria, Vietnam, Southern Africa, Burma, and
Nicaragua]{.underline}**), **[as well as]{.underline}** the experiences
of **[predatory dictatorships put into power throughout the world with
the direct encouragement]{.underline}**, or at least complicity, **[of
the intelligence agencies of the West]{.underline}**. The **[increasing
power]{.underline}** of the security state in the contemporary context
is, furthermore, **[accompanied by a remodeling of the world through
technology and an exacerbation of forms of racial
categorization]{.underline}**. Facing the transformation of the economy
of violence throughout the world, liberal democratic regimes now
consider themselves to be in a nearly constant state of war against new
enemies who are in flight, both mobile and reticular. **[The theater of
this new form of war]{.underline}** is both external and internal. It
requires a \"total\" conception of defense, along with greater tolerance
for legal exceptions and special dispensations. The conduct of this type
of war **[depends on the creation of]{.underline}** tight, **[panoptic
systems that enable increasing control of individuals]{.underline}**,
preferably from a distance, via the traces they leave behind.46 **[In
place of the classic paradigm of war]{.underline}**, in which opposing
sides meet on a well-defined battlefield and the risk of death is
reciprocal, **[the logic is now vertical]{.underline}**. **[There are
two protagonists: prey and predator.]{.underline}**47 The predator, with
nearly complete control of the airspace, selects the targets, locations,
times, and nature of the strikes.48 The increasingly vertical character
of war and the more frequent use of unpiloted drones means that killing
the enemy looks more and more like a video game, an experience of
sadism, spectacle, and entertainment.49 And, even more important, these
new forms of warfare carried out from a distance require an
unprecedented merging of the civil, police, and military spheres with
those of surveillance. The spheres of surveillance, meanwhile, are also
being reconfigured. No longer mere state structures, and operating as
chains linked in form￼only, they function by cultivating private-sector
influence, by expanding into those corporate entities responsible for
gathering the data necessary for mass surveillance. As a result, the
objects of surveillance become daily life, the space of relationships,
communication (notably through electronic technologies), and
transactions. There is not, of course, a total concatenation of the
mechanisms of the market and those of the state. But in our contemporary
world the liberal state is transformed into a war power at a time when,
we now realize, capital not only remains fixed in a phase of primitive
accumulation but also still leverages racial subsidies in its pursuit of
profit. In this context the citizen is redefined as both the subject and
the beneficiary of surveillance, which now privileges the transcription
of biological, genetic, and behavioral characteristics through digital
imprints. In a new technetronic regime characterized by miniaturization,
dematerialization, and the fluid administration of state violence,
imprints (fingerprints, scans of the iris and retina, forms of vocal and
facial recognition) make it possible to measure and archive the
uniqueness of individuals. The distinguishing parts of the human body
become the foundations for new systems of identification, surveillance,
and repression. The security state conceives of identity and the
movement of individuals (including its own citizens) as sources of
danger and risk. But **[the]{.underline}** generalized **[use of
biometric data as a source of identification and]{.underline}** for the
**[automation of facial recognition constitutes a new type of
populace]{.underline}**, one predisposed toward distancing and
imprisonment. 51 So it is that, in the context of the anti-immigration
push in Europe, entire categories of the population are indexed and
subjected to various forms of racial categorization that transform the
immigrant (legal or illegal) into an essential category of difference.52
This difference can be perceived as cultural or religious or linguistic.
It is seen as inscribed in the very body of the migrant subject, visible
on somatic, physiognomic, and even genetic levels.53 **[War and race
have meanwhile become resurgent problems at the heart of the
international order]{.underline}**. The same is true of torture and the
phenomenon of mass incarceration. It is not only that the line between
war and peace has been blurred. **[War has become a \"gigantic process
of labor,\" while the military regime seeks to impose its own model on
the \"public order of the peace state.\"]{.underline}**54 While some
citadels have collapsed, other **[walls have been
strengthened]{.underline}**.55 As has long been the case, **[the
contemporary world is]{.underline}** deeply **[shaped and conditioned
by]{.underline}** the **[ancestral]{.underline}** forms of **[religious,
legal, and political life built around]{.underline}** fences,
enclosures, walls, camps, circles,￼and, above all,
**[borders]{.underline}**. 56 Procedures of **[differentiation,
classification, and hierarchization aimed at exclusion, expulsion,
and]{.underline}** even **[eradication have been reinvigorated
everywhere]{.underline}**. New voices have emerged proclaiming, on the
one hand, that there is no such thing as a universal human being or, on
the other, that the universal is common to some human beings but not to
all. Others emphasize the necessity for all to guarantee the safety of
their own lives and homes by devoting themselves-and their ancestors and
their memories, in one way or another-to the divine, a process that only
subtracts them from historical interrogation and secures them completely
and permanently within the walls of theology. Like the beginning of the
nineteenth century, the beginning of the twenty-first constitutes, from
this perspective, a significant moment of division, universal
differentiation, and identity seeking.

"Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital Subterfuge in Global Capitalism."
March 2019.

This is not the place for a detailed examination of the political
economy of \"postsocialist\" nations (Lane 2014). In the USSR, the orgy
of privatization and the chaos of shocktherapy marketization after 1991
have been followed under Putin by a new period of nationalization, in
which oligarchic capitalists operate under supervision of, and overlap
with, state elites in a context of market exchange (Worth 2005; Pirani
2010; Dzarasov 2014; Sakwa 2014). In the more complex case of the
People\'s Republic of China, the party apparatus has maintained control
of some \"commanding heights\" of the economy, even as other domains are
handed over to private ownership, including both foreign and domestic
investors. Some commentators see China\'s arrangements as tantamount to
full subsumption with the world market (Li 2009; HartLandsberg 2013);
others consider that a \"left turn\" from within the party apparatus
could reestablish a socialist project (Amin 2013). At the moment, the
latter possibility seems remote. In Russia, China, and other
postsocialist countries, the wage organizes production, the
responsibilities of the state for provision of public services have
typically been diminished, and there are vast income gulfs between
workers in and owners of the means of production. Corruption is often
rife. Political elites are either identical with, entangled in, or
dependent on capital ownership, and although these elites must in
various ways manage, mobilize, and hegemonize public opinion, their
fractions define the agenda of policy decisions, and perhaps especially
foreign policy decisions. Thus **[discussions of international relations
in terms of the intentions or desires of \"China\" or
\"Russia\"]{.underline}** - **[as]{.underline}**, of course, of **[the
\"United States,\" \"Canada,\" \"Ukraine,\" \"Saudi Arabia,\" or any
other capitalist nation - must be understood as shorthand metonymic
mystification of ruling-class power. Cyberwar has therefore emerged as a
topic of global concern]{.underline}** at a moment when the teleological
certainties of Marxism seem broken or reduced to cruel caricature. This
is not a coincidence. As we will argue, **[the emergence of cybernetics
from the military-industrial complex of the United States]{.underline}**
at the end of the Second Word War **[was an important part of that
nation\'s ascent as a new imperial leader for the]{.underline}**
capitalist **[system. Computers and networks]{.underline}**, both in
their military and economic applications, **[played an important role in
eventual U.S. victory]{.underline}** over the USSR **[in the Cold War.
And their extension into electronic commodities, industrial automation,
supply-chain logistics, and financial trading was a crucial part
of]{.underline}** the **[globalization]{.underline}** in which a
reinvigorated capitalism from 1989 on disseminated itself around the
planet, **[under the shelter of]{.underline}** the global hegemon\'s
**[cruise missiles, smart weapons, and satellite intelligence. This
armed pacification of a world market has]{.underline}**, however, **[not
had the finality many expected. Rather, it has generated new
wars]{.underline}**, of two major types, both misnamed and ill defined
but each a consequence of capital\'s global triumph over its socialist
opponents. The \"war on terror\" is, of course, the conventional and
ideologically laden name for the protracted sequence of conflicts set in
motion when mujahideen, armed and financed by the United States and its
Saudi Arabian ally to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, turned on
its imperial patron with the destruction of the World Trade Center in
2001. **[These conflicts, centered on the Middle East but radiating
across the planet, include the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan;
world-distributed terrorist attacks; and counterterrorist operations
across Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Mali, Libya,
and many other theaters]{.underline}**. If the \"war on terror\" is
sometimes colloquially used to include the U.S. invasion of Iraq, this
craven acceptance of the spurious rationalizations offered by the Bush
administration could be only retroactively justified, as U.S. occupation
generated first both Sunni and Shia insurgency and later, in its
aftermath, the rise of ISIS. **[This so-called war on terror
interpenetrates other regional conflicts, such as]{.underline}** those
in **[Kashmir between India and Pakistan, Russian actions in Chechnya,
and Saudi Arabia\'s intensifying clashes with Iran in Yemen and
elsewhere, and also overlaps with Israel\'s constant operations against
Palestinians, wars with neighbors, and determination to
maintain]{.underline}** its regional **[monopoly of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}** It is not our aim here to map the noxious
vectors of the \"war on terror,\" only to highlight how **[its mutating
fronts have been a bleeding edge for the development and use of
cyberweaponry]{.underline}**, **[in counterinsurgency operations,
domestic surveillance, and digital strikes]{.underline}** and sabotage
against nuclear weapons facilities.

### Link -- Deterrence

#### Effective deterrence strategies require a [silent war]{.underline} against racialized threats \-- their every 2AC claim that "threats are real" is a [performative gesture]{.underline} of *sly civility* that renders America the [policeman]{.underline} of international politics

**Mathur 16**. Rita Mathur is a Professor in Political Science and
Geography at UTSA and has a PhD in polisci from York. \"Sly civility and
the paradox of equality/inequality in the nuclear order: a post-colonial
critique.\" 2016. Nuclear Politics: Beyond Positivism.

**[Sly civility can be understood as a concept encompassing practices of
racial etiquette and strategic orientalism]{.underline}** as discussed
below. The **[practices of racial etiquette came into
play]{.underline}** with such speed **[in the establishment of the
nuclear order]{.underline}** that 'the previous longevity of
anti-egalitarian and racist sentiment can and was easily lost sight'
(Furedi 1998, 15). The **[practices of racial etiquette are conscious
of]{.underline}** the formal principles of **[equality among sovereign
states, induce an epistemological silence against any overt statements
on racial inequality but stubbornly refuse to give up on]{.underline}**
the idea of **[political mastery]{.underline}**. Frank Furedi argues
that **[practices of racial etiquette represent a 'second form of
colonization' that does not have any serious commitment to anti-racism
but seeks to indulge in a 'silent war']{.underline}** to 'produce over
time, social formations and even world orders that were macrostructural
systems of inclusion and exclusion' (5). These practices of racial
etiquette are further reinforced by contemporary practices of strategic
orientalism. Edward Said articulated the concept of 'Orientalism' to
demonstrate how the West constitutes its own identity on the premise of
its differences with others often seen as a source of threat (Said
2001). **[In these iterative practices of representation]{.underline}**
the **[cultural differences are]{.underline}** effectively **[deployed
to differentiate the West and discipline the others in the international
order]{.underline}**. Keith Krause and Andrew Latham suggest that the
continued exercise of this disciplinary power necessitates maintenance
of military superiority in the post-Cold War period. **[The
West]{.underline}** then **[deploys 'strategic orientalism' as a 'new
conceptual template' that enables the West to impute 'politicostrategic
objectives and purposes' to Third World countries in a manner that
is]{.underline}** '**[informed]{.underline}** more **[by Western fears
and prejudices]{.underline}** than by the realities of politics in these
states' (Krause and Latham 1998, 38). **[It transforms]{.underline}**
'essentially **[contestable interpretations of danger' into '"objective"
and incontestable facts]{.underline}** regarding the sources of threat
and insecurity in the international system' (38). An effort to map these
intersecting practices of racial etiquette, orientalism and strategic
orientalism on a continuum reveals practices of sly civility. A grasp of
these practices of sly civility facilitates an understanding of the
nuclear order with its practices of inclusion and exclusion and the
West's efforts to control the narrative of nuclear arms control and
disarmament. In this narrative **[there is an assumption
that]{.underline}** the **[Western practices of arms control and
disarmament are 'rational', 'benign' and provide]{.underline}** for the
**[global 'public good']{.underline}** (Krause and Latham 1998, 23).
**[The control of the narrative and its representation]{.underline}** of
these standards **[is a prerequisite in the exercise of power over
others]{.underline}**. Any resistance to this narrative is through
practices of racial etiquette and strategic orientalism to be
marginalized as peripheral and a source of instability and chaos. These
**[practices of strategic orientalism or sly civility are not sensitive
to the 'ethnocentricity' of]{.underline}** their **[underlying
assumptions]{.underline}** and exhibit a 'distinct matrix of beliefs and
dispositions' towards others in the field of arms control and
disarmament (23). **[It is]{.underline}**, therefore, **[imperative that
practices of sly civility be 'caught in the irredeemable act of
writing']{.underline}** (Bhabha 1994, 133). Homi K. Bhabha suggests that
**[the 'practice of writing' is a 'strategy of colonialist
regulation']{.underline}** (134). This writing 'puts on trial the very
discourse of civility within which representative government claims its
liberty and empire its ethics' (136). The **[writing makes visible the
'nationalist, authoritarian tone' that polices]{.underline}** the
**['culturally and racially differentiated colonial
space']{.underline}** of arms control and disarmament (134). This
authoritarian tone is embedded in a narrative that is narcisstic in its
insistence that the other recognize its authority. In its insistence for
this recognition it is willing to calculate and deploy tactical measures
such as 'skeptical conceits' that dismiss any efforts of the others that
seek to challenge its authority (141). Any resistance unleashes acute
anxiety and a 'paranoia of power' that generates 'political and psychic'
contestations on authority to regulate the borders of arms control and
disarmament (141--2). Despite this anxiety, it is important to
scrutinize arms control and disarmament texts as 'despatches of
hyprocrisy' that seek to 'moralize' but exhibit a specific 'discursive
doubleness' that exists between the lines as an 'effect of the
ambivalent, deferred address of colonialist governance' (Bhabha 1994,
136). It is in this space '**[between the civil address and its colonial
signification]{.underline}**' with '**[each axis displaying a problem of
recognition and repetition]{.underline}**' that there '**[shuttles the
signifier of authority in search of a strategy of surveillance,
subjection, and inscription]{.underline}**' (136). **[The signifier of
authority traverses through time and through its repetition deepens the
crisis of authority experienced in]{.underline}** practices of **[arms
control and disarmament]{.underline}**. This crisis of authority
encourages 'projections' compelling the 'native to address the master'
and reproducing the native as 'partially aligned or reformed' in
discourse 'endangering the boundaries of truth itself' (142). Any effort
to address this crisis necessitates an exposure of practices of sly
civility to encourage a confrontation with the 'colonialist
governmentality' in the field of arms control and disarmament. **[This
confrontation will make it]{.underline}** increasingly **[difficult for
the West to 'normalize its own history' and 'inscribe the history of the
other in a fixed hierarchy of civil progress']{.underline}** (136).
These confrontations have been initiated and are now generating a
momentum towards disavowal of the strategies of sly civility demanding
redressal against the experiences of 'institutionalized humiliation'
(Parek 2009, 31). The **[practices of sly civility often fail to grasp
that humiliation is not simply an affect but]{.underline}** '**[a claim
or claims of certain kinds]{.underline}**' and it is important to
'explore the structure of these claims, their logical or conceptual
conditions, and their role in the reproduction of relations of power'
(Palshikar 2009, 81). Bhikhu **[Parekh locates]{.underline}** organized
or **[institutionalized humiliation]{.underline}** in an 'unequal
society **[in which some enjoy considerable power over others and
exercise it with relative impunity]{.underline}**' **[and]{.underline}**
these **[powers are vested in]{.underline}** '**[social institutions and
practices]{.underline}**' **[that]{.underline}** '**[embody disrespect
for]{.underline}**, and systematically violate the **[self-respect of
groups of individuals]{.underline}**' (Parek 2009, 31). **[The pathos of
this]{.underline}** experience of **[humiliation among the subalterns
became acutely visible at a time when the use of nuclear weapons in
Japan reinforced the message that]{.underline}**: **[locations in the
hierarchy of states are marked off in part by specific
weapons]{.underline}**, so the possession of certain weapons is
considered the sine qua non for claiming places higher up the
international order. Perhaps of central importance in this regard are
nuclear arms. (Mutimer 2000, 137) **[This particular experience of
humiliation has been compounded with repetitive threats to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, specifically **[by the USA]{.underline}**, **[in
wars of intervention in the Third World]{.underline}** (Petras and
Morley 1988, 151). **[It is against these experiences of
vulnerability]{.underline}**, **[suffering and humiliation that
discourses on sly civility have to contend with to
address]{.underline}** the paradox of **[equality/inequality in the
nuclear order]{.underline}**. A clear conceptualization of practices of
sly civility above encourages us to now survey the system of recordation
of the paradox of equality/inequality in the texts on arms control and
disarmament. For the purpose of this paper we will limit this exercise
to three representative samples of writing that traverse through time
vacillating between 'what is always "in place", already known and
something that must be anxiously repeated' (Bhabha 1994, 95). These
texts display a liberal willingness to entertain the problem of
equality/inequality in arms control and disarmament in some measure. The
willingness to question the assumptions informing 'a desirable and
feasible' nuclear order is constrained by the desire to rationalize and
make it appear natural that the inequalities should persist in the
existing nuclear order (Bull 1987, 191). The treatment meted out to the
equality/inequality paradox deserves careful consideration as they make
visible the practices of sly civility that are responsible for the
hierarchical international nuclear order. In the initial period of the
Cold War, Hedley Bull, a representative figure of arms control and
disarmament acknowledges the hegemonic control that exists in the
nuclear order (1987, 191). He concedes that 'the vision of the world
order that is projected by our arms control arrangements is one against
which the majority of states are in revolt' and that 'one finds
different degrees of opposition to these arrangements, deep mutual
divisions' (191). However **[he insists on the need for maintaining this
nuclear order because those that 'wish' to break down this hegemony
'have nothing in mind with which to replace it']{.underline}** (191,
emphasis added). **[Bull specifically cites countries such as China,
India, Iran, Indonesia, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Argentina,
Nigeria and argues]{.underline}** that 'the **[objection of the third
world countries is not to the quality of order in the present
international arrangements]{.underline}**; it is rather to the way in
which these arrangements discriminate against them' (191, emphasis
added). Thus, **[Bull]{.underline}** not only specifically identifies
the countries that are opposed to the inequality in the nuclear order
but **[is]{.underline}** also **[insistent in making a division between
those that have a mind and others that are mindless in their quest for
change in the nuclear order]{.underline}**. **[He]{.underline}** further
**[argues that states located on the third rung of the hierarchical
nuclear order harbour grievances not to the quality of order but the
arrangements within this order that are discriminatory against
them]{.underline}**. This split discourse on quality of nuclear order
and responsibility for the arrangements within the nuclear order is
further buttressed by the suggestion that 'those who have special
interests recognize the special responsibilities that go with them, and
conduct themselves in such a way as to engage general support for the
system whose custodians and guarantors they are' (Bull 1968, 1987,
143--50, 214, emphasis added). **[The racial etiquette
practiced]{.underline}** by Hedley Bull **[becomes more pronounced in
his statement that the]{.underline}** '**[Third World's lack of power,
including military power]{.underline}** -- its sense of impotence and
vulnerability **[in relation to the Western countries' makes it rail
against the existing international nuclear order]{.underline}** (1987,
201--2, emphasis added). It is with an inquisitorial insistence that he
demands they articulate an 'alternative conception of world order' to be
taken seriously (191). A similar tone of authority persists in the text
of Joseph S. Nye as he writes in the last decade of the Cold War. Nye
undertakes a purposeful investigation of the 'logic of inequality' in
the nuclear order (1985, 123). The sincerity of his undertaking is
belied by attributing theatrics to those claiming to harbour grievances
against the existing nuclear order prior to the investigation being
completed. At the very outset of this investigation, he describes the
allegations of discrimination, hypocrisy and failure to live up to
commitments levied by the diplomats of non-nuclear weapons states
against the superpowers as a 'drama' (123). Nye then suggests that there
is a 'basic intuitive compact underlying the NPT' and describes the
nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT) itself as an 'imaginary compact'
(1985, 124, 129) He then stipulates that 'under certain conditions' and
'other things remaining equal' nuclear inequality is acceptable
(124--126). This reluctance to engage with historical circumstances and
insert ceteris paribus clauses to advance abstract conditions of
arguments is a questionable exercise. According to Akeel Bigrami and
Priya Chacko this reluctance exhibits a 'technological mindset' that
'fosters an abstract view of the world and relies on an understanding of
truth as cognitive rather than as lived moral experience' (Bilgrami
2003, 4164; Chacko 2011, 191). Nye deliberately insists on investigating
the logic of inequality only as a technical problem susceptible to
failure and denounces any investigation of the problem as embedded in
racial roots. He emphatically insists that, 'nuclear inequality has
nothing to do with racism on the part of weapons states or with the
irrationality that some claim to see in Third World leaders' (Nye 1985,
126). **[This impatience to denounce charges of racism is coupled with
fearful portents that questioning the logic of inequality could lead to
the possibility that 'deterrence will fail']{.underline}** (126). **[The
failure of deterrence it is argued 'is likely to be much higher in most
regional situations because of the shaky political conditions found in
most states seeking nuclear weapons as well as their limited experience
with nuclear command and control systems']{.underline}** (126). The
existing inequality is further justified on grounds that with 'new
proliferators' the threat of breaking 'nuclear taboo becomes that much
more likely' (127). The reference to 'shaky political conditions' belies
an element of suspicion and uncertainty of a stabilized and legitimate
influence in these regions that fuels the need for assertion of hegemony
in the nuclear order. There is little effort to balance these
observations with acknowledgement of the risks that the possession of
nuclear arms by Western powers has exposed to the world (Sagan 1995).
The maintenance of inequality is further proposed in the following
terms, 'under many circumstances the introduction of a single bomb in
some non-nuclear states may be more likely to lead to nuclear use than
the addition of a thousand more warheads to the US and Soviet
stockpiles' (Nye 1985, 128, emphasis added). **[This]{.underline}**
particular **[statement reveals the]{.underline}** entrenched **[psyche
of fearful discrimination and reignites the racial trauma of
colonization in the subaltern that is to be severely penalized should
even a single, rusty weapon be discovered in its possession by the
colonizer]{.underline}** (Memmi 1967, 93--4). **[Nye is
confident]{.underline}** in his assertion **[that]{.underline}**,
'**[nonproliferation is not an inconsistent or hypocritical policy if it
is based on impartial and realistic estimation of relative
risks]{.underline}**' (Nye 1985, 127). **[But he is oblivious to the
consideration that the power to make calculations pertaining to risk of
failure of deterrence are all vested in the West and violation of taboo
are all sourced to 'new proliferators' that need to be
policed]{.underline}** (Nye 1985, 131). **[Nye does not problematize the
task of policing as a shared responsibility of all countries but
reiterates that the task of policing is 'traditionally the domain of
great powers in international politics']{.underline}** (131). Any
**[resistance to this policing function perceived as 'the domain of
great powers' is]{.underline}** further **[circumscribed by polarized
choices between 'some ordered inequality in weaponry' or 'anarchic
inequality' an oxymoron that is described]{.underline}** by Nye **[to be
'more dangerous']{.underline}** (Nye 1985, 130). Nye casually entertains
the possibility that 'third countries may hold the superpowers similarly
accountable' but fails to provide any account of how this might be
undertaken as he only insists on 'alliance guarantees' to stem
proliferation and readily concludes that the NPT's 'Article VI
obligations cannot be interpreted as simple disarmament' (128). The
transfer of nuclear technology even for energy programmes is also to be
grounded in an 'evolutionary approach' and susceptible to additional
deliberation on a 'region's stability and of the susceptibility of the
technology to safeguards' (130). It is **[this entrenched mindset of
political master and paranoia of displacement of power]{.underline}**
that is displayed by Nye four decades into the Cold War. Nye **[displays
little desire to question the legacy of attitudes]{.underline}** that he
has **[inherited from those that have been revered and]{.underline}**
are **[woven into the traditional discourse on arms control and
disarmament.]{.underline}**

[The most proximate scene of biosecurity\'s solidification is the
post-9/11 US security state\'s War on Terror.]{.underline} The extent to
which the American government came to coopt the language of disease
emergence was illustrated by Donald Rumsfeld\'s oft-cited speech from a
2002 Department of Defense news briefing in which he observed: \"There
are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known
unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don\'t know.
But there are also unknown unknowns. These are things we don\'t know we
don\'t know.\"24 As Bruce Braun points out, Rumsfeld\'s logic mimed the
contemporary perception of the \"virtuality of molecular life\": just as
[biology increasingly gets articulated in terms of virtual networks of
unknown and dangerous viruses that \"circulate and recombine in novel
ways, threatening our bodies and identities,\" so national security came
to be couched in terms of hidden networks of sleeper cells and emerging
threats]{.underline}.25 Melinda [Cooper calls this the \"biological
turn\" in US foreign policy after 9/11, but more than a simple
rhetorical resonance, she argues that this turn reflected a fundamental
phi-osophical reconceptualization of warfare by the Bush
administration]{.underline}. Moving away from the previous geopolitical
doctrine of mutual deterrence, **[the US government strategically
\"conflate\[d\] public health, biomedicine, and war\" so as to make
operative a security agenda of \"full-spectrum dominance,
counterproliferation, and preemption.\"]{.underline}**26 The
epidemiological tenets of microbial emergence, resistance and
counterresistance, and [humans\' permanent warfare against germs were
transferred over and made central to defense policy. Within this new
security framework, war became integral to the very conceptualization of
life]{.underline}, or as Cooper puts it, \"as if permanent war were
simply a fact of life\'\'27 In the reverse direction, [national security
now propels biological research--- including the creation of new
infectious diseases. In anticipation of potential bio- terrorist
attacks]{.underline}, the US government\'s agency for developing
cutting-edge mili­tary technology, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency [(DARPA), has been actively inventing antibiotics and vaccines
for not only known pathogens but also ones that do not yet exist. In the
name of biodefense, \"DARPA finds itself in the paradoxical situation of
having first to create novel infectious agents or more virulent forms of
existing pathogens in order to then engineer a cure,\" thus \"blurring
the difference between defensive and offensive
research.\"]{.underline}28 For Cooper, this ideological convergence
between biomedicine and biosecurity represents the culmination of
neoliberalism\'s politics of life, which entrenches ideas of specu­lative
preemption and catastrophe risk so as to disable a counterpolitics. What
we can further emphasize is the real geography that underlies the
post-9/11 bios- ecurity imagination. Despite rather postmodern
descriptions of Al-Qaeda as a fluid organization of dispersed and
fluctuating networks, **[the actual targets of US antiterrorism measures
remain fixed in Asia and Africa.]{.underline}** As in the case of the
2003 Iraq War, [Rumsfeld\'s **invocation of \"unknown unknowns\"**
served **to justify** Amer­ican military **invasion of Iraq** in the
absence of evidence that it was stockpiling weapons of mass
destruction.]{.underline} Concurrently, the formulation of a
prototerritory of infectious disease emergence took place against the
backdrop of this geopolit­ical theater of war.

Yet the consoll dat ion of the biosecurity posit ion predates 9/11 and
can be traced back to the late 1980s and 1990s, as part of the US
response to post-Cold War geopolitics after the dissolution of the USSR.
As Susan Wright details, up until the 1980s, the American government
mostly regarded terrorism as a \"sec¬ond- or third-tier security
problem---a problem that happened elsewhere,\" so that proponents of
biological defense remained marginal in national security discus-
sions.29 With the end of the Cold War, however, the former template of
the Soviet threat was replaced by the discourse of hostile third-world
\"rogue states,\" and the prospect of nuclear warfare was superseded by
the menace of biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction.
Before 9/11 gave a concrete context to this logic, the 1995 Aum
Shinrikyo attack on the Tokyo subway provided biosecurity advocates
within the US government with an early platform. This attack, they
warned, represented the \"index case\" for contemporary acts of
bioterrorism: a vital \"threshold\" had been crossed, a taboo lifted,
and henceforth, terrorists of all stripes would follow suit by employing
bioweapons on civilians.30 Bioterrorism, they argued, was \"no longer
the stuff of science fiction or adventure movies\" but \"a reality which
has already come to pass, and one which, if we do not take appro¬priate
measures, will increasingly threaten us in the future.\"31 As Wright
recounts, this \"alarmist\" stance overtook Washington during the 1990s,
and the congressio¬nal budget for counterterrorism defense soared.

Biological research benefitted directly from this political paradigm
shift, as the study of infectious diseases now became a security
priorlty. Significantly[, a]{.underline} small [cohort of prominent
scientists was instrumental in linking infectious disease to biowarfare
as coterminous national security threats.]{.underline} These scient ists
served as key advisers in Washington, organizing research forums and
participat¬ing on government panels as well as supplying successive
White House admin-istrations with numerous reports on bioterrorist
scenarios. They presented their views as impartial and nonpartisan
extensions of scientific expertise, and their voices carried tremendous
weight in determining government policy and budget allocations as well
as the direction of scientific research. Two figures in particular stood
out. [Donald Henderson]{.underline}, the elder statesman of American
epidemiology credited with eradicating smallpox in the 1960s and 1970s,
[was crucial in lending his support to the biosecurity
position]{.underline}. At a 1998 CDC-sponsored confer¬ence on emerging
infectious diseases, for instance, he categorically dismissed the
objections of bioterrorism skeptics, and in a report later that year by
the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council, he warned
that it would be a \"grave mistake\" for the government to delay
biodefense preparations.32 In that same year, he was named the founding
director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies,
with an earmarked \$1 million in congressional funding.33 Even more
influential than Henderson was [Joshua Lederberg, Nobel Prize-winning
molecular biologist and scientific adviser since the 1950s for nine
consecutive White House administrations. He organized and supervised
many of the research panels at the National Academy of Sciences and the
Institute of Medicine, and in his reports to the government, he
repeatedly forecast the calamitous impact of biowarfare]{.underline},
even handpicking experts specifically to dramatize for politicians
apocalyptic scenarios of bioterrorist attacks on American cities. [He
was the one who identified the 1995 Tokyo subway attack as a \"threshold
event,\" claiming that \"Aum Shinrikyo has done us a favor by . . .
making it obvious that there is a very serious threat; that terrorists
would use any means imaginable at their disposal.\"]{.underline}34
Again, [**Asia enters into this history as a strategic** site, this time
as a \"**threshold\" of biothreat to be held at bay, in a coordinated
narrative of bioterrorism**.]{.underline} As Wright notes, [Lederberg
too reaped financial benefit from his political advocacy,]{.underline}
as he later became a board member of EluSys Therapeutics, a
biotech¬nology company with a biodefense research focus.35 The
intertwined interests of neoliberal and neoconservative forces with
public health became entrenched in this era, even if only a handful of
high-profile scientists were directly implicated in this development.

In fact, the basis for the coniunction between biomedicine and
biosecurity was set already in the historic 1989 NIAID/NIH Conference on
Emerging Viruses held in Washington, DC. This conference was attended by
over two hundred American scientists and pubiic health experts, includ
ing both Henderson and Lederberg, and it was the forum where the term
emerging viruses was first coined by the conference\'s principal
organizer, epidemiologist Stephen Morse.36 In his follow-up landmark
edited volume, Emerging Viruses, Morse captured the core message of the
meeting:

The problem of emerging viruses is not likely to disappear. If anything,
it will increase; episodes of disease emergence are likely to become
more frequent. . . . Constructive action has been paralyzed in the past
by a combination of apathy and uncertainty. The AIDS epidemic is a
powerful reminder of the price of apa¬thy. It is also a demonstration
that infectious diseases can still be a major threat to human life.
Although we cannot yet predict specific disease outbreaks, and may never
be able to, we now understand many of the factors leading to emer¬gence.
. . . Part of the question therefore becomes whether people will
continue unwittingly to precipitate emerging diseases and suffer the
consequences, as has happened throughout history, or will begin to take
responsibility for these human actions.37

According to Morse, since recent human history has witnessed waves of
epi¬demics culminating in the AIDS crisis, we need to understand
outbreaks not as \"acts of God\" but within a framework of \"disease
emergence.\" He therefore coined the phrase emerging viruses to desi
gnate not just new pathogens but also known ones that are \"rapidly
expanding their range.\"38 As Andrew Lakoff points out, this
classification is powerfully \"generative,\" for it unifies under one
name an array of illnesses not previously linked. The term converts a
\"disparate set of disease threats\" into a single \"imperative\" of
biodefense preparation.39 So even if the category of EID seems
\"self-evident\" by our time, it is a \"relatively recent invention,\"
by a relatively elite and invested group of microbiologists and
epidemiologists.40

The 1989 conference laid the conceptual cornerstone for later
biosecurity techniques. Nicholas King pinpoints this conference as the
catalyzing moment for what he calls an \"emerging diseases worldview.\"
Not just a set of scientific explanations or policy proposals, this
worldview, he argues, is deeply ideological: it \"comes equipped with a
moral economy and historical narrative, explaining how and why we find
ourselves in the situation that we do now, identifying vil¬lains and
heroes, ascribing blame for failures and credit for triumph,\" as well
as providing \"a consistent, self-contained ontology of epidemic
disease\" that allows for strategic intervention and management.41 As
King shows, in the decade after the conference, leading scientists and
health officials in the United States increasingly conjured pandemic
scenarios and tied them directly to national security, helping to
formalize and cement the emerging diseases worldview across multiple
spheres of knowledge. Endorsing a system of global epidemic surveillance
and medical commoditization, this worldview represents a model of
capltallst biopower that seeks not only to be omnipresent and omniscient
but to profit from sickness everywhere.42 Indeed, in his edited volume,
Morse already strongly pro¬moted global disease surveillance as an
\"essential first step\" for securing national and human health.43 He
cited Henderson\'s proposal for creating a fleet of interna¬tional
disease surveillance centers modeled on the CDC, as well as global
surveil¬lance systems for early detection and rapid tracking of
outbreaks, electronic data¬bases for instantaneous accessing of medical
information, and the marketization of health commodities such as drugs
and vaccines.44 In fact, given the advent of internet technology and the
global pharmaceutical industry, Henderson\'s blue-print has been not
only reallzed but surpassed. Current systems of syndromic surveillance,
which gather real-time data from numerous sources and monitor for
patterns of symptoms distributed across populations, now work to
\"identify potential outbreaks while they are still invisible to
healthcare professionals,\" effec¬tively relocating disease knowledge
from physicians and patients to the infor¬mation systems overseen by
national security authorities.45 In turn, this disease governance
template has been exported to the WHO by American CDC officials, and
from there it has disseminated into the public health institutions of
countries such as China, becoming ever more established on a global
scale.46

Echoing King\'s analysis, we can also see a penchant for moral parables
in the champions of infectious disease and biosecurity discourse. On
their account, in a narrative that has become canonized as scientific
lore, Morse and Henderson consistently portray themselves as the
longtime underdogs in American public health, the unjustly ignored wise
men who were never complacent, the small but marginalized contingent of
microbiologists and epidemiologists who valiantly disputed the earlier
era\'s status quo and ultimately came to be vindicated by the microbes\'
vengeful return. In short, they were the heroes to William Stewart\'s
vil¬lain. Ironically, it turns out that Stewart\'s infamous line about
\"closing the book on infectious diseases\" is itself the stuff of urban
legends---one that, as far as the records indicate, originated in this
very 1989 conference on emerging viruses, in a personal correspondence
between none other than Henderson and Morse.47 Henderson had apparently
heard the remark secondhand, from unnamed people who were in turn
recalling a speech from memory years later, and he went on to repeat
this anecdote both at the conference and in his essay for Morse\'s
volume.48 Morse, for his part, footnoted the quotation and attributed it
to Henderson in a medical textbook a few years later.49 Two journalists
who attended the conference reported this line in the media, and one of
them, Laurie Garrett, further popu¬larized it in her 1994 bestselling
book The Coming Plague.50 But Stewart himself never made the alleged
statement, and on the contrary, he expressed the opposite view on
multiple occasions that \"warning flags are still flying in the
communi¬cable disease field\" and that \"we cannot turn our backs on
microbiology.\"51 That the notion of emerging viruses was bestowed
official birth at exactly the same moment as the mythic invention of the
Stewart quotation, and by the same group of ascendant scientists,
intimates just how essential the fable of a benighted villain is to the
founding legitimacy of the infectious disease paradigm, as if the latter
must create its own dark prehistory to claim an epochal birthright.

Finally, if we trace the NIAID/NIH 1989 conference and its ideological
roots further back, we arrive at the Cold War as another vital scene of
pandemic dis¬course\'s emergence. Before Morse coined the term emerging
viruses, microbiolo¬gist Rene Dubos was the first to use emergence in
the 1950s to describe the behav¬ior of microbes. According to Dubos,
microbial evolution was far from stable or linear but radically
unpredictable and disruptive, and since humans are locked in an
unremitting coevolving ecology with microbes, there can be no final
overcom¬ing of them. Cooper sees in Dubos\'s germ theory \"an
alternative vision of warfare and a counterphilosophy of disease\" that
would ultimately culminate in the post- 9/11 biosecurity credo of
permanent, preemptive, speculative warfare.52 Along with his proteges,
Dubos developed models of disease ecology in these early years of the
Cold War.53 As Lakoff contends, this was the period of the decisive rise
of an \"ideology of preparedness\" in US politics and public health.
Toward the end of World War II, some [US military
strategists]{.underline} argued against demobilization, main¬taining
that the country needed to remain prepared to respond to new enemy
threats such as a nuclear attack. They [campaigned for \"military and
civilian readiness,]{.underline} in peacetime, [for an anticipated
future war,\" in effect projecting a state of \"permanent mobilization
for total war.\"]{.underline}54 This preparedness model was transferred
over to natural disaster management beginning in the mid-1950s, when
defense officials started to treat environmental disasters and modern
warfare as bearing \"a close affinity.\"55 [It]{.underline} also [led to
the founding]{.underline} in 1951 [of the CDC\'s]{.underline} Epidemic
Intelligence Service ([EIS)]{.underline} by Alexander Langmuir, the
father of infectious disease epidemiology and Henderson\'s mentor.
Langmuir [advocated an approach of \"hypervigilance\" against epidemics,
of \"continued watchfulness\" on a global scale, and]{.underline} he
proposed [a global network of centers that would provide around-
the-clock surveillance]{.underline} and early rapid detection for both
natural and unnatural outbreaks.56 Henderson\'s later template of global
disease surveillance was consciously modeled on Langmuir\'s. As he noted
in his essay for Morse\'s volume, the contemporary issue of infectious
disease surveillance is not unprecedented but had been raised \"at least
once before\"---in 1950, [at the start of the Korean War,]{.underline}
when [**fears of a biological attack**]{.underline} on civilian
[populations prompted the creation of the EIS.]{.underline}57 In this
essay, Henderson [vividly **resurrected the Cold War language of
permanent total war**, writing that \"the world is increasingly
interdependent, and .. . human health and survival will be challenged,
ad infinitum, by new and mutant microbes, with unpredictable
pathophysiological manifestations.\"]{.underline}58

The 1989 conference, then, had a direct lineage in Cold War
epidemiological frameworks, with its presiding scientists pushing for
not just a revival but permanent normalization of Cold War biosecurity
techniques. Again, this history is anchored in a US geopolitics in which
Asia figures repeatedly and strategically as the site of multiple forms
of potential biothreat, requiring exceptional modes of power to be
mobilized at home. Infectious disease discourse therefore epitomizes the
insufficient deimperialization of contemporary conditions of knowledge.
So far, I have used pandemic as a prism for a geopolitical archaeology.
Now I turn to pandemic as a method for diagnosing contemporary
bio-orientalism and tracing it to one particular historical formation.

Pandemic as Bio-orientalism

As a theory of the ways politics captures biological life into its
domain---as \"pow¬er\'s hold over life,\" in Michel Foucault\'s original
formulation, \"the acquisition of power over man insofar as man is a
livfng befng\"59---biopolitics seems ideally suited as a framework for
analyzing the operations of disease governance. Indeed, disease plays a
paradigmatic, one might say narratively indispensable, role in Fou-
cault\'s history of power. Most famously, the plague inaugurated for him
projects of disciplinary power, exemplified by mechanisms of panoptic
surveillance and control, but this plague template was also preceded by
leprosy\'s \"rituals of exclu¬sion.\" As Foucault underscored, different
diseases gave rise to different \"ways of exercisfng power over men\"
and different \"pofitfcal dream\[s\]\": \"The leper was caught up in a
practice of rejection, of exile-enclosure . . . those sick of the plague
were caught up in a meticulous tactical partitioning . . . the great
confinement on the one hand; the correct training on the other. The
leper and his separation; the plague and its segmentations.\"60 Yet, as
epidemics were superseded by endemics, \"illnesses that were difficult
to eradicate \... affecting a population\" as \"something permanent,\"
so too did sovereign and disciplinary power structures give way to a
contemporary \"\'biopolitics\' of the human race,\" represented by a
modern \"med¬icine whose main function will now be public hygiene, with
institutions to coor¬dinate medical care, centralize information, and
normalize knowledge.\"61 Later, Foucault would call this last type of
power security: where sovereignty excludes as in the case of leprosy and
discipline quarantines as in the case of plague, secu¬rity inoculates as
with smallpox.62 Each biopolitical moment has its correspond¬ing
disease. Philipp Sarasin calls this recurrent motif a minor \"trace of
infection\" in Foucault\'s writ ing,63 but we can flip the order of
priority here and postui ate that the history of Western disease
governance has been that which underlay the inception of contemporary
biopolitical theory.

To be sure, for later theorists, the most telling scenes of biopower
will change. For Giorgio Agamben\'s models of sovereign power and bare
life, the intractable historical prototype would be the Nazi death
camps; for Achille Mbembe\'s necro- power, slavery and colonialism; and
for Brian Massumi\'s ontopower, the post-9/11 War on Terror. What these
subsequent articulations make ever more visible is that [biopolitics
becomes conceptually relevant not merely when there exists a
politicization of any life but when the life to be excluded, surveilled,
disciplined, detained, stripped bare, subjugated, slain, or preempted
entails some form of otherness, whether racial, colonial, or
geopolitical.]{.underline} Yet biopolitical theories often take recourse
in an abstracted language of space, however real and acknowl­edged the
historical referents, whether it is Foucault\'s panopticon or \"spaces
of security\";64 Agamben\'s \"state of exception,\" \"zone of
indistinction,\" or \"camp as nomos\";65 or Massumi\'s
\"prototerritory.\"66 [**Mbembe** is]{.underline} perhaps most
[explicit]{.underline} and steadfast [in reversing this intellectual
movement from history to theory when he moves instead from imagined
geographies back to historically politicized ones.]{.underline} For him,
[the colony is \"the location par excellence\" for not just particular
vari­ants of biopolitics but also the accumulated operations of it: the
colony]{.underline}, as with the [plantation system and]{.underline} the
[apartheid regime, has been a consummate site for the \"concatenation of
biopower, the state of exception, and the state of siege.\"]{.underline}
[And \"crucial to this concatenation,\"]{.underline} he emphasizes, [is
\"race.\"]{.underline}67

Following Mbembe, I would suggest [that Asia, akin to the colony, has
been the rationale for]{.underline} the concatenation of [multiple
manifestations of Western bio- power]{.underline}; as such, it has
occupied a key place in the geopoiitical history, if not the conscious
theorizing, of biopolitics. As we saw, over the course of the past
century, [Asia has been]{.underline} variously and [strategically cited
within US discourses of infectious disease and biosecurity as the
threshold of bioterrorism as well as the biological other that justifies
preemptive biodefense.]{.underline} A more recent exam­ple of the nexus
between Asia and global biopolitics centers on the 2003 SARS epidemic.
As the new millennium\'s first pandemic, with its origins in southern
China[, SARS incited deep anxieties]{.underline} and fears [about
the]{.underline} contemporary world and its [breakdown of the boundary
between first-world health and third-world contagion.]{.underline}68 The
Chinese communist government\'s initial cover-up of the outbreak at home
[further fueled age-old orientalist tropes of China as the site of
exotic and unhygienic culinary traditions]{.underline} as well as
authoritarian secrecy, a lethal com­bination for global health
security.69 It was partly in the context of these orien­talist
perceptions that the WHO began to act routinely beyond its jurisdiction
in response to SARS, bypassing and sometimes overriding state
authorities to issue travel advisories, collecting disease data from
nonstate sources, and dissem­inating this information to other countries
without the consent of affected gov­ernments. Most controversial among
these measures was WHO\'s unprecedented global travel advisory for Hong
Kong and Guangdong, a move calculated not just to safeguard global
health but also to pressure the Chinese government into compliance. In
2005, the World Health Assembly would go on to revise the Inter­national
Health Regulations to formalize these powers for WHO and to grant it
additional authority, from everyday surveillance and intelligence
gathering to crisis management. David Fidler argues that [SARS radically
transformed global health governance into a \"post-Westphalian\"
paradigm, which centralizes med­ical authority and regulatory power on a
global scale more than ever before]{.underline}.70 If for Mbembe
colonialism and slavery are the historical forms of life that enact
theories of biopolitics, we might say [that bio-orientalism similarly
haunts global biopolitical history.]{.underline}

[Contemporary pandemic discourse further sustains this biopolitical
history. In popular culture as much as public health arenas, Asia is
frequently depicted as the birthplace of one wave of infectious disease
after another.]{.underline} A 2004 issue of Time magazine typifies this
bio-orientalist pandemic imagination: the cover image shows a giant egg
about to be hatched, with a bird\'s beak poking through a crack in the
shell, while the headline poses the ominous question, \"Bird Flu: Is
Asia hatching the next human pandemic?\" As the article goes on to
assert, the avian flu was the \"latest scourge to emerge from Asia.\"
Barely a year after the containment of SARS, the bird flu was already
\"spreading with alarming speed through Asia\'s poultry farms,\" with
outbreaks in South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand. Though the virus
was not yet virulent among humans, \"the great fear of health officials
around the world is that the virus could, like SARS, jump the species
barrier, mutate into a deadly and highly contagious form and set off a
worldwide pandemic.\" This \"next deadly global epidemic\" would be what
epidemiologists call \"a slate wiper,\" but what endangers the world is
not just the virus itself but \"dissembling and stalling by local
governments \[that\] have already allowed the pathogen to spread in
Asia---not only in birds but also among the men and women who raise them
for a living and the kids who gather eggs or simply kick up infected
dust in their vill ages.\"71 Given the combination of Asia\'s dishonest
and corrupt governments, the poor hygiene and general level of medical
ignorance of its rural residents, as well as the rapidity of
international travel enabled by globalization, Asia stands to jeopardize
public health the world over. The expertise of health officials and
epidemiologists is summoned, and even the experts, the article declares,
are afraid. As Priscilla Wald has demonstrated, [cultural narratives of
disease outbreaks follow formulaic conventions, one of which is a
\"geography of disease\" where \"timeless, brooding Africa or Asia\" is
imagined as \"the birthplace of humanity, civilization, and deadly
microbes.\" Infectious diseases are constructed as third-world problems
\"leaking\" into the global North]{.underline}, in a one-way traffic of
emergence.72 [The underlying message of the pandemic orientalist
narrative seems to be that, while we may lament the loss of Asian lives
to deadly microbes, we should not slacken our vigilance toward Asian
bodies precisely because they may host those microbes---if not every
single body in actuality, then the collective Asian body in
potential.]{.underline}

In the early weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States,
President Trump put out many mixed messages, but he remained consistent
with one---that [China was to blame for the]{.underline} spread of [the
virus]{.underline}. Repeatedly, he insisted on [calling]{.underline} the
novel [corona]{.underline}virus ["the Chinese virus,"]{.underline}
despite mounting public criticism against the racialization of the
deadly pathogen. Many noted the inflammatory nature of this anti-Asian
rhetoric. During this same period, [reports ranging from verbal
**abuse** to intimidation to **physical assault** against people of
Asian descent documented the sudden rise of anti-Asian **hate crimes**
in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
globally]{.underline}. According to Human Rights Watch, [an Asian woman
in Brooklyn]{.underline}, New York, [suffered a racially motivated
**acid attack**]{.underline}, and in Texas, [a Burmese American man and
his two children were **stabbed** by a man who claimed he thought the
family was "Chinese and infecting people with the
coronavirus."]{.underline}1 The [A]{.underline}sian
[P]{.underline}acific [P]{.underline}olicy and Planning Council in the
United States [reported over **one thousand cases** of anti-Asian
incidents **in a two-week period**]{.underline} in March 2020.2 Outside
the United States, [a Singaporean student]{.underline} in the United
Kingdom [was violently **kicked** and **punched** by an angry group of
men]{.underline} after they uttered, "we don't want your coronavirus in
our country" (my emphasis).3 [In Australia, a survey]{.underline} taken
by the community group Asian Australian Alliance [recorded]{.underline}
a total of 178 [reports of anti-Asian incidents]{.underline} in two
weeks, [ranging from **racial slurs** to **physical
assault.**]{.underline}4 Though President Trump has dropped the "Chinese
virus" for "kung flu" and tweeted on March 23 that "It is very important
that we totally protect our Asian American community . . . the spreading
of the virus is NOT their fault," it seems that Sinophobia and racial
violence against Asian Americans have been unleashed.

Make no mistake, as long as President Trump continues to take a
confrontational stance, using the **[rhetoric of blame against
China]{.underline}** with the intention to punish it with new sanctions,
tariffs, and even the cancellation of U.S. debt obligations,5 the
**[racial aggressions against Asian Americans will continue to
rise,]{.underline}** if not intensify. By now, it is widely accepted
that the novel coronavirus emerged first in Wuhan, and scientists
believe that the zoonotic disease might have jumped from animals to
humans at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market where
vegetables, seafood, meat, and a small number of exotic wildlife were
sold. Despite this, on April 30, President Trump casually offered a new
theory, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: that COVID had
originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which houses a biosafety
level-4 lab, and that the virus might have "leaked" from that lab. The
implicit suggestion is that China had either intentionally bioengineered
the novel coronavirus to cause massive destruction, thereby attributing
malice, or carelessly leaked the virus due to scientific negligence,
thereby attributing incompetence. In either case, these kinds of
unsubstantiated [speculations work to further stoke anger and disdain
against the Chinese state.]{.underline} More disturbingly, [they traffic
in the idea of China as a biotechnology threat, resonating with
pre-existing filmic representations of futuristic dystopian
worlds.]{.underline}

The immediate and unqualified responses from the scientific community
reveal the danger of these potentially incendiary speculations.
Responding swiftly, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
issued a press release the morning of April 30 stating that "The
Intelligence Community . . . concurs with the wide scientific consensus
that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified . . . "
(my emphasis).6 Within days, the director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, attested that the
virus "could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated."7
These assertions sought to extinguish any attribution of malice to the
Chinese state. Even with firm contestation, however, **[the very
invocation of]{.underline}** the idea of **[biotechnology warfare
has]{.underline}** tapped into and perhaps even **[fueled]{.underline}**
our existing **[techno-Orientalist anxieties.]{.underline}**

[As the COVID pandemic story transpires in real time, engulfing the
entire global community, taking unexpected twists and turns, making
divergences and transgressions,]{.underline} we have become increasingly
aware that the layers of entanglements cannot be easily parsed out, nor
will we know anytime soon how and when the story will end. [We offer a
query into how we might assess and make sense of the intensifying
Sinophobia and xenophobia in this current context. To do so, we must
resist the temptation to confine our analysis to the narrow parameters
of the pandemic.]{.underline} Rather, [we insist on examining the rise
of anti-Asian aggression within the]{.underline} concomitant [vectors of
the **pandemic, the**]{.underline} escalation of the U.S.-China **[trade
war, and]{.underline}** the growing [**concerns about cyber- and
techno-security.**]{.underline} Here we assert that the **[ideology of
yellow peril set within a techno-Orientalist imaginary is powerfully
animating the racial form and racial affect mediating the multiple
terrains of public health, technology, global trade, and national
security.]{.underline}** While it is tempting to treat this historical
conjuncture as extraordinary, [it is crucial that we situate the current
unfolding within the long history of Asian racialization]{.underline},
one that indexes the abiding tension between the political impetus to
define national belonging and the shifting economic imperatives of the
nation-state.8

### Link -- Hegemony

circling]{.underline} over Washington, DC, flying [low to

[While the spread of]{.underline} popular [uprisings against police

truth, we will continue to fail to actually address]{.underline}** the
institutionalized and **[structural racism that has led to decade after
decade of]{.underline}** state **[violence against Black
people]{.underline}** in this country and people of color **[around the
world.]{.underline}**

In the United States, this dehumanization has its roots in the founding
of our country. The [prosperity]{.underline} the white majority in the
United States enjoys today [cannot be divorced from the genocide of
Indigenous people and]{.underline} the [enslavement]{.underline} of
Africans, all for the economic benefit of white colonizers. **[The
violent domination of the white colonial project and its basis in
exploitation and white saviorism not only defined the foundations of
early US society, but is echoed today here at home, and in US foreign
policy.]{.underline}**

For decades, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates military [has
used many of the same tactics abroad that are used against Black and
brown people by police]{.underline} in the United States. **[The use of
force is never a last resort, but instead the preferred tool to ensure
submission. Local conditions, individual experiences, and other
drivers]{.underline}** to violence, dissent, or crime -- often rooted in
governance failure, human rights abuses, and economic and/or political
disenfranchisement -- **[are ignored.]{.underline}** Instead, a more
pernicious, dangerous motive is assigned to all members of subjugated
groups once one individual decides to resort to violence or commit a
crime.

**[A violent response is then justified in cloaked language
about]{.underline}** patriotism, **[security]{.underline}**, and
saviorism. The United States military is undertaking [dangerous missions
against]{.underline} "extremists" [to "save"]{.underline} the Afghan
people, [to "secure freedom]{.underline}" for Iraqis; just as in the
United States police are keeping the streets of the US "safe," tracking
"extremists" that threaten the status quo and private property. As the
experience of the past several weeks has shown, however, **[violence
from the oppressive force ultimately begets more
defiance.]{.underline}** **[The idea that violence can quell dissension
is ultimately rooted in the orientalist, racist belief that non-white
people are inherently threats that must ultimately be silenced in order
for stability to take hold.]{.underline}**

The US government's use of [force is continuously justified by its
stated intention to create safety --- but safety for whom? Surely not
the **countless innocents killed in endless wars** abroad]{.underline},
the **[diaspora communities surveilled, or]{.underline}** the **[Black
people murdered]{.underline}** by police here **[at home]{.underline}**.
The Trump administration's current **[militarized
response]{.underline}** to the popular uprisings sweeping the country
**[is merely an outgrowth of long-standing policies that have devalued
Black and brown lives,]{.underline}** and ignored the unique injustices
and inequities these communities face in achieving safety, well-being,
and liberation. The post-9/11 police state and outdated slavery-era laws
merely provide useful levers for Trump to pull in the face of this new
challenge to his power.

If people in power continue to see these latest instances of violence
and repression as isolated, unfortunate instances that "don't reflect
who we are as a nation," then we will have failed to truly challenge and
disrupt the forces and systems at play that have allowed [white
supremacy]{.underline} to [infiltrate]{.underline} every aspect of US
public life, including [foreign policy.]{.underline}

The solution is not merely to end the transfer of US military weaponry
and equipment to police departments, even though this is an incredibly
important, short-term reform. [The solution lies in a larger
awakening]{.underline} in this country and a willingness to confront the
systemic racism and white supremacy that drives our government's
engagement domestically and abroad. **[It means accepting that our
current policies empower and export white supremacist
violence.]{.underline}** **[It starts with divesting from the
institutions whose primary purpose is to terrorize people of color at
home and abroad to maintain white supremacy]{.underline}** -- the
Pentagon, CBP and ICE, state and municipal police. It begins with
investment in restorative and community solutions to conflict and
violence that seek to uplift individuals from poverty, ensure and value
the rights and dignity of every human being, and make amends for past
injustices.

The celebration of [NATO's 70 years of existence provides]{.underline}
another [opportunity to unearth the real history of the ideas, practices
and destruction wrought by this military alliance. Even
with]{.underline} the clear [exposure of the cooperation between NATO,
the CIA and the British MI6 to spread terror and psychological
warfare]{.underline} in Europe immediately after the formation of this
military alliance, the [mainstream media, academics and policy makers
remain silent on]{.underline} activities of the 'stay behind armies' and
['false flag' operations that distorted the real causes of
insecurity]{.underline} in the world after 1945. The evidence of the
manipulations of the peoples of the world to ensure the continued
survival of NATO has been well documented in the fraudulent
interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the present multiple
wars against the peoples of Iran. Vijay Prashad had [identified NATO as
the prime defender of]{.underline} the Atlantic project. This Atlantic
project, he noted was, "a fairly straightforward campaign by the
[propertied classes]{.underline} to maintain or restore their [position
of dominance]{.underline}." This Atlantic Project was anchored in the
military alliance called NATO with its principal work, that of reversing
the South Project; the struggles for peace bread and justice by the
poorer citizens of the planet, especially those who had emerged on the
world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.
[The ostensive reason for **the founding of NATO was to 'thwart' Soviet
aggression, but in practice the organization was a prop for western
capital** and]{.underline} after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the
core prop for [Wall Street]{.underline}. In this year, there will be
many commentaries on the fact that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold
War relic, that NATO is obsolete and lost its mandate, but very few will
link the expansion of NATO to the military management of the
international system. Prior to 1991, the planners of NATO could justify
the existence of NATO on ideological and political grounds, but with the
threat of a multi polar world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO
expanded to the point where this author joined with others in labelling
this organization Global NATO to reflect its current imperial mandate.
[The Global thrust of NATO now comprises 29 members from Europe and
North America along with 41 'partners' that had started off under the
banner of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council]{.underline} (NACC) in
1991. [Since that time, NATO has launched a lengthy war without end in
Afghanistan, colluded in the destruction of Iraq and conspired with
militarists to forge 'Partnership for Peace']{.underline}
([with]{.underline} most **[members of the former Warsaw Pact
states]{.underline}**). The core 29 members are now enmeshed with
treaties and undertakings from states involved in the Mediterranean
Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and
United Arab Emirates. There are also [the 'partners' from across the
globe: Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan]{.underline}. This enlargement
[served the military purposes of encircling China and
Russia]{.underline} who military planners in the West targeted. There is
no shortage of literature on NATO and its milestones, but very [few have
documented the real crimes of this **global network of anticommunist
operatives who precipitated real terror and psychological
warfare**]{.underline} against the citizens of Europe and North America
[while supporting]{.underline} mass [atrocities from Algeria to
Indonesia]{.underline}, and South Africa. Books such as that of NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by
Danielle Ganser and The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and
Their Secret World War, by Stephen Kinzer used rigorous research
techniques to uncover the dark history of NATO. These two books can be
distinguished from the bland international relations texts that
discusses NATO inside the old calculations of 'strategy,' 'concert of
democracies', 'security cooperation' and the balance of power,' and
spheres of influence. Most recently, this IR rendering of the history of
NATO has been served up in a document entitled, NATO at Seventy: An
Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard University with one of the
coauthors being a former US ambassador to NATO. This document spelt out
ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a testimony before Congress, Nicolas
Burns boiled down the challenge of NATO to one objective; that the
current role of NATO must be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On the
day before the actual 70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to a joint session of the US
Congress advocating an expansion of the alliance while promoting a
military buildup against Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have
to reflect deeply on whether the current sanctions regime and the
special propose vehicle called the Instrument in Support of Trade
Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of inter imperialist
rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the
[shifting alliances yielded confusion among **working peoples who
ultimately went to fight against each other** in Europe, spreading
barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima.]{.underline} The continued struggles for bread, peace and
justice ensure that it is only the authoritarian leaders from the Global
South who are compromised on the real meaning of the existence of NATO.
In the present era, [there is a new capitalist competition
while]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as **an integral part of the Pentagon's
world command structure**.]{.underline} Recent experiences have
demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that [the moguls of Wall
Street are willing to **wage as many wars, to destroy as many countries
and to kill as many people as necessary to achieve the dominance of US
capitalism**. The destruction of Libya was a classic example of the
**convergence of finance as warfare, the weaponization of information
and incessant bombing to destroy a society**.]{.underline} Where at the
start of NATO the war scare was the propaganda method, [In
the]{.underline} current [digital age, **brain hacking and the
engineering of smart phones** have placed]{.underline} the [giant
technology firms]{.underline} of Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
Facebook [at the forefront of the new weapons platform of NATO and Wall
Street.]{.underline} This analysis is in three parts spelling out the
rationale for the call for all progressive forces to join together to
concentrate their energies in the dismantling of NATO. NATO at Birth:
Stay behind armies, directed terrorist organizations and psychological
warfare against Europeans. In the period after the fall of the Berlin
Wall there were major press reports on the role of NATO's stay behind
armies that had been operating inside Western Europe since 1949.Ten
years earlier, when [the kidnapping and killing of the former Italian
Prime Minister, Aldo Moro]{.underline} rocked western Europe, it emerged
that his demise [had been authored by]{.underline} clandestine
paramilitary network code-named ["Operation Gladio"]{.underline} that
was a false flag operation of NATO. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had
meticulously documented how [NATO funded and often even **directed
terrorist organizations throughout Europe in what was termed a "strategy
of tension" with the aim of preventing a rise of the left** in Western
European politics]{.underline}. NATO's "secret armies" engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. In the specific
case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the unforgivable crime of
contemplating a government that included Italians who belonged to the
Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the Cold war, [the **CIA
and MI6 had worked closely with former fascists** to oppose]{.underline}
citizens and [organizations]{.underline} in Western Europe [that were
anti-capitalists]{.underline}. Under the leadership of US planners such
as Allen Dulles, William Colby, Frank Wisner and later James Angleton,
these operatives weaned and nursed a network of agents and secret arms
dumps across Europe, a network that would remain secret but active
throughout the Cold War. \[4\] Ganser elaborated on the extensive
operations of Operation Gladio all across Europe with the explicit aim
of subverting the democratic wishes of European citizens who were
opposed to oppression. It is worth quoting at length the role of the
secret armies. ["NATO's "secret armies"]{.underline} engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. [In
Turkey]{.underline} in 1960, the stay behind army, working with the
army, [staged a coup d'état and killed Prime Minister]{.underline} Adnan
[Menderes; in Algeria]{.underline} in 1961, the French stay-behind army
[staged a coup]{.underline} with the CIA against the French government
of Algiers, [which ultimately failed;]{.underline} in 1967, [the Greek
stay-behind army staged a coup and imposed a military
dictatorship]{.underline}; in 1971 in [Turkey]{.underline}, [after a
military coup]{.underline}, the stay-behind army [engaged in "domestic
terror" and killed hundreds]{.underline}; in 1977 [in Spain, the stay
behind army carried out a massacre in Madrid]{.underline}; in 1980 in
Turkey, the head of the stay behind army staged a coup [and]{.underline}
took power; in 1985 [in Belgium, the stay behind attacked and shot
shoppers randomly in supermarkets]{.underline}, killing 28; in
Switzerland in 1990, the former head of the Swiss stay behind wrote the
US Defense Department he would reveal "the whole truth," and was found
the next day stabbed to death with his own bayonet; and in 1995, England
revealed that the MI6 and SAS helped set up stay behind armies across
Western Europe."\[5\] The mainstream media and University commentaries
have not been able to confront this history in so far as the
manipulation and deception that gave rise to the birth of NATO is still
at work against the citizens of Europe and the United States. War Scare,
NATO and psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe and North
America. [At the end of World War II, the defense Industries in the USA
had been faced with the choice of conversion and retooling]{.underline}
the [factories that made weapons or continue]{.underline} the [massive
subsidies for]{.underline} the [industries vested in
military]{.underline} and armaments [production. The choice
was]{.underline} eventually made to [embark on]{.underline} [**a
propaganda war scare to justify the need for an expanded army** and it
was in this context when NATO was conceived. To sustain the WW II
armaments enterprise, there needed to be **a cycle of war scare and the
fabrication and inflation of threats and enemies**.]{.underline} It was
in this context that Lawrence D. Bell, President of Bell Aircraft
Corporation, in a statement to [the U.S. Air Policy
Commission]{.underline} Finletter Commission) on September 29, 1947,
[stated that "**as soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money
available**."]{.underline} \[6\] According to Andrew Cockburn, "The
aircraft corporations that had garnered enormous profits during the war
on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that peace
was ruinous. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was
proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of
wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by
the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never
lived up to expectations, while efforts to diversify into other
products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved
disappointing and costly." \[7\] [In]{.underline} the spring of [1948,
the U.S. Secretary of Defense]{.underline} James Forrestal and top
officials of the Harry Truman administration [began to sound alarm about
a looming Soviet attack against Western Europe. It is]{.underline} now
[known]{.underline}, [from declassified documents, that the **officials
were aware that there was no credible evidence**]{.underline} to back up
their war scare. Some analysts have argued that the war scare of 1948
was devised to save the aircraft manufacturing industry from plunging
into bankruptcy. And this goal was achieved. In the book Harry S. Truman
and the War Scare of 1948, Frank Kofsky states thatwithin 2 months of
the emergence of the scare, the Trumanadministration revamped the
aircraft industry by embarking on a 57% increase in purchase of military
aircraft, and the total budget of the Pentagon was increased by 30%.
[NATO was born]{.underline} on April 4, 1949 [out of this propaganda war
to deceive the US citizens about a pending attack of the Soviet
Union]{.underline} on Western Europe. [The task of organizing the
deception]{.underline} of the citizens of the West [was assigned to the
C]{.underline}entral [I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency.
There are now so many books and articles on the role of the CIA in
deception, propaganda and psychological warfare that we will not spend a
great deal of time on the role of the Covert agencies in giving
legitimacy to the idea of a Soviet threat. Stephen Kinzer and David
Talbot are two writers who have documented extensively how the Dulles
brothers ensnared every major profession in the USA in this deception.
\[8\] It was especially chilling how **[Universities were suborned to be
surrogates for this psychological warfare]{.underline}**. Noam Chomsky
has dealt with this aspect of the period of the birth of NATO in the
work on the Universities and the Cold War.\[9\] Racists and
anticommunists in the propaganda war It was not by accident that [the
thinkers and **planners of these secret operations were known racists
and Nazi sympathizers**.]{.underline} Frank Wisner who hailed from
Mississippi in the USA was a good example of the upright US citizen who
was an architect of the false flag operations and the deception
associated with NATO and western intelligence agencies. After the War,
in 1948 Frank Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special
Projects. Soon afterwards under the direction of Allen Dulles, this
Office of Special Projects was renamed [the]{.underline} Office of
Policy Coordination (OPC). This became the [espionage and
counter-intelligence branch of the C]{.underline}entral
[I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency. Later James Jesus
Angleton was to take this brand of counter intelligence work to the
highest levels of state assassinations. Wisner [had been
mandated]{.underline} told [to create]{.underline} an organization that
concentrated on ["propaganda, economic warfare; preventive direct
action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation
measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to
underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist
elements in threatened countries of the free world."]{.underline} It was
from this opaque sounding name of Office of Policy Coordination where
the brainwashing and virulent anti-communism of the Cold War era was
refined. Evan Thomas reported in The Very Best Men: the Daring Early
Days of the CIA, the OPC's charter gave it responsibility for
"propaganda, economic warfare; preventative direct action, including
sabotage, antisabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion
against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance
groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened
countries of the free world." NATO as the principal prop for
international capitalism today.

\[15\] Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal deepened their links to
NATO but in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower halted the planned offensive of the
British and the French in the Suez war. After this war, both the
currencies of Britain and France suffered sharp declines with France
seeking cover inside the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), while
the British pound accepted its place as a prop to the US dollar in the
global economy. Within a year after the Suez debacle, France had pushed
for the Treaty of Rome that paved the way for the European Economic
Community to be a competitive force with US capitalists. Within the
context of the competition between European capitalists and US
capitalists, Charles De Gaulle exhibited pique at the organization of
NATO that supported the armaments culture of US capital. Charles De
Gaulle partially pulled France out of this alliance in 1966 after it
became clear that this military organization was dominated by the United
States and Britain (supporting their military industries). De Gaulle
argued for an independent nuclear arsenal while remaining a signatory to
North Atlantic Treaty and participating in the North Atlantic Council.
Nicholas Sarkozy ended the farce when France returned to the fold of the
NATO military structures in 2009. The duplicitous actions on the part of
the French leadership were always based on calculations meant to
preserve the dominance of French capital in Africa. When the US devalued
the dollar in 1971 and broke the agreements of the Bretton Woods Treaty,
it was the French who complained about the Exorbitant Privilege of the
Dollar. For a short period, both the President of France and the
Chancellor of West Germany had chafed under the privilege and had worked
hard to bring into being the Maastricht Treaty and the Europe Union to
end the dominance of the dollar in the international capitalist system.
It was known than the one necessary aspect of this emerging common
currency in Europe would be the dismantling of the military occupation
of Europe by US military personnel. Hence, both Giscard de Estaing and
Helmut Schmidt had linked the common currency, the European Central Bank
and common foreign and security policy (CFSP), with the expectation that
ultimately Europe will break from the traditions of NATO. It was in the
face of this threat and the fall of the centrally planned economy that
the forward planners expanded NATO. Emergence of Global NATO and the
myth of 'humanitarian intervention' [Usually, when an alliance is formed
for a specific purpose such as halting the spread of communism, that
alliance is folded when the mission is complete.]{.underline} Hence,
after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was expected by those
seeking the 'peace dividend' that the mission of NATO would be scaled
down. [Instead, NATO expanded, seeking to encircle Russia by extending
its membership to include former members of the Warsaw Pact
countries.]{.underline} Progressive scholars have documented the
cynicism of the **[US military planners who orchestrated the
'humanitarian intervention' in the Balkans in order to advance the
hegemony of US capitalism]{.underline}** [after the fall of the Soviet
Union.]{.underline} The scholarship on this manipulation of the European
working peoples to entrench NATO is rich and needs to be revisited at
this moment of the celebration of the 70thanniversary of the founding of
NATO. Richard Aldrich in the book, The Hidden Hand: Britain, America and
Cold War Secret Intelligence' brought out evidence to expose how the
massacres in the Balkans, helped give a new impetus to US hegemony.'
\[16\] David Gibbs had argued, "How the Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US
Foreign Policy." It is worth quoting at length how the Balkans war was
used to manipulate public opinion in Europe, "Perhaps most importantly,
the massacre helped give a new impetus to US hegemony, contributing to
its post-Cold War legitimacy. In bolstering America's hegemonic
position, the significance of [the Srebrenica massacre]{.underline}
cannot be overstated: The massacre [helped trigger a NATO bombing
campaign that is]{.underline} widely [credited with ending the Bosnian
war]{.underline}, along with the associated atrocities, and this
campaign gave NATO a new purpose for the post-Soviet era. Since that
time, the Srebrenica precedent has been continuously invoked as a
justification for military force. [The **perceived need to prevent
massacres and oppression helped justify later interventions in Kosovo,
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya**, as well as the ongoing fight against
ISIS.]{.underline} The recent UN doctrine of Responsibility to Protect,
which contains a strongly interventionist tone, was inspired in part by
the memory of Srebrenica." \[17\] The more nefarious aspect of this
manipulation of humanitarianism was the ways in which elements such as
Bernard Kouchner used their credentials as former members of the left
and progressive forces to give cover to US imperialism. Since the war in
the Balkans it is now accepted by the military planners that
humanitarian intervention acts as a force multiplier. \[18\] This
position was explicitly stated by General Colin Powell who noted, "Just
as surely as our diplomats and military, American NGOs are out there
serving and sacrificing on the front lines of freedom NGOs are such a
force multiplier for us, such an important part of our combat team."
These observations can shed light on the relationship between NGOs such
as Doctors without Borders and the International Rescue Committee in
global militarism. The fiction of collective western security was
effectively broken while [after the Asian economic crisis, US capital
mobilized NATO to defend Wall Street.]{.underline} In this defense of
Wall Street, [**NATO incessantly bombed Kosovo for 79 days** in 1999 as
it gave itself a new mission to enlarge US military power right up to
the doorstep of Moscow.]{.underline} Gingerly, NATO expanded under US
President Bill Clinton from 12 members to 16, then to 19, then to 26 by
2004 and by 2009 to 28 members. Despite vocal opposition from Russia,
[the discussion of expanding NATO now proceeded to develop the idea of
Global NATO]{.underline}. In 2019 there were 29 members of NATO. In his
presentation before the US Congress Stoltenberg advocated for a further
expansion of NATO and boasted of the high state of readiness of the NATO
Response Force (NRF) which had been created in 2002. NATO and the
Weaponization of finance **[Global NATO was the preeminent force to
orchestrate the weaponization of everything.]{.underline}** Michael
Hudson has [outlined]{.underline} finance as warfare and [the
weaponization of finance in the current phase of
imperialism.]{.underline} It will be important to grasp the present
sanctions regime of the USA as a form of warfare. In the current
literature on imperialism, the term weaponization of finance refers to
the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital
markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive
diplomacy. The [multiple wars agains Iran represent a model example of
the **weaponization of finance, the weaponization of information and the
weaponization of trade**.]{.underline} Under the Presidency of Barack
Obama,Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, noted that the weaponization of
finance offers to the US "a new battlefield...one that enables \[the
US\] to go after those who wish \[the US\] harm without putting \[US\]
troops in harm's way or using lethal force." Instead of fighting
countries militarily, the US can now "cripple them financially. The
Obama administration had retreated from a full scale weaponization of
finance with Iran by signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA ) with Iran in 2015. Under the terms of this agreement in Vienna
on 14 July 2015 between Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council---China, France, Russia, United
Kingdom, United States---plus Germany),\[a\] and the European Union, it
was agreed that Iran would accept the P5+1 would ensure that Iran did
not develop nuclear weapons. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel had opposed
this agreement. When Donald Tromp became President of the United States,
his administration renounced the JCPOA in 2018 and then signed an
executive order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that
continues to do business with Iran. The order gave companies 90-day or
180-day grace periods to extract themselves from existing Iranian
contacts or face punitive US measures. Those NATO partners of the USA
who signed the JCPOA refused to accept the sanctions imposed on Iran and
in 2019 agreed to create a special purpose vehicle to manage their trade
with Iran. Britain, Germany and France rolled out INSTEX in February
2019 as one way to break the weaponization of Finance by the USA but in
the cat and mouse game of economic warfare, the Foreign Ministers of
Europe have not yet been transparent on the full mandate of the special
purpose vehicle. These developments mirror the weaponization of trade
\[19\] and finance within NATO and the problems of inter imperialist
rivalry in West Asia. The threats against the countries that created a
special purpose vehicle (SPV) to help facilitate trade with Iran must be
taken very seriously, especially in the context of the political
insecurity generated by BREXIT. This period reminds the world that of
the depression when trade wars and currency wars eventually fueled open
fighting in World War II. Finance as warfare [Since the global financial
crisis of 2008-2009, there have been efforts by countries holding US
debt to limit their exposure to the dollar. In 2009, the Russians and
the Chinese worked to establish]{.underline} an alternative
international institution involving Brazil, Russia, India and China,
later including South Africa and called [BRICS]{.underline}. Within the
context of BRICS, the Chinese set about a slow process to
internationalize its currency, the RMB and undertook currency swaps to
avoid the US dollar. After failing to negotiate successfully within the
Bretton Woods institution for an increase of its drawing rights
commensurate with its volume of international trade, the Chinese
embarked on major economic and financial ventures under the banner of
One Belt One Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. When the
AIIB was launched in 2015 with 57 countries, the former Treasury
Secretary of the US, Lawrence Summers noted that the launch of the AIIB
was a turning point and 'the creation of the AIIB will undermine the
leadership role the U.S. has long enjoyed in global finance.' Both
Russia and China intensified their swap trading efforts and Russia
settled its crude sales to China. "In March 2018 news broke that Beijing
is planning a pilot project for the second half of the year to pay for
imported crude oil with renminbi instead of dollars. The two countries
allegedly selected for the pilot are Russia and Angola, with rumors that
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may become involved. If this
venture is successful, it will act as a spur to similar schemes for
other imports and primary products." China was joining the leaders of
Europe and the countries in Asia and West Asia who were calling for a
multi-currency financial system. Many progressive economists noted that
it was not a matter if more countries would flee the dollar, but when.
One economist writing from Singapore wrote, "the emergence of a
multicurrency or multi-asset international payments system will take
time. It doesn't portend a collapse of the global payments system, but
does point to a redistribution of global wealth. The seigniorage
harvested by the US as the world's banker will gradually fall, narrowing
the room for maneuver in US economic policy, which for the last 70 years
has had the greatest influence on markets globally. As the power of the
dollar wanes, the US will be pressured to adjust to a world economy
vastly changed since 1945." \[20\] The German financial leaders along
with France were maneuvering to speed this change with the establishment
of the special purpose vehicle to continue trading with Iran. At this
time of writing the specific details of the specific purpose vehicle
called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) is still
being worked out, but the statements of former Ambassador Nicholas Burns
before Congress on March 26 made it clear that the Foreign Policy
establishment in the USA will not retreat from the weaponization of
Finance, especially since INSTEX allows members of NATO to continue
trading and financial arrangements with Iran, China and Russia. In so
far as Global NATO is serving the task of defending the dollar, the
extent to which China has created an alternative clearing system in the
Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) will be seen as another
blow to US financial hegemony. Although in its first rollout of the CIPS
system, the Chinese went to great length that it would cooperate with
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
system, the current US intelligence war against the Chinese telecom firm
Huawei point to the integration between Finance, information warfare and
cyberwarfare. \[21\] In the book, The Perfect Weapon, David Sanger
discussed the debates within this highest levels of US intelligence and
the Federal Reserve of whether the USA should use its Federal Reserve
and cyber warfare to backdoor into the Russian Central Bank to make
money disappear. It is in this context where one can note in the
planning of NATO strengthening the cyber capabilities is at the top of
the Agenda. The Harvard study emphasized the importance of winning the
Technology Battle in the Digital Age. [The convergence of cyberwarfare,
economic warfare and information warfare is being taken to new levels
under the current administration with its wide ranging sanctions against
countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.]{.underline}
Traditional books on NATO had surveyed the integration of diplomacy,
sanctions and weapons procurement, but [the new push of the USA in
formulating its position of unrivalled dominance is turning out to be
another front for defending the dollar. In a world where the USA had
imposed sanctions on Cuba, Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Turkey, North
Korea, Syria, Sudan along with individual sanctions against individuals
in Somalia, South Sudan, Libya, Ukraine and Zimbabwe, the logic of these
sanctions]{.underline} enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) of the US Treasury has [now clarified to]{.underline} the allies
of the USA in [NATO the importance finance was warfare.]{.underline} It
was the former Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, who had warned that the
over use of sanctions could dull their effectiveness. His logic was
simple: Sanctions work because they cut targets off from dealing with
U.S. citizens and American financial institutions---a complete severance
from the world's largest economy and its most important financial
center. If Washington used this power idly, Lew suggested, it could
encourage countries to find partners outside of the United States, and
undermine sanctions' deterrent effect. [What Lew did not acknowledge was
**the relationship between the Treasury, Global NATO and the financial
wars**.]{.underline} Much of the scholarship on the printing of dollars
miss the way in which the infusion of capital in emerging economies
further enmesh these societies into the instability of the system.
Ultimately, the export of the oscillation of the US economy deepens
social and political challenges on the world and reinforces the
militarization of the international political economy. Michael Hudson
outlined three ways in which flooding of dollars through debt leverage
and QE supported the military: (1) the surplus dollars pouring into the
rest of the world for yet further financial speculation and corporate
takeovers; (2) the fact that central banks are obliged to recycle these
dollar inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the federal U.S.
budget deficit; and most important (but most suppressed in the U.S.
media, (3) the military character of the U.S. payments deficit and the
domestic federal budget deficit. He continued, "Strange as it may seem
and irrational as it would be in a more logical system of world
diplomacy the "dollar glut" is what finances America's global military
build-up. It forces foreign central banks to bear the costs of America's
expanding military empire effective "taxation without representation."
Keeping international reserves in "dollars" means recycling their dollar
inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bills U.S. government debt issued largely
to finance the military." After the financial crisis in Europe,
Quantitative Easing was extended to the Eurozone and Japan, but in the
continuing re alignment, of global capitalism, US capital is working
hard to decapitate Russia and China as opponents of Global NATO. [The
currency wars and weaponization of finance is now accompanied by the
weaponization of trade and the weaponization of
information.]{.underline} Sanger's The Perfect Weapon War, Sabotage, and
Fear in the Cyber Agehas opened one window into how [**full spectrum
dominance** and the militarization of space is now linked to the
**weaponization of information and cognitive hacking**. We now have new
terms of warfare, terms such as "fake news", "disinformation,"
"weaponized information," "post-truth" and "alternative
facts."]{.underline} Weaponized information (WI) [defines a new method
messaging and dissemination of content that contains falsehoods, facts
taken out of context and pieces of truth strategically released, in an
attempt **to manipulate knowledge and beliefs**.]{.underline} The NATO
destruction of Libya was one clear example of how falsehoods were
refined to lull workers in Europe to support the destruction of Libya
The weaponization of Finance and the Destruction of Libya [Not enough is
being done to expose the real role of Global NATO and the role of so
called humanitarian operatives in ensuring that humanitarian
interventions become a force multiplier.]{.underline} Currently, many
countries of the EU collaborate with France in the North African region
in the fabrication of terror to ensure the deployment of the US Africa
Command and French forces in Africa. [In Western Europe, NATO has been
very successful in ensuring confusion, demoralization,]{.underline}
paralysis, [and apathy in relation to western imperialism in
Africa.]{.underline} African scholars and progressives are very clear
that while calling for the dismantling of NATO there must be a call for
the EURO to break from the CFA franc zone. Nicolas Sarkozy was very
clear that the intervention in Libya was to save the Euro. Africans
cannot have a Newtonian view of the struggle against imperialism to
assure those from the European left who want solidarity with Africans
while supporting French imperialism in Africa. Global NATO and French
machinations are involved in a delicate dance and there is silence from
the left in the EU when it comes to Europe's 4000 km strategic radius
that covers the entire area of West Africa, North Africa and down
through East Africa to Somalia. It is beyond this commentary to
delineate the ways in which German scholars, religious organizations,
German foundations and non-governmental organizations are now implicated
in the criminal acts of France in Africa, especially the war on terror.
It is the task of the progressive movement to penetrate the areas of
cooperation and conflict between European capitalists and Wall Street so
that European workers do not continue to complicity support
'humanitarian interventions.' [When 200 African scholars wrote the open
letter on the impending crime against the peoples of Libya, there has
been and continue to be **silence on the part of the left in Europe and
the United States**.]{.underline} Barack Obama had described the
intervention in Libya as a mistake and the British Parliamentary
Committee outlined how the Libyan intervention had been based on lies.
Obama may have considered the intervention a mistake, but his
understanding of the process did not reveal how Goldman Sachs was
thoroughly implicated the destruction of Libya. The case in the London
High Court of the Libyan Investment Authority vs Goldman Sachs brought
out revealing evidence of how [firms such as Goldman Sachs and others
involved in the financialization of the energy markets sought to
mobilize the resources of oil rich states]{.underline} with Sovereign
Wealth Funds [to keep alive the]{.underline} private equity, hedge funds
and structured derivatives [markets of the global capitalist
economy.]{.underline} Most societies and peoples in the world want these
banks to be brought under control. But Goldman Sachs benefitted in the
ruling because in 2014, two and a half years after the case was brought
before the High Court, there was a war in Libya and there was no
government therefore one could not represent the Libyan Investment
Authority in this arena. We see therefore that the financial
institutions are direct beneficiaries of the warfare that is going on in
Libya. When the United Nations passed Resolution 1970 and resolution
1973 in 2011, those who had signed these resolutions did not understand
then that the resolution was for regime in Libya.\[22\] The current
fighting in Libya remains one of the most inglorious aspects of the 70
year history of NATO but there is silence among those celebrating 70
years of NATO. \[23\] [Since the writings on Finance capital over a
century ago by]{.underline} Rudolph Hilferding, Vladimir
[Lenin,]{.underline} Rosa [Luxemburg, and]{.underline} Nikolai [Bukharin
the role of finance in the international system has grown beyond the
parameters outlined by those who linked finance capital to modern
imperialism]{.underline}.\[24\] After the collapse of the dollar/gold
system of 1944 **[the financial industry of the West has become the axis
on which international capitalism spins]{.underline}**.

### Link -- Russia

#### Their framing of conflict in Ukraine is the Starwarsification of violence -- voting aff obviously does nothing, but endorsing the 1ACs feeds into the fantasy of war machine 

**Eid 3/5** -- \[Hanna, "Russia, Ukraine, and the Desert of the Real,"

According to Baudrillard: **[\"We are all hostages of media
intoxication, induced to believe in the war just as we were once led to
believe in the revolution in Romania, and confined to the simulacrum of
war as though confined to quarters\"]{.underline}**(1). This is so
visible in this case: [immediately after the Russian operation, we saw
all of the signs of a manufactured narrative in something which felt
quicker than real-time. Infographics, the \'Ghost of Kiev\', Zelensky as
\'war bae\', quippy one-liners from Zelensky that read as if they are
from the latest Call Of Duty installation: \"I don\'t need a ride, I
need ammunition\".]{.underline} In a much darker vein, Pornhub\'s number
one search is 'Ukrainian women', [the \'refugees are welcome here\'
discourse from the liberals, \'anti-war\' protests being staged (in
reality they are pro-war and pro-sanctions).]{.underline} One person
went as far as to create a list of fascist flags for people to avoid at
pro-Ukraine rallies across the USA. [All of this created the conditions
for more sanctions on Russia in less than a week.]{.underline} It's not
sanctions just on \"The Oligarchy\", but on Russian cinema and sport as
Russia was suspended from F1 and FIFA. The ruble crashed and is now
worth less than one cent. Interesting to note is that [the US\' own
oligarchs (Bezos, Musk, Zuckerburg, Branson, etc) are not called as
such. Oligarch is a term the US reserves for the likes of Putin who
belong to the \"oriental despotism\" that seeks to undermine American
freedom and democracy.]{.underline}

Baudrillard continues[: \"our virtual has definitively overtaken the
actual and we must be content with its extreme virtuality
which]{.underline}, unlike the Aristotelian, [deters any passage to
action\"(]{.underline}2). By this, he means that **[the event exists
primarily in the media]{.underline}** (even though real bombs drop).
**[We can see this through the use of the same images to signify
different things for either side. Videos of wounded soldiers claimed to
be Russian and Ukrainian at the same time show us that.]{.underline}**

It seems that [this obsession with the passage to action today governs
all our behavior; obsession with every real, with every real event, with
every real violence... \[a\]gainst this obsession with the real we have
created a gigantic apparatus of simulation\...which allows us to pass to
the act \"in vitro\"\...\[we\] prefer the exile of the virtual, of which
television is the universal mirror, to the catastrophe of the
real(3).]{.underline}

[This war is taking place on television for those in the occident, and
as such, it assumes the relations of television**. The Harry
Potterification of the conflict, the Star Warsification of the event**.
\"Thus \'real time\' information loses itself in a completely unreal
space]{.underline}, finally [furnishing images of pure, useless,
instantaneous television where its primordial function
irrupts]{.underline}, namely that of filling a vacuum, [blocking up the
screen hole through which escapes the substance\"]{.underline}(4).

When one tries to speak of Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine in
power-political terms, they are called a Putin apologist or a shill for
authoritarianism. Anouar Abdel Malek spoke about this tendency within
the Western socialist camp 40 years ago:

The basic approach towards the end of the nineteenth and the beginning
of the twentieth century was, and remains to a very large extent, an
ethical approach. Violence, armaments, were viewed as an \'evil\'
pursuit, and peace, disarmament, as a moral, humanistic, endeavor. Any
attempt at a content analysis of speeches, resolutions, writings, and
expositions on war, violence, peace, or disarmament would reveal a very
heavy load of moral considerations and a much lower percentage of
power-political analysis. (5)

This shows how important it is that we focus on the real material
implications of the event, not on the moral character of the players
involved[. The occidental media has created a scenario in which the
Ukrainian government can put out a call for mercenaries that is answered
by those who have been duped by the media message. These ragtag
mercenaries who want to go defend Ukraine have no scruples in regards to
the type of people they will fight alongside to 'defend
Ukraine'.]{.underline} Another piece of evidence against bringing this
occidental, protestant morality into the mix [when speaking of
geopolitics is the fact that some are saying Putin is both
the]{.underline} next manifestation of Adolph [Hitler and a Soviet
revivalist. History is relegated to the shredder, and the martyrs of the
Red Army who died fighting Nazism have their legacy denigrated in the
desert of the media.]{.underline}

In sum, [what we are seeing is the USA-NATO nexus reacting to the new
reality of multipolarity in the world system by desperately attempting
to control the flow of information. Russia has been removed from
SWIFT]{.underline}, as stated earlier [the ruble has crashed and is now
worth less than a penny. Yet, China and Russia have already been in
talks to create a system parallel to SWIFT for some time now, and
earlier this year announced an era of 'friendship with no limits'.
Multipolarity and the de-dollarization is one step towards dismantling
the US-led financial regime of the IMF and World Bank which is
militarily insured by NATO.]{.underline} According to Michael Hudson:
["While America's allies are told to bear the costs of US sanctions,
Russia and China are benefiting by being obliged to diversify and make
their own economies independent of reliance on US suppliers of food and
other basic needs"]{.underline}6. How this multipolarity will shape up
is not yet known, but [the current military escalation between Russia
and Ukraine shows us that we are definitely moving towards a world in
which the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can no longer reign
unchecked and unchallenged, even within its massive media narrative
control system.]{.underline}

#### The 1ACs reading of Russia as aggressive expands a [cartography]{.underline} of violence -- Ukraine isn't an isolated or uniquely horrific war zone but instead an [extension]{.underline} of decades of [imperial]{.underline} bloodshed waged by Whiteness

[People look at a map of Europe and express horror that a large part of
it is once more in flames. Pundits point out with alarm
that]{.underline} for the first time since 1945, [one European country
has invaded another and we are witnessing the first big military
conflict on the continent since the Balkan wars]{.underline} in the
1990s, aside from some earlier fighting in the Ukraine itself.

**[But if we look at a larger map that includes not only Europe but the
Middle East and North Africa, we get an entirely different impression
because Ukraine is no longer a blood-soaked exception in a zone of
peace. It is]{.underline}**, on contrary, **[the new northern extension
of a giant zone of war that has extended over the last twenty years
east-west from Afghanistan to north-east Nigeria and north-south from
Turkey to Somalia and Yemen.]{.underline}**

[Parallels are]{.underline} occasionally [drawn between the Ukrainian
war and a dozen or so conventional and guerrilla wars being fought out
in this vast area of conflict]{.underline} to the south of Ukraine. When
similarities between these conflicts are noted, it is usually on the
grounds that Russian shelling and bombing of cities like Mariupol and
Kharkiv is similar to that of Damascus and Aleppo by Russian-backed
Syrian forces. [This is true enough, but keep in mind that the
bombardment of Gaza by Israel and Raqqa and Mosul by the Americans
likewise led to massive physical destruction and heavy civilian loss of
life.]{.underline}

But [there is]{.underline} are other [more ominous similarities between
the war in Ukraine and the wars in the Middle East and North
Africa.]{.underline} Most of the latter developed into stalemates with
no final winner or loser, while the countries being fought over were
wrecked from end to end. [Ceaseless violence generated mass flight of
the population, the ruin of the economy, and the disintegration of
society.]{.underline}

The standard of living in Iraq was close to that of Greece in 1980, but
had fallen to that of Mali forty years later. Skilled surgeons who had
once worked in Baghdad or Damascus hospitals fled to California or New
Zealand and were not coming back.

Could the same thing now happen in Ukraine? The war there has turned
into a stalemate in a surprisingly short period and the result may be
akin to that in the Middle East wars. [The Russians have failed to
destroy the Ukrainian government and army, take the cities or even
encircle them, gain control of the air or stop Ukraine being resupplied
with arms by foreign powers. It does not look as if Moscow can mobilise
enough soldiers and equipment to recover from these
setbacks.]{.underline}

[But at the same time, Russia has not been militarily defeated and it
can keep pounding Ukrainian cities into rubble even though it cannot
easily capture them. It is unlikely to agree to serious peace talks
until it has made some significant gains on the ground and these may be
a long time coming. Already large parts of these Ukrainian cities look
like opposition areas in Damascus and Fallujah west of
Baghdad.]{.underline}

II Governing through emergency

A range of work in geography and allied fields has traced the work
emergency does in the advent and (re)production of existing and new
forms, practices and relations of power. Stimulated by the 'war on
terror', [research has shown how contemporary liberal order is secured
by governing through the logics of Emergency with a capital
E]{.underline} (Adey, 2016; Amin, 2013; Agamben, 2007; Anderson, 2015;
Aradau, 2015; Cooper, 2008; Dillon and Reid, 2009; Grove, 2013; Graham,
2011; Massumi, 2009). On the one hand, [events or situations which are
designated as emergencies are governed in ways that are designed to
contain and curtail classes of events, and people that are designated as
threats to an existing order. Governing through emergencies primarily
hinges on draining an event of its eventfulness, by reducing its
potentiality to disrupt, end, or overturn.]{.underline} On the other
hand, [liberal order governs through emergency in the sense that claims
to an emergency -- sometimes strategic declarations that an emergency
has happened, is happening or will happen -- can justify actions that
(re)order bodies and relations for pre-existing reasons.]{.underline}
Within this broad emphasis on 'governing through emergency', two main
lines of research have developed.

First, a line of research concerned with emergency as exception has
unpacked the work that the 'state of emergency' as juridical-political
category and instrument does in the (re)making and (re)ordering of
spaces and bodies (Neal, 2006; Coleman, 2007; Braun and McCarthy, 2005).
Here the emphasis is less on the materialities and affects of the event
designated as an emergency, and more on what is enabled through the act
of formal declaration and the acts that follow. Building on Agamben's
(1998) neo-Schmittian engagement with sovereignty and the exception,
research has disclosed the intensely uneven geographies of exclusion
that are founded through the 'state of emergency', and the myriad ways
in which people suffer and are damaged in the name of emergency. This
emphasis on [the 'state of emergency' reflects the fact that emergency
declarations and subsequent actions often reveal the relation between
democratic life and its authoritarian others as fractured and
fragmented]{.underline} (Ophir 2007[). In a 'state of emergency' visible
impacts and effects of power manifest in and through bodies, typically
framed in terms of the production of 'bare life']{.underline} (Agamben
1998). [Research into racial violence]{.underline} following Hurricane
Katrina (Braun and McCarthy, 2005) and the 2010 Haiti earthquake
(Mullings et al., 2010), for instance, [shows how action in a state of
emergency draws on and reproduces black disaster victims as disposable
lives]{.underline} (Giroux, 2006) [while pursuing a goal of sustaining
the existing socio-ecological order.]{.underline}

A second strand of work troubles this emphasis on the 'state of
emergency' by approaching emergency as one technique of liberal rule
amongst others. [Governing through emergencies happens through
innumerable mundane techniques designed to enable either the
continuation or swift return of the non-emergency everyday. **These
techniques include**]{.underline} exercises (Anderson and Adey, 2012;
Schoch-Spana, 2004; O'Grady, 2016), shelters (Fredricksen, 2014),
**[scenarios]{.underline}** (De Goede, 2008; De Goede and Randalls,
2009), **[and participatory activities]{.underline}** (Grove, 2014a).
This research examines: the problem that situations designated as
emergencies pose for governance; efforts to grasp such situations and
render them actionable as emergencies; and how the practical operation
of particular techniques of governance change what an event is and might
become (De Goede and Randalls, 2009; Lakoff and Collier, 2008; Lentzos
and Rose, 2009). [Governing through emergencies is shown to involve a
set of disparate, partially connected activities that happen through
spatially distributed networks of anticipation including]{.underline}:
forms of preparedness, preemption and precaution action (Amoore, 2013;
De Goede and Randalls, 2009; Cooper, 2008; Lakoff, 2007; Massumi,
2009)); detectiondiagnosis (Luque-Ayala and Marvin, 2016); and response
and recovery (Anderson, 2015). Rather than a juridico-legal category
confined to the spaces and topologies of the exception, [governing
through emergencies appears here as simultaneously ordinary and
extraordinary, materializing in scenes and situations of emergency,
before returning to the background life of otherwise unexceptional
spaces]{.underline} (see, for example, Barker, 2012; Hu, 2018).

Despite important differences, work on emergency-as-exception and
emergency-as technique emphasize how [emergency as a juridical-political
category]{.underline}, set of governmental techniques, and atmosphere
[functions to sustain liberal rule.]{.underline} Following MacIntyre's
(1989: 345) assertion that [liberalism's teleological goal is 'no more
and no less than the continued sustenance of liberal and social order',
emergency is at once an occasion in which liberal rule is placed in
question and (re)consolidated. Governing through emergency promises to
bring events to an end by attempting to (re)produce recognizable
cyclical or linear sequences]{.underline} of, for example,
order-growth-development, disruption stabilization-recovery, or
disruption-adaptation transformation. The goal is to drain an event of
its eventfulness, making it into a recognized, completed happening and
bringing the potentiality that the term emergency gestures towards to an
end. This foreclosure of potentiality is by no means always a problem;
as Povinelli (2011) reminds us, the burden of becoming-otherwise is
often unevenly distributed. But [it becomes a problem as it is harnessed
to the goal of perpetuating liberal order, and emergency and disaster
management are transformed into forms of 'institutionalized anti-action'
designed to 'ward off unexpected novelty' and 'block contingency rather
than exploit its opportunity']{.underline} (Hu, 2018: 103).

Work on 'governing through emergencies' offers and rests on a critique
of how governing through emergency ends, forecloses or redirects
potentiality and thus (re)produces harmful or damaging conditions in the
name of securing existing order. While it has mainly focused on liberal
democracies in the Global North (exceptions including Hu, 2018, and
Grove, 2013, 2014a, 2014b), we take four key points from this
literature. First, 'governing through emergencies' orientates inquiry to
how and with what consequences events or situations are claimed and
thereafter related to as 'emergencies': claims of emergency demand
action from those who govern, and it is important to attend to how
subsequent in-action generates its own harms. Second, how certain events
and situations become more perceptible and actionable than others is an
important line of inquiry. Activist, public and artist claims of
emergency often go unheard, ignored, or are dismissed by the state and
other apparatuses through which emergencies are governed. Third, how
everyday lives are partly composed through the techniques, objects,
institutions and practices of governing through emergency requires
exploration. Emergency techniques, objects and so on are encountered and
become palpable with the atmospheres and moods that give everyday lives
a particular feel.

Finally, work on 'governing through emergencies' reminds us that [the
relation between emergency and the everyday is at stake in emergency
governance.]{.underline} [Everyday habits, practices, and events may be
governed as a source of potential or proto emergencies]{.underline},
with governing happening as dispersed phenomena across multiple sites
and scenes in addition to visible, punctual scenes of emergency. This
final point importantly connects to longstanding questions on what
counts as a time-space of emergency when the line between exceptional
and everyday becomes blurred. Walter Benjamin's (1968: 257) observation
that ['the tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the "state of
emergency" in which we live is not the exception but the rule' has
shaped]{.underline} anthropologists' and geographers' [studies of banal
forms of violence throughout the Global South]{.underline} (e.g.
Taussig, 1992; Scheper-Hughes, 1992; Das, 2007; Rose, 2014). More
recently, geographers and other critical theorists have turned to
concepts including ['slow violence']{.underline} (Nixon, 2011[) and
'slow death']{.underline} (Berlant, 2011) to [examine how racially and
economically uneven processes of environment (in)justice fold harm,
suffering, risk and premature death into the fabric of everyday
life]{.underline}, particularly among poor and marginalized communities.
Taken together, this and other research highlights that
**[emergency]{.underline}** is not only a dry juridical category, but
**[signals a form of life structured through biopolitical techniques and
mechanisms of racialization that delimit what lives can and should be
exposed to banal forms of exceptional violence.]{.underline}** The next
section explores the multiple time-spaces of this form of Anderson et
al. 5 life -- what we are calling here racializing emergency.

III Racializing emergency

One of the more influential literatures in geography on everyday
violence comes from work on environmental racism. Drawing variously on,
inter alia, black geographies, political ecology, and feminist
geography, this body of research reflects Ruth Wilson Gilmore's (2007:
28) [definition of racism as the 'state sanctioned and/or extralegal
production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerabilities to
premature death'.]{.underline} In contrast to interpretations of racism
as subjective prejudices, [Gilmore's approach directs attention towards
structurally-produced forms of violence that have created and sustained
capitalist political ecological order and continue to do so]{.underline}
in the present day. Illustrating this approach, Katherine McKittrick
(2013) demonstrates how [colonialism operated through a geographic
language of racial condemnation that created both difference and value
in colonial economies: the figure of the black slave that embodied the
possibility of violence without limits.]{.underline} Here, [blackness is
less an indicator of phenotypic difference than a political, juridical
and philosophical category that constructed certain spaces as unlivable
and marked those inhabiting these areas as less-than-human.]{.underline}
This racialized designation formed the material and discursive
foundations for the emergence of the uniquely European experience of
finitude. The temporal experience of the future as an open-ended domain
of progressive change, growth and betterment, amenable to human
intervention and calculated improvement (Dillon, 1996), emerged
literally on the backs of enslaved peoples from the African continent
designated as 'black', whose forced labor and premature death in
plantation economies created previously unimaginable sources of wealth
and prosperity for European slave traders and slave owners (Thomas,
2016; Smith and Vasudevan, 2017).

[These 'racialized imaginative geographies of the
uninhabitable']{.underline} (McKittrick, 2013: 7) [continue to shape the
present.]{.underline} McKittrick (2013: 7) stresses that:

> in our present moment, some live in the unlivable, and to live in the
> unlivable condemns the geographies of marginalized to death over and
> over again. Life, then, is extracted from particular regions,
> transforming some places into inhuman rather than human geographies.

Geographic work on environmental (in)justice has unpacked how this
['geographic management of blackness' plays out in contemporary liberal
societies.]{.underline} For example, Pulido's (2000) seminal study of
environmental racism in Los Angeles demonstrates how the urban landscape
has been shaped by historical trajectories of white residents' movement
away from both polluted industrial areas and minority neighborhoods.
[Whiteness]{.underline} -- and white privilege [-- is produced in this
relational movement away from spaces and communities marked as 'black'
and thus subject to greater levels of hazardous material exposure. The
exposure of black bodies to]{.underline} harmful contaminants, and their
resulting poor health and [premature death, operates not only through
direct and intentional means, but also through more insidious and banal
practices that produce the toxic environments these bodies
inhabit]{.underline} (Bullard, 2000; Tse, 2007; Mohai and Saha, 2015).

This literature has increasingly drawn on Rob [Nixon's]{.underline}
(2009, 2011) concept of [slow violence and]{.underline} Achille
[Mbembe's]{.underline} (2003) concept of '[necropolitics']{.underline}
to [unpack how power differentials unevenly distribute risk and harm in
late modern capitalist societies.]{.underline} Nixon deploys slow
violence to think through the subtle transformations in the spatial and
temporal organization of violence under conditions of what Ulrich Beck
refers to as 'reflexive modernization'. Beck foregrounds how the
[institutions that]{.underline} structured modern societies throughout
much of the 20th century, such as the territorially-bounded
nation-state, full employment, and the maledominated nuclear family,
have increasingly become destabilized in recent decades (Beck et al.,
2003). While these institutions formerly provided the (white, male)
modern individual with a sense of security and stability, their gradual
erosion creates qualitatively new experiences of insecurity. Reading
spectacular catastrophes such as the 1983 Bhopal chemical explosion and
1986 Chernobyl meltdown against the grain, he argues that the
[violence]{.underline} of these events [is not confined to the immediate
time-space of the event itself. Rather, the effects slowly reverberate
across affected spaces and populations, gradually producing mutations,
diseases, and debilitating injuries that erode vital capacities. But
these drawn-out, attritional after-effects fail to receive]{.underline}
the media attention and [public concern]{.underline} these disasters
initially received. [Instead, they produce new subjectivities striving
to survive in and through risky, inhospitable landscapes.]{.underline}
Thus, while some adherents to Beck's risk society thesis maintain that
late-modern societies can be characterized by the democratization of
catastrophic risk (see Bougen, 2003), Nixon demonstrates how the [slow
violence of advanced modernity is not evenly distributed across the
population.]{.underline}

Environmental racism scholars have begun to articulate Nixon's arguments
alongside Mbembe's (2001, 2003) sense of necropolitics to understand how
this uneven geography of **[slow violence is shaped by racializing
assemblages]{.underline}**, or various legal and extra-legal techniques
**[that produce differences within the population and expose some
segments to premature death]{.underline}** (Pulido, 2017; Davies, 2018).
In short, Mbembe offers necropolitics as a corrective to Agamben's
formulation of bare life and sovereignty. For Mbembe, the colony, rather
than the camp, is the paradigmatic scene where exceptional violence --
the sovereign decision on the state of exception that brings the figures
of both the sovereign and bare life into being -- is contingent on banal
practices that sustain colonial rule. **[Necropolitics names those
techniques and practices that produce death-spaces inhabited by
colonized subjects whose lives carry no juridical or theological
value.]{.underline}** Thus, for some researchers, **[slow violence
signals 'a form of late-modern necropolitics, where communities are
exposed to the power of death-in-life']{.underline}** (Davies, 2018:
1540). For example, Thom Davies' research into the lived experience of
toxic environments in the US's so-called 'Cancer Alley' is rooted in a
recognition that:

> just as Mbembe's colonialized bodies were kept in a state of gradual
> injury through processes of imperial domination, Nixon's
> interpretation of slow violence shows how the uneven spread of
> globalization and pollution also keeps marginalized groups in
> situations and spaces of wounded subjugation. (Davies, 2018: 1540)

Similarly, Randi Gressgard's (2019) innovative approach to urban
resilience juxtaposes research on the necropolitics of colonialism with
urban splintering to understand how [practices of urban securitization
are situated in antiblack racism and settler colonialism. These
engagements with necropolitics draw out how contemporary forms of rule
enact a subtle form of death-politics: the production of necropolitical
geographies that render some places deathworlds whose slow forms of
violence do not elicit shock or emergency response.]{.underline}

However, Jared Sexton (2010) cautions against Mbembe's tendency to blur
qualitatively distinct forms of racialized violence. In Sexton's
reading, Mbembe effaces the distinction between contingent violence that
maintains colonial rule and the structural violence of slavery. He
argues that by positioning slavery as one instance of a general
phenomenon of modern terror, Mbembe loses track of

> the singular commodification of human existence (not simply its
> \[instrumentalized\] labor power) Anderson et al. 7 under racial
> slavery, that structure of gratuitous violence in which a body is
> rendered as flesh to be accumulated and exchanged. (Sexton, 2010: 38)

Flesh is key to Sexton's insistence that the experience of blackness is
irreducible to that of other paradigmatic figures of modern
deathpolitics in Agamben and Mbembe's thought, such as the colonized
subject or the refugee. [Flesh is not biological; it materializes
through racializing assemblages that inscribe racialized imaginaries
onto human physiology]{.underline} (Weheliye, 2014). It thus offers an
alternative to both the representational understandings of race and the
abstract, ontological understandings of bare life that undergird Mbembe
and Agamben's readings of death-politics. It highlights the
contextually- specific [social formations -- such as the New World
plantation society -- that, for African and indigenous peoples, are
scenes of actual rather than potential mutilation, dismemberment and
exile.]{.underline} For Sexton (2010), the social death that results
from this 'theft of the body' (Spillers, 1987) distinguishes slavery's
structural violence from the colony's contingent violence: the
terror-formation Mbembe attributes to colonialism is already
institutionalized in the structure of chattel slavery that denies the
black subject kinship ties and mandates total submission of the enslaved
before all whites.

While these arguments on racialized violence appear somewhat removed
from work on governing Emergencies, they point to the racialized
foundations of modern biopolitics that both Agambenian- and
Foucauldian-inflected work bypass. If, as we saw above, the contextually
[specific transformation of persons into mere 'flesh' precedes any
biopolitical division]{.underline} of the population into
decontextualized categories of bare life (zoe) and valued life (bios),
then the bios -- **[the valued life in need of security and development
-- always carries with it the antihumanist negation of black flesh as
its historical condition of possibility.]{.underline}** Saidiya
Hartman's (1997) influential genealogy of freedom in the pre- and
post-Civil War US offers an alternative account of how biology and
politics intertwine. As she details, the definition of the slave's legal
status also established the scope of rights and liberties of the freed.
This system of rights, liberties and privileges in white supremacist
societies gave rise to particular experiences of daily life for white
subjects that shaped normative expectations for how 'valued life' as
such should unfold. Thus, post-emancipation and post-war legal struggles
to eradicate discrimination revolved around the question of how to
delimit black 'freedom' in a white supremacist society that continued to
be structured around the exclusive privileges and value of whiteness.
Biology -- in the form of blood -- became the means for managing life
through the Jim Crow-era 'separate but equal' doctrine. [The subject's
bloodline determined their capacity to claim the rights and privileges
of whiteness, and determined the capacity of the state and other white
subjects to legally deny those privileges to subjects marked as
black.]{.underline} [Thus, the expectations and comforts of whiteness
were secured by white subjects through the continued classification of
racialized subjects and the definition of the limits of their
freedom.]{.underline}

Hartman's analysis thus shows how [the valued life that modern
biopolitics takes as its object is an effect of racializing assemblages
that extend the violence and deprivations of slavery into the present
day. **The possibility for specifying and managing various forms of
collective life through techniques of emergency governance are thus
founded on a 'corporeal politics spanning the divide between slavery and
freedom'**]{.underline} (Hartman, 1997: 9) **[that makes possible the
experience of the future as openended and in need of securing through
denying the possibility of this future to black spaces and
subjects.]{.underline}**

This argument offers an important corrective to work on governing
Emergencies and slow violence by revealing that modern biopolitics
carries within it multiple temporal registers that 8 Progress in Human
Geography XX(X) express uneven and shifting economies of harm, suffering
and insecurity within liberal societies. The anticipatory and open-ended
temporality of the liberal subject is constitutively conjoined with at
least two additional temporalities. First, [the durative temporality of
slow violence]{.underline} is not confined to contemporary late-modern
societies, but [defines the black experience of modernity since its
inception in racialized slavery. The temporality of blackness as
**social death is**]{.underline} not growth and development, [**but an
incalculable, endured time with no interval or break.** **This 'stalled
present'**]{.underline} of 'arrested movement' (Scott, 2014: 6)
[**offers no promise of** transformation, betterment or **improvement,
only** the **exhaustion** that comes from striving to endure unlivable
worlds.]{.underline} As Sexton (2010: 64) emphasizes, ['to be black in
an antiblack world \... is to be inundated and under assault at every
turn, pushed into an endlessly kinetic movement; which is to say
subjected to an open and absolute vulnerability.']{.underline}

[This persistent 'open and absolute vulnerability]{.underline}'
encompasses and [exceeds both slow violence and
necropolitics.]{.underline} [But at the same time, we do not read
blackness as an absolute, ontological category --]{.underline} following
McKittrick (2016), [we do not reduce black lives to death.
Instead]{.underline}, Weheliye's (2014) attention to [racializing
assemblages directs attention to the way the structural violence of
racial capitalism hinges on topologically pliant and contextually
specific configurations of different racializing techniques whose
precise arrangement conditions the specific content of blackness as
such]{.underline}. In this sense, [the slow violence of late-modern
societies is thus a topologically recalibrated form of the exposure to
harm, suffering and premature death that has structured blackness since
the slave plantation.]{.underline} As McKittrick (2013: 4) emphasizes,
the plantation 'uncovers a logic that emerges in the present and folds
over to repeat itself anew throughout black lives'. **[This repetition
of plantation violence -- the recurrent demand for black social death as
the possibility for liberal freedom -- signals a second alternative
temporality of modernity: the simultaneity of past, present and future
that collapses open-ended futurity into a stalled present of enduring
the violence of social death]{.underline}** (Thomas, 2016). Christina
Sharpe (2016) characterizes this simultaneity in terms of living in the
wake of slavery. As a metaphor, wake signals an ongoing disturbance that
folds the past into the present. Sharpe emphasizes that

> living in the wake on a global level means living the disastrous time
> and effects of continued marked migrations, Mediterranean and
> Caribbean disasters, trans-American and African migration, structural
> adjustment imposed by the International Monetary Fund that continues
> imperalisms/colonialisms, and more. (Sharpe, 2016: 15)

Taken together, stalled time and disastrous time allow us to rethink the
biopolitics of emergency governance in a way that situates liberalism's
anticipatory temporalities in relation to its constitutive racialized
temporalities of duration and simultaneity. [The life that emergency
governance takes as its object carries with it multiple temporalities:
the open-ended futurity of the white liberal subject and the
repetitive]{.underline} and durative [temporalities of black and
indigenous subjects enduring the wake of slavery and genocide that
denies these subjects the possibility of a future]{.underline} (Smith
and Vasudevan, 2017). In this light, the biopolitics of emergency
governance revolves around the uneven re/distribution of these distinct
temporalities of modernity throughout the population. In clear
distinction from all-encompassing visions of emergency and violence
found in some Agambenian- and Foucauldian-inspired research, this
reframing of biopolitics encourages us to look beyond the foreclosure of
potentiality that works on governing through emergency details, and
instead attend to expressions of actually-existing difference in the
present that emerge out of and against contextually-specific racializing
assemblages. The challenge here is to practice what Anderson et al. 9 we
might call racializing emergency: racializing emergency involves
situating emergency claims in particular socio-spatial contexts to
examine how they contest the distribution of anticipatory, repetitive
and durative temporalities and the forms of harm and suffering that are
exercised through these uneven spatiotemporal geographies.

[**Explicitly recognizing** the **racializing assemblages that structure
liberal biopolitics foregrounds the centrality of blackness to the
modern category of emergency**, and thus points to the need for critical
analyses of emergency governance to take on board the coexistence of
anticipatory, repetitive and durative temporalities. This
decentering]{.underline} move [radically opens up the relation between
power and life that has been a central concern of research on governing
Emergencies.]{.underline} As our review outlined above, geographers
commonly read this relation in terms of governmental apparatuses that
attempt to strategically control individual and collective life
processes (a power over life) and an ontologically prior constitutive
power of collective life. But [this vision of a pluripotent life capable
of generating new becomings must be radically expanded in light of the
multiplicity of unevenly distributed temporalities that structure
liberal order.]{.underline} In particular, [analysis needs to account
for a prior political economy of racialization that produces this uneven
distribution in the first place.]{.underline} This opens the question of
the threshold between different forms of modern life that are
differentially governed through emergency logics and techniques.
Importantly, **[this is not an ontological threshold]{.underline}** that
ultimately resolves into a clear Agambenian distinction between a valued
life of the polis (bios) and the expendable life of homo sacer (zoe).
[Rather, this is a mutable and mobile threshold that is continually
re/produced and challenged through the contextually-specific interplay
of force relations, techniques, knowledges and strategies that
differentially inscribes racial categories onto specific
bodies]{.underline}, which are then open to being governed in some ways
rather than others (Baldwin, 2012). In short, **[governing through
emergency hinges on a prior politics of racialization that renders some
lives governable through liberal techniques of emergency rule, and
others not.]{.underline}**

As Hartman (1997) patiently details, [this politics of racialization
allows]{.underline} some [(white) subjects to claim protections from the
state]{.underline} (or, we could add, any institution that governs) [on
the basis of an expected future of growth, security and development, and
withholds the possibility of this claim from]{.underline} other
[(black/Indigenous) subjects]{.underline} (see also Povinelli, 2011).
Racializing emergency allows us to approach Emergency as one sphere
among others of liberal rule in which subjects may advance these claims.
[Emergency claims draw on and reiterate the racialized distribution of
temporalities that structures liberal life.]{.underline} In doing so,
[racializing emergency opens a space of indeterminacy between emergency
and life foreclosed by accounts of Emergency governance that equate
liberal life with a purely anticipatory temporality. T]{.underline}o
rethink the spatio-temporal structure of liberal life thus also demands
that we rethink the spatio-temporal structure of emergency as one
terrain of liberal biopolitics. In the penultimate section, we
articulate the concept of slow emergency to think through emergency
governance in relation to a racialized understanding of emergency.

Abstract: In recent years, **[the military establishments of the
US]{.underline}** and the UK **[have produced a series of reports that
attempt to 'think the unthinkable']{.underline}** in imagining future
threats to the security of the West. **[A new genre of military
futurology has emerged which owes as much to apocalyptic Hollywood
movies as it does to the cold war tradition of 'scenario
planning']{.underline}**. Often outlandish and bizarre in its
prophecies, and always dystopian, **[this new military futurism sees
threats to the western way of life]{.underline}** emanating not only
from rogue states, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism but also
from resurgent nationalism, conflicts over dwindling resources,
migration, disease, organised crime, abrupt climate change and the
emergence of 'failed cities' where social disorder **[is
rife]{.underline}**. This article provides a survey of the genre,
showing how **[the grim predictions of the military futurists provide a
justification for]{.underline}** endless **[global
war]{.underline}** against enemies that may never exist. Reports that
say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because
as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We
also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are
some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns -- the
ones we don't know we don't know. Donald Rumsfeld1 Downloaded

BUFFALO on March 1, 2010 14 Race & Class 51(3) There was a time when the
future was considered a subject for prophecy and science fiction rather
than empirical analysis. From Jules Verne and H. G. Wells onwards,
science writers have combined fantasy with a serious examination of what
the future might contain. But it was not until the last decades of the
twentieth century that futuristic speculation began to transcend the
category of entertainment, with the emergence of the discipline
variously known as futurology, futuristics or future studies. Defined by
the Encarta Dictionary as 'the study and forecasting of the future, with
predictions based on the likely outcomes of current trends', futurology
first emerged as a popular non-fiction genre in the early 1970s, with
Alvin Toffler's best-selling Future Shock and the Club of Rome's
environmental wake-up call Limits to Growth. In 1972, the University of
Houston established the first graduate programme in futurism and today a
plethora of university departments, thinktanks and research centres
across the world are dedicated to 'foresight' and the study of 'probable
and preferable futures', such as the Copenhagen Institute for Futures
Studies, the UK Horizon Scanning Centre, Foresight International and the
World Future Society. **[The military has]{.underline}** also **[shown a
keen interest in the study of the 'possible future']{.underline}** in
the early twenty-first century, **[particularly in the United
States]{.underline}**. In 1997, **[the US National Intelligence
Council]{.underline}** (NIC) **[published Global Trends
2010]{.underline}**, the first of three reports in its ambitious 2020
Project that aims **[to predict the 'forces that will shape our world'
over a two-decade period]{.underline}**. In 2001, the prestigious US Air
Force thinktank, the RAND Corporation, established the Frederick S.
Pardee Center for Longer Range Global Policy and the Future Human
Condition. Since 2000, **[the US Joint Forces Command has published two
studies of the international military and security
environment]{.underline}** over the next two decades **[and its
implications for the military.]{.underline}** Military and national
security research institutions such as **[the]{.underline}** **[US
Army's Strategic Studies Institute]{.underline}**
(**[SSI]{.underline}**) **[regularly stage conferences and
symposia]{.underline}** on 'Long Range Planning and Forecasting',
**['Scenario Planning']{.underline}** and 'Projecting Future
Battlespaces and Scenarios'. These **[studies are not limited to purely
military concerns]{.underline}**. Military futurists also devote
considerable attention to more mainstream futurological subjects, such
as social and economic transformation, demographics, urbanism, cultural
trends and climate change. What explains the military's interest in the
future and what does this fascination tell us about the present?
Military futurism is not a historical novelty in itself. Armies have
routinely engaged in contingency planning ever since the German armed
forces pioneered 'long range planning' in the late nineteenth
century. **[Military futurism really came into its own during the cold
war, when the RAND Corporation began conducting regular war games and
simulations to predict]{.underline}** the likely **[outcomes of nuclear
and conventional military confrontations]{.underline}** with the Soviet
Union. In the 1950s and 1960s, RAND luminaries such as Herman Kahn, Leo
Roster and Albert Wohlstetter built illustrious careers around
**['scenario planning']{.underline}** and 'systems thinking', which
**[attempted to provide US policymakers with the conceptual tools to
anticipate 'alternate' or 'surprising' military futures by 'thinking the
unthinkable']{.underline}**. By the 1980s, forecasting, war-gaming and
scenario planning had become routinely integrated into US military
practice. While studies such as Innovation Task Force 2025 (1988) and
AirLand Battle 2000 (1982) considered the transformation of the armed
forces or rehearsed NATO war plans against the Warsaw Pact, others
continued to explore the outer limits of the unthinkable future. One
report published by the Department of Defense in the early years of the
Reagan presidency imagined a nuclear war in which the White House, the
Pentagon and much of civilisation were destroyed, but computers
continued in the aftermath 'to run a war no human mind can control',
directing space satellites, nuclear weapons and armies of robots 'that
can gallop like horses and walk like men, carrying out computerised
orders as they roam the radioactive battlefield'.2 **[Cold war military
futurism also spilled over into the private sector]{.underline}**. In
1961, Herman Kahn founded the Hudson Institute, a conservative thinktank
and research centre which aspires to provide 'global leaders in
government and business' with the tools to 'manage strategic transitions
to the future'.3 In the 1970s, **[Royal Dutch Shell pioneered the
corporate use of scenario planning in the oil industry in response to
what was perceived as a new climate of uncertainty and
unpredictability]{.underline}** following the OPEC oil embargo. This
overlapping nexus between the military and corporate futurism has
continued ever since. Not only do the US military and the private sector
share the same concern with geopolitical and international developments
pertaining to US national security and the future of the capitalist
world economy, but private companies and institutions specialising
in scenario planning and risk management also work closely with the
military in developing futuristic analyses. **[The Hudson Institute's
Center for Political-Military Analysis produces regular studies for the
military on the 'critical variables' and 'nonlinear forces' affecting
international politics.]{.underline}**4 Both the Pentagon and the
Department of Homeland Security have also commissioned futuristic
studies from scenario planning specialists such as the Global Business
Network (GBN) and the giant management consultancy firm Booz Allen
Hamilton. In 2006, Booz Allen won a \$32 million contract to provide the
Pentagon's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) with war-gaming
materials and simulations, whose aim, according to the company
spokesman, was to 'write the history of the future' and provide the
Pentagon with a 'picture of the world between 2001 and 2025'.5 All this
is in keeping with the tradition developed by Kahn and his RAND
colleagues but the new military futurism is also strikingly different
from its predecessors. Where the cold war futurists were primarily
concerned with the Soviet Union and scenario planning for nuclear war,
twenty-first century futurists are concerned with very different
'threats' and 'challenges'. One of the most prolific producers of
futurological studies is the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment (ONA),
an obscure but influential thinktank run by the veteran RAND
intellectual and military futurist Andrew Marshall. Each year, the ONA
commissions dozens of studies from academics and thinktanks like the
Hudson Institute and private consulting companies. Most of these reports
are classified but
the [talkingpointsmemo.com](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/) website
recently used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain an index of ONA
publications. These include titles such as Pandora's Boxes: the mind of
jihad (June 2007), Why they Won't Know What Hit Them: are Arabs thinking
about the consequences of another 9/11 (July 2006), Europe 2025:
mounting security challenges amidst declining competitiveness (September
2008), Role of High Power Microwave Weapons in Future Intercontinental
War (July 2007) and even German Liberals and the Integration of Muslim
Minorities in Germany (December 2006).6 These titles are an indication
of the new concerns of contemporary military futurism. The new military
futurists also differ from their predecessors in their generally grim
perspective on the future. In Rethinking the Unthinkable (1963), Herman
Kahn attempted to demonstrate that a nuclear war might not be survivable
and therefore 'thinkable'. This scenario was intended to be positive --
albeit from a hawkish foreign policy perspective -- but contemporary
military futurism is often extremely pessimistic in its depictions of
the twenty-first century 'security environment'. Such pessimism is
partly a reflection of the prevailing mood in the US national security
establishment. Ever since the end of the cold war, US security analysts
have argued that the US was vulnerable to attack by elusive and
unpredictable enemies that were potentially more dangerous than the
former Soviet Union. Such predictions appeared to be confirmed by the
catastrophic events of September 11. On the one hand, the 9/11 attacks
were 'predictable', in the sense that an attack of some kind had been
expected. At the same time, the attacks constituted what futurologists
call 'wild cards', 'discontinuities' or 'surprising events with huge
consequences', which force a new set of expectations about what the
future might contain. Some US security analysts have since added the
Iraq insurgency to the category of 'strategic shocks' and attributed the
failure to predict it to the same 'failure of imagination' that helped
make the 9/11 attacks possible. The result is a new willingness amongst
the US national security establishment to consider further 'strategic
shocks' by 'imagining the unimaginable' -- a tendency which has
generated imaginative scenarios that sometimes owe more to apocalyptic
Hollywood movies, manga comics and science fiction than they do to sober
analysis. Faced with a future that seems fraught with unpleasant
surprises, the Pentagon has embarked on some outlandish and even bizarre
attempts to try to reduce the element of uncertainty and
unpredictability. One ongoing project aims to recruit social scientists
to compile a computerised database of cultural, religious and political
beliefs in every country in the world that will supposedly enable the
military to predict which countries are most likely to succumb to
unrest, insurgency or terrorism. In 2002, the Pentagon's cutting edge
Defense and Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) came close to
introducing a 'terrorism futures market' based on the financial futures
market, which invited bets on when and where terrorist events were
likely to occur in order to predict them beforehand. This scheme was
abandoned when it was pointed out that some organisations might
deliberately carry out attacks in order to profit from them. In 2007,
DARPA awarded Lockheed Martin a contract to develop an 'Integrated
Crises Early Warning System' (ICEWS) that its designers claimed will
'anticipate and respond to worldwide political crises and predict events
of interest and stability of countries of interest with greater than 80
percent accuracy' in the same way that meteorologists predict the
weather.7 These initiatives cannot be attributed simply to an
overzealous desire to protect the US 'homeland' from 'another 9/11'.
**[The broad scope of contemporary military futurism is partly a
consequence of changing concepts of warfare in]{.underline}** the
early twenty-first century, with its new emphasis on 'asymmetric'
warfare, **[terrorism and insurgency across the global
'battlespace']{.underline}** rather than conventional wars between
states. **[The commitment to 'fourth generation warfare' is fuelled by a
new sense of the fragility and instability of the international state
system, coupled with the belief that the nation-state]{.underline}** in
the early twenty-first century **[is]{.underline}** increasingly
**[vulnerable to global economic turbulence, civil and ethnic conflict
and the violent activities of 'non-state actors']{.underline}** -- all
of which are perceived to pose threats to global security and even the
future of globalisation itself. The 'uncertainty', instability and risk
that military futurists project onto the future not only emanates from
nuclear-armed 'rogue states' or 'non-state actors', however. A recurring
theme in military futurist scenarios concerns the possibility that the
emergence of China, India and Brazil as major economic powers may be
accompanied by a decline in US -- and western -- global hegemony and
that the 'unipolar world' of the post-cold war era may be drawing to an
end. With the demise of the Soviet Union, US military thinking has been
dominated by the concept of the 'Revolution in Military Affairs' (RMA)
-- a term used to describe periods of history in which one particular
military power or group of powers outstrips all potential rivals. The
display of US technological firepower in the first Gulf War convinced
many military planners that this position is now occupied by the US. But
this belief is often accompanied by a realisation of the limitations of
US military power and anxiety that the RMA may not be permanent. The
notion of the US RMA is often attributed to the Pentagon's
'futurist-in-chief' Andrew Marshall at the ONA. Celebrated as a
visionary genius by his admirers and denounced as a paranoiac by his
enemies, Marshall is a long-time associate of Donald Rumsfeld and Paul
Wolfowitz, and was given a major role by Rumsfeld in the preparation of
the 2002 Quadrennial Defense Review, which the US Armed Forces use as a
medium-range planning guide to justify its budget requests to Congress.
That same year, Marshall commissioned an 85-page monograph for the ONA
from Booz Allen Hamilton entitled Military Advantage in History, which
studied some of the most successful military conquerors of the past for
lessons on how the United States 'should think about maintaining
military advantage in the twenty-first century'.8 Though the study
identified the United States as the 'dominant military power in the
world', it nevertheless warned that such dominance might not be
permanent and that 'barring a more innovative approach the process
leading to its substantial erosion has already been set in motion'. To
contribute to this process of innovation, the report sought inspiration
from imperial conquerors such as Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and
particularly from Rome, whose 600-year dominance, the authors argued,
'suggests that it is possible for the United States to maintain its
military advantage for centuries if it remains capable of transforming
its forces before an opponent can develop counter-capabilities'.9
Stripped of its anachronistic application of contemporary military
jargon, its shallow scholarship and its unproblematic comparisons
between the United States and previous empires, this document was
essentially a variant on ONA futuristic studies such as Preserving
American Primacy (January 2006) and Preserving US Military Supremacy
(August 2001). The same objectives are shared by the neoconservative
thinktank Project for the New American Century (PNAC) in its 2000 call
for US military transformation, Rebuilding America's Defenses. The PNAC
couples a boyish fascination with sci-fi weaponry with a strident
insistence on the need to preserve US 'primacy', 'geo-political
pre-eminence', 'dominance' and a 'global security order that is uniquely
friendly to American principles and prosperity'.10 This determination to
shape, control and 'dominate' the turbulent and conflict-prone
twenty-first century in the foreseeable (and unforeseeable) future
is a key component of the new military futurism. On the one hand,
military futurism is a by-product of the megalomaniac military doctrine
of 'full spectrum dominance'. At the same time, its predictions about
the future express very real fears amongst the US ruling elite that the
United States is inextricably connected to a world that may be slipping
out of its control. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, the new
military futurists are often considerably more pessimistic than their
predecessors and tend to paint a very bleak future of an unsafe and
unstable world that demands a constant military presence to hold it
together. From Yevgeny Zemyatin's We to Brave New World and Orwell's
Nineteen Eighty-Four, twentieth-century writers have used dystopian
visions of the future as a warning or as a satirical commentary on the
often lethal consequences of twentieth-century utopianism. The
**[dystopias of]{.underline}** the new military futurists have a very
different purpose. The US military often tends to perceive itself as the
last bastion of **[civilisation against encroaching chaos and
disorder]{.underline}**. The worse the future **[is perceived to
be]{.underline}**, the more these **[dark visions of chaos and disorder
serve to justify]{.underline}** limitless military 'interventions',
**[techno-warfare, techno-surveillance and]{.underline}** weapons
procurement programmes, and the **[predictions of the military futurists
are often very grim]{.underline}** indeed.

### 2AC -- Extinction First

#### Extinction outweighs.

Seth D. **Baum &** Anthony M. **Barrett 18**. Global Catastrophic Risk
Institute. 2018. "Global Catastrophes: The Most Extreme Risks." Risk in
Extreme Environments: Preparing, Avoiding, Mitigating, and Managing,
edited by Vicki Bier, Routledge, pp. 174--184.

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? Taken literally, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe. This suggests a rather low threshold for what counts as a global
catastrophe. An event causing just one death on each continent (say,
from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a global catastrophe, because
surely these deaths would be catastrophic for the deceased and their
loved ones. However, in common usage, a global catastrophe would be
catastrophic for a significant portion of the globe. Minimum thresholds
have variously been set around ten thousand to ten million deaths or
\$10 billion to \$10 trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or
death of one quarter of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell
2004). Others have emphasized catastrophes that cause long-term declines
in the trajectory of human civilization (Beckstead 2013), that human
civilization does not recover from (Maher and Baum 2013), that
drastically reduce humanity's potential for future achievements (Bostrom
2002, using the term "existential risk"), or that result in human
extinction (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). A common theme across all these
treatments of GCR is that [some catastrophes are vastly more important
than others]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to recognize
this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983). Without nuclear
winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred million people.
This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity would presumably
carry on. However, with nuclear winter, per Sagan, [humanity could go
extinct. The loss would be not just an additional four billion or so
deaths, but the loss of all future generations.]{.underline} To
paraphrase Sagan, the loss would be billions and billions of lives, or
even more. Sagan estimated [500 trillion lives, assuming humanity would
continue for ten million more years, which he cited as typical for a
successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number **may even be an
underestimate**]{.underline}. The analysis here takes an adventurous
turn, hinging on the evolution of the human species and the long-term
fate of the universe. On these long time scales, the descendants of
contemporary humans may no longer be recognizably "human". The issue
then is whether the descendants are still worth caring about, whatever
they are. If they are, then it begs the question of how many of them
there will be. Barring major global catastrophe, Earth will remain
habitable for about one billion more years 2 until the Sun gets too warm
and large. The rest of the Solar System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and
(if it exists) the multiverse will remain habitable for a lot longer
than that (Adams and Laughlin 1997), should our descendants gain the
capacity to migrate there. An open question in astronomy is whether it
is possible for the descendants of humanity to continue living for an
infinite length of time or instead merely an astronomically large but
finite length of time (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way,
the stakes with global catastrophes could be much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives. Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007),
but they have limited practical significance. [This can be seen when
evaluating GCRs from a standard risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude
framework.]{.underline} Using Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it
follows that reducing the probability of global catastrophe by a mere
one-in-500-trillion chance is of the same significance as saving one
human life. Phrased differently, **[society should try 500 trillion
times harder to prevent a global catastrophe than it should to save a
person's life.]{.underline}** [Or, preventing one million deaths is
equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability of global
catastrophe]{.underline}. This suggests **[society should make extremely
large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives]{.underline}**. Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
society should be willing to spend at least that much to prevent a
global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend at least
\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of
global catastrophe. Thus while reasonable disagreement exists on how
large of a VSL to use and how much to count future generations, even
low-end positions suggest vast resource allocations should be redirected
to reducing GCR. This conclusion is only strengthened when considering
the astronomical size of the stakes, but the same point holds either
way. The bottom line is that, as long as something along the lines of
the standard riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being
used, then even tiny GCR reductions merit significant effort. This point
holds especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
permanent harm to global human civilization. The discussion thus far has
assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is not
universally held. People often value some people more than others,
favoring themselves, their family and friends, their compatriots, their
generation, or others whom they identify with. Great debates rage on
across moral philosophy, economics, and other fields about how much
people should value others who are distant in space, time, or social
relation, as well as the unborn members of future generations. This
debate is crucial for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed, if
each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [While everyone
has the right to their own views and feelings, we find that the
strongest arguments are for the widely held position that all human
lives should be valued equally]{.underline}. This position is succinctly
stated in the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the
1848 Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be
self-evident: that all men and 3 women are created equal". [Philosophers
speak of an agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere" (Nagel 1986) or
a "veil of ignorance" (Rawls 1971) in which each person considers what
is best for society irrespective of which member of society they happen
to be. Such a perspective suggests valuing everyone equally, regardless
of who they are or where or when they live. This in turn suggests a very
high value for reducing GCR,]{.underline} or a high degree of priority
for GCR reduction efforts.

### 2AC -- Extinction Reps Good

#### Preventing existential risk and framing it as a "we" claim is [good]{.underline}.

**Coles and Susen 18**---Research Professor at the Institute for Social
Justice at Australian Catholic University AND Reader in Sociology at the
School of Arts and Social Sciences of City, University of London (Romand
and Simon, "The Pragmatic Vision of Visionary Pragmatism: The Challenge
of Radical Democracy in a Neoliberal World Order," Contemporary
Political Theory May 2018, Volume 17, Issue 2, pp 250--262)

Visionary pragmatism is driven by a political ethos that accents radical
receptivity and a sense that a greater degree of wildness in our efforts
is indispensable for transformative democratic movements. While some of
my earlier works accented the ethical character of receptive generosity
in political life, Visionary Pragmatism argues that [receptivity is
**indispensable** for **generating democratic power**]{.underline} --
precisely [because receptivity involves **vulnerability**,
**relationship formation**, **capacities to modulate**, and **learning
in unexpected ways** amidst **difficult differences**]{.underline}.
Drawing on my engagements with the movement for democratic action
research in Northern Arizona, I argue that [receptive practices
**engender remarkable capacities** for **fostering grassroots critique**
and **alternatives**, **powerful political assemblages across
differences**, and **transformative dynamics** in the face of what
otherwise appear to be **intractable problems**. Our **best** and **most
powerful possibilities** for co-creating urgent democratic change
**almost always advance** along pathways **engendered partly through
relationships of careful attentiveness** to what we **initially took to
be oblique**, **unintelligible** -- or, perhaps, even
**odious**]{.underline}.

For these reasons, my political, theoretical, and pedagogical
engagements move across many different configurations and a wider range
of situations, ideologies, modes, and commitments than most. [Eschewing
a single subject position]{.underline}, in Visionary Pragmatism, I
experiment with first-person plurals in which [the 'we' **morphs** in
relation to the **different loci of initiative**]{.underline} that
animate my reflections. [Sometimes 'we' refers to **proponents of
radical** and **ecological democracy very broadly**, sometimes to
**scholars in higher education**, sometimes to **political
theorists**]{.underline}, sometimes to the action research movement that
formed among people at Northern Arizona University and its community
partners, sometimes to a specific action research team, [sometimes to
**all people facing the possibility of planetary ecological
collapse**]{.underline}. Among the many things I find compelling about
the writing of **[James Baldwin]{.underline}** is how he [shifts his
pronouns **without notice**]{.underline} -- for example, [**sometimes**
using '**we**' to represent **black people**, sometimes as an **uncanny
member of the white-majority United States**. This]{.underline}
rhetorical shiftiness [**encroaches upon** and **pulls his readers** --
**especially white readers** -- **beyond** the '**innocence that
constitutes the crime**' of their **assumed individual** and
**collective white subjectivities**]{.underline} [in ways that work in
**visceral**, **relational**, and **conceptual registers**]{.underline}
(Baldwin, 1992, p. 6). [Such uncertainty has **significant capacity to
erode habits** and **defences**, as one finds oneself **unexpectedly
drawn into perspectives**, **locations**, **energies**, and
**tendencies** that **unsettle** and **reorient one's own
subjectivity**]{.underline}. Much of my work has theorized 'moving
democracy', and my rhetorical shifting of the first-person plural is a
textual practice that aims to enhance this in ways that facilitate
reflection.

Throughout Visionary Pragmatism, I argue that [there are **powerful
reasons for active hope**. At the same time, we **do not live far from
tipping points** beyond which **planetary ecological collapse**,
**globalizing neoliberal fascism**, and **violent chaos** may
**overwhelm our efforts**. I **do not think so much** in terms of
**pessimism** or **optimism** as I do about **seizing** and
**co-creating opportunities** for **catalysing dynamic changes** in
theory and practice that **foster a powerful movement** of **receptive
democracy**, for **complex democratic commonwealth** and **ecological
flourishing**. In one sense]{.underline}, as Walter Benjamin's
discussion of Paul Klee's 'Angelus Novus' makes poignantly clear, [it is
**always 'too late' for so much** and **so many**, as catastrophic
history **keeps piling wreckage at our feet**. **At the same time**,
there are]{.underline} what Benjamin (1968) calls [']{.underline}weak
messianic powers' that emerge as [the **retroactive force** of salvaged
aspects of past struggles **ignite sparks with emerging
struggles**]{.underline} to explode the continuum of progress. [In this
sense]{.underline}, up to our day, [it is **never altogether too
late**]{.underline}. With the language of 'game-transformative
practice', I argue that [a **visionary-pragmatic movement**]{.underline}
of radical democracy [must do something analogous in response to the
**fierce urgency of now**, to **avoid a sixth extinction** in which this
possibility **could well become a casualty**]{.underline}.

#### Priming of existential risk focuses on *[compassion]{.underline}* which results in progressivism 

**Vail et al, 9** (Kenneth E. Vail III, University of Missouri
Department of Psychological Sciences researcher, Jamie Arndt, University
of Missouri psychology professor, Matt Motyl, University of Colorado at
Colorado Springs Masters in Experimental Psychology, and Tom
Pyszczynski, University of COlorado at Colorado Springs professor and
co-developer of terror management theory; \"Compassionate Values and
Presidential Politics: Mortality Salience, Compassionate Values, and
Support for Barack Obama and John McCain in the 2008 Presidential
Election,\" Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, Vol. 9, No. 1,
p. 263-266, IC)

The present findings extend those of Rothschild et al. (2009).
**[Rothschild]{.underline}** et al. **[showed that priming religious
fundamentalists with compassionate values]{.underline}** that were
clearly tied to their religious foundations in either Christianity or
Islam **[led to lower level of support for the use of violence against
Iran among Americans and to less hostile attitudes toward the United
States]{.underline}** (including less support of martyrdom attacks)
**[among Iranians; in the absence of priming these compassionate values,
death reminders led to increased support for violence among both
groups]{.underline}**. The present study goes beyond a religious context
to show that **[in the absence of being faced with compassionate values,
death reminders increased support for]{.underline}** John **[McCain; but
when oriented toward compassionate values, MS increased support for
Barack Obama]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** study also
**[provides convergent support for a growing number of findings that
existential threat is capable of motivating defense of progressive,
prosocial values like tolerance, egalitarianism, and
empathy]{.underline}** (Gailliot et al., 2008; Greenberg et al., 1992;
Rothschild et al., 2009; Schimel et al., 2006). **[Because people
possess a variety of resources for buffering existential fear, terror
management trajectories can be quite malleable]{.underline}**. Thus,
**[increasing the salience of]{.underline}** a particular aspect of
one's cultural worldview, such as **[the prosocial value of compassion,
can motivate increased adherence to this value after reminders of
death]{.underline}**. As such, examining the effects of MS in light of
individual differences in progressive value orientation might be a
useful direction for the future research on the psychology of politics
and/or intergroup relations. For example, emerging research suggests
that **[compassion might be found in the perception of interdependence
among diverse groups of people, helping to reduce or eliminate
reactionary, hostile forms of worldview defense]{.underline}**. Motyl et
al. (2009) report that **[priming a perception of a common humanity
attenuated an increase in anti-Arab prejudice and hostile immigration
policy among Americans reminded of death. This compassionate
perception]{.underline}** of a common humanity **[can]{.underline}**
also **[be observed]{.underline}**, rather ominously, **[in universal
dangers]{.underline}** (i.e., global warming) **[that threaten humanity
as a whole]{.underline}**. In research conducted with both Americans and
Palestinians living in Israel, Pyszczynski et al. (2009) demonstrated
that the **[perception of]{.underline}** such **[global threat bolsters
support for peaceful coexistence in the face of increased death
awareness]{.underline}**. Future research on these values and concerns
might provide useful directions for those seeking peace and political
harmony among groups embroiled in long-standing conflicts. The present
analysis of compassion also offers potential insights into understanding
reactions to other political figures. Weise et al. (2008) found that MS
motivated securely attached adults to support John Kerry instead of
Bush. Given that secure attachment is linked to compassion and empathy
(e.g., Mikulincer et al., 2005), the existentially motivated activation
of secure adult attachment systems may have increased support for Kerry
to the extent that he was perceived as the more compassionate candidate.
However, comparing the current study with Weise et al. suggests a
crucial distinction between the ability of Obama and Kerry to capitalize
on the MS-induced need to achieve psychological equanimity by rigorously
defending culturally cherished values. Whereas both men might very well
have been harbingers of compassion, for Kerry, this may have been
obscured by his relatively dry speaking style and meeker presence;
Obama, on the other hand, wore compassion on his sleeve (Steinhauser,
2008). Thus, it may have been that Obama's frequent, eloquent outbursts
of compassion boosted his support by priming thecultural defense of this
value amid frequent discussion of issues involving reminders of
mortality (e.g., healthcare, Iraqi occupation, Russian invasion of
Georgia, etc.). It is important to note, however, that the present
analysis does not imply that compassionate associations are limited only
to Democratic candidates. Indeed, as the quote which opens this paper
illustrates, then-President George W. Bush co-opted the term
"compassionate conservative" during his second campaign, a move that may
have helped garner support, assuming both that he was perceived as the
more compassionate candidate and that such values were made salient. The
present **[research]{.underline}** also **[contributes to understanding
the nature and specificity of responses to thoughts of
death]{.underline}** (cf, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, & Maxfield,
2006). Like a number of other studies, here we tested the impact of MS
against that of personal uncertainty. **[Proponents of the uncertainty
management model claim that MS effects are actually a result of
increased personal uncertainty, which motivates efforts to regain a
sense of certainty by defending the validity of one's cultural worldview
and confidently adhering to its norms and values (]{.underline}**e.g.,
Van Den Bos, Poortvliet, Marjolein, Miedema, & Van den Ham, 2005).
**[The]{.underline}** present **[study demonstrates that uncertainty
concerns did not impact political preferences, or produce reactions to
cultural values]{.underline}** (e.g., compassion) **[similar to those
triggered by MS]{.underline}**. The recently proposed
**[uncertainty-threat model]{.underline}** (e.g., Jost, Glaser,
Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003) **[claims that uncertainty and mortality
threat both produce a shift toward political conservatism.
Critics]{.underline}** of this model (e.g., Anson et al., in press;
Greenberg & Jonas, 2003), on the other hand, **[have argued that the
motivated social-cognitive foundations]{.underline}** (i.e., dogmatism;
intolerance of ambiguity; personal need for closure, structure, or
order; etc.) **[of political ideology are not limited to a conservative
shift]{.underline}**, but can readily trigger support for progressive
change. **[The present study provides clear and direct evidence for the
latter contention: MS-induced threat is]{.underline}** indeed **[capable
of motivating support for either conservative or progressive
politicians, depending on the values that are salient at the
time]{.underline}**. This idea, however, does raise an interesting
possibility with regard to interpreting the present effects. The
compassionate value statements were designed for this study to directly
emphasize the value of compassion. While the comparison statements were
designed to lack such references, it is possible that these statements
might have been construed as priming wisdom. Previous research (e.g.,
Landau et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2004, 2005) demonstrated that MS
motivated increased support for authoritarian candidates, and for Bush
specifically, without moderating factors such as a wisdom induction.
This is consistent with the notion that Republican candidates tend to
enjoy increased support from those reminded of mortality because these
candidates tend to emphasize American superiority. However, McCain was
considerably older than Obama and held his Senate seat for much longer;
thus, he may have been seen as "wise" relative to Obama's "na¨ıvete." If
this were the case, and if the neutral value condition's statements did
´ prime wisdom, this may have motivated increased support for McCain
after death reminders. While the participants in this study were by no
means representative of the diverse American electorate, they provided
crucial insight into the psychological impact of each candidate's
campaign and even of the candidates themselves. **[Embedded within a
social climate boiling over with death reminders]{.underline}** (e.g.,
war, terrorism, fear-mongering rhetoric, etc.), **[people may latch onto
certain political leaders in an effort to affirm their faith in the
permanence and validity of their particular culture]{.underline}**.
However, it would seem that **[the individual can achieve
this]{.underline}** leader-based worldview defense **[in several
different ways. Depending on the salience of particular cultural values,
a person might be motivated to follow a conservative leader who
rigorously asserts the fundamental superiority of one's
culture]{.underline}** and aggressively "defends" it from the clutches
of evil, **[or they might be motivated to support progressive prototypes
of their more compassionate social values]{.underline}**. As Ernest
Becker (1973, p. 139) concluded, "\[The human\] is a trembling animal
who pulls the world down around his shoulders as he clutches for
protection and support and tries to affirm in a cowardly way his feeble
powers. The qualities of the leader, then, and the problems of people
fit together in a natural symbiosis.

Added-**[value of scenario analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to **fill the gap**
between **IR theory** and **real-world problems**]{.underline}, "an
increasing number of [scholars]{.underline} have come to [embrace a
spirit of **intellectual openness**, recognizing both the need for
**greater flexibility** in the **theoretical formulations** and the
**possibility of complementarity** by **other theories** and
approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12). [This]{.underline} section discusses
the [added value of scenario analysis as a **complementary approach** to
**traditional IR methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious advantage of
**scenario analysis as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [lies]{.underline} by definition [in its
ability to **tackle future events**.]{.underline} As mentioned before,
[there are no specified instruments within traditional IR methods which
would allow scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The
only exception is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which
is, however, distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [this method is helpful for **overcoming** enduring **cognitive
biases**---mental errors such as **linearity**, **presentism**, and
**group think** caused by the **subconscious** and **simplified
information processing of humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111--
112). [Humans have the tendencies to focus on the present at the expense
of the future and to think about the future in linear terms by
extrapolating past trends into the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992)
points out, "we tend to bias our historical and our theoretical analyses
too much toward continuity (...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to
[introduce **discontinuities into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt
to determine what causes them to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if
Gaddis does not explicitly mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts
underlying scenario approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis
attends to "**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions**
about **continuous** and **linear patterns of
development**"]{.underline} (Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The
[**process of scenario development** invites the participants to
**reveal** and **question convictions** which have **so far remained
unchallenged**, and to **question the linearity of world
developments**.]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [foresight helps IR scholars to **exit** the
**tunnel vision** on world affairs and discover potentially valuable
nonlinear lines of development. These can be both **innovative** in
terms of **scholarship**, and **policy-relevant** by offering a
**reflection** on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline} Thus, [it
can facilitate the **intellectual capability** to **think the
unthinkable**]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[innovative research topics **confront the uncertainties** that are
**crucial for policymakers** to be monitored closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[possibility to **accommodate multiple driving forces**, to **take into
account different values** they might take and finally to **combine them
with each other** and **see how they affect the dependent variable**,
makes the scenario approach quite unique. Traditional IR methods work
with a limited number of independent variables]{.underline}, formulate
and test hypotheses usually based on the relation between a single
causal variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex causal
trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background, we
agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and providing academia with a tool for "**actionable
clarity** in **understanding contemporary global issues**"]{.underline}
(p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [scenario analysis can be perceived as a tool towards **more
exchange between academia and policy-making** that can contribute to a
**better understanding between the two** worlds. For policymakers, it
provides the opportunity to consider **long-term trends**]{.underline}
(an occasion not often found in the day-to-day nature of politics). [For
academics, it provides insight into which trends are most concerning for
policy-makers, allowing them to check and ultimately enhance the
**relevance of their research agendas**.]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Fiat Good

#### Fiat is [good]{.underline} \-- foreign policy [simulations]{.underline} teach students how [allies and adversaries]{.underline} respond to [U.S. policy]{.underline} \-- fosters [ideological reflexivity]{.underline}, accurate [policy prediction]{.underline}, and [argumentative agency]{.underline}.

Review*, "NEGOTIATING NONPROLIFERATION: Scholarship, Pedagogy, and

These [government]{.underline} or quasi-government think tank
[**simulations** often provide]{.underline} very similar [**lessons**
for]{.underline} high-level players as are learned by
**[students]{.underline}** in educational simulations. Government
[participants learn about the **importance** of **understanding foreign
perspectives**]{.underline}, the need to practice internal coordination,
[and the **necessity** to **compromise and coordinate**]{.underline}
with other governments in negotiations and crises. During the Cold War,
political scientist Robert Mandel noted how **[crisis
exercises]{.underline}** and war games [forced]{.underline} government
officials to overcome ''bureaucratic myopia,'' moving beyond their
normal organizational roles and thinking more creatively about how
others might react in a crisis or conflict. [The **skills of
imagination** and the subsequent ability to predict **foreign interests
and reactions** remain critical for **real-world foreign policy
makers**]{.underline}. For example, simulations of the Iranian nuclear
crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the Brookings Institution's Saban
Center and at Harvard University's Belfer Center, and involving former
US senior officials and regional experts\*highlighted the dangers of
misunderstanding foreign governments' preferences and misinterpreting
their subsequent behavior. In both simulations, the primary criticism of
the US negotiating team lay in a failure [to **predict accurately** how
**other states**]{.underline}, both [**allies and adversaries**, would
behave **in response** to **US policy initiatives**.]{.underline}

[By **university age**, students]{.underline} often [have a
**pre-defined view** of **international affairs**]{.underline}, and the
literature on simulations in education has long emphasized how such
[exercises **force students** to challenge **their assumptions** about
how other governments **behave** and how their own government
works]{.underline}. Since simulations became more common as a teaching
tool in the late 1950s, educational literature has expounded on their
benefits, from encouraging engagement by breaking from the typical
lecture format, to improving communication skills, to promoting
teamwork. More broadly, [**simulations** can deepen **understanding** by
asking **students** to link **fact and theory**]{.underline}, providing
a context for facts while bringing theory into the realm of practice.
These exercises are particularly valuable in teaching international
affairs for many of the same reasons they are useful for policy makers:
[they force **participants** to ''grapple with the issues arising from
**a world in flux.**]{.underline} Simulations have been used
successfully to teach students about such disparate topics as European
politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US response to the mass killings in
Darfur. Role-playing [exercises]{.underline} certainly [encourage
**students** to learn **political and technical facts**]{.underline}\*
but they learn them [in a **more active style**]{.underline}. Rather
than sitting in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, [students
actively research]{.underline} ''their'' government's positions
[and]{.underline} actively [argue]{.underline}, brief, and negotiate
with others. Acts can change quickly; [**simulations** teach students
how to **contextualize and act** on information]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Debating Nuclear Risk Good 

#### Debating [nuclear risk]{.underline} is good.

**Bernstein '18** \[Aron; September 21st; Emeritus Professor of Physics
at MIT; The Bulletin, "Reducing the risk of nuclear war begins in the
classroom,"
https://thebulletin.org/2018/09/reducing-the-risk-of-nuclear-war-begins-in-the-classroom/\]

The need for education on nuclear weapons. When it comes to nuclear
weapons, the [students]{.underline} of [today have **less lived
experience** to draw on than older generations]{.underline}. [Today's
typical **college student**]{.underline} [was born after the end of the
Cold War]{.underline} and has no memory of a time when most Americans
were deeply afraid of nuclear war (excluding, to an extent, the fiery
exchange of threats between President Trump and Kim Jong-un last year).
Perhaps as a result, these students also have very limited knowledge
about nuclear weapons. [The majority do not have a strong
understand]{.underline}ing of what **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**
[are, their destructive power, or their role in the international
order]{.underline}, [and even fewer have a sense of how many nuclear
weapons exist]{.underline}. They [are not aware of the]{.underline}
\$[1.2 trillion]{.underline} nuclear **[modernization
program]{.underline}**, in which the majority of costs come from
modernizing and improving delivery systems rather than performing the
technically necessary maintenance of the nuclear warheads. [History
education on the Cold War often addresses the US-Soviet arms race of
that time, but nuclear weapons]{.underline} [issues in other
regions]{.underline}---[such as]{.underline} [the tense situation
between India and Pakistan---are rarely ever mentioned. The]{.underline}
distant, but [persistent]{.underline}, [possibility of an
**unintentional nuclear launch**]{.underline} due to unauthorized
access, technical failure, or a cyberattack on warning systems, is also
overlooked, as is general information about which states possess nuclear
weapons [today]{.underline}.

In short, students in the United States (and likely elsewhere) typically
graduate from high school having received almost no information on
nuclear weapons. [It is]{.underline} [generally]{.underline}
[**assumed** that]{.underline} [today's]{.underline} American [public
simply **doesn't care** about the]{.underline}
**[complicated]{.underline}** [and somewhat]{.underline}
**[abstract]{.underline}** [issues of **nuclear weapons** and
**deterrence** because they **rarely affect people's lives
directly**]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, an alternative
explanation exists: [The]{.underline} American [public doesn't know
enough]{.underline} about nuclear weapons [to have much political
opinion on them, **but**]{.underline} [if they had **more knowledge**,
that could **change**]{.underline}. If so, [educating students **on
nuclear weapons**]{.underline} on a large scale [could have the
**long-term effect**]{.underline} [of creating an]{.underline} American
[public that is **politically engaged**]{.underline} [on the
nuc]{.underline}lear [issue and **motivated to hold its elected leaders
accountable**]{.underline} [for implementing nuclear policy that
**reduces the risk of nuclear war**]{.underline}.

For some students, education on nuclear issues may have an impact beyond
just putting nuclear weapons on their radar (pun intended). Today's
[**students** are the **next politicians, scientists, and journalists**,
and some]{.underline} of them [will]{.underline} inevitably [be tasked
with addressing the nuc]{.underline}lear [issue in their
careers]{.underline}. For these students, [early exposure to the
issues]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [in an educational context could
be **useful preparation** for grappling with those issues
professionally]{.underline}. Indeed, [for some]{.underline} students,
[learning about **nuclear weapons** could have a **decisive impact** on
their career trajectory and **inspire them**]{.underline} [to dedicate
themselves to solving **these problems**]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- IR Racist

#### IR isn\'t anti-black \-- it\'s a [minimalist theory]{.underline} to explain the occurrence of [interstate war]{.underline} \-- purity in [scholastic]{.underline} exercises have [zero]{.underline} concrete solvency.

**Wæver &** **Buzan '20** \[Ole and Barry; May 15th; Professor of
International Relations at the University of Copenhagen; Emeritus
Professor of International Relations at the London School of
Economics; KU, "Racism and Responsibility \-- The Critical Limits of
Deep-Fake Methodology in Security Studies: A reply to Howell and
Richter-Montpetit," Racism and Responsibility \-- The Critical Limits of
Deep-Fake Methodology in Security Studies: A reply to Howell and
Richter-Montpetit; GR\]

Racism is a powerful, malignant force in world politics, and our
discipline, IR, has deeply problematic entanglements with it. It is a
serious matter both to come intellectually to grips with this and to
find the most effective strategies to act on it. [We worry
that]{.underline} [more serious **problems**]{.underline} [and
**possibilities** are **marginalised**]{.underline} [by an ultimately
very **inward-looking** and **scholastic exercise**]{.underline} [where
a particular definition of racism and]{.underline} a specific
[theoretical perspective makes it possible to deem the vast majority of
scholarship in IR 'racist', 'methodologically white' and 'antiblack'-
every work that does not explicitly follow one exact version of
anti-racist scholarship]{.underline}. Especially, [the role
played]{.underline} in H&RM's argumentation [by]{.underline} our **[sins
of omission]{.underline}** [does]{.underline} ultimately seem to [rest
on the premise that **only** their **distinct form**]{.underline} [of
scholarship can be redeemed]{.underline}, because even post-colonial
scholarship and critiques of euro-centrism are not enough; [you are a
racist if you do not follow exactly this particular route]{.underline}.
It is not important whether your scholarship actually supports or
hinders anti-racist analysis or political engagement; [it is all about
**who you cite**]{.underline} [and what **declarations you
make**]{.underline}. **[Here]{.underline}**, [a theory is not judged by
**what can be done with it**]{.underline}, [but by the question whether
**self-appointed anti-racists** can find **supposedly problematic
sentences** somewhere in its key texts]{.underline}. In this section, we
will first point out that the H&RM article is a personal attack on us
for racism, despite their reassurances about the opposite. Then, we
discuss what an analysis of structural racism (systems of power) could
amount to, given that they claim to do one but utterly fail to do so,
resorting instead to a pretend examination of the foundations of ST.
Next, we discuss what could be methodological guidelines for actually
proving whether or not a theory like ST is racist.

[H&RM's usage of the term racism for all scholarship that does not
foreground race as the primary theme, means that **99% of IR will be
'racist'**]{.underline}. [There will be **no room** for any other
scholarship]{.underline} (unless you will live with the moniker of being
racist). [Not only does this seem **very unproductive**]{.underline} [in
terms of disciplinary conversations, not to talk of **diversity** and
**pluralism**, it]{.underline} also [means that it becomes **very hard**
to use the category of 'racism' for **critical purposes**]{.underline}
[for those cases where it **actually is at stake**]{.underline} in a
sense closer to what the rest of the discipline, and indeed the public
discourse, means by it. [It has been **watered down**]{.underline} [by
the fact that everyone but those in critical whiteness studies have been
deemed racist]{.underline}, one by one, where we just happened to get
the special honour of being among the first. [H&RM might protest that
this is not their plan, but we **fail to see how this can be
avoided**]{.underline} [when the logic they apply is that the term
racist can be based primarily on **sins of omission**]{.underline} [in
the sense of a theory being focused around other
categories]{.underline}.

As documented above, they claim numerous times that ST 'occludes' or
'refuses' various dynamics relating to race that they find important,
but they never offer any basis for concluding that the theory makes it
harder to see these things, only that it does not as such zoom in on
them. This does not have to do with a choice particularly regarding race
but the structure and nature of the theory as a general analytical
apparatus that can be applied to all instances where actors try to
securitize or desecuritize something, and the user is free then to
include race more or less in this analysis, just as the theory is not
deciding how important nationalism is or gender51, but it enables the
analysis of the way different categories and distinctions become
politically mobilised in security struggles.

[H&RM will probably argue that if you do not mention race in these
contexts, you '**hide' it**]{.underline}. **[Three
answers]{.underline}**: [1) **no**, there is a difference between **not
mentioning** and **hiding**, it takes a step more of the critic to show
that the theory **prevents** something from being
articulated]{.underline} or that it uses abstractions that stand in the
way of articulating race; that certainly is the case for some theories,
so it is a legitimate avenue of critique, but they haven't shown this,
[2) the theory is **intentionally**]{.underline} (as we have explained
numerous times) **[minimalist]{.underline}** in having a clear
conceptual core and then [not putting all kinds of factors like the role
of media or populism into the theory \-- **not** because we haven't
noticed these factors but because they **belong in applications**, and
the theory exactly allows you to study these phenomena, 3) we
are]{.underline} very [explicit that one of the **advantages of a
minimalist theory**]{.underline} [is the ability to **combine it** with
other theories]{.underline} especially general theories [about the
nature and structures of society]{.underline}; one should not build out
ST to become a general theory of society or international relations,
better in any specific usage of the theory combine it with the theories
one finds productive for the particular research project. (Wæver 2011,
2015) The latter point has come up in replies to the 'sociological'
version of ST (Balzacq), which has more of a tendency to add all
relevant factors to the theory, while the classical Copenhagen version
is tight and invites combination with theories that complement it, which
could exactly be theories of race and racism. Our ultimate concern here
is: how do we actually get to study racism in world politics in a
practically and politically helpful way?

When developing our own framework, ST, [we took **care**]{.underline}
[to make sure it could do critical work in concrete analyses, in our
view on racism as well]{.underline}, and H&RM fail to show that this is
not the case. In addition, we have then on a more mundane, human level
engaged ourselves in various ways to foster non-Western scholarship and
theories in IR (Tickner & Wæver 2009; Acharya & Buzan 2010, 2019). One
has for instance co-founded a book-series with the aim to identify
"alternatives for thinking about the 'international' that are more in
tune with local concerns and traditions outside the West" and
"provincializing the West" (quoting from the Routledge homepage of the
book series); the other has amongst many other things re-written this
history of the IR discipline to show both that it has ignored
non-Western contributions and that the Western part of it is indebted to
'scientific racism' (Buzan & Lawson 2015; Acharya and Buzan 2019).
Closer to ST, the project in Buzan & Wæver 2003 was to a large extent to
challenge the euro-centrism enshrined in dominant conceptions of
polarity and of the relationship between global and regional, to enable
theories to be more attentive to actual security dynamics in 'most of
the world'.

Surely, all of these efforts can be critically assessed as to what has
been helpful and what hasn't. But we find it strange that H&RM choose to
ignore completely the possibility of assessing the ability of ST to form
the basis for helpful analyses of racism. They neither look at those
analyses that have actually been done, nor do they show systematically
why it would be impossible to do so. On the contrary, [they limit
themselves to highly abstract and indirect attributions of racism to the
theory as such through various unconvincing routes]{.underline}. From
this they deduce (without any discussion) that ST can't inform studies
of racism (and when it has actually done it, they presumably are able to
magically make those publications go away) (see section 6 below).

[H&RM offer **no explanation**]{.underline} [as to how their type of
analysis helps in combating racism]{.underline}. [It is
**unclear**]{.underline} [if it is a kind of **ground clearing
operation**]{.underline} [to be followed up by new and better theories
after getting us out of the way]{.underline}. [Or whether they believe
that we are so much a part of the oppressive structures that attacking
us is in itself liberating]{.underline}. Or \-- as we will consider
below in more detail \-- the whole exercise is more about making
universities more inclusive and hospitable to students and scholars of
colour. Closely linked to the latter option, [their rationale could be
that the attack is meant more as a kind of 'happening' drawing attention
to the question of race]{.underline}. [Especially in the latter case, it
would be intentional that the article plays ambiguously with making a
very personal attack while pretending not to]{.underline}.

#### IR scholarship regarding the liberal order is [not]{.underline} irredeemably racist

Gideon **Rose 16**, editor of Foreign Affairs, and a member of the
Council on Foreign Relations, March/April 2016, "Review of, 'White World
Order, Black Power Politics: The Birth of American International
Relations,'"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2016-02-16/white-world-order-black-power-politics-birth-american

In this interesting and important yet flawed book, [Vitalis seeks to
bridge the "vast gulf divid\[ing\] international relations from Africana
studies," bringing the "racism \[of the discipline of **i**nternational
**r**elations\] to light]{.underline}." [Conventional narratives of the
field's history, he argues, trace it to the rise of realism and national
security concerns in the years around World War II, adding a few
historical thinkers, such as Thucydides, to claim a timeless
intellectual pedigree.]{.underline} But [this ignores]{.underline} both
the **[extensive mainstream scholarship]{.underline}** [of the first
decades of the twentieth century that dealt with colonialism and racial
issues and the pioneering work of African American writers in what he
calls "the Howard School."]{.underline} Consigning both to the memory
hole, he says, paints a distorted picture of the discipline's origins
and nature, obscuring the role that international relations scholarship
has played in the construction and perpetuation of white Western
dominance. These are major claims, and some of them hold up better than
others. [Vitalis is correct to shine a spotlight on]{.underline} the
forgotten academic work of the first third of the twentieth century and
offers a timely reminder of just [how prevalent racialized thinking was
and how central a role imperialism]{.underline}---**[as opposed to
straightforward great-power relations]{.underline}**---[played in global
affairs]{.underline}. [Back then, for example, "policy relevance" in
political science often meant figuring out how to train good colonial
administrators]{.underline}. Vitalis also provides a service by telling
the story of scholars such as Alain Locke, Ralph Bunche, and Rayford
Logan, enriching readers' understanding of midcentury [intellectual
debates over U.S. foreign policy and tracing]{.underline} how
[racism]{.underline} operated inside various professional institutions.
Vitalis [is]{.underline} **[less convincing]{.underline}**, however, in
casting his analysis [as an indictment of the postwar discipline of
international relations, let alone **its contemporary
incarnation**]{.underline}. To get there, one has to share his politics.
V[italis sees a project of U.S. imperial domination playing out over the
course of the past century, with the "subjection" continuing today,
"through new-old policies of intervention, tutelage, and targeted
killings in new-old zones of anarchy and civilization
deficit."]{.underline} Given such a reading of U.S. foreign policy, it
is not surprising that he believes "the history of ideas, institutions,
and practices \[in the field\] has a constitutive role in their present
forms and functions"---or that he sees today's mainstream international
relations scholars as handmaidens of an evil national security state and
as the direct descendants of their racist predecessors of a century ago.
Scorning the notion that the postwar liberal international order
represents anything particularly new or admirable, Vitalis scores a few
points in noting how long it took for some [earlier social and racial
hierarchies]{.underline}, both international and domestic, to erode. But
he refuses to accept the fact that they [have]{.underline} indeed
**[eroded]{.underline}**. One is left wanting more analysis of how and
why the attitudes and **[patterns of domination]{.underline}** Vitalis
describes [gave way over time]{.underline}, and how the midcentury
theorists and [practitioners of the liberal international
order]{.underline} understood and [handled the paradoxes of its
**halting and inconsistent implementation.**]{.underline}

#### There is no monolithic IR -- the field is [reflexive]{.underline} and [effective]{.underline} -- its [track record]{.underline} of [prediction]{.underline} proves. AND, sweeping criticisms of a fragmented field of research don't answer the [specificity]{.underline} of our studies.

"Scholars Help Policymakers Know Their Tools." War on the Rocks.
8-27-2015.
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/>

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign **policy choices** are
**not sui generis**, there are patterns across space and time that
**inform decision-making**]{.underline}. Policymakers recognize this and
routinely draw lessons from history when making foreign policy
decisions. As noted below, policymakers in other areas such as
development and public health routinely rely on broader, more general
studies to craft policy. And, [**broader scholarship** can **improve**
foreign policy performance, as evidenced by the ability of **IR
academics** to build on their own work to **predict outcomes**,
including for example **forecasting** the lengths of the conventional
and insurgency phases of the U.S.--Iraq conflict in the
2000s]{.underline}. But, even if one were to accept the limits of
general work, there is a growing body of academic work that evaluates
foreign policy tools as applied to a specific country or region. These
studies ask questions such as whether: Development projects reduced
insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone strikes reduced insurgent
violence in Pakistan; Development programs increased civic participation
and social capital in Sudan; Building cell phone towers in Iraq reduced
insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate combatants into society in
Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in Liberia increased the
legitimacy of the government there; Road projects in India reduced
insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's failure in Congo;
Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent attacks from militants.
This is not by any means a dismissal of professional intelligence work.
Academics are not intelligence analysts: They do not have access to
contemporary intelligence data, nor are they generally trained to do
things like examine the latest satellite photos of North Korean nuclear
activities and make judgments about North Korea's current plutonium
production. And certainly, academic IR work can never replace
professional intelligence work. But the best policy decisions marry
timely, specific intelligence with academic work that has a more general
perspective. A third critique is that much of this academic work on
foreign policy tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too
quantitative and technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik
Voeten, [there is a **danger** in **not appreciating** the
**importance** of **rigorous research design**, including sophisticated
**quantitative techniques**, for **crafting effective
policy**]{.underline}. [**Sophisticated research design** is not the
enemy of effective policy, it is **critically necessary** for
it]{.underline}. Certainly, [the current academic focus on building
research designs that permit causal inference speaks exactly to what
policymakers care about the most: if implementing a certain policy will
cause the desired outcome]{.underline}. Or, put differently, [**bad
research** designs make for **bad public policy**]{.underline}. [A
classic example is school busing]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline}
19[60s]{.underline} [and]{.underline} early 19[70s]{.underline}, [some
cities adopted voluntary integration programs for public
schools]{.underline}, in which families could volunteer to bus their
children to schools in neighborhoods with different racial majorities.
[Policymakers used the favorable results for the voluntary programs to
make the improper inference that mandatory busing policies would also
work]{.underline}. [The result was bad public policy and
violence]{.underline} in the streets. [Sophisticated **technical
methods** can improve our ability to make **causal inferences**,
and]{.underline} can help [solve]{.underline} other **[empirical
problems]{.underline}**. Consider that the heart of successful
counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine, winning the
support of the population. [Assessing whether certain policies do win
public support requires collecting opinion data]{.underline}. A
conventional method for measuring popular opinion is the survey, but of
course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas may be unwilling to
reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of fear for their
personal safety. [Methodologists have crafted sophisticated techniques
for addressing this issue, improving our ability to measure public
support for the government in these areas]{.underline}. These techniques
have been used to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.
[Going forward, we will continue to need advanced methodologies to
address pressing policy questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S.
military's commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this
commitment will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science
that address outstanding questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in
which mixed gender units engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective
than male-only units? How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion
in combat? How might mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual
assault, both within the military and of assault committed by troops
against civilians? [Certainly, **other areas** of public policy
understand the importance of rigorous research design]{.underline}.
[Economic and development policy communities read the work of and employ
economics Ph.D.s.]{.underline} [Policymakers incorporate the findings of
sophisticated studies on policy areas such as **microfinance**, **gender
empowerment**, and **foreign aid**, knowing the best policy decisions
must incorporate these studies' findings]{.underline}. Or consider
public health policy. [**Lives are literally on the line** as
decision-makers must make decisions about issues such as
**vaccinations**, **nutritional recommendations**, and **air
quality**]{.underline}. [Policymakers know they must use sophisticated
technical studies executed by epidemiologists and other public health
academics to craft the best policies]{.underline}. Critics will argue
that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from contemporary academic
IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics let go of an obsession
with technique, they will then be better able to connect with
policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree that IR
academics need to find ways to communicate their results in clear,
non-technical language. But [the **technical components** of the work
**need to be there**]{.underline}. [Stripping them out **directly
undermines** the ability of the research to give the **right** kinds of
policy **recommendations**]{.underline}. Let me conclude by noting that
I am sympathetic to the concern that IR academics should think about the
big picture as well as smaller questions, the forest of grand strategy
as well as the trees of foreign policy tools. [**IR academics** have the
potential to **make real contributions** to big picture
**debates**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of grand
strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates foreign
policy means and ends. [The nature of the IR subfield and its
integration of political economy and security, and its ability to think
about structure as well as units, make it especially well positioned to
consider these broad questions]{.underline}. The ability of IR academics
to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of many
reasons why [political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield
of [IR and resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions]{.underline}. Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers
need to know their tools]{.underline}. [**Rigorous IR research** is the
**only way to evaluate them effectively**]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Eurocentric

#### IR's [not intrinsically Eurocentric]{.underline} -- they need to indict [our specific studies]{.underline}, or their vague theoretical cards [just don't apply]{.underline}

Audrey **Alejandro 19**, Assistant Professor at the Department of
Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science, "Western
Dominance in International Relations?", Routledge Publishing,
forthcoming

[Since the **1970s**]{.underline}, [a 'critical' movement has been
developing in the humanities and social sciences denouncing the
existence of]{.underline} '**[Western dominance']{.underline}** [over
the worldwide production and circulation of knowledge]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, [thirty years after the emergence of
this]{.underline} promising [agenda]{.underline} in International
Relations (IR), [this discipline has **not** experienced a]{.underline}
major [shift]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} volume [offers a
counter-intuitive and original contribution to the understanding of the
global circulation of knowledge]{.underline}. **[In contrast to the
literature]{.underline}**, it argues that [the internationalisation of
social sciences]{.underline} in the designated 'Global South' **[is not
conditioned]{.underline}** [by the existence of a presumably 'Western
dominance']{.underline}. Indeed, [although discriminative practices such
as Eurocentrism and gatekeeping **exist**,]{.underline} [their existence
**does not lead to a unipolar structuration of IR
internationalisation**]{.underline} [around 'the West'.]{.underline}
[Based on these empirical results]{.underline}, [this book reflexively
questions the role of critique in the **(re)production of the social and
political order.**]{.underline} Paradoxically, [the anti-Eurocentric
critical discourses **reproduce the very Eurocentrism they
criticise**]{.underline}. This book offers methodological support to
address this paradox by demonstrating how [one can use]{.underline}
discourse analysis and [reflexivity to produce innovative results and
decentre oneself from the vision of the world]{.underline} one has been
socialised into.

### 2AC --Grove

#### Grove is [wrong about everything.]{.underline}

\*note: the identity of the author isn't immediately obvious but he
links his book title in the comments, and you can look that up and it
reveals his identity

[Where I **disagree with the author**, however, is his **very concept of
the 'Eurocene.'**]{.underline} [If the present international state
system **wasn't working** for states across the globe it would be
**dying out**, but **it seems to strengthening**]{.underline}. [There is
**no way** we are getting through what I will remain calling the
anthropocene without **some level of a command economy** for
**resources** and research direction for technologies]{.underline}.
[Many of these resources will be **scare** and will be **competed
over.**]{.underline} [The **competitive nature of the state system**
means something **Darwinistic** is occurring]{.underline}, [which is
good as we do not yet have the answer for surviving our current era and
so **multiple approaches must be tried** and **the best will serve as
models** for others and the worst will die out. I]{.underline} also
**[do not see anything particularly European about modernity
anymore]{.underline}**. [While a new era did begin with the biological
and demographic takeover of the western hemisphere and its forceable
wedding to Europe]{.underline}-previously a minor and not particularly
important subcontinental peninsula of Asia-**[any Eurasian
actor]{.underline}** [could have potentially done the **same
thing**]{.underline}. [The bureaucratic state was first born in
**China**]{.underline} [and the agricultural state came from the
**Middle East**]{.underline}, [and those strike me as **just as
relevant** to where we are now than the maritime-industrial states of
post medieval Europe.]{.underline} Furthermore, [as India and China move
their way into full industrialization]{.underline} on their own terms
[and countries like Japan have long held that position dating back to
the colonial era]{.underline}, [I find **little to argue** for something
called **specifically** 'The Eurocene.']{.underline} That being said,
the author is entirely correct that our currently unsustainable methods
of development are a type of self-replicating virus imposed by force.
But so too will any solutions have to follow that path. It may come as
no surprise that I, a person very into geopolitics (and making
speculative realist geopolitics in particular) also take a more neutral
tone on the field than this author. [I think geopolitics are **as likely
to get us out of this mess**]{.underline} [as they are to dig us
deeper.]{.underline} [Aside from general environmental goals, I see
**little universal** in how we will escape from pollution and mass
extinction and more a variety of paths which depend on the varying
ecologies of different countries]{.underline}. As it is, [some countries
will benefit from climate change and their interests **cannot be said to
be comparable** with those who will suffer.]{.underline} **[A stateless
world is a de facto neoliberal world in practice]{.underline}** [and the
author's fear of political homogenization is not caused by realism or
geopolitics but rather **prevented by those same actors**]{.underline}.
Diversity can only thrive in the absence of grand universal projects. So
our approaches are very clearly different as **[I see realist
geopolitics as the guarantor of ideological, economic, and ecological
diversity, not its foe]{.underline}**. But Grove is an excellent writer
so I enjoyed his take on it anyway.

#### Grove's move is totalizing, preemptive, and cedes the present to fascists 

Benjamin **Tallis 20**, Researcher at Institute of International
Relations Prague, "Un-cancelling the future," New Perspectives 1--18,

[Timeless pessimism, hopeless critique]{.underline} Hope is a Form of
Extortion. (Jairus Grove, Savage Ecology, 2019: 25) Both Rutger Bregman
(2014) and Franco Berardi (2011) have written extensively on this
pessimism. In different ways and with different aims, they argue that
[despite the **huge** and **real**]{.underline} ([although highly uneven
and inequitable]{.underline}) [progress that we]{.underline} (in this
case, many of us who live in the West) [have made in helping more people
live longer, healthier, happier lives, we no longer believe we can
**improve further**]{.underline}. [We have become **collectively
disappointed**]{.underline} [by the **failures** of
**political**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[technological]{.underline}** [vision]{.underline}; [shocked by the
**downsides** of]{.underline} **[modernity]{.underline}**, [stunned by
the **scale** and **complexity** of our challenges]{.underline} [-- and
by the **pace** of **change**.]{.underline} As Jonathan Meades (2014)
observed, [change itself has changed: for many in the West, it used to
mean change for the better2]{.underline} [but for too many people that
is no longer the case.]{.underline} This fear of change itself has
exacerbated the problem, leading to a stasis of ideas, a lack of daring,
deficit of vision and vacuum of purpose. [Even faced with the
existential crisis of climate change, our responses have been
**piecemeal** and **incremental**]{.underline}. Too often even the
bolder proposals have been mealy mouthed or, worse, have framed human
life itself as the problem (e.g. Sparrow, 2019; Wilkinson, 2020). A
pious puritan streak in the environmental movement seems to relish in
the idea of a future of less, a restricted and spartan life, purged of
joy. It has not been widely embraced. Both Bregman and Berardi note that
majorities or significant minorities of people in richer countries have
long believed their children will be worse off than they are (see, e.g.
Pew, 2019) -- but they don't wish to actively spur this process along.
[There has been]{.underline} [no credible]{.underline} **[positive
vision]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[radical change]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[countervail]{.underline}** [this]{.underline}
**[negativity]{.underline}** [and so we drift, **seemingly
helpless**]{.underline} [as well as **hopeless**]{.underline} [in the
**interregnum of ideas**]{.underline}. As Bregman puts it: the real
crisis of our times, of my generation, is not that we don't have it
good, or even that we might be worse off later on. No, [the real crisis
is that we can't **come up with anything better**.]{.underline}
(Bregman, 2014: 22) He goes on to note that [we have become so **wary**
of positive visions of progress that: today we **stamp out dreams of a
better world before they can take root**]{.underline}. [**Dreams** have
a way of turning into **nightmares**]{.underline}, goes the cliche´.
**[Utopias]{.underline}** [are a breeding ground for
**discord**]{.underline}, **[violence]{.underline}**, [even]{.underline}
**[genocide]{.underline}**. Utopias ultimately become dystopias; in
fact, a utopia is a dystopia. (Bregman, 2014: 23) [Examples of this way
of thinking are plentiful but,]{.underline} for convenience, [one need
to look no further than **Jairus Grove's**]{.underline} scintillatingly
pessimistic keynote at the Hamburg Sessions (forthcoming as an essay in
NP and based on his 2019 book, [Savage Ecology]{.underline}).3 [It is
not that Grove doesn't make **compelling**]{.underline} [critical
arguments]{.underline} -- he does and in brilliant, imaginative ways --
[but]{.underline} that [they **lack balance.**]{.underline} And balance
matters, whether we are reckoning with horrendous pasts or trying to
boldly imaging new futures. [To see, or certainly to **dwell
on**]{.underline}, **[only]{.underline}** [the **bad** in what we in the
West have collectively done]{.underline} (however, Grove or anyone else
defines who we are), [over the entire course of our past and present is
**grossly unfair**]{.underline}. [It also amounts]{.underline}, in
effect, [to a **counsel of despair,**]{.underline} [however much Grove
protests to the contrary or **claims to eschew nihilism**]{.underline}.
In his keynote, [having written off our past and present, Grove also
explicitly urged us in Europe and the West **to stop imagining better,
progressive futures**]{.underline}, [arguing that this has led to
precisely the problems he identified]{.underline}. [Grove's critique
thus not only leaves us **out of time**]{.underline} ([without an
**avowable** past, present or future) but also leaves us **without
space**]{.underline} [for **contesting** **negative**, **regressive**
and **repressive**]{.underline} [political trends]{.underline}. In his
book, he laments the 'debilitating stupor' in which the work of thinkers
like Theodor Adorno and Giorgio Agamben leaves us (Grove, 2019: 238).
But [Grove's own pessimism, if we took it seriously, would leave
Europeans **without a political leg to stand on**. It would]{.underline}
[leave us]{.underline} in just such a stupor -- or worse --
[with]{.underline} no solid ground and no lever: [no way to move the
world and no platform for positive, progressive change. Why bother, if
everything we do only makes things worse? However much harm
we]{.underline} Europeans and [Westerners have done, we **haven't**
done, **don't** and won't **only do harm**]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} real [danger of Grove's type of **timelessly
pessimistic** and **literally hopeless**]{.underline} [critique is that
(]{.underline}again, if [taken seriously]{.underline}) [it breeds only
**damaging inertia**]{.underline}, **[inaction]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[resentment]{.underline}** -- [its **hopelessness**
makes it a **debilitating critique**]{.underline}; [its]{.underline}
**[timelessness]{.underline}** [offers **no possibility of
salvage**]{.underline}, [let alone **progress**]{.underline}. [It
**cedes the ground of action** to those]{.underline} [who many of
us]{.underline} (including Grove) [would]{.underline} **[explicitly
disagree with]{.underline}** -- [whether to exponents of '**traditional'
approaches**]{.underline} [to IR who are more than happy to offer policy
advice or, worse, to **authoritarians** and **populists**]{.underline}
[in practical politics]{.underline} (as ably described in Johanna
Sumuvuori's essay in this issue). [Critical scholars]{.underline} too
[rarely see it as their task to construct positive visions of better
worlds]{.underline}. [Instead, too often they content
themselves]{.underline} (if no one else) [with **evermore**]{.underline}
thoroughgoing **[deconstructive critique]{.underline}** -- including of
other critical academics. Whether totalising or parasitic, even some of
its leading proponents admit that [IR's critical project
has]{.underline}, thus far, [had]{.underline} **[insufficient
impact]{.underline}** [on the world at large]{.underline} (Austin, 2017,
2019). Few critical scholars will thank me for this comparison, but, in
their pessimistic, misanthropic zeal, they echo what French President
Emmanuel Macron called the 'sad passions' of the author Michel
Houellebecq4 (Carre\`re, 2017). They may not share Houellebecq's
politics, but many critical scholars certainly share his exhaustive (and
exhausting) disenchantment with contemporary (neo)liberal societies, the
state of Europe and of the West. Too often they also share his
miserabilist outlook on the impossibility of change for the better and
the futility or harm of even trying to improve things. [Grove does
propose several forms of political action:
**micro-kindnesses**]{.underline}, [however vague]{.underline} (e.g.
'the impossible generosity and affirmation of deconstruction', 2019:
231); **[resistant acts]{.underline}** [by **brave
individuals**]{.underline} ([e.g. 'William ''Fox'' Fallon, who
sacrificed his prestigious position as head of \[US Military\] Central
Command]{.underline} because he would not go along with the plan to
attack Iran', 2019: 232); [embracing entirely **new 'forms of
life5**]{.underline} '[; or **welcoming apocalypse as driver of
change**]{.underline} (2019: 229--248). [Grove **will not be confused
with Goldilocks** anytime soon -- these forms of action each seem either
**too little** or (**much**) **too much.** Few of us would question the
**value** of and **need** for **kindness**]{.underline} and, indeed, the
most hopeful part of Grove's book is the touching introduction where he
details many of the kindnesses he has himself benefitted from, mainly
from people in the West where he has spent most of his life. [There is
also, clearly, a role for resistance and for the kinds of acts that
Grove notes have prevented executions and even nuclear war.
**Yet**]{.underline} [without a **wider programme**]{.underline},
[without a **bigger** **positive vision**]{.underline}, [kindness and
resistance **cannot sufficiently change our world for the
better**]{.underline}. [Apocalypse, on the contrary, **changes too
much**]{.underline}, [junks **too much that is good** and is **rarely
likely to be an appealing option**]{.underline}, [or something we can
all get behind. The apocalyptic aspect of Grove's position]{.underline},
like that of many critical scholars, [seeks to inflict destructive harm
on Western institutions rather than constructively reform
them]{.underline} -- something Houellebecq would also relish.
Apocalyptic change also smacks of the recklessly callous, negative sides
of early 20th-century futurism (Marinetti, 1909), as Grove acknowledges
when asking 'How do we go wild without the cruelty of indifference?'
(2019: 280). Again, a more balanced approach to boldness would help. [To
be clear, major change is needed]{.underline} -- that was the whole
point of the Hamburg Sessions and the motivation behind giving it the
theme of 'Un-Cancelling the Future'. I've argued elsewhere that [the
kind of socio-economically regressive, technocratic, defensive
liberalisms that have dominated large parts of the last 40 years in the
West have a lot to answer fo]{.underline}r (Tallis, 2018). So too, of
course, does the type of narrowly, teleological individually atomising
(neo)liberalism that neither saw (Fukuyama, 1992) nor allowed (Fisher,
2009) alternative visions of politics, societies and economies. Mark
Fisher (2009), echoing the artist Gerhard Richter (Elger, 2009), called
this myopic liberalism 'Capitalist Realism'. You don't have to be a
Marxist or even a leftist to see that a mandated lack of alternatives
and a commensurate narrowing of possibilities and horizons is a bad
thing. As noted above, both climate change and sociotechnical upheavals
in the ways we work and live need bold visions to address the challenges
they pose while also seizing the opportunities they present. [It is,
however, **eminently possible** to recognise the **full
horrors**]{.underline} [of Europe's (colonial) pasts and presents
without **immediately discounting** the **possibility of
improvement**]{.underline} [coming from the West]{.underline}, from
Europe. [Similarly, one can recognise the myriad problems that Europeans
have caused while also **celebrating** the many **positive things** they
have also achieved.]{.underline} Moreover, it is possible to use those
achievements as inspirations for better ways of doing things -- as
catalysts to new, progressive creativity and to positive visions of the
future. Just as Kraftwerk did in the [fragile yet fertile Germany of the
second half of the 20th century when they acknowledged the abyss yet
still sought a better future, including as atonement for that
past.]{.underline} The cancellation of the future William Gibson
recently tweeted ''In the 1920s, the phrase 'the 21st Century' was
already popubiquitous. How often do we see the phrase ''the 22nd
Century'', now?''. And it's true -- we don't have these dates anymore.
As a boy, as a young man, I had mental pictures of the 21st Century. But
I don't have any sense of 2050 or 2100 -- except as a deterioration or a
collapse. (Simon Reynolds, Hamburg Sessions 2019, see essay in this
issue) I return to Kraftwerk below but first, a little more is needed on
the ramifications of contemporary hopelessness. [Rather than striving to
create **new** and **compelling** **positive**]{.underline},
**[progressive]{.underline}** [visions, many thinkers **content
themselves with critique**]{.underline} (Austin, 2017) while
[others]{.underline}, [like Grove, see **positive**, **progressive**
visions and **futures**]{.underline} -- [especially those coming from
Europe or the wider West -- as being **necessarily harmful in
themselves. This is postmodernism as hangover**]{.underline}. [The
depressed]{.underline} -- and depressing -- [aftermath of the
**shortcomings**]{.underline}, **[broken promises]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[unintended consequences]{.underline}** [of
modernisms of different kinds,]{.underline} in which strange connections
are made and selective, **[guilty memory runs amok]{.underline}**
(Fisher, 2014). **[Forgetting the good,]{.underline}** [it fuses the
bewitchingly pertinent]{.underline} [aspects of the post-positivist
critical project]{.underline} (which influenced many of us, myself very
much included), [with more zealously **(self-)destructive** and
**paralysing tendencies**]{.underline}. As Fisher puts it:
'Deconstruction \[is\] a kind of pathology of scepticism, which induced
hedging, infirmity of purpose and compulsory doubt' (2014: 16). In this
mode, [scholarship]{.underline} [no longer seeks to **invent the train**
but **fixates** on the **train crash**]{.underline} [or even
**pre-empts** and **precludes the train's invention** for fear of the
**seemingly inescapable** **imagined** **train crash to
come.**]{.underline} [Like Grove's denunciation of the future, many of
the critiques of (popular) modernisms are not so much **wrong** as
**imbalanced**]{.underline} (although some are wrong of course, others
not even). [They take **insufficient account** of modernisms'
**multiple** and **meaningful** **successes**]{.underline} (there's no
time here, but see, e.g. Fisher, 2014: 22; or Meades, 2014, for a
flavour). This leaves us in an odd situation where [many]{.underline} of
the [scholars]{.underline}, commentators and others who criticise
neoliberalism, capitalist realism and so on[, find themselves in de
facto agreement with its notion that there should be **no
alternative**]{.underline}. In this view, [we **simply shouldn't do big
vision politics** because our 'schemes to improve the human condition'
have not only 'failed' but will **always**, **inevitably**, **do more
harm than good**]{.underline} (Scott, 2008). [This
approach,]{.underline} all post and no modern, [will take us
**nowhere**]{.underline}, **[even as it fast-forwards the academic
careers of its exponents]{.underline}**. The future visions that are
left, on the left, tend to be Marxist ones (see, e.g. Grove, 2019: 198--
202). Tarred not only by the brush of the communisms that actually
existed (and their distinctly less balanced ledger than that of
modernism more widely) they understandably fail to inspire mass
enthusiasm. Many of their proponents are still really more interested in
explaining the failure to bring about the inevitable (full communism) in
the past and present than in imagining new futures that go beyond the
narrow world view and limiting subjectivity of too many Marxist
approaches (see, e.g. Scribner, 2003; Sˇitera, 2015). This has done
little to address the crisis of hope or to countervail prevalent
contemporary pessimism. [The **loss of the belief** in the]{.underline}
**[progressive future]{.underline}** -- [that **tomorrow** can be
**better** than yesterday and today -- and the related erosion of faith
in our ability to **positively shape our own destiny**]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} what Berardi (2011: 13) called '[the slow cancellation
of the future']{.underline}. As Simon Reynolds noted in his Hamburg
Sessions keynote (included in this issue of NP), the cancellation may
have started slowly in the 1970s, but, by the 2000s, it had picked up
speed and its effects could start to be seen. The first of these -- its
more (neo)liberal variant -- was the feeling of living in an endless
present. For a lot of people in the West, this has been comfortable in
many ways (although often unevenly and unfairly) and has had distinct
advantages over the past (the extension of rights and opportunities to
broader swathes of the population) but without much hope, optimism or
greater purpose. Unless it provokes the nostalgic responses outlined
below, [this **endless present** can lead to a sense of
**ennui**]{.underline}, [a **lack of direction** and **loss of
momentum**]{.underline}. [The second, more overtly
**sinister**]{.underline}, [variant that **fills the vacuum** left by
the **dearth**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[positive]{.underline}**,
**[progressive]{.underline}** [visions for the future takes the form of
**darker re-enchantments** focused on the (**imagined)
past**]{.underline} (e.g. Campanella and Dassu\`, 2019). [Whether
'**making America great again'**]{.underline}, '**[taking back
control']{.underline}** [in the United Kingdom or claiming to offer an
'**alternative for Germany'**]{.underline}, [these movements are
fundamentally premised on a **backward-looking politics**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[nostalgia]{.underline}**. [The **pessimism about the
present** and **worries about the future**]{.underline} [on which these
movements have each capitalised have given rise to an **increasingly
defensive**]{.underline} [politics of **closing down** and
**protecting**]{.underline}, [at the expense of opening up and
integrating]{.underline}. **[Nativism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[pessimism]{.underline}** **[tend to go hand in hand]{.underline}**:
[shrinking pies bring narrowed]{.underline} [horizons and hasten the
circling of wagons around exclusive and chauvinistic visions of national
communities]{.underline}. Too often, this retro-rightism has been met
only with retro-leftism or a tired centrism that merely seeks more of
the same, to smooth the endless present. But that can change \...

### 2AC -- Nation State

#### Analysis through nation-states and security is good. 

Robin **Luckham 17**, an Emeritus fellow at the Institute of Development
Studies, University of Sussex, where he has been based since 1974.
Following the publication of his book The Nigerian Military in 1971, he
has researched and published extensively on civil-military relations,
militarism, political violence, democratisation, security and
development, security sector governance, security 'from below' and
peacebuilding. Whose violence, whose security? Can violence reduction
and security work for poor, excluded and vulnerable people?
2017.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21647259.2016.1277009

6\. The two faces of security -- and of peace [Security]{.underline},
especially [state security, tends to be enacted in contexts of the
violently contested **political authority**]{.underline}. [Often it is
enacted through **violent power**]{.underline}, rebranded as legitimate
force. Small wonder that some in the development community, including
those who drafted SDG 16, hesitate to use the word at all. [But
**although** security is a **deeply disputed** idea, it is also a
**highly necessary** one]{.underline}. [Security functions
simultaneously as an analytical construct, as a **frame for policy** and
as a **moral narrative**]{.underline}. It is distinct from the equally
ambiguous if less contentious concept of peace. Yet, at the same time,
[it is]{.underline} often seen as [**essential** to the preservation of
**peace**]{.underline}. Most of the things that international
decision-makers, political and security elites and development
practitioners do in security's name are supposed to protect the safety
and welfare of people in a world of multiple challenges and threats.
However, [there is a tendency to slide from **global**, to **national**,
to **citizen** and to human security and back again, without enough
serious reflection on how they **interconnect**]{.underline} and on
where tensions and contradictions lie hidden. Development agencies have
too often plunged into security policies and programmes, without a clear
understanding of where they might lead, who would benefit and how they
might go wrong. The ambiguities stem in part from a deep-seated tension
between two distinct visions of security (summarised in Table 3), which
interconnect, yet are in deep tension with eachother. [On the **one
hand**]{.underline}, [security can be seen as a process of political and
social ordering, aiming to reduce violence and keep the
peace]{.underline}. As such it is territorially organised and kept in
place globally as well as nationally through the authoritative
discourses and practices of power, including socially sanctioned
violence. [It connects to conceptions of what Galtung termed 'negative
peace': the ending of overt violence, without necessarily **transforming
the conditions** giving rise to this violence]{.underline} [or attending
to the **quality** of the **subsequent peace**]{.underline}. In this
view security is a public good delivered in principle by states, much
like official or donor-driven development.29 Yet in a world where states
and indeed the international order face sustained challenges, security
is often kept in place also through alternative nonstate or 'hybrid'
networks of violence and protection.30 Moreover, security is far from
being an unalloyed public good. In principle, it is equally shared and
socially inclusive, even if in practice it is anything but, especially
at the insurgent margins where insecurity is most acute. For [in
practice it protects **socially embedded power**, established property
relations and **social privilege** -- and reinforces global, national
and local **inequalities**]{.underline}. [On the **other hand**,
security can be seen]{.underline} (in the vernacular) [as an
**entitlement of citizens**]{.underline} and more widely human beings
[to **social peace** and **protection from violence**, abuses of
**rights** and **social injustice**, along with other **existential
risks** such as **famine** or **disease**]{.underline}. [It connects to
the idea of '**positive peace'**, including **transformations** in the
social conditions giving rise to violence and deepening the
**relationships between states and** their **citizens**]{.underline}.
The vernacular understandings, day-to-day experience, resilience and
agency of the people and groups who are 'secured' and 'developed' are in
this view the touchstone by which to evaluate security and violence
reduction[. Most people **fall back** upon their **social identities**
-- as women and men, members of families, clans, castes, ethnic groups,
sects, religions and nationalities -- to navigate their social worlds,
to **respond to insecurity**]{.underline} and violence and (sometimes)
to organise for violence. At the same time, [these **identities** are
**written into** the **structures of power and
inequality**]{.underline}, [being deployed to **establish hierarchies of
citizenship** and **patterns of exclusion**]{.underline}. Ensuring that
security is inclusive and not simply the security of particular groups
or the property of the well-armed, powerful and wealthy, is fraught with
difficulty and must be negotiated at multiple levels. 'Security in the
vernacular' is the term used here rather than the interlinked but
distinct concepts of 'human security' and of 'citizen security'
popularised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
World Bank,31 which fit in the conceptual toolboxes of development
practitioners, humanitarian agencies and intervention forces. Both human
and citizen security have come under criticism for 'securitising'
development by framing poverty, exclusion and vulnerability through
security lenses, and thus paving the way for military interventions in
the affairs of fragile states.32 '[**Security in the vernacular'** paves
the way for more precise and detailed empirical scrutiny of how security
and plays out in particular local and national contexts. It highlights
the experience and social agency of those who are 'secured'. And it
underscores the transformative potential of security as an
**entitlement**]{.underline}, [which can be **actively claimed** by
those who **challenge** the **deeply rooted legacies** of
**insecurity**, **exclusion** and **injustice**]{.underline}. Both these
faces of security have their underside, most obviously the first.
'Seeing like a state' even with the best of intentions can lead to the
interests of citizens being sacrificed to an unbending vision of
national security or of top-down development (as even in Nyerere's
Tanzania).33 It is also open to abuse -- for instance, to prop up
authoritarian regimes; to advance the interests of predatory elites; to
impose exclusionary economic and social policies; to justify state
secrecy and surveillance of citizens; or to justify the hegemonies and
military adventurism of major world powers. And it tends to be closely
if complexly related to 'seeing like a corporation', most obviously in
enclave economies, where privatised security arrangements in protected
enclaves may indeed destabilise or weaken the state.34 The
[**deformations** of **security in the vernacular** tend to be more
hidden]{.underline}, but no less damaging -- for instance, [the
submission of minorities and refugees to campaigns of exclusion and
violence by populist majorities]{.underline}; [forms of **popular
justice** that **violate the rights**]{.underline}, dignity and safety
of supposed perpetrators; or grass roots endorsement of 'traditional' or
customary institutions, which perpetuate gender and other inequities.
Moreover, local-level insecurities can persist or even worsen, when a
state, like India or Brazil, is considered to be stable, or a region or
locality is considered to be secure. Neither face of security can be
considered without the other. The relationship between them is utterly
crucial. The capacity of states to protect their citizens is at the
basis of the social contract.35 That is, [the rights and security of
citizens]{.underline} and people [are the bedrock of state and
international security -- or at least they **should be**]{.underline}.
But [these entitlements cannot be protected without some kind of
**social order**]{.underline}, however achieved. [And how and by whom
social order is assured are both **affairs of governance** and **vital
concerns** for **everyone** who lives under the **leaky umbrella** of
**political authority**]{.underline}. **[Political
stability]{.underline}**, **[durable institutions]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[rule of law]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[effective and accountable security apparatuses]{.underline}**
**[are]{.underline}** not just **[desirable attributes of
states]{.underline}** but are also in many respects conditions of the
security of people. However, [they **come at a price**]{.underline}, not
just in taxes, but also [because of the need for **constant vigilance**
to ensure that those charged with delivering security do not ignore or
still worse violate the entitlements of those they are supposed to
protect]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Heg Bad

#### Pursuit's inevitable

**Mearsheimer 11** John J. Mearsheimer, the "R. Wendell Harrison
Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University
of Chicago" Jan/Feb 2011 "Imperial By Design"
http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0059.pdf

[The downward spiral the United States has taken was anything but
inevitable. Washington has always had a choice in how to approach grand
strategy. One popular option among some libertarians is
isolationism.]{.underline} This approach is based on the assumption that
there is no region outside the Western Hemisphere that is strategically
important enough to justify expending American blood and treasure.
Isolationists believe that the United States is remarkably secure
because it is separated from all of the world's great powers by two
giant moats---the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans--- and on top of that it
has had nuclear weapons---the ultimate deterrent---since 1945. But in
truth, [**there is really no chance that Washington will adopt this
policy**,]{.underline} though the United States had strong isolationist
tendencies until World War II. For since then, [an internationalist
activism, fostered by the likes of the Rockefeller Foundation, has
thoroughly delegitimized this approach. American policy makers have come
to believe the country should be militarily involved on the world
stage]{.underline}. Yet though no mainstream politician would dare
advocate isolationism at this point, the rationale for this grand
strategy shows just how safe the United States is. This means, among
other things, that it will always be a challenge to motivate the U.S.
public to want to run the world and especially to fight wars of choice
in distant places. [Offshore balancing]{.underline}, which was America's
traditional grand strategy for most of its history, [is but another
option]{.underline}. Predicated on the belief that [there are three
regions of the world that are strategically important to the United
States]{.underline}---Europe, Northeast Asia and the Persian Gulf---[it
sees]{.underline} [the United States' principle goal as making sure no
country dominates any of these areas as it dominates the Western
Hemisphere]{.underline}. This is to ensure that dangerous rivals in
other regions are forced to concentrate their attention on great powers
in their own backyards rather than be free to interfere in America's.
The best way to achieve that end is to rely on local powers to counter
aspiring regional hegemons and otherwise keep U.S. military forces over
the horizon. But if that proves impossible, American troops come from
offshore to help do the job, and then leave once the potential hegemon
is checked. [Selective engagement also assumes that Europe, Northeast
Asia and the Persian Gulf are the only areas of the world where the
United States should be willing to deploy its military might. It is a
more ambitious strategy than offshore balancing in that it calls for
permanently stationing U.S. troops in those regions to help maintain
peace]{.underline}. For selective engagers, it is not enough just to
thwart aspiring hegemons. It is also necessary to prevent war in those
key regions, either because upheaval will damage our economy or because
we will eventually get dragged into the fight in any case. An American
presence is also said to be valuable for limiting nuclear proliferation.
But [none of these strategies call for Washington to spread democracy
around the globe---especially through war. The root cause of America's
troubles is that it adopted a flawed grand strategy]{.underline} after
the Cold War. From the Clinton administration on, the United States
rejected all these other avenues, instead pursuing global dominance, or
what might alternatively be called global hegemony, which was not just
doomed to fail, but likely to backfire in dangerous ways if it relied
too heavily on military force to achieve its ambitious agenda. Global
dominance has two broad objectives: maintaining American primacy, which
means making sure that the United States remains the most powerful state
in the international system; and spreading democracy across the globe,
in effect, making the world over in America's image. The underlying
belief is that new liberal democracies will be peacefully inclined and
pro-American, so the more the better. Of course, [this means that
Washington must care a lot about every country's politics. With global
dominance, no serious attempt is made to prioritize U.S. interests,
because they are virtually limitless. This grand strategy is "imperial"
at its core]{.underline}; its [proponents believe]{.underline} that the
[United States has]{.underline} the right as well as the [responsibility
to interfere in the politics of other countries]{.underline}. One would
think that such arrogance might alienate other states, but most American
policy makers of the early nineties and beyond were confident that would
not happen, instead believing that other countries---save for so-called
rogue states like Iran and North Korea---would see the United States as
a benign hegemon serving their own interests.

[The finding that]{.underline} U.S. [entanglement is rare **has
important implications for international relations
scholarship**]{.underline} and U.S. foreign policy. For scholars, **[it
casts doubt on classic theories of imperial overstretch]{.underline}**
in which great powers exhaust their resources by accumulating allies
that free ride on their protection and embroil them in military
quagmires.22 [The U.S. experience instead suggests that **great powers
can dictate the terms of their security commitments and that allies
often help their great power protectors avoid strategic
overextension.**]{.underline} For policy, [the rarity of U.S.
entanglement suggests that the United States' current grand strategy of
deep engagement]{.underline}, which is centered on a network of standing
alliances, does not preclude, and [may]{.underline} even
[facilitate]{.underline}, U.S. **[military restraint]{.underline}**.
Since 1945 the United States has been, by some measures, the most
militarily active state in the world. [The most egregious cases of U.S.
overreach]{.underline}, however, **[have stemmed not from
entangling]{.underline}** alliances, [but from the penchant of American
leaders **to define national interests expansively**,]{.underline} to
overestimate the magnitude of foreign threats, and to underestimate the
costs of military intervention. Scrapping alliances will not correct
these bad habits. In fact, [disengaging from alliances may unleash the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to intervene
recklessly]{.underline}** abroad [while **leaving it without partners**
to share the burden **when those interventions go awry**.]{.underline}

#### Even if they win an epistemology DA---explaining the absence of war among great powers means making *[relative]{.underline}* not *[absolutist claims]{.underline}*---winning heg bad requires them to *[defend an alternative]{.underline}*

William **Wohlforth 12**, Daniel Webster Professor in the Department of
Government at Dartmouth College, "Nuno Monteiro. "'Unrest Assured: Why
Unipolarity is not Peaceful.' Reviewed by William Wohlforth" October
31st, http://www.h-net.org/\~diplo/ISSF/PDF/ISSF-AR17.pdf

Third, setting up the article as a claim that unipolarity is not
peaceful runs into a problem: **[Unipolarity is peaceful. The Most
Peaceful. Ever. Period]{.underline}**. No one expects any imaginable
anarchic inter-state system to be perfectly peaceful, with no war at
all. In my 1999 paper, I stressed that "[unipolarity **does not imply
the end of all conflict**\... It simply means the absence of two big
problems" --- hegemonic rivalry and counter-hegemonic balancing---that
were present in all earlier systems. As a result "unipolarity favors the
absence of war among the great powers." Like any statement]{.underline}
[about the war-proneness of any international system, **this is a
relative claim**.]{.underline} [International relations scholarship does
not have theories that make anything other than relative predictions
about the war-proneness of systems]{.underline}. [Monteiro tries but
fails to escape this reality. He writes: "Rather than assess the
relative peacefulness of unipolarity vis-à-vis bipolar or multipolar
systems, I identify causal pathways to war that are characteristic of a
unipolar system and that have not been developed in the extant
literature (12). The latter portion of this sentence is exactly right,
but the former bit is contradicted just a few pages later when Monteiro
presents evidence that "Unipolarity is the most conflict prone of all
systems .. ." (18). While conflict researchers debate the causes, they
are nearly united in agreeing that the post-1990 international system is
**the least afflicted by war**.5 **There are many ways to measure**
war]{.underline}

[: the overall number that occur, the number of people killed, the
probability that any state will be at war in any year, the size or cost
of military forces compared to economic output or population, or,
perhaps best, the probability that any individual will die as a result
of organized inter-group violence. **By all those measures, we are
living in the most peaceful period**]{.underline} since the modern
inter-state system took shape in the seventeenth century. Indeed,
Stephen [Pinker assembles masses of evidence to suggest that **there has
never been a less violent time in all of human history**.6 It is hard to
think of any way to measure war that does not show the unipolar period
as remarkably peaceful--- except for the ones Monteiro uses: "the
percentage of years that great powers spend at war, and the incidence of
war involving great powers," (18) with the United States defined as the
only great power after 1990. That is a very convoluted way to say 'Iraq
and Afghanistan.' **The fact that the United States ended up in two
grinding counter-insurgency operations in no way contradicts the claim
that unipolarity is unprecedentedly peaceful.**]{.underline} But that
reaction concerns the framing rather than the substance of the article.
[One can dismiss as America-centric the claim that unipolarity is
war-prone and still regard Monteiro's carefully]{.underline} [crafted
arguments as promising advances]{.underline}. Further investment in
refining and evaluating these arguments is warranted, for [even if we
agree that unipolarity has been pretty darned peaceful, it surely
doesn't seem that way to anyone in or around the U.S.
military]{.underline}. [Along with most security scholars]{.underline},
[I've regarded the post-1991 military interventions as permitted **but
not dictated by unipolarity**]{.underline}. [That **at least leaves open
the possibility of strategic learning**, as happened]{.underline} [back
in biplolarity]{.underline}. Even though the bipolar structure and U.S.
grand strategy remained constant, [bloody conflicts in **Korea and
Vietnam** prompted Washington to get out of the direct military
intervention business in favor of proxy wars]{.underline} and less
costly covert operations. Similarly, [the new "Iraq syndrome" might
**tame interventionist impulses** even as unipolarity
endures]{.underline}. But Monteiro's message is gloomier. "The
significant level of conflict the world has experienced over the last
two decades," he warns, "will continue as long as U.S. power remains
preponderant." (38). That's a scary message even if that "significant
level" is far lower than in any other known interstate system. So while
I hope Monteiro is wrong, there is no doubt that his article has
decisively altered the terms of the debate on this crucial issue.

### 2AC -- China Threat Con

#### Empirically disproven.

Tenzin **Dorjee 21**. Senior researcher at Tibet Action Institute and a
PhD candidate in the political science department at Columbia
University. \"Opinion: Anti-China is not anti-Asian\". Washington Post.
4-6-2021.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/06/anti-china-is-not-anti-asian/

However, [some]{.underline} commentators [are arguing that the U.S.
foreign policy establishment's criticism of the Chinese government is to
blame for the domestic problem of anti-Asian violence]{.underline}. This
specious claim, which China's state-run media quickly exploited, has
been most prominently advanced in the mainstream Western media by
distinguished novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen and political scientist Janelle
Wong, who claim that "bipartisan political rhetoric about Asia" and
successive administrations' "critical takes" on China fuel anti-Asian
violence. This narrative, which weaponizes Asian American vulnerability
to shield Beijing from international criticism, is as dangerous as it is
fraudulent.

First of all, let's be clear that [there is no bipartisan political
rhetoric targeting Asia]{.underline}, a continent of nearly 50 nations.
[Conflating Asia with China is the geopolitical equivalent of assuming
all Asians are Chinese, precisely the **kind of racial lumping that the
writers themselves sensibly caution against**.]{.underline}

To be sure, criticism of the Chinese government by policymakers in
Washington has escalated in recent years. But [the overwhelming volume
of the rhetoric targeting Beijing has been prompted not by abstract
geopolitical competition but by tangible grievances, including China's
**genocide in Xinjiang**]{.underline}, intensifying **[repression in
Tibet, dismantling of democracy in Hong Kong and sweeping crackdown on
Chinese civil society]{.underline}**. [Some of Beijing's harshest
critics are Asian Americans]{.underline}. [Uyghur refugees, Hong Kong
democrats, Chinese dissidents and Tibetan exiles such as
myself]{.underline}, whose communities back home reel under Beijing's
boot, [are **urging Congress to censure China for its
crimes**]{.underline}. [Asking lawmakers of conscience to hold their
tongue on Beijing's genocide to supposedly prevent racial violence here
is to set up a **false trade-off between Asian American safety and
Uyghur lives**, both of which should be treated as
**nonnegotiable**.]{.underline}

Moreover, **[there is no research-based evidence that American
lawmakers' legitimate criticism of Beijing has a causal effect on
violence against Asians]{.underline}**. In fact, [Washington's political
rhetoric has been rising steadily over the past half decade, during
which Beijing built the **Uyghur internment camps**, demolished **Hong
Kong's democracy** and chipped away at the **liberal international
order**]{.underline}. **[Anti-Asian attacks remained rare]{.underline}**
[during this whole period, soaring only when the pandemic
hit]{.underline}. [If China had contained covid]{.underline}-19 within
its borders, or if the United States had succeeded in keeping it out,
[no amount of congressional criticism against Beijing would have made us
afraid to ride the subway at night.]{.underline}

[market reforms, the Chinese people **experienced the fastest increase
so far in their standard of living.**]{.underline}

#### Competition rhetoric doesn't cause their impacts. 

David **Shim 14**. Assistant Professor at the Department of
International Relations and International Organization of the University
of Groningen, Netherlands. 2014. "Visual Politics and North Korea:
Seeing is Believing." Routledge, pg. 25-26.

However, [particular representations **do not automatically lead to
particular responses** as, for instance, proponents of the so-called
\'CNN effect\' would argue]{.underline} (for an overview of the debates
among academic, media and policy-making circles on the \'CNN effect\',
see Gilboa 2005; see also, Dauber 2001; Eisensee/Stromberg 2007;
Livingston/Eachus 1995; O\'Loughlin 2010; Perlmutter 1998. 2005;
Robinson 1999, 2001). [There is **no causal relationship** **between a
specific image and a political intervention**]{.underline}, [in which a
dependent variable]{.underline} ([the image]{.underline}) [would explain
the outcome of an independent one]{.underline} ([the act]{.underline}).
David [Perlmutter]{.underline} (1998: l), for instance, [explicitly
challenges, as he calls it, the \'visual determinism\']{.underline} [of
images, which dominates political and public opinion]{.underline}.
[Referring to findings based on public surveys]{.underline}, [he argues
that the formation of opinions]{.underline} by [individuals depends
**not on images** but on their idiosyncratic predispositions and
values]{.underline} (see also, Domke ct ah 2002; Perlmutter 2005). Yet,
[it should also be noted that visuals function as unquestioned
referents]{.underline} in international politics [when underlining the
necessity of such specific policy practices as sanctions,]{.underline}
deterrents and/or military cooperation. A good example of this is
satellite imagery, which plays a pivotal role in the surveillance and
assessment of missile or nuclear proliferation activities by so-called
\'rogue states\' like Iran and North Korea. [Regarded as providing
compelling evidence about the stage of development]{.underline} of
nuclear facilities [or about the collaboration between suspect states,
satellite images point to a nexus between visuality, knowledge and
international politics]{.underline} wherein this way of seeing
consequently enables governments to make legitimate statements, draw
conclusions and take informed political action. In sum, [the visual
provides the foundation for knowledge generation and. in doing so,
bestows political responses with legitimacy]{.underline} (cf. Moller
2007). A now famous case-in-point is Colin Powell\'s PowerPoint
presentation at the United Nations Security Council in February 2003. In
the briefing, the then US Secretary of State showed satellite images
that allegedly proved the existence of Iraqi \'Weapons of Mass
Destruction\'. What was remarkable about Powell\'s presentation was that
the visual emerged as the primary referent for the US government\'s
casus belli, which, in the words of MacDonald ef ai (2010: 7-8),
disclosed the fact that the \'logic of geopolitical reason is now
inseparable from its visual representation\' (see also, Campbell 2007c;
Der Derian 2001). [The causal theory of the \'CNN effect\',]{.underline}
[or what Perlmutter]{.underline} (1998: 1) [has called above \'visual
determinism\', misconceives of how the visual recasts the political
realm itself]{.underline} (Hansen 2011[). Rather than asking whether an
image caused an intervention]{.underline}, [it should be asked instead
how the visual has been involved in structuring the understandings of
**legitimate action**]{.underline}, [and how visual representations of
different policy options affect particular security practices
(]{.underline}Williams 2003: 527). For instance, [many scholars have
shown that images can provoke particularly emotive
responses]{.underline} (Bleiker/Hutchison 2008; Crawford 2000;
Hariman/Lucaites 2007; Mercer 2006; Ross 2006). Just one example of the
(deliberate) evocation of an emotional reaction is the numerous
fundraising campaigns that have been run by different humanitarian aid
organizations over the years, in which imagery plays an essential role
(Bell/Carens 2004; Dogra 2007; Manzo 2008).

[The United States **must compete with China**]{.underline} and
**[confront the Chinese government]{.underline}** on a range of issues
[while simultaneously **combating the rise of anti-Asian
racism**]{.underline} at home. [These two missions are **not at odds
with each other**]{.underline}, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
would have you believe. In fact, [they]{.underline} must [go **hand in
hand**]{.underline}. In Alaska last weekend, Chinese government leaders
sought to stoke our country's racial divisions, accusing the United
States of having "slaughtered" African Americans, to deflect criticism
over Beijing's mass atrocities against its Uyghur Muslim population.
Meanwhile, [CCP propaganda outlets have been using the
killing]{.underline} last week in the Atlanta area [of]{.underline}
eight [innocent]{.underline} people (six of them [Asian]{.underline})
[to cast aspersions on those who are condemning the Chinese government's
atrocities]{.underline}. [Beijing's goal is to **conflate and
confuse**]{.underline} two **[related but distinct
issues]{.underline}**: [challenging the Chinese government
and]{.underline} the need to [fight racism]{.underline} in the United
States. But [their gambit amounts to **presenting a false choice**
between doing one or the other.]{.underline} "[It is part of a broader
strategy that the Chinese Communist Party is enacting to **undermine our
democracy**]{.underline}," Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) told me in an
interview. "So [when you see them creating that **false
equivalency**]{.underline} . . . [it is their way to **sow
discord**]{.underline} in our society, because [they understand when we
are not united, we are weaker]{.underline} in leading the world [in
confronting]{.underline} their [bad behavior]{.underline}." Murphy, a
former Pentagon official who came to the United States as a child
refugee from Vietnam, said that the use of racist language by former
president Donald Trump and other GOP officials plays into the CCP's
hands. Yet at the same she emphasized that [U.S. leaders have to be able
to **speak**]{.underline} honestly and **[critically about the CCP's
negative behaviors]{.underline}**, including its mishandling of the
covid-19 pandemic. The rise of racism against Asian Americans not only
hurts the United States' ability to deal with China, but also it harms
efforts to make common cause with our regional allies and partners such
as Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. Those governments' ability to join
the United States in confronting China is hurt when members of their
diaspora communities are mistreated in the United States.
"[We]{.underline} have to be able to [make a **very clear
distinction**]{.underline} that [our adversary and competitor is the
**Chinese Communist Party, not the Chinese people**]{.underline}, and
certainly **[not]{.underline}** the **[Asian Americans]{.underline}**
who live here and who have contributed so much to this country," Murphy
said. "When we attack Americans of Asian descent, we attack ourselves."
[Some]{.underline} American commentators [argue that]{.underline} the
[effort to confront the Chinese government's behavior]{.underline} has
[fueled]{.underline} the staggering rise in [hate and violence directed
at Asians and Asian Americans]{.underline} in the United States. [It's
certainly true that Trump's racist rhetoric]{.underline} regarding the
coronavirus fueled hate and [conflated the two issues,
tragically]{.underline}. And U.S. government efforts to confront CCP
influence operations in our country have at times unfairly targeted
people of Chinese origins. Such targeting of Asians and Asian Americans
makes us weaker at home and abroad. **[We must]{.underline}** learn
from, **[not repeat, examples]{.underline}** from history [when U.S.
foreign policy negatively affected American minorities]{.underline},
including the mass internment of U.S. citizens and noncitizens of
Japanese descent during World War II and the mistreatment of Arab and
Muslim Americans after 9/11. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the son of
Indian immigrants, told me that **[the United States has to out-compete
China without replicating the paradigms]{.underline}** of the Cold War.
But, he said, [we must]{.underline} also **[stand up to the
authoritarian and repressive model the Chinese government]{.underline}**
is putting forward [without ceding our moral authority]{.underline}.
"[That has to be the balance]{.underline}, enhance America's strategic
interest but **[clearly reject provocative rhetoric]{.underline}**
that's intended to play to a base," he said. "[There's a way to **frame
our moral position as a liberal democracy**]{.underline} . . . [without
coming]{.underline} off as [demonizing an entire
civilization]{.underline} in a way that hurts Chinese or Chinese
Americans." [Khanna and]{.underline} Rep. Mike [Gallagher]{.underline}
(R-Wis.) have co-sponsored a bill, the Endless Frontier Act, to revamp
the National Science Foundation to **[try to out-compete China through
technological innovation]{.underline}**. Senate Majority Leader Charles
E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) are cooperating on
companion legislation in the Senate. These efforts will be a major test
of whether bipartisan cooperation on the China challenge is possible.
**[It's not the drive to confront China that is fueling hate and
racism]{.underline}** against Asians in America. Political [opportunists
are abusing that effort by fueling bigotry]{.underline} to score
political points. This makes a unified strategy to confront the Chinese
government only more difficult to achieve. In fact, addressing racism at
home is crucial to winning the competition with China in the long run.
"[We have to be aggressive in our policies and working with our
allies]{.underline} to combat the violations the Chinese are making,
[but at the same time, **we can hold the CCP accountable without
scapegoating Asian Americans**]{.underline}," Murphy said. "And we have
a responsibility to do that."

N.S.: One question I have is, [will there be]{.underline}
**[buy-in]{.underline}** [from the American public for a Cold War style
confrontation]{.underline}? Americans remember quite vividly how the
Bush administration lied about WMDs in Iraq and pushed us into a
pointless and horribly destructive war. On the other hand, [negative
opinions of China]{.underline} **[are running quite high]{.underline}**,
[and a recent poll showed that for the first time, a majority of
Americans **support using military force**]{.underline} to defend
Taiwan. So where do you see public opinion going on this issue? Also, a
follow-up question here. [Some people are worried that a Cold War style
confrontation with China will result in]{.underline} a **[racist

[language]{.underline} in 2020. And of course the memory of how the U.S.
treated Japanese Americans during World War 2 looms large. What can we
do at the policy level to ensure that there\'s no such backlash? H.B.:
Let\'s side aside Iraq for a moment: I think the idea that Bush lied is
an overstatement, but that\'s a separate debate (and the war was indeed
destructive and counterproductive). There are [certainly the makings of
a **bipartisan consensus** on China]{.underline} in the United States.
[COVID turned Americans against China to a degree that Beijing building
bases in the South China Sea **never did**]{.underline}: It showed how
the CCP\'s cynicism and irresponsibility could cause concrete harm to
Americans and their livelihoods. There is [bipartisan
support]{.underline} in Congress for measures [to strengthen America\'s
competitive posture]{.underline}. And, while we shouldn't make too much
of \"would you want to defend X\" sort of questions, Americans are
clearly more concerned about the fate of Taiwan than they were before.
For now, the [consensus is still broader than it is
deep]{.underline}\--**[politicians want to compete with
China]{.underline}**, but not if it means doing something that would
cause even a minor correction in the stock market\--but I think this may
change over time. [As for the]{.underline} **[racism
issue]{.underline}**, this is something that **[good
leadership]{.underline}** [can help]{.underline} with. [We didn\'t have
a]{.underline} massive **[anti-Muslim backlash]{.underline}** [after
9/11]{.underline}, in part [because Bush]{.underline}, whatever his
other failings, **[modeled good behavior]{.underline}** in that regard.
And [while the Cold War left some ugly political
legacies]{.underline}\--red-baiting and the like\--[it also led the
United States to invest in **domestic reform and
rejuvenation**]{.underline}. The [breaking down of segregation, the
creation of the world\'s best university system, the building of our
interstate highway system, and other constructive measures were all
rooted, at least partly, in the imperative of making America more
attractive and competitive in the Cold War]{.underline}. So hopefully
our [leaders will treat competition with China not as a reason to bring
out our worst impulses]{.underline}, **[but as an opportunity for
America to become a better version of itself.]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- China War Securitization

#### [No self-fulfilling prophesy]{.underline}\-\--securitizing the [danger]{.underline} of US-China war creates the [caution]{.underline} and [risk-aversion]{.underline} [necessary]{.underline} to avoid it.

Throwing the Baby Out with the Bathwater? [Chan warns that the discourse
on **Thucydides's Trap** and **power transition** can create a
**self-fulfilling prophecy**. If leaders **believe** in Thucydides's
Trap and act accordingly, it may **create** the anticipated conditions
that **make war more likely**.]{.underline} [Talking and thinking in
terms of Thucydides's Trap will influence the state's construction of
its identity as well as its definition of interests and
preferences]{.underline}. The discourse is harmful because it encourages
'othering' the opponent and contributes to confrontation. Should we,
then, throw out the proposition that war is more likely when the system
is undergoing a power transition? It might be worthwhile to go back to
what Thucydides's Trap refers to: "the severe structural stress caused
when a rising power threatens to upend a ruling one. In such conditions,
not just extraordinary, unexpected events, but even ordinary flashpoints
of foreign affairs, can trigger large-scale conflict."\[112\]
[**Instead** of **creating a self-fulfilling prophecy**, this statement
should induce **caution** from leaders in **Beijing and
Washington**.]{.underline} **[Understanding the danger of war is the
first step to avoid being trapped in it]{.underline}**. Like Chan,
[Allison seeks to offer]{.underline} "a set of
**[principles]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} strategic
**[options]{.underline}** [for those seeking to **escape Thucydides's
Trap**]{.underline} and avoid World War III."\[113\] Obviously,
[historical analogies cannot completely capture an ongoing]{.underline}
event. Allison himself cautions against "facile analogizing" and
emphasizes that "the differences matter at least as much as the
similarities."\[114\] [The purpose of **analogizing Thucydides's Trap**
is not to **shoehorn** China and the United States into the roles of
**Athens** and **Sparta**]{.underline} respectively, as Chan suggests
(17-18), [but to underscore the **enduring feature** of international
politics throughout the ages]{.underline}. [The dynamics of conflict
highlighted by Thucydides **remain**]{.underline} as
**[relevant]{.underline}** today as it was two thousand years ago. [Many
scholars accuse structural theory of determinism]{.underline}, as Chan
does, (14, 34), [**even though** structuralists **do not adopt it**.
States can go to war for a **variety of reasons**]{.underline}.
[**Attempting to isolate a single cause for all wars is impossible**.
The proposition that war **tends** to break out during a power
transition is better understood as a **probabilistic**---**not
deterministic**---statement. The **structural tensions** cause by power
shifts can substantially **increase the probabilities of war**, much
like **dry leaves** waiting for a spark, but it does not mean that war
will **inevitably break out**.]{.underline} Properly understood,
[Thucydides's Trap **cautions** us to **be prepared for the danger of
war** during a power transition.]{.underline} Overall, Chan's book
provides a stronger critique of power transition theory than of
Thucydides's Trap. Students of power shifts should take his argument
seriously and avoid the pitfalls he identifies. We should not, however,
hastily dismiss the warnings of Thucydides's Trap.

#### Attempting IR predictions about China is both possible and desirable\-\--even if inaccurate\-\--because giving up on bounding assessment of threats results in security dilemmas

Joseph K. **Clifton 11**, Claremont McKenna College, "Disputed Theory
and Security Policy: Responding to the \"Rise of China"," 4-25-2011,
http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context=cmc_theses

First, motives can be known. Mearsheimer is correct in observing that
[assessing motives can be difficult, but this does **not** mean that the
task is **impossible**. There clearly are ways of finding out
information about the goals of states and the means with which they plan
to achieve them. One of the most important roles of intelligence
analysts]{.underline}, for example, [is to determine state interests and
expected behavior based on obtained information. The possibility that
information may be flawed should **not** lead to a **rejection** of all
information. People make decisions based on less than perfect knowledge
all of the time. This ability to know motives extends to future motives,
because an analyst can use information such as **historical trends** to
observe **consistencies** or constant **evolutions** of motives.
Prediction of the future is necessarily less certain in its accuracy,
but the **prediction can still be made**]{.underline}.104 Second, even
if there is still some uncertainty of motives, the rational response is
not to assume absolute aggression. Assuming aggressive motive in a
situation of uncertainty ignites the security dilemma, which could
actually decrease a state's security. Mearsheimer calls this tragic, but
it is not necessary. An illustrative example is Mearsheimer's analysis
of the German security situation were the United States to withdraw its
military protection. Mearsheimer argues that it would be rational for
Germany to develop nuclear weapons, since these weapons would provide a
deterrent, and it would also be rational for nuclear European powers to
wage a preemptive war against Germany to prevent it from developing a
nuclear deterrent. 105 This scenario is not rational for either side
because it ignores motives. If Germany knows that other states will
attack if it were to develop nuclear weapons, then it would not be
rational for it to develop nuclear weapons. And if other states know
that Germany's development of nuclear weapons is only as a deterrent,
then it would not be rational to prevent German nuclear development. The
point is that [**the security dilemma exists because of a lack of
motivational knowledge, so the proper response is to try to enhance
understanding of motives, not discard motivational knowledge
altogether**. Misperception is certainly a problem in international
politics, but reducing misperception]{.underline} would allow states to
better conform to defensive realist logic, which results in preferable
outcomes relative to offensive realism. 106 Assessing motives [is
**vital in the case of the rise of China**, because mutually preferable
outcomes can be achieved]{.underline} if China is not an aggressive
power, as offensive realism would have to assume, but is actually a
status quo power with aims that have limited effect on the security of
the U.S. and other potentially affected countries. I do not mean here to
claim with certainty that China is and will always be a status quo
power, and [policymakers likely have access to more intentional
information than what is publicly known]{.underline}. [At the very
least, valuing motivational assessments **empowers policymakers** to act
on this knowledge, which is preferable because of the possibility of
**reduc**ing **competition** and **conflict**]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Realism/Perm

#### Perm do both -- IR is reflexive, constantly changing and can be re-appropriated 

**Abraham, 17**---Johns Hopkins University (Kavi Joseph, "Making
Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial Thought,"
International Political Sociology (2017) 11, 221--238, dml)

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that [those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with a number of possible responses:
one is to **deem realism**, in all its **complex** and **contradictory
manifestations**, as a **failed**, **unethical**, and **fundamentally
racist/imperial project**]{.underline}. A second response is to
politically align against liberalism, while holding this partnership at
arm's length. [A third response]{.underline}, derived from Ayoob's
(2002) subaltern realism, [is to work on an **epistemic register**,
**selectively taking insights** from realist traditions that help better
explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this [failing **does not
delegitimize other realist insights**]{.underline}. What is important
for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to combine plausible
realist insights with other categories that can grasp the extent of
global politics, including the dynamics of the postcolonial experience,
better. The final response is the one I advance. To adopt a mode of
argumentation concerned with [building a counter-imperial machine is to
neither **dismiss constituencies** that become caught up in imperial
formations, nor merely to **tactically align with them**; rather,
**establishing resonant connections** among postcolonial and realist
lines of thought, **highlighting shared dispositions** to difference, is
to push the latter toward **repositioning itself on new ethical lines**
that **limit contemporary forms of violence**. To recover a minor
position in realism is **not to accept all realist positions**, nor is
it to synthesize or convert any theoretical line into a coherent
framework. It is]{.underline}, however, [to **amplify the shared
spirituality** that informs both realist and postcolonial thinking,
drawing constituencies toward **prudential** rather than **imperial
defenses of difference**. It is to **furnish current research agendas**
with an **anti-imperial focus**, to seek the **creative possibilities**
that may arise when divergent constituencies meet, interfuse, and
shift]{.underline}. Thus, our response to Morgenthau, as to other
realists, is to cultivate the connections that do exist, not for
epistemic reasons but for a political project that strengthens
counter-imperial movements. Thinking from the Present By way of
conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that motivates a
theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial thinking. If the
ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of liberalism and
its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a return to
classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and above
postcolonial approaches. However, [the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a **counter-imperial machine**]{.underline}, to
cultivate a shared spirituality [that can **gather diverse** and
**divergent constituencies** to confront dangerous
practices]{.underline}. In my estimation, [countering an imperial
machine that operates in **complex ways** and at **complex sites**
requires a political strategy as **unwieldy** and **diffuse**, linking
constituencies that we **may otherwise dismiss**.]{.underline} [That a
tradition of realism **regularly circulates through halls of power**
across the globe **should be reason not to reject righteously** but
rather to **leverage its authorized status**. We can talk about
**imperialism**, **knowledge production**, and **race** here, while they
can talk about **anarchy**, **power**, and **self-interest** there---or
we can theoretically work on the lines of thought that **reverberate
among us**]{.underline}. To reiterate, building a countermachine is not
driven to "pragmatic" reconciliation or consensus and, thus, remains
distinct from the "eclecticism" of other plural approaches popular in IR
today. While the combinatory logic of paradigmatic synthesis has its
place, the connections between realist and postcolonial thought
articulated here are made in a far more agonistic manner. Rather than
produce something like a "postcolonial-realism," [this]{.underline}
argument [involves pushing contemporary realist scholarship toward **new
research agendas** and **new forms of critique**]{.underline} that both
capture a spirit internal to its own traditions while confronting the
realities of contemporary global politics. It engages with minor
positions along the realist canon to orient today's realism away from
the logic of great power politics operating under anarchy toward an
understanding of how the logic of liberal order permits forms of
imperial intervention. Needless to say, [drawing together realist and
postcolonial thought]{.underline}, as this essay has done, [can be met
with **analytical skepticism** and **political hostility**. A mode of
argumentation that **refuses comparisons** of theoretical cores or
non-truncated readings of select theorists strikes a note of
**analytical evasion**]{.underline}. To this there is no defense---other
than that already discussed at length. On the other hand, if the
expressly political purpose of this work is accepted, [the argument
anticipates **strong political reservations**: why align the project of
postcolonial theory with realism, an **unethical tradition of
militarism** and **realpolitik**?]{.underline} To this I would respond
that while a kind of strategic essentialism has its place, [**reducing**
"realists" to a coherent body of thought not only **obscures the
complexity** of their thinking]{.underline} (see never-ending
interpretations of Machiavelli as an example) [but **reproduces the
narrative of transhistorical unity** that some realists use to
**authorize unethical policy programs** in the first place]{.underline}.
More critically, however, [in embodying an **unproductive
ahistoricism**, it poses conventional realist categories of **anarchy**,
**selfinterest**, and **military power** as the **political problem to
confront** whereas the present historical context **demands attunement**
to how some of these drives]{.underline} (militarism, national interest)
[**connect with discrete problems** of liberalism and imperial
practices]{.underline}. In fact, there are good reasons to think that
the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and Morton
2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR theory
is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of a US liberal
world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while realism may
have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must theorize
from the present. In doing so, we may find that [countering imperial
formations **may benefit from resonances established**]{.underline} not
just **[among]{.underline}** postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and
other "critical" theorists but [**contemporary realists** who identify
links between liberalism and imperialism]{.underline} (Walt 2013).
Indeed, [if realism as a policy program defending the national interest
is **entangled with current militaristic** and **imperial
interventions**, we should **push the premise** of this statement, that
**difference should be defended**, in **anti-imperial** and **prudential
directions**. Doing so may allow **new openings to emerge** in the
present sense of closure, **new strategies to think** and **defend
alternative politics**]{.underline}. In this way, we may more fully
embody postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow
critique or brash conversion but rather attentive translation.

#### Balance-of-power concerns [structure]{.underline} state behavior, even if they can't explain [everything]{.underline} states do. 

**Blagden, 18**---Senior Lecturer in International Security at the
Strategy and Security Institute, Department of Politics, University of
Exeter (David, "Realism, Uncertainty, and the Security Dilemma: Identity
and the Tantalizing Promise of Transformed International Relations,"
*Constructivism Reconsidered: Past, Present, and Future*, Chapter 12, pg
205-216, dml)

The previous section documented how [social variables **might** be taken
as having the **potential** to transform international
politics]{.underline}. This section now turns to an explanation of why
[it is]{.underline} so [**hard to fulfill** such seeming
transformational promise]{.underline}. Running throughout is the
argument that [while playing a particular social role or expressing a
particular cultural identity are certainly state interests, they are
**necessarily subordinate** to political **survival**]{.underline} (as a
sovereign entity with control over its own foreign policy),
"physiological" **[security]{.underline}** (the safety from death and
harm of the state's population), [and]{.underline} economic
**[prosperity]{.underline}** (a baseline level of which is necessary to
ensure physiological security). Put simply, [if a state and its
population do not exist, it **cannot achieve anything
else**]{.underline}---such as fulfilling a social role or expressing a
cultural identity---either.36 And since survival, security, and
prosperity all have a material base---as Wendt recognizes via his "rump
materialism" (he simply does not think the material base yields
determinate outcomes)---so too must states necessarily put the defense
of such interests ahead of social role fulfillment if they want to be in
a position to play any sort of role in future.37 [That is **not to
suggest** that states **do not**]{.underline} sometimes---or, indeed,
often---[make ideationally driven foreign policy choices that are
**detrimental** to their other interests. It is simply a description of
states' **incentive structure**, which **much of the time** they end up
following]{.underline}. [It is necessary]{.underline} at this point [to
defend the notion that there is, in fact, a **material base independent
of the social world** and that characteristics of that material base can
yield **causal outcomes**]{.underline}. After all, [military technology
does not descend as **manna from heaven**, but rather is created via
**human agency** in response to perceived threats]{.underline}, and thus
it necessarily contains a dose of military culture and broader social
identity from the outset. The same goes for the overall share of
national economic resources allocated to defense, and indeed, money
itself is a socially constructed store of value, albeit one premised
upon underlying materially underpinned wealth.38 Any assessment of
strategic priorities is necessarily filtered through the
strategic-cultural lens of the institution(s) doing the assessing;
asking one's navy for an analysis of the relative merits of sea denial
versus power projection, for example, necessarily delivers an answer
infused with that navy's historical trajectory, its sense of its role in
the nation and the world, its internal politics, and so forth. The
broader question of whether the sea--- like other geographical
features---constitutes a strategic barrier or a highway similarly
requires cultural interpretation. Even technologies with such seemingly
self-evident destructive power as nuclear weapons are not self-evidently
"good" or "bad," either morally or strategically, absent social
interpretation. One might see them as "bad" because of the potential
humanitarian consequences of their use (or because of the constraints
they impose on conventional military options), or "good" because of the
casualties in conventional war they prevent (and deterrence that they
enable at low relative cost). Their political meaning is thus socially
constructed, even if the physiological effects on human bodies of their
detonation have only one possible outcome. If military technology and
resources require a social component to be both developed and
meaningfully deployed, then Wendt's contention that there is indeed a
"rump" material base but that it is simply indeterminate---in the
absence of a friend/enemy distinction---as a cause of international
outcomes becomes alluring.39 Crucially, however, [each of these social
choices involves a **decisive material effect** that is **not open to
interpretation**. It may be debatable whether nuclear weapons are
"**good**" or "**bad**," but the **effect** that one will
have]{.underline} on the city and its population of frail, carbon-based
human animals over which it detonates [represents a **single**,
**determinate outcome**]{.underline}---and a state facing another state
armed with them must therefore make certain necessary calculations based
around that capability.40 In the same vein, [while]{.underline} the
[strategic threat/opportunity]{.underline} constituted by geographical
features, such as the oceanic moats enjoyed by the United States and
United Kingdom, [may be a matter of interpretation, the **underlying
material factor**]{.underline}---humans' inability to cross water
without spending resources on capital (ships) that could otherwise have
been spent on further ground forces---[yields certain **necessary
outcomes**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the very **foundation** of relations
between major powers]{.underline} after 1945---secure second-strike
nuclear deterrence and its disincentivization of conventional
aggression41---[rests on a physical "**fact**"]{.underline}: the
relative impenetrability of water to the electro-magnetic spectrum and
the associated survivability that it provides to ballistic missile
submarines. [The same goes for the decision over what **share
of**]{.underline} national economic [**resources** to allocate to
defense. Choosing a proportion may indeed be a **socially** and
**ideationally informed political choice**, but the **underlying size**
of the resource pools]{.underline}---and the military potentiality that
they underpin--- rests on the total size of the state's capital stock
(both human and physical), which [is **not a matter of social
interpretation**]{.underline}. And while military technology is indeed
developed in response to human agency, it is done so from within the
technical bounds of the feasible. Such rebuttals apply more widely:
[while the balance of power]{.underline}, including resources and
technology, [is]{.underline} indeed necessarily [interpreted through
states' social lenses, it nonetheless **conditions the bounds of the
possible** even in the absence of social content]{.underline}. And when
those possibilities include hostile use, certain behaviors are
necessitated by prudent states seeking survival for their populations.
Realists should indeed be castigated if they infer predictions solely
from the balance of currently existing military hardware---a thin and
intellectually impoverished understanding of relative power---and
critics are correct to point out that a large stock of materiel is not
the same as being able to compel another to do that which they would not
otherwise have done, in line with the behavioral output understanding of
power commonly associated with Dahl (as distinct from the input
understanding).42 But [viewing total state power in terms of **overall
assets**]{.underline}, defined as the state's total stock of physical,43
financial,44 and human capital,45 [does a **better job** of]{.underline}
first [encompassing all the **relevant
resources**]{.underline}---equipment, stores of value, human bodies and
brains---[and]{.underline}, second, [providing an **effective measurable
proxy** for the **underlying causes** of behavioral power]{.underline}
(given that [the latter can only be observed **ex post**, and is
therefore **not an effective predictor** of outcomes]{.underline}).
[None of this is to **deny** that there is a **social element** to the
construction of all these power resources]{.underline}, or indeed that
the "material" itself involves a large dose of social input, and this
chapter is therefore not attempting to "settle" the debate over the
precise nature of the relationship. [It is simply to point
out]{.underline}, rather, [that states' power resources and their
effects are **not wholly socially constructed** and that the nonsocial
element **produces certain effects**]{.underline}. Turning to specific
arguments over states' pursuit of status, the notion that achieving a
particular elevated status and thus fulfilling a certain
international-social role might be a goal of states is relatively
uncontentious.46 For instance, one insightful recent constructivist work
on Britain's pursuit of international status suggests at the outset that
states' social roles are not the same as their interests, ambitions,
values, or capabilities.47 Yet the same work later asserts that social
role actually produces national interests, thus implying that states
cannot in fact have interests besides those constituted by identity.48
Such conceptual tensions are symptomatic of a theoretical dilemma: the
more minimal former assertion is the harder to refute, yet the more
ambitious latter claim is necessary if constructivists are to escape the
realist retort that fulfilling a social role is merely an interest of
states---and a subordinate one to materially underpinned survival at
that---rather than the interest. Escaping this retort is in turn
necessary if constructivists are to be able to claim that anarchy is
indeed what states make of it socially, since transforming the
prevailing culture of anarchy would require states to lower their guard
against each other---and thus accept higher risk to their survival, at
least while the hoped-for transformation was taking place---in pursuit
of an international-social value. The less contentious point---that
playing a particular social role is one of multiple interests---opens
the way to conceding that the most fundamental state interests remain
"political" survival (of state territory and institutions), "biological"
security (of the citizenry's bodies), and preserving some baseline level
of economic prosperity, since a state that cannot survive cannot achieve
anything else. But if that is the case, then from these materially
underpinned vital interests follows a need to be capable of defending
them against potential foes---and that, if it comes to it, means
accomplishing certain military missions.49 Such military capability is
necessarily underpinned by material resources, even as it also has a
socially constructed dimension. Such capability can be provided
independently (internal balancing), via allies (external balancing), or
through some combination of the two---prudent strategy, including
eschewing avoidable confrontation and aligning with the preferences of
powerful allies, is a key aspect of state success50---but either way, it
rests on some friendly actor's underlying resources. And reliance on
external balancing brings its own dangers, as recently experienced by
European NATO, when one's allies turn coercive.51 In short, [such an
analysis]{.underline}---while conceding that social role and status are
important to states, all else held equal, and that such concerns
sometimes drive them to act in imprudent ways---nonetheless [suggests
that hedging]{.underline} against abandonment, coercion, or outright
destruction [via balance-of-power positioning is **likely to remain
pervasive**. This is **not to say** that there will not be variation in
the **extent** and **severity** of such competition. All manner of
ideational variables might exacerbate or reduce tensions]{.underline},
as discussed above, and even in the absence of such social forces,
overt, intensive competition may yield self-destructive outcomes if it
increases another side's insecurity and causes them to adopt a more
offensively capable strategic posture in response.52 [The
point]{.underline}, rather, [is simply that conflict will never be a
**wholly absent possibility** and that that reality **must condition
states' calculations**]{.underline}---often to the point of some level
of defensive hedging, if the state has the resources and technology to
make that feasible---even in times of broadly cooperative relations. [A
similar retort can be made against the claims that threat perception and
military doctrine are both so **fundamentally skewed** by culture that
they may be **commonly** and **wholly disconnected** from
balance-of-power concerns]{.underline}, and which subsequently allow for
an end to military balancing, mutual threat, and security competition.
While this short chapter is clearly not the place for an extensive
review, the success of many states--- particularly resource-rich
ones---in aping military technological and professional best practice
would seem to suggest that much of the time states are able to achieve
what Gray, borrowing from marketing theory, dubs "good enough" force
postures in the face of strategic uncertainty.53 Similarly, when states
do "die" in the face of foreign aggression---a rare occurrence in
post-1945 international politics---it is more often as a consequence of
their relative military weakness and geographical vulnerability than as
a consequence of a failure to perceive a looming threat.54 Indeed, a key
contribution of the neoclassical realist research program has been to
demonstrate that [while domestic-political variables may **filter
strategic behavior** in multifarious and often nefarious ways, there are
still **underlying balance-of-power structural pressures** at the
international-systemic level that states **usually respond to**, even if
they do so **belatedly** or **imperfectly**]{.underline}.55 In short,
while Waltzian "socialization" toward accurately perceiving threats and
formulating effective military doctrine may frequently be hindered---and
sometimes terminally compromised---by cultural factors, [as a
description of the **workings of the international system** as a
whole]{.underline} (as he intended his theory to be), [realist
predictions of enduring concern and possible competition over the
distribution of material power are **not undermined** by]{.underline}
this recognition.56 Tellingly, despite their strong **[ideational
commitments]{.underline}** toward democracy promotion and human rights
enforcement under the banner of upholding international order, Western
states have recently had the reprioritization of balancing against
increasingly capable rivals forced upon them by developments in the
balance of power, whether that be China's rise in Asia for the United
States or Russia's (partial) resurgence in Europe for the rest of
NATO.57 Finally, [even **national identity** and]{.underline} the
**[nationalism]{.underline}** it engenders---the ideational "master
variable" underpinning the nation-state system---[is itself forged by
the interaction of **political group identity** and the **survival
imperative** under structural anarchy]{.underline}. To paraphrase Tilly,
[war **makes the state**, and the state **makes war**]{.underline}.58
[Modern nation-states may have **originated** as political groups of
individually weak human beings with some shared identity connection, but
their choice to **form states** as protective war machines capable of
generating]{.underline} the military [power]{.underline} necessary [to
defend]{.underline} against similar political units, [and the subsequent
mutual reinforcement of national identity and state strength, is **very
much consistent** with realism's predictions of the **consequences of
international structural anarchy**]{.underline}. Indeed, as noted
earlier, Mearsheimer uses these grounds to argue that nationalism and
realism are mutually supportive theories.59 In the post-- Cold War
world, moreover, mutually threatening political groups' need to generate
the military power necessary for security under anarchy---the security
dilemma, in short---helps to explain the explosion of ferocious
ethnonationalist and sectarian conflict within and between the new
states emerging from the collapse of previously multiethnic communist
federations, secular Middle Eastern autocracies, and so forth.60 Such
conflict has in turn forged the identity of the states and state-like
entities emerging from it. In short, [while it is **certainly not
impossible** for national identities to shift]{.underline}, as noted
above, [the **process** of their generation nonetheless suggests that
they are **endogenous** to---rather than **readily capable of
exogenously shifting** to transform---international systemic security
competition and balance-of-power positioning]{.underline}, that they are
as much a dependent variable as an independent variable. Uncertainty and
the Menacing Shadow of the Future The previous section outlined why some
of the otherwise most convincing [constructivist variables]{.underline}
at work in international politics nevertheless [**cannot promise** to
transform international politics away from a world of "**realist**,"
**security-motivated balance-of-power positioning**]{.underline}. This
section turns to discuss why [this is something that social variables
will **continue to struggle with** as long as there is an international
system]{.underline}. [The **principal barrier** to states ever setting
aside their inclination to guard against each other and instead embrace
each other as "friends"---**no matter how strong** their]{.underline}
leaders' or citizens' [desire to **transform the culture** of
international anarchy---is **uncertainty** over others'
intentions]{.underline}, particularly their future intentions.61
Following the logic of the prisoners' dilemma, a state62 that trusts
that another means it no harm while the other state concludes that it
now has an opportunity to pursue advantage may be punished severely for
its complacency, rendering such trust perilous, particularly in security
affairs, where defection from cooperation could result in the end of the
"game" for one party.63 The meaning and implications of this
"uncertainty" assumption merit consideration, however. Human beings are
constantly trying to impose certainty on a contingent world via
cognitive heuristics and neural shortcuts, for the sake of their own
mental well-being.64 Indeed, since humans derive meaning and value from
the self-imposed certainty of ideational reinforcement, so too they can
derive benefit from the entrenchment of both amity with and enmity
against "others," even when this creates other complications and
dangers.65 As a result, much of international politics is influenced by
habit, both the habit of friendship and the habit of animosity.66
"Uncertainty" also means different things to different people: for
realists, it is a condition from which to infer fear about others'
possible behavior; for constructivists, by contrast, it may simply refer
to the inherent indeterminacy of information until it is imbued with
social content.67 It may be possible to build trust in others' benign
intent over time and thereby escape security competition, meanwhile,
through their costly signaling: forgoing capabilities and policy options
that a potential aggressor would not want to do without.68 States can
also have the certain "friendship" of those with whom they are balancing
against a third-party threat, and if that threat is long-lived, then so
too may be the certainty of alliance.69 Illustrating this "uncertainty
about uncertainty,"70 consider one of the highest profile oft-invoked
security dilemmas: the Cold War escalation of U.S.-Soviet hostility,
during which the most seminal security dilemma theorization took
place.71 Robert Jervis---one of the concept's foremost
progenitors---subsequently questioned whether the Cold War can be
understood as a security dilemma after all, understood as a tragic cycle
of mutual threat between nonrevisionist security seekers driven by
uncertainty over the other's intentions. Neither side was "uncertain"
over whether the other was an adversary. And as subsequent archival
revelations document, each side did want to destroy the other, and
correctly inferred as much of its opponent.72 Jervis's "recantation" of
the Cold War-as-security-dilemma is itself bounded, however, and this
bounding sheds light on the ways in which varieties of uncertainty can
still operate even between states with "certain" mutual intent. "Greedy"
states versus "security-seeking" states are themselves binary ideal
types that mask an underlying spectrum. Practically all states are
greedy, in terms of wanting to improve their lot, if the costs are low
enough.73 Conversely, few states are greedy to the point of total
unconcern for security; not even Nazi Germany desired limitless global
war. While there may not have been uncertainty over each side's Cold War
intent, therefore---enmity-driven desire to defeat and ultimately
destroy the other---there was still uncertainty over underlying
motivations. 74 A desire to exterminate an enemy population may entail
quite different behavior than a desire for ideological supremacy, for
example, and the two may therefore merit different policy responses,
even though both fall within the domain of "hostile" intent. Such doubt
over motivations---even within the cognitively "certain" domain of
U.S.-Soviet enmity---still added up to a variety of security dilemma:
[the **most salient question** for Americans was not "**is the Soviet
Union an enemy?**" but rather "**what might Moscow do** about situation
X, in Y circumstances, at time Z?" The same is evident]{.underline} in
major power politics [today. Washington is not "uncertain" over whether
or not China and Russia are its "adversaries,"]{.underline} defined in
broad and obvious terms, [but there is a **high degree of uncertainty**
over what **types** of rivals they represent and their **associated
future strategic choices**. Recognition of uncertainty's nonbinary
nature]{.underline}, in short, [**does not undermine** the argument that
states' inability to know others' future behavior with perfect
reliability **incentivizes them to worry** about possible future
dangers]{.underline}. Realists disagree over prospects for avoiding
security competition through signaling motivations, of course,75 but all
variants are united by recognizing the enduring significance of the
balance of material power.76 On top of these qualifications to the
uncertainty-over-intentions assumption come disagreements over the most
appropriate response to such uncertainty. [Conceding that we can never
know another state's future intentions with mathematical certainty, and
therefore that the worst-case outcome]{.underline}---surprise attack by
a concealed aggressor---[will always remain a hypothetical possibility
**does not**]{.underline} necessarily [**imply** that security is
**maximized** by treating such a scenario as **likely**]{.underline}.
Provoking war for fear of possible future war is like committing suicide
for fear of death, and given the balancing often generated by hostile
behavior, provoking others into uniting against oneself through
attempted power maximization can ultimately reduce one's security.77
[While worst-case contingencies **always merit consideration**, policy
planning]{.underline}---particularly decisions over how much of the
national resource base to devote to defense ("guns") versus consumption
and productive investment ("butter")78---[**necessitates probabilistic
calculations** of the relative dangers of **overarmament**]{.underline}
(provoking balancing alongside domestic economic immiseration) [versus
**underarmament**]{.underline} (attack by a better-armed adversary).79
Intense security competition can therefore be an irrational and
self-defeating response to mere uncertainty over future intentions, in
the absence of other threat data.80 Both "realist" and "constructivist"
variables can feature among this threat data and therefore play a
crucial part in determining the optimal strategic response to such
intentions uncertainty, and that in turn conditions whether the
potential threat posed by each side's capabilities, be they latent or
realized, manifests itself as a security dilemma. For many realists, the
offense-defense balance of technology and geography determines whether
uncertainty over others' intentions merits military confrontation and
determines the (in)stability of states' strategic relations.81 For
constructivists, the solidarity/enmity borne of sociocultural
similarity/difference may be equally decisive. But [**neither** of these
observations---that uncertainty neither carries a single meaning nor
prescribes a single strategy---undermines the **core claim** that
survival has a **material base** that necessitates **continual
security-motivated concern** for one's position in the balance of power.
Survival may]{.underline} indeed [be "**multiply
realizable**,"]{.underline} with social/ideational variables informing
the path taken, alongside various "realist" variables. [But]{.underline}
given all [states']{.underline} need to safeguard a materially based
hierarchy of interests without wholesale reliance on others' politically
contingent (and therefore capricious) benevolence---whether that be
potential abandonment by erstwhile allies, potential attack by erstwhile
neutrals, or potential coercion by either---their [position in the
balance of power will **always remain relevant** to their future
security]{.underline}. And [given that situation, the conditions for
**mutual threat** and an associated **security dilemma** to re-emerge
are **unlikely to be permanently expunged**]{.underline}, despite such a
deterioration going unrealized indefinitely in many cases due to other
overlying factors.82 [Fear of future conflict]{.underline}---at least
against some state, if not against any specific state---thus [remains an
**endemic feature** of international politics]{.underline}. And much of
that is still down to the enduring concerns of structurally based
realism: international-systemic anarchy, its absence of a reliable
sovereign enforcer of global peace, and the associated dangers of
offensively capable peers of unreliably benevolent intent. Tellingly,
while many contemporary states have achieved mutual "friendship," they
have rarely sustained it once the strategic factors holding them
together---such as alliance against a mutual threat, shared membership
of a great(er) power's dependency network, or some other mutually
beneficial exchange---have disappeared. This suggests that such
"friendship" is as much a dependent variable (an outcome of realist
balancing behavior) as an independent variable (a transformational force
in international politics).83 Even within the zone of friendship that
had come to characterize the European "community" by the late 1980s, for
example---probably the deepest case of intersubjective recognition,
cooperation, and sovereignty pooling to date---Britain and France still
worried intensely about the potential power imbalances created by German
reunification, and they were not content until reunified German power
was subordinated via a restated US commitment to NATO.84 As noted
previously, moreover, via both Trump and Brexit---ideationally motivated
shifts in foreign policy orientation85---Euro-Atlantic security
relations have recently displayed a dramatic backsliding, raising the
specter of alliance breakdown and coercive confrontation. The relative
power of all sides is critical to their ability to resist/dispense such
coercion and safeguard future security even in the possible absence of
alliance support. Even within the EU, the ability of members to resist
or dispense coercion comes down to relative power: witness Greece's
experience at German hands in the context of the Eurozone crisis, and
contrast it with the lack of sanction for Franco-German breaches of EU
rules.86 And between NATO and Russia, a 1990s moment of optimism over
developing friendship has retrenched to coercive confrontation as an
outcome of each other's choices.87 All these developments---which can be
interpreted as negative movement along the spectrum between cooperation
and conflict---illustrate the continuing centrality of relative power to
safeguarding a hierarchy of national interests without dependence on the
changeable commitments of others. As a consequence, [the **base
conditions** for the security dilemma will **always exist** between
sovereign states under anarchy, even if it lies]{.underline} wholly
**[dormant]{.underline}** for most states most of the time, thanks to
overlying factors. [Interstate friendship does not render deterioration
to a security dilemma **impossible**, and neither does interstate
animosity **preclude**]{.underline} stable and durable
**[cooperation]{.underline}**.88 [So while identity---which]{.underline}
in any case [is "**sticky**" and **slow to change**---certainly matters
to security relations, it is **unlikely to trump** some combination of
**power** and **informational variables**]{.underline}.89 Of course, if
international relations were transformed by the emergence of a single
world-state, the system would no longer be anarchic and the
units-formerly-known-asstates would not need to rely on relative power
for their security, and thus such competition would end.90 That
requirement, however, does not look likely to be fulfilled anytime soon.
Conclusion [Conflict and cooperation is not some binary "**either/or**"
condition, but]{.underline} rather [a **spectrum**]{.underline}. So too
the [security concerns]{.underline} borne of uncertainty over
motivations [are not some irreversible "on/off" switch]{.underline}, be
that permanently severe or permanently solved. There is certainly far
more peace in the world than the most pessimistic readings of realism
would seem to imply,91 and ideational similarity and solidarity---as
well as the power and informational variables beloved of
realists---clearly have something to do with this.
[Interests]{.underline} within the parameters of continuing to survive
[are **socially constituted**]{.underline}, and even the route to
survival itself represents an ideationally informed choice. [But the
need to safeguard a **materially underpinned hierarchy of interests** if
states are to continue to exist]{.underline}---a necessary prerequisite
to performing any kind of social role---[still incentivizes them to
**value their position** in the balance of power as a
**safeguard**]{.underline} against future dangers. Of course, [states
**can** and **do** disregard certain incentive structures in favor of
others]{.underline}.92 [But until **all** states are known to have done
so---a **high bar indeed**---the potential for security competition to
re-emerge]{.underline} in the international system [will **continue to
exist**]{.underline}. And knowing that, states will continue to prize
the capabilities to provide for their own security . . . and so on,
creating enduring conditions for security dilemmas to one day reappear,
even though they go overlain by other factors in most international
relationships most of the time. Both realists and constructivists
therefore have work to do, in terms of both refining their paradigmatic
cores and recognizing the necessity of analytically eclectic
cross-pollination [to explain many of the **most pressing questions** of
real-world international politics]{.underline}. Realists must do more to
incorporate identity as a variable that produces systemically
significant variation in behavior rather than as some adjunct bolt-on,
whether that be via the post-1990s boom of neoclassical theorization or
attempts at microfoundationally elaborated structural realism.93
Porter's work on the interaction of power and habit in determining US
grand strategy is a good recent example, while---as noted
earlier---Snyder's Myths of Empire remains a key benchmark.94
Constructivists, for their part, must continue to investigate the
relationship between states' potentially infinite array of socially
constituted interests, their materially underpinned hierarchy of core
survival requirements, and the enduring concern for relative power that
the latter generates. Along the way, [both sides must be **circumspect**
in their appeals to allegedly "**smoking-gun**" examples]{.underline}.
For realists to claim that structure alone explains World War II or the
Cold War, for example--- missing the universalist ideologies of German
Nazism, Soviet communism, or US liberalism---would be a stretch indeed.
Equally, constructivists' most beloved examples---amicable US-Canadian
relations along an easily passable land border, the relative
underarmament of Germany and Japan, greater American fear of a few North
Korean atomic bombs than hundreds of British thermonuclear warheads, the
rise of European Union, and so forth---can all be readily explained with
reference to balances of capability and information. "Analytic
eclecticism" is easy to profess, but the most pressing contemporary
questions of world politics require that theorists practice it too. [For
those **not interested** in resolving **paradigm wars** or "**isms**"
debates]{.underline}, meanwhile, [the intersection of
**material-structural pressures** on state behavior with socially
constituted foreign policy preferences **provides ample scope** for
investigating **crucial real-world questions** of our time]{.underline}.
Viewed in rationalist terms, this might involve investigating the role
of social variables in informing leaders' utility functions, and thus
their preference orderings under the overall structural constraint of
needing to ensure continued survival. Just how far could the United
States meddle in the Middle East at the behest of domestic interests,
for example, before it critically harmed its power position vis-à-vis
China? Extending the previous point, has US unipolarity created unique
space for a "crazy" foreign policy that disregards the balance of
power---both by the United States itself and by close US allies---and
will this change if or when unipolarity wanes?95 Relatedly, just how far
can the likes of Germany and Japan sustain their pacifistic foreign
policy orientations in the face of US relative decline or disengagement
and the likely associated need for them to provide more for their own
security? Changing tack, how does a small power like Sweden---say---make
its trade-off between providing mobile forces for an EU Battlegroup (a
cause it values), on the one hand, and maintaining large amounts of
conscripts and armor on its eastern border to hedge against Russia (a
threat that it cannot be rid of), on the other? Are UK efforts to
rebrand as an "aid superpower" facilitated by a nuclear deterrent and
the US alliance, say, providing leeway to follow an ideational foreign
policy under the cover of a "good enough" military umbrella? In short,
[there is scope for **any number** of midlevel theories of foreign
policy under the **constraint of still recognizing** that interstate
balance-of-power considerations **continue to structure** the
international system]{.underline}.

[In today\'s emerging world order, the Cold War-like confrontation
between the United States and China is not as rigid as it was between
the U.S. and Russia]{.underline}. Neither the U.S. nor China is in any
position to gather a group of committed warriors behind themselves
willing to fight for unsaturated material benefits or noble ideological
causes. [Solid alliance structures based on common threat perceptions
and unshakeable collective identities seem to have already given way to
short-term pragmatic cooperation across rival camps]{.underline}.
Compartmentalization has now become the buzzword defining frenemy-like
relations between countries. [Turkish-Russian relations of the last
decade offer a textbook example in this regard.]{.underline} While the
two countries are at odds with each other concerning many issues topping
the geopolitical agenda of the wider Middle East, the South Caucasus and
Eastern Mediterranean regions, they have simultaneously developed the
ability to manage their crises lest they get out of control. [All
countries, irrespective of their material power capabilities, are now
trying to improve their ability to resist the emerging tumultuous
developments **by increasingly adopting a nationalistic approach to
international relations.**]{.underline} Standing unyielding abroad while
going through a restoration process at home is now the most feasible
strategy that strategists recommended to national decision-makers to put
into use. [Speaking the language of populist nationalism and investing
in material power capabilities are now common trends across the globe.
What better evidence can one find than the European Union, the showcase
of liberal understating of international politics, trying now to become
a geopolitical power in order to survive in the world of carnivorous
powers, such as the U.S., China and Russia]{.underline}? While we are
going through a transitional process in global politics in which
geopolitical cards are being reshuffled, no particular country,
including the two behemoths, lays its cards on the table. [Of all
international relations theories, **it is structural realism that
defines today\'s world order the best.**]{.underline} [States do not
trust each other]{.underline}. The anarchical nature of international
relations impedes long-term cooperation. [Trust is lacking.
International organizations are mere tools used by states in order to
gain an advantage at the expense of the other.]{.underline} Material
power maximization is the key not only to mere survival but also to
regional/global supremacy. [States are extremely jealous of their
sovereign rights to determine what is right or wrong for
themselves.]{.underline} Conflict is the rule whereas cooperation the
exemption. Concerns over cheating and relative gains prevent states from
developing trust-based relations. [Distribution of material power
capabilities among states determine who would call the shots in global
politics and who would be at the mercy of others]{.underline}; [hard
power is becoming more and more important than soft power to survive in
this jungle. Self-help is the only strategy to rely on]{.underline}.
Nationalism outbids internationalism in the competition among
alternative ideologies. [The nation-state is the most legitimate
political community in which liberalism or democracy could
survive.]{.underline} The most sacred identity that individuals might
theoretically possess is the idea of citizenship. [Peace and stability
in the world can only be attained through the formation of a stable
balance of power among great powers, which are the only actors that
matter in international politics. **Any attempt to help build a global
community of humankind thriving on a universal civilization or political
and economic rights is futile.**]{.underline} Though states, middle and
small powers, in particular, try to preserve their strategic autonomy,
they cannot help but choose between balancing or bandwagoning in the
mid- to long-term. So long as they can, [many middle powers will try to
avoid choosing one side at the expense of the other. Yet this will prove
to be extremely difficult, as the stiff competition between Washington
and Beijing turns out to become an abject enmity in the years
ahead.]{.underline} **[We are fast moving away from a rule-based
international order in which liberal and constructivist accounts of
international relations would have more explanatory power than the
time-tested structural realism.]{.underline}**

[This article introduces]{.underline} political scientists to
[scenarios]{.underline}---future counterfactuals---[and demonstrates
their value]{.underline} in tandem [with other methodologies and across
a]{.underline} wide [range of research]{.underline} questions. The
authors describe best practices regarding the scenario method and argue
that [scenarios contribute to **theory building**]{.underline} and
development, [identifying **new hypotheses**, analyzing
data-poor]{.underline} research [topics, articulating **"world views,"**
setting]{.underline} new research [agendas, **avoiding cognitive
biases**, and teaching]{.underline}. The article also establishes the
low rate at which scenarios are used in the international relations
subfield and situates scenarios in the broader context of political
science methods. The conclusion offers two detailed examples of the
effective use of scenarios. In his classic work on scenario and Duncan
1993; Leufkens, Haaijer-Ruskamp, Bakker, and Dukes 1994; Baker, Hulse,
Gregory, White, Van Sickle, Berger, Dole, and Schumaker 2004; Sanderson,
Scherbov, O\'Neill, and Lutz 2004). [Scenarios]{.underline} also [are a
**common tool** employed by]{.underline} the [policymakers]{.underline}
whom political scientists study. [This]{.underline} article [seeks to
elevate the status of scenarios in political science by
demonstrating]{.underline} their [usefulness for theory building and
**pedagogy**. Rather than]{.underline} constitute [mere speculation
regarding an unpredictable future]{.underline}, as critics might
suggest, [scenarios assist]{.underline} scholars [with]{.underline}
developing [testable **hypotheses**]{.underline}, gathering [data, and
identifying a theory\'s]{.underline} upper and lower
[bounds]{.underline}. Additionally, [scenarios are an **effective way to
teach students** to apply theory to policy]{.underline}. In the pages
below, a "best practices" guide is offered to advise scholars,
practitioners, and students, and an argument is developed in favor of
the use of scenarios. The article concludes with two examples of how
[political scientists have invoked the scenario method to
improve]{.underline} the [specifications of]{.underline} their
[theories, propose **falsifiable hypotheses**, and design]{.underline}
new **[empirical research]{.underline}** programs. Scenarios in the
Discipline What do counterfactual narratives about the future look like?
Scenarios may range in length from a few sentences to many pages. One of
[the most common uses of]{.underline} the [scenario]{.underline} method,
which will be referenced throughout this article, [is to study the
conditions under which **high-consequence, low-probability**
events]{.underline} may [occur]{.underline}. Perhaps [the best
example]{.underline} of this [is **nuclear warfare**]{.underline}, a
circumstance that has never resulted, but has captivated generations of
political scientists. For an introductory illustration, let us consider
a very simple scenario regarding how a first use of a nuclear weapon
might occur: During the year 2023, the US military is ordered to launch
air and sea patrols of the Taiwan Strait to aid in a crisis. These
highly visible patrols disrupt trade off China\'s coast, and result in
skyrocketing insurance rates for shipping companies. Several days into
the contingency, which involves over ten thousand US military personnel,
an intelligence estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike
against US air patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States
conducts a preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on
the Chinese mainland. The US strike is far more successful than Chinese
military leaders thought possible; a new source of intelligence to the
United States---unknown to Chinese leadership---allowed the US military
to severely degrade Chinese targeting and situational awareness
capabilities. Many of the weapons that China relied on to dissuade
escalatory US military action are now reduced to single-digit-percentage
readiness. Estimates for repairs and replenishments are stated in terms
of weeks, and China\'s confidence in readily available, but "dumber,"
weapons is low due to the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of
the successful US strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese
publics. The Chinese Government concludes that for the sake of
preserving its domestic strength, and to signal resolve to the US and
Taiwanese Governments while minimizing further economic disruption, it
should escalate dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield
nuclear device against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific
region. [This]{.underline} short story [reflects a future event
that]{.underline}, while unlikely to occur and far too vague to be used
for military planning, [contains]{.underline} many [**dimensions of
political science** theory. These include]{.underline} the following:
what leaders perceive as ["limited," "proportional," or "escalatory"
uses of force]{.underline}; the [importance of]{.underline} private
[information about capabilities]{.underline} and commitment; audience
[costs in international politics; the relationship between
**military**]{.underline} expediency **[and political
objectives]{.underline}** during war; [and]{.underline} the role of
[compressed timelines for decision making]{.underline}, among others.
The purpose of this article is to explain to scholars how such stories,
and more [rigorously developed narratives that specify variables of
interest]{.underline} and draw on extant data, may [**improve the study
of IR**. An important starting point is]{.underline} to explain how
[future counterfactuals]{.underline} fit into the methodological canon
of the discipline.
