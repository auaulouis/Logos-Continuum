[COVID-19 took the world by surprise]{.underline}: for the first time in
living memory, the entire globe was under attack. [Although the pandemic
was quickly understood to be a global challenge, international
cooperation was initially put under severe stress, with uncoordinated
travel bans, competition over acquisition of medical equipment, and
authoritarian powers trying to take advantage of the crisis to push
forward their geopolitical agendas.]{.underline} The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) was also impacted by COVID-19: exercises and
operations were scaled down and some countries repatriated their
militaries to redeploy them at home.1 There were initially few reasons
to be optimistic about either the role of the political-military
alliance in supporting the fight against COVID-19 or the future of the
organization. Less than a year ago, [French President Emmanuel Macron
had referred to NATO as "brain-dead," lamenting the lack of shared
strategy between its members vis-à-vis the most pressing challenges
facing the alliance.]{.underline}2 Furthermore, for the past four years,
U.S. President Donald J. Trump has consistently undermined the
importance of NATO, treating security as transactional and casting
doubts on U.S. commitment to the Article 5 mutual defense clause at the
heart of the North Atlantic Treaty.3 Despite this backdrop and amidst
negative propaganda from China and Russia, NATO established a dedicated
COVID-19 Task Force. Leveraging its experience in crisis management and
disaster relief along with its massive logistical apparatus, the
alliance was able to offer a decisive response through transporting
medical aid and equipment across the globe, fighting against
disinformation, and ultimately preventing the public health crisis from
leading to a traditional security crisis. The goal of this essay is to
provide a critical assessment of NATO's preparedness and response to
COVID-19. By exploring the mechanisms in place, the support offered, and
the measures taken by NATO to avert a security crisis, it provides
reflections on [how lessons learned from this pandemic could help to
manage and prevent similar future crises.]{.underline} In conclusion,
this report argues that [the alliance has proved capable of overcoming
political tensions and has given an important sign of resilience and
solidarity at a crucial moment for its member states. However, more
could have been done with better preparedness in managing health risks
and most importantly with better political coordination between member
states.]{.underline} Despite the disruptive effect COVID-19 had on
global economy and international relations, the virus's impact on the
future of the alliance will be marginal. [NATO's survival and success in
responding to global challenges will ultimately be contingent on a
relaunch of trans-Atlantic relations.]{.underline}

#### Existential disease is [imminent]{.underline} -- current frameworks fail, but international mitigation efforts are the [only hope]{.underline}

Nicholas **Studzinski** 20**20**. MA, Visiting International Research
Fellow at the Policy Institute of King's College London. "Managing
existential risks of pandemics: a systems approach." 2-14-20.

[The world is generally not prepared for a severe pandemic, whether
natural or bio-engineered to evade known variants of vaccines and
medical countermeasures. According to the Global Challenges Foundation,
pandemics are among the key likely causes of the collapse of human
civilisation, defined as a "drastic decrease in human population size
and political, economic/social complexity, globally and for an extended
time." A recent estimate by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
suggests that an outbreak of a magnitude similar to the Great Influenza
of 1918, could result in 360 million deaths, despite modern vaccines,
antivirals and antibiotics.]{.underline} According to a report by the
RAND Corporation, "the spread of infectious disease can be worse than
world wars." The complete costs of a severe pandemic are difficult to
estimate, given the potential array of social, political, agricultural,
and economic impacts. A World Bank analysis put the minimum cost of the
recent Ebola crisis in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone at \$2.8 billion
in GDP. But a subsequent analysis of the total economic and social costs
of the same outbreak was estimated at \$53.19 billion. [In a new paper,
I explore the nature of pandemic risk as a threat to human and
civilisational security and discuss the shortcomings of the currently
accepted international strategy for pandemic preparedness]{.underline}.
In its place, I propose a comprehensive pandemic risk management system
(CPRMS), including a practical roadmap for its institutional
implementation. The current system [Academic and public assessments
confirm a lack of global preparedness. In May 2018, the Johns Hopkins
Centre for Health Security conducted a pandemic simulation called "Clade
X", in which a bioengineered microbe ended up killing 150 million people
within 20 months and producing devastating impacts across the
US]{.underline}. The exercise found that [many vulnerabilities,
including leadership challenges, were "hardwired into the American
system."]{.underline} Established in the wake of the early 21st century
crises with avian influenza, SARS and Ebola, [the current international
pandemic strategy aims to improve preparedness by strengthening the
capacity of national public health systems]{.underline}. This is pursued
via appeals to compliance with the standards of the International Health
Regulations, as part of an emergency framework designed to prevent
outbreaks with infectious disease from becoming international health
crises. [While such efforts are appropriate and necessary, they are
centred primarily on the health sector, with less focus on the global
multisectoral, multidimensional risks and impacts of pandemics. The
current strategy also remains primarily country-focused and reactive,
and as such is not cost-effective, allocatively efficient, or
sustainable for preventing and managing the large-scale impacts of
severe pandemics.]{.underline} A comprehensive pandemic risk management
system (CPRMS) [A new cost-effective system is needed to manage the
spectrum of multisectoral pandemic risk to both national and global
security]{.underline}. Such a comprehensive pandemic risk management
system (CPRMS) would constitute a genuine global public good. [As a
complex-systems-based paradigm, the strategy would help prevent and
manage both the direct human security risks to health and ensure a
critical continuity in the flow of essential services and
infrastructure, sustaining interconnected global socio-economy, on which
human security depends.]{.underline} Characteristics of an effective
CPRMS Human security: [The conceptual grounding of the
approach]{.underline} includes but [transcends the currently dominant,
state-oriented framework of global health security, in favour of a
multidimensional concept of human security.]{.underline} Full-spectrum
risk management: [The CPRMS assumes an integrated system of prevention,
preparedness, response and mitigation, with universal, pre-emptive
vaccine protection against prioritised microbes that threaten the human
genome]{.underline}. It must also mitigate the drivers of cross-species
contagion within human society and secure the functional continuity of
essential services and infrastructure critical to global human security.
Principal characteristics: As a strategically coherent system, [the
CPRMS must be risk-based and grounded in evidence derived through the
emerging discipline of complexity science. The approach must be
long-term and multisectoral, integrating prevention, preparedness and
response in health, essential public services and enabling critical
infrastructure.]{.underline} It needs to be financially and politically
sustainable to meet 21st century challenges at national and global
levels. Organisational framework: [Institutionally, a CPRMS would also
be structured as an organised operational system whose structure and
functions embody the six critical elements of all institutional systems:
harmonised leadership and governance; sustainable financing; information
systems management; requisite human resources; essential commodities and
related logistics; and a capacity for operational interventions and
service delivery]{.underline}. Crucially, governance of the CPRMS must
be envisioned in the broader, increasingly urgent context of managing a
growing complex of existential risks.

[A pandemic]{.underline} (from Greek πᾶν, pan, "all", and δῆμος demos,
"people") [is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through
human populations across a **large region**]{.underline}; [for instance
**several continents**, or even **worldwide**]{.underline}. Here only
worldwide events are included. A widespread endemic disease that is
stable in terms of how many people become sick from it is not a
pandemic. 260 84 Global Challenges -- Twelve risks that threaten human

3.1.4.1 Expected impact disaggregation 3.1.4.2 Probability Influenza
subtypes266 [Infectious [diseases]{.mark} have been [one of the
**greatest causes of mortality in history**]{.mark}. Unlike many other
global challenges pandemics have happened recently, as we can see where
reasonably good data exist. Plotting historic epidemic fatalities on a
log scale reveals that these tend to follow a **power law with a small
exponent**]{.underline}: many plagues have been found to follow a power
law with exponent 0.26.261 [These kinds of power laws are
**heavy-tailed**]{.underline}262 [to a significant
degree]{.underline}.263 [In consequence most of the fatalities are
accounted for by the **top few events**]{.underline}.264 [If this law
holds for future pandemics as well]{.underline},265 [then the
[majority]{.mark} of people who will [die]{.mark} from epidemics will
likely die [from the **single largest**]{.mark}
**pandemic**]{.underline}. Most epidemic fatalities follow a power law,
with some extreme events -- such as the Black Death and Spanish Flu --
being even more deadly.267 There are other grounds for suspecting that
[such a highimpact epidemic will have a [**greater probability**
than]{.mark} **usually [assumed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [All the
[features]{.mark} of an extremely devastating disease **already exist
[in nature]{.mark}**:]{.underline} [essentially]{.underline}
**[[incurable]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([Ebola]{.underline}268), [nearly
always **[fatal]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([rabies]{.underline}269),
**[extremely [infectious]{.mark}]{.underline}** ([common
cold]{.underline}270), [and]{.underline} **[[long incubation]{.mark}
periods]{.underline}** ([HIV]{.underline}271). [[If]{.mark} a pathogen
were to emerge that]{.underline} somehow **[[combined]{.mark} these
features]{.underline}** ([and influenza has demonstrated **antigenic
shift**, the ability to combine features from different
viruses]{.underline}272), [its [death toll]{.mark} would be
[extreme]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Many relevant features of the world have
changed considerably, making past comparisons problematic. The modern
world has better sanitation and medical research]{.underline}, as well
as national and supra-national institutions dedicated to combating
diseases. Private insurers are also interested in modelling pandemic
risks.273 [Set against this is the fact that **[modern
transport]{.mark}** and **[dense]{.mark} human [population]{.mark}**
allow [infections]{.mark} to [spread]{.mark} much more
[rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}274, and there is the potential for urban
slums to serve as breeding grounds for disease.275 Unlike events such as
nuclear wars, pandemics would not damage the world's infrastructure, and
initial survivors would likely be resistant to the infection. And there
would probably be survivors, if only in isolated locations. Hence the
risk of a civilisation collapse would come from [the]{.underline}
**[ripple effect]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the [fatalities
and]{.underline} the [policy responses]{.underline}. These [would
include **[political and ag]{.mark}ricultural
[disruption]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as well as **[economic
dislocation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and [damage to]{.mark} the world's
**[trade]{.mark} network**]{.underline} ([including the food

**[further pandemics]{.mark}**).]{.underline} Five [important factors in
estimating the probabilities and impacts of the
challenge]{.underline}: 1. What the true probability distribution for
pandemics is, especially at the tail. 2. [The capacity of modern
international health systems to deal with an extreme

emergency. 4. How mobility of goods and people, as well as population
density, will affect pandemic transmission. 5. Whether humans can
develop novel and effective anti-pandemic solutions.

#### The aff would strengthen the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme -- that boosts science diplomacy and international mitigation effectiveness

**NATO ESCG** 20**19**. The Emerging Security Challenges Division. "THE
NATO SCIENCE FOR PEACE AND SECURITY SPS PROGRAMME." NATO OTAN. 2019.
IZP)

Now in its seventh decade of existence, [the NATO Science for Peace and
Security (SPS) Programme remains a key vehicle for engaging NATO
partners in practical cooperation in the areas of civil science,
technology, innovation and capacity building]{.underline}. Based on the
Overarching Guidance provided by the North Atlantic Council (NAC[), it
develops and supports key flagship projects in line with NATO's
Strategic Objectives and fosters regional cooperation among
partners]{.underline}. As demonstrated over decades, [the Programme is
very flexible and versatile in its response to changing security
environments and to Allied guidance. SPS top-down flagship activities in
particular are demand- driven responding to Allies' and partners'
priorities for practical cooperation, reflecting NATO's balanced and 360
degree approach.]{.underline} While SPS staff is monitoring the
implementation of its activities on a daily basis, Allies in the
Partnerships and Cooperative Security Committee (PCSC) approve
applications following review and recommendation from the Independent
Scientific Evaluation Group (ISEG). In addition the PCSC is regularly
presented with updates on the progress and results of SPS activities. [A
2014 audit by the Independent Board of Auditors of NATO (IBAN) confirmed
the strong alignment of SPS with the political priorities of the
Alliance, and underlined the effective management of the SPS
Programme.]{.underline} It also provided a number of recommendations
that have been addressed over the last five years to further streamline
the Programme, including efforts to systematically analyze the results
of SPS activities. In 2019, this included the organization of a SPS
cluster workshop on Advanced Technologies. [SPS activities bring
together experts and scientists from NATO and partner countries through
several grant mechanisms, including Multi-Year Projects (MYP), Advanced
Research Workshops (ARW), Advanced Training Courses (ATC), and Advanced
Study Institutes (ASI) that lead to tangible outputs with a concrete
impact and a high public diplomacy value for NATO. This well-established
partnership programme]{.underline} is an integral part of NATO's
Emerging Security Challenges Division (ESCD), and, over the years, [has
helped to forge important international expert networks and build
capacity while addressing a wide range of security concerns as
identified in the SPS key priorities]{.underline}. [These priorities
include counter-terrorism,]{.underline} cyber defence, energy security,
[CBRN defence]{.underline}, the development of advanced technologies
with security applications, mine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection
as well as human and social aspects of security. At the same time, the
SPS Programme has grown to include projects that encompass
capacity-building, hybrid threats and the implementation of UNSCR1325 on
Women, Peace and Security. [In order to achieve its goals, SPS works in
close coordination with other relevant NATO Divisions and
Bodies.]{.underline} STRONG ALIGNMENT WITH NATO'S STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
AND POLITICAL GUIDANCE All SPS activities have a clear link to security
and help to address NATO's Strategic Objectives. [The Programme closely
follows guidance received from Allies, and has repeatedly demonstrated
its flexibility and versatility to adapt to the changing political and
security context]{.underline}. The PCSC is directly overseeing the
implementation of the SPS Programme by approving SPS activities, the
annual SPS Work Programme and the nominations received from Allies for
the Independent Scientific Evaluation Group (ISEG). At the same time,
SPS follows the strategic and political guidance resulting from NATO
Meetings and Summits, such as the July 2018 Brussels Summit and the
December 2019 Leaders' Meeting in London. This has been reflected in the
development of SPS activities to support NATO-wide priorities such as
the Defence and Related Security Capacity Building (DCB) Initiative,
NATO efforts to project stability, the fight against terrorism, and the
strong cooperation with partners in the South, the Western Balkans and
East. SPS has also continued its strong engagement with Ukraine,
including through the 16th annual meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Joint
Working Group Scientific and Environmental Cooperation (JWGSEC) in March
2019. WORKING WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS NATO AND THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY [The SPS Programme relies heavily on its close and
well-established cooperation and coordination with various NATO
stakeholders, including Allied and partner Delegations, NATO Agencies,
Divisions, and Offices, such as the Office of the Secretary General's
Special Representative on Women, Peace and Security]{.underline}. The
Programme has established longtime coordination and cooperation with the
Science and Technology Organization (STO) and the Office of the Chief
Scientist, with one expert from each being an ISEG member. The Senior
SPS and Partnership Cooperation Advisor is an ex-officio member of the
Science and Technology Board (STB) for the ESC Division. Where
appropriate, SPS draws on the expertise of the network of NATO Centers
of Excellence to deliver specialized, modular training activities,
tailored to the needs of partner nations. [The SPS Programme is also
engaging with other International Organizations, including with the
United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), the European Union (EU) and, since 2019, the African
Union, to identify synergies, forge networks and avoid
duplication.]{.underline} SPS PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION FACTS AND FIGURES
Over the last year, the SPS Programme received a total of 130
applications in response to three calls for proposals throughout the
year. Of these, 112 passed the eligibility screening and were
peer-reviewed by the Independent Scientific Evaluation Group (ISEG)
during two meetings. 52 proposals were recommended by the ISEG. The NATO
Partnerships and Cooperative Security Committee (PCSC) met on eight
occasions throughout 2019 to discuss the SPS Programme, and during these
meetings approved new SPS activities. Out of these, 25% were top-down
activities that had been developed in close cooperation with the NATO
and partner countries involved, to respond to their needs and
priorities. While SPS activities cover a wide range of security-relevant
topics, cyber defence, CBRN defence and the development of advanced
technologies were the top three SPS key priority areas addressed by new
activities in 2019. 22 partner countries from all NATO partnership
frameworks are leading last year's newly approved SPS activities.
Multi-Year Projects and Advanced Research Workshops were the most
popular SPS grant mechanisms in 2019. [A total of 32 SPS Multi-Year
Projects were completed in 2019. They helped to build capacity through
the provision of modern equipment and specialized training. They
supported young scientists as they began their careers, and resulted in
new insights, technologies, prototypes and policy recommendations that
can be further developed and applied by end-users.]{.underline} A full
list of SPS projects completed in 2019 can be found in Annex 3. In
addition, in 2019, 31 advanced training courses and research workshops
were carried out, involving approximately 2700 experts, researchers and
young scientists. An exhaustive overview of the SPS events organized in
2019 may be found in Annex 2. The SPS Programme fully executed its
budget of EUR 11.8 M in 2019, maintaining a linear spending curve. A
substantial part of the budget remains allocated for new and ongoing
large-scale MYPs. MODERNIZATION [The SPS Programme continues to foster
the development of scientific and technological innovation by applying
specialized know-how to address emerging security challenges. In
particular, cluster workshops and special calls for proposals maintain
the SPS Programme's position at the leading edge of innovation and
modernization.]{.underline} In this light, the Programme issued two
Special Calls for Proposals in 2019. The Special Call for Proposals on
Advanced Technologies focused on four clusters of topics: communication
systems, advanced materials, sensors and detectors, and unmanned
systems, proving the Programme's dedication to innovating in
security-related civil science. This Special Call was developed
following a cluster workshop on Advanced Technologies in September,
which was in line with the IBAN recommendation to cluster activities in
order to increase networking amongst scientists, to stock-take, and to
ultimately enhance results. In 2019, the Programme also launched a
Special Call for Proposals in the field of Explosives Detection,
specifically in the areas of multi-sensor systems, data analysis, new or
rapidly developing technologies, preparation for actual field
conditions, and dissemination and capacity building. The Programme also
continued to support the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda through
concrete activities, closely coordinated with the office of the NATO
Secretary General's Special Representative on Women, Peace and Security,
and following the guidance provided by the 2018-2020 NATO/EAPC Policy
Action Plan on WPS. Notably, in 2019, SPS completed a MYP that conducted
the first organizational climate assessment of the Georgian Armed
Forces. The MYP addressed the topics of gender equality and
discrimination, with the goal of understanding and enhancing the
conditions of women and men in the armed forces. PROJECTING STABILITY
Projecting Stability with MD and ICI partners continued to be a priority
in 2019. This included new initiatives and progress in ongoing
activities in support of the DCB initiative with key partners such as
Tunisia and Jordan. Highlights included the completion of the SPS
tailor- made training package at the NATO-ICI Regional Centre in Kuwait;
the launch of a MYP with Morocco and Jordan to study emerging security
challenges in NATO's southern neighborhood; the development of a C-IED
project under the DCB package for Tunisia; and the kick-off of a mobile
CBRN laboratory (DIMLAB) with Tunisia and Morocco. Building on a
recently completed MYP, which established a Computer Emergency Response
Team within the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF), in 2019 SPS delivered
tailored intermediary and advanced-level cyber security training for the
JAF. In 2019, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the
Mediterranean Dialogue partnership framework, SPS celebrated its active
cooperation with MD partners, which has resulted in 528 activities since
1994. NATO also recognized its engagement with Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative partners during the 15th anniversary of the partnership
framework in 2019. The ICI anniversary coincided with the completion of
a package of ATCs delivered at the NATO-ICI Regional Center in Kuwait.
In light of these anniversaries, 2019 was a defining year for NATO's
partnerships in the South, marked by NAC visits to Ankara and Kuwait
city to commemorate the occasions. SPS cooperation with partners in the
East was also highlighted through a number of flagship activities. For
instance, cyber defence remained at the core of SPS contributions to the
DCB package for the Republic of Moldova, which addressed the Moldovan
Armed Forces Incident Response Capability Centre's need for adequate
hardware and software. SPS also maintained its strong relationship with
Ukraine, which remains the largest beneficiary of the Programme. In
2019, Ukraine was involved in 28 ongoing activities, a number of them
being flagship projects, such as the DEXTER programme. On November 21,
the SPS Programme held an Information Day in Kyiv to reflect upon the
achievements of the partnership since 1991, and to invite Ukrainian
scientists and experts to continue to contribute to scientific
cooperation for peace and security. COOPERATION WITH PARTNERS ACROSS THE
GLOBE [Aligning with NATO's 360 degree approach, the SPS Programme
remained open to cooperation with all partners in 2019. A number of SPS
activities involved NATO's Partners across the Globe (PaG]{.underline}).
2019 saw the first ever practical activity with NATO's newest partner
nation, Colombia, under the key priority of counter- terrorism. Experts
and scientists from the Republic of Korea and Pakistan were also
involved in ongoing SPS flagship projects in counter-terrorism,
respectively the "Microwave Imaging Curtain" project under the umbrella
of the DEXTER programme, and the MYP "Public Safety Communication in
Context Related to Terror Attacks". SPS also furthered NATO's
cooperation with Japan through the Cyber Defence Workshop 'Assessing
Risk and Building Cooperation in Cyber Defence', which took place in
October in Tokyo. SPS ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST
TERRORISM [The SPS Programme has been a platform to engage partners in
practical cooperation on counter-terrorism, supporting NATO's wider
efforts in this area]{.underline}. In line with the 2017 Action Plan on
Enhancing NATO's contributions to the International Community's Fight
against Terrorism, SPS continued to address a wide range of CT-related
topics throughout 2019. CT capacity building activities were built on
existing cooperation and frameworks, particularly the DCB initiative.
SPS pursued the implementation of activities that were kicked-off as a
result of the Special Call for Proposals on Counter-Terrorism, which
closed in 2018. In July, a Consortium Agreement was signed by eight NATO
and partner nations, thereby launching the DEXTER (Detection of
Explosives and Firearms to Counter Terrorism) programme. This flagship
activity aims to develop an integrated system to detect explosives and
firearms in a mass-transit environment, without disrupting the flow of
pedestrians. Another highlight of the CT agenda in 2019 included the
first cooperative activity with the African Union with a focus on
counter-terrorism capacity building. Going forward, there is potential
for increased cooperation with a number of stakeholders contributing to
the international fight against terrorism.

#### Independently, science diplomacy solves regulation of emerging biotech

In the early 1970s concern was expressed over threats and impacts of
advances in biology, particularly on the impacts of genetic engineering,
and Issues related to biosafety and regulations were discussed. [[As
genetic engineering was]{.mark} getting [established]{.mark} as a novel
technology that had huge potential to benefit and harm,
[scientists]{.mark} themselves [were]{.mark} [concerned about
biosafety]{.mark} and issues arising out of recombinant DNA research.
[So]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [the Asimolar]{.mark} [Conference]{.mark},
convened by scientists themselves a Declaration was adopted and
[scientists]{.mark} [decided]{.mark} that [they would adopt
self-regulation]{.mark} as at that time there was no national level
legislation/regulation in the USA. The rules adopted by the scientists
laid the foundation stone for modern biotechnology
regulation]{.underline}. Over the next few years, it became clear that
fears were exaggerated and recombinant DNA research was crucial in
biotechnology research. Today about four decades and a half have
passed[. Still the Asimolar conference is regarded as a pioneering
conference, not just for the technical issues discussed there, but also
for the decision to adopt self-regulation and minimize potential
risk.]{.underline} Scientists thus responded to public concerns and
concerns within the scientific community. What was novel once often
turns out be routine and an ordinary matter over a period of time. The
same has happened to the techniques and technologies discussed in
Asimolar Conference, as recombinant DNA research soon became a routine
affair in biotechnology. It became clear that fears were exaggerated and
technology resulted in applications, many of which were not envisaged
then. A criticism of the Conference was that it ignored ethical, legal
and social impacts (ELSI) of the technology and focused solely on
technical issues and concern for environment and health. Yet [the key
lessons from Asimolar were that developing consensus was critical and
prudent action in light of uncertainty was important]{.underline}.1
[[Today, we have]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies/ applications [such as
synthetic biology that confer]{.mark} to scientists [far more
power]{.mark} than genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technologies
did]{.underline}.2 But they have such a wide-ranging impact that
discussion on ethical, legal and social implications are part of the
debate among scientists, National Academies of Science and regulators.
In case of human genome project, a specific percentage of money as
allocated for ELSI research and governments and scientists made efforts
to reach out to the public and allay their fears as well as to learn
from the public about their concerns, values, fears and expectations.
But governing human genome mapping was relatively easier as the number
of countries was limited and they had come to an understanding among
themselves. So, [except for a few issues like intellectual property
rights and data management models, human genome mapping did not emerge
as a challenge for governance at the international level.]{.underline}
At the national level, countries had revised their regulations based on
regulation of biotechnology/genetic engineering. [In case of human
reproductive cloning while there was a UN declaration on banning human
reproductive cloning, progress could not be made on a binding
international treaty on human reproductive cloning]{.underline}.
Although efforts were made to build a consensus and move towards a
binding treaty it did not go beyond a point, because consensus did not
emerge. Thus while. In 2005, the United Nations adopted Declaration on
Human Cloning, a binding treaty is nowhere is sight. Still it is
suggested that [a global governance framework may still be
possible.]{.underline} [Synthetic biology is not governed by any
international treaty or convention]{.underline}. In the last few years
it has been discussed in Convention on Biological Diversity and many
studies have been done. The forthcoming COP-MOP to be held next year in
Kun Ming, China is likely to make some progress on this. But given its
implications for biosafety and biosecurity, whether the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD) is the right forum is a question. [At the
same time as it has ramifications for other sectors ranging from health
to agriculture, its governance at the global level raises new
challenges. These range from whether the precautionary principle is the
right principle to govern synthetic biology to whether products of
synthetic biology are treated as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) /
Living Modified Organisms (LMO) or their equivalent.]{.underline} In
December 2017 the ad-hoc technical experts group created by Parties to
the Convention on Biological Diversity , decided that organisms
developed or being developed under current methods of synthetic biology
, including the ones containing gene drives will fall under the category
of LMOs. LMOs are regulated under Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB).
CPB has been ratified by most countries in the world and has 171 Parties
to it. CPB has an elaborate mechanism to handle LMOs and invokes the
Precautionary Principle. So negotiating further under CBD/CPB seems to
be a better option but some of the countries that are innovators in
Synthetic Biology and Gene Drives are not Parties to CBD or CPB. For
example, USA is not a Party to CBD while Australia, and, Canada are not
parties to CPB. [Noting that broader shifts in global biodiversity
governance are happening, Rabitz points out that a broader package deal
with specific provisions on Gene Drive Organisms (GDO) can be arrived at
the forth coming COP-MOP (]{.underline}Rabitz, 2019; P.9). [But in the
case of Synthetic Biology there is a strong and growing Do It Yourself
Biology (DIY Bio) movement that has become global and the DIY Bio
community is also an important contributor in terms of innovation and
events like iGEM incentivize students to work on Synthetic Biology.
[This diffusion of tech]{.mark}nology [among those who do not work under
the]{.mark} [typical biosafety regulatory regime]{.mark} and the
diversity in their uses and applications [is a challenge]{.mark} to
governing Synthetic Biology]{.underline}. Most of the DIY Bio groups are
aware of biosafety concerns and adopt safety procedures and take
precautionary measures. [How to regulate and govern DIY Bio is a key
issue because [DIY Bio]{.mark} promotes citizen science and enables
better understanding of science and hence has to be supported but as it
[raises questions on biosecurity, biosafety and bioterrorism]{.mark}, it
cannot be left entirely to DIY Bio groups.]{.underline} Will self-
regulation combined with monitoring by a government agency is enough or
should this also be regulated as a regular scientific activity? [Genome
Editing is a novel technology that has emerged since 2012 or so, and is
revolutionizing the way scientists handle and manipulate genomes. While
human genome mapping enabled scientists to explore and understand the
genome better, Genome Editing, offers them tools and protocols to edit
the Genome, or, 'to rewrite the genetic code'.]{.underline} There are
some common features among Synthetic Biology, Genome Editing, Gene
Drives and GM Mosquitoes from a governance perspective: [• There is no
clarity on applicability of any convention/treaty for their governance
globally]{.underline} • Although nations have been trying to develop
frameworks and regulatory norms[, there are many unresolved issues
ranging from categorization/ classification to identifying appropriate
governance principles]{.underline}. For example should Gene Drives be
classified as LMOs? Should Genome Edited Crops be treated as similar to
crops bred in traditional plant breeding programs or as GMOs for
regulatory purposes. • Are principles like precautionary principle
adequate to develop regulatory regimes •
Traditionalriskassessmentsmaynotbe sufficient to fully understand the
long terms environmental impacts of these • [Given the gaps in knowledge
about impacts, issues on impact assessment methodologies, there are
uncertainties on assessing their impacts • They raise concerns about
biosafety and biosecurity and some of these are new and arise out of
their unique and novel features, and, this includes concerns about DIY
bio]{.underline}.3 • Given the wide-ranging applications in different
sectors, is it possible to develop coherent governance frameworks, which
can adapt in tune with technological developments. The good news is that
different stakeholders are aware of these and are trying to understand
the implications. Thus, whether it is National Academies of Sciences or
WHO or professional bodies representing scientists or Parties to
different Conventions/Treaties there are many initiatives on debating
about governance issues and to develop a common understanding, if not a
consensus. For example WHO has established a "expert advisory committee
on Developing global standards for governance and oversight of Human
Genome editing" and it has started functioning. Parties to The
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) are discussing the
implications of advancements in science and technology, including genome
editing for BWTC. A paper submitted by Switzerland states (BWTC, 2018):
["[CRISPR]{.mark} technology [can]{.mark} reasonably be expected to
[surprise us with new twists and turns impossible to predict.]{.mark}
This is likely also true for many other areas, including the above
discussed nucleic acid origami, but also for synthetic biology or the
neurosciences. In this context, it will be important to keep track of
scientific and technological advances, and their potential bearings on
the Convention.]{.underline} At the upcoming MX2, we should hold a
technical discussion on genome editing technologies, and especially
CRISPR technology, to then take the next step towards an assessment of
their implications for the Convention by putting them into the broader
context of the 'new era of biology'. In doing so, [we should broaden our
traditional focus of 'pathogens causing disease' to the wider prospects
and implications that developments in the biosciences as a whole may
have.]{.underline} Furthermore, technical discussions should also take
into account any intangible aspects (e.g. 'tacit knowledge') of advances
in science and technology, which may significantly shift initial
perceptions about benefits and risks. All of this will allow for a
holistic and more realistic understanding of the benefits and risks to
the Convention" The figure 1 illustrates some of the concerns on the
potential of recent developments in science and technology. (figure 1
omitted) According to Diane DiEuliis and James Giordano (2017):
["'Neurohacking' will increase, and biotechnology, such as CRISPR/ Cas
and novel gene editors, will provide tools to realize production of
novel neuroagents with dual-use potential.]{.underline} Simple
acknowledgment of these facts, however, is insufficient. [It will be
essential to pursue and obtain a deeper and fuller understanding of the
ways that genetic pathways to human cognitive and behavioral
modification can be engaged for dual and direct use as
neuroweapons]{.underline}, [to formulate policies based on this level of
understanding, and to engage surveillance of the use of these
technologies in various silos of development and application, so as to
afford both preventive and more preparatory capabilities"]{.underline}
(Pp. 300-301) For obvious reasons, 'creating' babies through genome
editing with enhanced traits or similar application have created a mixed
feeling, from awe and wonder, to repulsion and shock. [Even as nations
struggle to regulate genome editing in health sector, [the absence
of]{.mark} [international norms]{.mark} for governance can
[result]{.mark} [in]{.mark} tricky situations and [unanticipated turn of
events]{.mark}]{.underline}. While giving an example of such a tricky
situation, Dounda and Sternberg (2017), suggest that [international
governance is a better solution,]{.underline} by pointing out: "A
cautionary tale on the risks of inaction can already be seen with a
related assisted reproductive technology known as mitochondrial
replacement therapy, which is being developed but is not yet clinically
approved in the US. In a recent case, however, a New York physician
exported genetically modified embryos to Mexico for implantation,
specifically to evade US restrictions. Imagine the type of industry that
might result if the intent were not to produce an embryo free of genetic
disease, but an embryo with a genetic enhancement enabled by CRISPR.
[Robust international governance could discourage this kind of medical
tourism, assure equal protection for the citizens of all nations, set
international gene editing standards for scientists and companies, and
help prevent trade disputes with gene-edited foods.]{.underline} The
challenge is determining what mechanism of international convergence is
actually possible, given the substantial legal differences that are
already in place across the globe on issues like GMOs and genetic
modification of human embryos." [Given the challenges in developing
governance norms and principles for these emerging technologies is there
a role for Science Diplomacy in helping countries to develop governance
frameworks and arrive at commonly agreed principles, if not a consensus?
The answer is YES.]{.underline} [[Science Diplomacy can play]{.mark} key
role as 'Science for Diplomacy' and 'Diplomacy for Science' can play [a
vital role in bringing together]{.mark} [scientists, regulators and
policy makers]{.mark} by acting as interfaces and help in building
bridges]{.underline}. It is not important that countries should start
with a common understanding or with shared objectives. But [through
deliberations, countries can at least find out points they agree fully,
points they totally disagree and points they agree and disagree with a
give and take attitude. Science diplomacy can help countries in
identifying these points and identify how their respective positions are
shaped by these points. For example with respect to human genome editing
for reproductive purposes, [countries can]{.mark} at least [agree on
what they want to prohibit]{.mark} at all costs [and how they will
ensure that]{.mark}, In arriving at such a common position, [science
diplomacy can play a vital role]{.mark} [when scientists and diplomats
work together]{.mark} towards this]{.underline}. While scientists can
rely on positions taken by National Academies and ethical guidelines in
vogue in the respective countries, diplomats can negotiate on developing
flexible positions and norms that are beyond any bargain or compromise.
[Mutual interactions among them will enable a better understanding that
can be used to arrive at a shared understanding for further
deliberations.]{.underline} Through track II diplomacy, other
stakeholders can contribute to further progress on developing such an
understanding. On the other hand Science Diplomacy can be part of track
II diplomacy although it may not be very visible. [If we conceptualize
that Science Diplomacy is a broad activity that goes beyond closed doors
of forums for negotiations, and, activities of scientists and diplomats,
then we have to consider the role of, inter alia, non-state actors, and,
civil society in activities related to developing norms for governance.
Given the importance of public engagement and public participation,
[Science]{.mark} [Diplomacy can]{.mark} facilitate that by
[engag]{.mark}ing [with other stakeholders directly or
indirectly]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example while in many of the
Conference of Parties and Meeting of Parties (COP- MOP) , civil society
groups and others that are recognized, can participate as observers ,
their influence among the public and their role in shaping public
opinion also has to be taken into account. Science Diplomacy can be
useful in engaging with them as observers as well as interfaces between
public on one hand, and, scientists and policy makers, on the other
hand. Obviously the tasks are not easy and there are many challenges.
Although there can be a consensus translating that into a binding
agreement or treaty is not easy. [As these technologies have biosafety
and biosecurity concerns, it is likely that Parties to BWTC will address
those concerns as far as BWTC is concerned]{.underline}. Similarly some
of the concerns relating to environmental impacts, long term impacts,
and risk assessment can be addressed through deliberations by Parties of
CBD/ CPB, which might result in changes/ additions/revisions in CBD/CPB.
The WHO's expert advisory committee can develop guidelines to regulate
genome editing for health/population related purposes. Dounda and
Sternberg have identified some relevant initiatives in governance of
genome editing. Thus [there is scope for using health diplomacy,
environmental diplomacy and perhaps innovation diplomacy in moving
towards governance norms for these technologies.]{.underline} [But this
will not happen on its own. Until countries realize that Science
Diplomacy is essential to address tricky questions in international
governance of these technologies and understand that some nudging
including persuasion is required through Science Diplomacy and create
forums and spaces for diplomats and scientists to interact and work
together, Science Diplomacy will not have an effective role in
this.]{.underline} As many of the Science Academies are active in
addressing issues relating to governance, in each country, a small team
from representatives of these Academies, negotiators can be formed to
develop a coherent negotiating strategy across different forums,
COP-MOPs etc. [One hopes that the countries will seize the opportunities
for Science Diplomacy to play a positive role and give it the importance
it deserves in this challenging task.]{.underline} Having said that, we
should not expect that Science Diplomacy will be the saviour or a factor
that could override all other factors in moving towards a consensus.
Perhaps developments in this year and the next few years will indicate
the directions in which the world is moving in governing these
technologies.

[[How worthwhile is it spending resources to]{.mark} study and
[mitigate]{.mark} [the chance of human extinction from biological
risks]{.mark}?]{.underline} The risks of such a catastrophe are
presumably low, so a skeptic might argue that addressing such risks
would be a waste of scarce resources. [In this article, we investigate
this position using a cost-effectiveness approach and ultimately
conclude that [the expected value of reducing these risks is
large]{.mark}, especially [since]{.mark} [such risks jeopardize the
existence of all future human lives]{.mark}.]{.underline} Historically,
disease events have been responsible for the greatest death tolls on
humanity. The 1918 flu was responsible for more than 50 million deaths,1
while smallpox killed perhaps 10 times that many in the 20th century
alone.2 The Black Death was responsible for killing over 25% of the
European population,3 while other pandemics, such as the plague of
Justinian, are thought to have killed 25 million in the 6th
century---constituting over 10% of the world\'s population at the time.4
It is an open question whether a future pandemic could result in
outright human extinction or the irreversible collapse of civilization.
A skeptic would have many good reasons to think that existential risk
from disease is unlikely. Such a disease would need to spread worldwide
to remote populations, overcome rare genetic resistances, and evade
detection, cures, and countermeasures. Even evolution itself may work in
humanity\'s favor: Virulence and transmission is often a trade-off, and
so evolutionary pressures could push against maximally lethal wild-type
pathogens.5,6 While these arguments point to a very small risk of human
extinction, they do not rule the possibility out entirely. Although
rare, [there are recorded instances of species going extinct due to
disease---primarily in amphibians, but also in 1 mammalian species of
rat on Christmas Island]{.underline}.7,8 [There are also historical
examples of large human populations being almost entirely wiped out by
disease, especially when multiple diseases were simultaneously
introduced into a population without immunity.]{.underline} The most
striking examples of total population collapse include native American
tribes exposed to European diseases, such as the Massachusett (86% loss
of population), Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of population), and the
Western Abenaki (which suffered a staggering 98% loss of population).9
In the modern context, no single disease currently exists that combines
the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to
countermeasures, and global reach. But [many diseases are proof of
principle that [each worst-case attribute can be realized
independently]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example, [some diseases exhibit
nearly a 100% case fatality ratio]{.mark} in the absence of treatment,
such as rabies or septicemic plague]{.underline}. [[Other
diseases]{.mark} have a track record of [spreading to virtually every
human]{.mark} community [worldwide]{.mark}, such as the 1918 flu,10 and
seroprevalence studies indicate that other pathogens, such as chickenpox
and HSV-1, can successfully reach over 95% of a
population]{.underline}.11,12 Under optimal virulence theory, natural
evolution would be an unlikely source for pathogens with the highest
possible levels of transmissibility, virulence, and global reach. But
[[advances in biotech]{.mark}nology might [allow the creation of
diseases that combine such traits.]{.mark} Recent controversy has
already emerged over a number of scientific experiments that resulted in
viruses with enhanced transmissibility, lethality, and/or the ability to
overcome therapeutic]{.underline}s.13-17 [Other experiments demonstrated
that mousepox could be modified to have a 100% case fatality rate and
render a vaccine ineffective.]{.underline}18 In addition to
transmissibility and lethality, studies have shown that [other disease
traits, such as incubation time, environmental survival, and available
vectors, could be modified as well]{.underline}.19-21 Although these
experiments had scientific merit and were not conducted with malicious
intent, their [implications are still worrying]{.underline}. [This is
especially true given that [there is]{.mark} also [a long historical
track record of state-run bioweapon research]{.mark} applying
cutting-edge science and technology to design agents not previously seen
in nature.]{.underline} The Soviet bioweapons program developed agents
with traits such as enhanced virulence, resistance to therapies, greater
environmental resilience, increased difficulty to diagnose or treat, and
which caused unexpected disease presentations and outcomes.22 [Delivery
capabilities have also been subject to the cutting edge of technical
development, with Canadian, US, and UK bioweapon efforts playing a
critical role in developing the discipline of
aerobiology]{.underline}.23,24 While there is no evidence of state-run
bioweapons programs directly attempting to develop or deploy bioweapons
that would pose an existential risk, [the logic of [deterrence and
m]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured [d]{.mark}estruction [could
create]{.mark} such [incentives]{.mark} [in]{.mark} more [unstable
political environments]{.mark} or following a breakdown of the
Biological Weapons Convention]{.underline}.25 [The [possibility of a
war]{.mark} between great powers [could]{.mark} also [increase
the]{.mark} [pressure to use such weapons]{.mark}---during the World
Wars, bioweapons were used across multiple continents, with Germany
targeting animals in WWI,]{.underline}26 [and Japan using plague to
cause an epidemic in China during WWII.]{.underline}27 [[Non-state
actors may also pose a risk]{.mark}, especially those with explicitly
omnicidal aims]{.underline}. While rare, there are examples. [The Aum
Shinrikyo cult in Japan sought biological weapons for the express
purpose of causing extinction.]{.underline}28 [Environmental groups,
such as the Gaia Liberation Front, have argued that "we can ensure
Gaia\'s survival only through the extinction of the Humans as a species
... we now have the specific technology for doing the job ... several
different \[genetically engineered\] viruses could be
released"]{.underline}(quoted in ref. 29). [Groups such as R.I.S.E. also
sought to protect nature by destroying most of humanity with
bioweapons.]{.underline}30 Fortunately, [to date, [non-state
actors]{.mark} have [lacked]{.mark} the [capabilities]{.mark} needed to
pose a catastrophic bioweapons threat, [but this could change]{.mark} in
future decades [as biotech]{.mark}nology [becomes more accessible and
the pool of experienced users]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[grows]{.underline}]{.mark}.31,32 What is the appropriate response to
these speculative extinction threats? A balanced biosecurity portfolio
might include investments that reduce a mix of proven and speculative
risks, but striking this balance is still difficult given the massive
uncertainties around the low-probability, high-consequence risks. In
this article, we examine the traditional spectrum of biosecurity risks
(ie, biocrimes, bioterrorism, and biowarfare) to categorize biothreats
by likelihood and impact, expanding the historical analysis to consider
even lower-probability, higher-consequence events (catastrophic risks
and existential risks). In order to produce reasoned estimates of the
likelihood of different categories of biothreats, we bring together
relevant data and theory and produce some first-guess estimates of the
likelihood of different categories of biothreat, and we use these
initial estimates to compare the cost-effectiveness of reducing
existential risks with more traditional biosecurity measures. We
emphasize that these models are highly uncertain, and their utility lies
more in enabling order-of-magnitude comparisons rather than as a precise
measure of the true risk. However, even with the most conservative
models, we find that reduction of low-probability, high-consequence
risks can be more cost-effective, as measured by quality-adjusted life
year per dollar, especially when we account for the lives of future
generations. This suggests that despite the low probability of such
events, society still ought to invest more in preventing the most
extreme possible biosecurity catastrophes The Impact Spectrum of Various
Biothreats Here, we use historical data to analyze the probability and
severity of biothreats. We place biothreats in 6 loose categories:
incidents, events, disasters, crises, global catastrophic risk, and
existential risk. Together they form an overlapping spectrum of
increasing impact and decreasing likelihood (Figure 1). (Figure 1
omitted) The historical use of bioweapons provides useful examples of
some categories of biothreats. Biocrimes and bioterrorism provide
examples of incidents.† Biological warfare provides examples of events
and disasters. These historical examples provide indicative data on
likelihood and impact that we can then feed into a cost-effectiveness
analysis. We should note that these data are both sparse and sometimes
controversial. Where possible, we use multiple datasets to corroborate
our numbers, but ultimately the "true rate" of bioweapon attacks is
highly uncertain. Biocrimes and Bioterrorism Historically, risks of
biocrime‡ and bioterrorism§ have been limited. A 2015 Risk and Benefit
Analysis for Gain of Function Research detailed 24 biocrimes between
1990 and 2015 (0.96 per year) and an additional 42 bioterrorism
incidents between 1972 and 2014 (1 per year).36 This is consistent with
other estimates of biocrimes and bioterrorism frequency, which range
from 0.35 to 3.5 per year (see supplementary material, part 1, at
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028). Most
attacks typically result in no more than a handful of casualties (and
many of these events include hoaxes, threats, and attacks that had no
casualties at all). For example, the anthrax letter attacks in the
United States in 2001, perhaps the most high-profile case in recent
years, resulted in only 17 infections with 5 fatalities.37 The 2015 Risk
and Benefit Analysis for Gain of Function Research detailed only a
single death from the recorded biocrimes.\*\* Only 1 of the bioterrorism
incidents in the report had associated deaths (the 2001 anthrax letter
attacks).36 Based on this data, for the purposes of this article, we
assume that we could expect 1 incident per year resulting in up to tens
of deaths. Biological Warfare Academic overviews of biological warfare††
detail 7 programs prior to 1945.38 A further 9 programs are recorded
between 1945 and 1994.39 For most of the last century, at least 1
program was active in any given year (Table 1). (Table 1 omitted) The
actual use of bioweapons by states is less common: Over the 85 years
covered by these histories (1915 to 2000), 18 cases of use (or possible
use) were recorded, including outbreaks connected to biological warfare
(see supplementary material, part 2, at
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028).
Extrapolating this out (dividing 18 by 85), we would have about a 20%
chance per year of biowarfare. It is worth noting the limitations of
these data. Most of these events occurred before the introduction of the
Biological Weapons Convention and were conducted by countries that no
longer have biological weapons programs. Since many of these incidents
occurred during infrequent great power wars, we revise our best guess to
around 10% chance per year of biowarfare. We use 2 sets of data to
estimate the magnitude of such events. The first dataset was Japanese
biological warfare in China,40 where records indicate a series of
attacks on towns resulted in a mean of 330 casualties per event and 1
case in which an attack resulted in a regional outbreak causing an
estimated 30,000 deaths (see supplementary material, part 3, at
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028). The second
data set came from disease events that were alleged to have an unnatural
origin.41 In one case study, a point source release of anthrax resulted
in at least 66 deaths. In a second case study, a regional epidemic of
the same disease resulted in more than 17,000 human cases. While these
events were not confirmed as having been caused by biological warfare,
contemporary or subsequent analysis has suggested that such an origin
was at least feasible. Combined, these figures provide an estimated
impact of between 66 to 330 and 17,000 to 30,000. For the purposes of
this analysis, we are assuming the lower boundary figures from
biological warfare are indicative of events, with a likelihood of 10%
per year and an impact ranging between tens and thousands of fatalities.
The upper boundary figures from biological warfare are indicative of
disasters, with a likelihood of 1% per year and an impact range of
thousands to tens of thousands of fatalities.‡‡ Go to: Global
Catastrophic and Existential Risk [Unlike standard biothreats, there is
no historical record on which to draw when considering global
catastrophic or existential risks]{.underline}. Alternative approaches
are required to estimate the likelihood of such an event. [Given the
high degree of uncertainty, we adopt 3 different approaches to
approximate the risk of extinction from bioweapons: utilizing surveys of
experts, previous major risk assessments, and simple toy
models]{.underline}. These should be taken as initial guesses or rough
order-of-magnitude approximations, and not a reliable or precise
measure. Model 1: Survey of 2008 Global Catastrophic Risk Conference An
informal survey at the 2008 Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk Conference
asked participants to estimate the chance that disasters of different
types would occur before 2100. Participants had a median risk estimate
of 0.05% that a natural pandemic would lead to human extinction by 2100,
and a median risk estimate of 2% that an "engineered" pandemic would
lead to extinction by 2100.42 The advantage of the survey is that it
directly measures the quantity that we are interested in: probability of
extinction from bioweapons. The disadvantage is that the estimates were
likely highly subjective and unreliable, especially as the survey did
not account for response bias, and the respondents were not calibrated
beforehand. We therefore also turn to other models that, while indirect,
provide more objective measures of risk.§§ Model 2: Potentially Pandemic
Pathogens [Recent controversial experiments on H5N1 influenza prompted
discussions as to the risks of deliberately creating potentially
pandemic pathogens. These agents are those that are highly
transmissible, capable of uncontrollable spread in human populations,
highly virulent, and also possibly able to overcome medical
countermeasures]{.underline}.44 Previous work in a comprehensive report
done by Gryphon Scientific, Risk and Benefit Analysis of Gain of
Function Research,36 has laid out very detailed risk assessments of
potentially pandemic pathogen research, suggesting that the annual
probability of a global pandemic resulting from an accident with this
type of research in the United States is 0.002% to 0.1%. The report also
concluded [that risks of deliberate misuse were about as serious as the
risks of an accidental outbreak]{.underline}, suggesting a 2-fold
increase in risk. Assuming that 25% of relevant research is done in the
United States as opposed to elsewhere in the world, this gives us a
further 4-fold increase in risk. In total, this 8-fold increase in risk
gives us a 0.016% to 0.8% chance of a pandemic in the future each year
(see supplementary material, part 4, at
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0028). The
analysis in Risk and Benefit Analysis of Gain of Function Research
suggested that [lab outbreaks from wild-type influenza viruses could
result in between 4 million and 80 million deaths,36 but others have
suggested that if some of the modified pathogens were to escape from a
laboratory, they could cause up to 1 billion fatalities.]{.underline}45
For the purposes of this model, we assume that for any global pandemic
arising from this kind of research, each has only a 1 in 10,000\*\*\*
chance of causing an existential risk. This figure is somewhat arbitrary
but serves as an excessively conservative guess that would include
worst-case situations in which scientists intentionally cause harm,
where civilization permanently collapses following a particularly bad
outbreak, or other worst-case scenarios that would result in existential
risk. Multiplying the probability of an outbreak with the probability of
an existential risk gives us an annual risk probability between
1.6 × 10--8 and 8 × 10--7.††† Model 3: Naive Power Law Extrapolation
Previous literature has found that casualty numbers from terrorism and
warfare follow a power law distribution, including terrorism from
WMDs.46 Power laws have the property of being scale invariant, meaning
that the ratio in likelihood between events that cause the deaths of 10
people and 10,000 people will be the same as that between 10,000 people
and 10,000,000 people.‡‡‡ This property results in a distribution with
an exceptionally heavy tail, so that the vast majority of events will
have very low casualty rates, with a couple of extreme outliers. Past
studies have estimated this ratio for terrorism using biological and
chemical weapons to be about 0.5 for 1 order of magnitude,47 meaning
that an attack that kills 10x people is about 3 times less likely
(100.5) than an attack that kills 10x--1 people (a concrete example is
that attacks with more than 1,000 casualties, such as the Aum Shinrikyo
attacks, will be about 30 times less probable than an attack that kills
a single individual). Extrapolating the power law out, we find that the
probability that an attack kills more than 5 billion will be (5
billion)--0.5 or 0.000014. Assuming 1 attack per year (extrapolated on
the current rate of bio-attacks) and assuming that only 10% of such
attacks that kill more than 5 billion eventually lead to extinction (due
to the breakdown of society, or other knock-on effects), we get an
annual existential risk of 0.0000014 (or 1.4 × 10--6). We can also use
similar reasoning for warfare, where we have more reliable data (97 wars
between 1820 and 1997, although the data are less specific to biological
warfare). The parameter for warfare is 0.41,47 suggesting that wars that
result in more than 5 billion casualties will comprise (5
billion)--0.41 = 0.0001 of all wars. Our estimate assumes that wars will
occur with the same frequency as in 1820 to 1997, with 1 new war arising
roughly every 2 years. It also assumes that in these extreme outlier
scenarios, nuclear or contagious biological weapons would be the cause
of such high casualty numbers, and that bioweapons specifically would be
responsible for these enormous casualties about 10% of the time
(historically bioweapons were deployed in WWI, WWII, and developed but
not deployed in the Cold War---constituting a bioweapons threat in every
great power war since 1900). Assuming that 10% of biowarfare escalations
resulting in more than 5 billion deaths eventually lead to extinction,
we get an annual existential risk from biowarfare of 0.0000005 (or
5 × 10--7). Perhaps the most interesting implication of the fatalities
following a power law with a small exponent is that the majority of the
expected casualties come from rare, catastrophic events. The data also
bear this out for warfare and terrorism. The vast majority of US
terrorism deaths occurred during 9/11, and the vast majority of
terrorism injuries in Japan over the past decades came from a single Aum
Shinrikyo attack. Warfare casualties are dominated by the great power
wars. This suggests that a typical individual is far more likely to die
from a rare, catastrophic attack as opposed to a smaller scale and more
common one. If our goal is to reduce the greatest expected number of
fatalities, we may be better off devoting resources to preventing the
worst possible attacks. Why Uncertainty Is Not Cause for Reassurance
Each of our estimates rely to some extent on guesswork and remain highly
uncertain. Technological breakthroughs in areas such as diagnostics,
vaccines, and therapeutics, as well as vastly improved surveillance, or
even eventual space colonization, could reduce the chance of
disease-related extinction by many orders of magnitude. Other
[breakthroughs such as highly distributed DNA synthesis or improved
understanding of how to construct and modify diseases could
increase]{.underline} or decrease [the risks. [Destabilizing political
forces]{.mark}, the breakdown of the Biological Weapons Convention, or
warfare between major world powers [could]{.mark} vastly
[increase]{.mark} the amount of [investment in]{.mark}
[bioweapons]{.mark} [and create the incentives to]{.mark} actively
[use]{.mark} knowledge and [biotech]{.mark}nology [in
destructive]{.mark} [ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each of these factors
suggests that our wide estimates could still be many orders of magnitude
off from the true risk in this century. But uncertainty is not cause for
reassurance. In instances where the probability of a catastrophe is
thought to be extremely low (eg, human extinction from bioweapons),
greater uncertainty around the estimates will typically imply greater
risk of the catastrophe, as we have reduced confidence that the risk is
actually at a low level.48 §§§ [Given that our conservative models are
based on historical data, they fail to account for the primary source of
future risk: technological development that could radically democratize
the ability to build advanced bioweapons. If the cost and required
expertise of developing bioweapons falls far enough, the world might
enter a phase where offensive capabilities dominate defensive ones. Some
scholars,]{.underline} such as Martin Rees, [think that [humanity has
about]{.mark} [a 50% chance of going extinct]{.mark} [due]{.mark} in
large part [to]{.mark} [such tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}.49
However, incorporating these intuitions and technological conjectures
would mean relying on qualitative arguments that would be far more
contentious than our conservative estimates. We therefore proceed to
assess the cost-effectiveness on the basis of our conservative models,
until superior models of the risk emerge. How Bad Would Human Extinction
Be? [[Human extinction would]{.mark} not only [end]{.mark} the [7
billion lives]{.mark} in our current generation, [but also cause the
loss of all future generations to come.]{.mark} To calculate the
humanitarian cost associated with such a catastrophe, one must therefore
include the welfare of these future generations]{.underline}. While some
have argued that future generations ought to be excluded or discounted
when considering ethical actions,50 [most of the in-depth philosophical
work around the topic has concluded that future generations should not
be given less inherent value]{.underline}.51-55 [Therefore, for our
calculations, we include future lives in our cost-effectiveness
estimate]{.underline}.\*\*\*\* [The large number of future generations
at stake mean that reducing existential risk even by a small amount may
have very large expected value. The Earth is thought to be habitable for
roughly another billion years;56 our closest relative, homo erectus,
lasted over 1.6 million years,57 and the typical mammalian species also
lasts on the order of 1 to 2 million years.58 Following Matheny,29 if we
were to assume that humanity would otherwise maintain a global
population of 10 billion for the next 1.6 million years, [human
extinction would jeopardize]{.mark} on the order of [1.6 × 10\^16 life

INTRODUCTION [The soft power of science has the potential to reshape
global diplomacy]{.underline}. (Ahmed Zewail) [[In]{.mark} [recent
years]{.mark} the role]{.underline} and place of interna- tional science
and technology (S&T) -- and [of [science diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}
(SD) in particular -- have [[attracted only limited interest]{.mark} on
the part of international affairs analysts and diplomatic practitioners
alike.]{.underline} [In part [as a result, progress in
addressing]{.mark} 'wicked'1 global [issues such as]{.mark} [climate
change]{.mark}, [diminishing biodiversity,]{.mark} [spe- cies
extinction]{.mark}, [resource scarcity]{.mark}, [environmen- tal crises,
and]{.mark} a daunting array of other [epidemic threats]{.mark} and
challenges [which]{.mark} now [imperil life on the]{.mark} [planet, has
been disappoint- ing]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The capacity to
apprehend and manage S&T-driven global issues has not grown suffi-
ciently, and [without a greater]{.mark} [effort]{.mark} by govern-
ments, international organizations and other SD actors,
[insecurity]{.mark} and underdevelopment [will
flourish]{.mark}.]{.underline} SD has been treated as a mar- ginal
practice, and the damaging consequences of doing so can be reversed only
through the provision of adequate resources and the eleva- tion of SD to
the status of an international policy, institutional and diplomatic
priority.2 UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE DIPLOMACY Learn from yesterday, live
for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is to not stop ques-
tioning. (Albert Einstein) Science, diplomacy and international policy
are often regarded as uneasy bedfellows. Science is widely perceived as
complex and impenetrable. Diplomacy is often viewed as elitist and
ineffective.3 International policy is an ambiguous, esoteric term of
which the gen- eral public is barely aware. It is little wonder,
therefore, that SD remains relatively obscure and is widely ignored.
Nevertheless, [[SD]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [important and]{.mark} is
[becoming]{.mark} [more so in an increasingly heteropolar]{.mark}4
[world order]{.mark} where the vectors of power and influence are
charac- terized more by difference than by similarity and S&T based
challenges are multiplying. At the highest level of analysis, SD can
best be understood as a diplomatic technique by which S&T knowledge is
freed from its rigid national and institutional enclosures, thereby
releasing its potential to address directly the drivers of
underdevelopment and insecurity]{.underline}.5 Unlike its constituent
elements of science and diplomacy, the expression 'science diplo- macy'
is a relatively new and unfamiliar term, and a consensus on its
definition has yet to be forged. Nina Fedoroff, the Science Advisor to
former US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, describes SD as: 'the use
of scientific collabo- rations among nations to address the common
problems facing 21st century humanity and to build constructive
international partner- ships'.6 [While the phrase science diplomacy
implies some sort of unified whole, the term is most commonly presented
as consisting of three distinct areas: informing foreign policy
objectives with scientific advice (science in diplomacy); facilitating
international science cooperation (diplomacy for science); and, using
science cooperation to improve interna- tional relations between
countries, regions or organizations (science for
diplomacy).7]{.underline} These three categories, while widely accepted
and used, tend to overlap and have some weaknesses as heuristic tools.
Many international S&T issues cannot easily be pigeon-holed: attempts to
manage climate change have involved science advice (both to governments
and the UN Secretary-General), science for diplomacy (the reports of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)) and diplomacy for
science (the meet- ings of the Conference of the Parties (COP)). Other
science-based issues, however, such as weapons inspections or fisheries
monitor- ing and surveillance, fall more convincingly under a single
heading (science for diplo- macy). For these reasons, as an umbrella
term SD must be used with some care. That said, [SD usefully combines
inter- national political agency with the scientific method of knowledge
production, and is an effective emissary of essential values such as
evidence-based learning, merit, openness and sharing.]{.underline} [As a
specialized sub-set of pub- lic diplomacy (PD),8 [science diplomacy
is]{.mark} also [a significant]{.mark} [generator of soft
power]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 [[It is this potent]{.mark}, and -- through
the increas- ing use of social and digital media -- often
technologically-enabled [form]{.mark} of attraction [which can]{.mark}
intimately [connect SD to]{.mark} [national image]{.mark}, reputation
and brand. In addition to addressing many of the planet's most urgent
challenges[, SD can]{.mark} also [contribute]{.mark}, through its use of
neutral, non- ideological language, [to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [mitigation
of international political differences]{.mark} [when regu- lar
diplomatic channels are strained]{.mark}, blocked or
non-existent]{.underline}.10 [[Even at the height of the Cold
War]{.mark}, for instance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, [Soviet and
American scien- tists maintained programmes of collaboration]{.mark} in
areas such as polar, atmospheric, health and deep sea research, plus
radioactive waste disposal]{.underline}. Similarly, Western scientists
have sustained or established contact with their Cuban, North Korean and
Iranian counterparts despite the existence of formidable political and
economic barriers. Most recently, during the conflict over Crimea and
eastern Ukraine, USandRussianscientistshavecontinuedto work closely on
Arctic issues, in crewing and managing the International Space Station,
and on negotiating the multilateral nuclear pact with Iran (2015) and
Syrian chemical weapons disarmament (2013). [[Science diplomacy
can]{.mark} also help [maintain relations at]{.mark} [times of
tensions]{.mark} between friends]{.underline}. For example, in 1985 the
government of New Zealand formally banned visits by potentially
nuclear-armed warships.11 In response, the US government, while leaving
the ANZUS treaty in place, withdrew security guarantees from its
traditional ally, downgraded its dip- lomatic relations, and excluded
New Zealand from the 'Five Eyes' intelligence sharing arrangement, which
also included the UK, Australia and Canada. It was a surprisingly nasty
row, and bilateral relations were not fully normalized until 2014.
Still, through it all, the US base in Christchurch, which pro- vides
forward supply and logistical support for American scientific research
activities in Antarctica, remained fully operational, and cooperation
between US and NZ scientists continued without interruption. Science
diplomacy is sometimes conflated with international scientific
cooperation, a mistake which has given rise to some confu- sion. The
distinction, however, is clear. While the latter is sometimes
commercially oriented and often occurs without direct state partici-
pation, the former is animated by its direct relationship to government
interests and objectives. In the case of international scien- tific
cooperation, private sector or civil society partners work together to
produce, for example, better medications, cleaner water, improved
hygiene or more disease-resistant crops. In contrast to international
science coop- eration, [SD involves state interests]{.underline}. When
these interests diverge, the outcomes may be asymmetrical, particularly
if broader nego- tiations are involved. In other cases, interests and
objectives converge. As regards outcomes beneficial to all parties, many
examples can be drawn from a swathe of international scientific
programmes and exchanges undertaken dur- ing the second half of the last
century. These have included not only the extensive array of Cold War
programmes, but also the highly successful US/G-8/ NATO-led efforts12 to
employ members of shrinking defense science establishments and to
decommission facilities used for the construction of weapons of mass
destruction after the collapse of the USSR. Contemporary negotiations on
issues such as the terms and conditions of resource access or
environmental protection in a North--South context provide another
example of success. There, however, the results have sometimes been more
one-sided. Not all countries possess the same level of SD capacity.
Large, rich, developed states, such as the US, UK and France, can engage
in a wide spectrum of activity, but smaller states, such as Switzerland
(commercial technological innovation) or New Zealand13 (agricultural
greenhouse gas emissions, bio- security and phytosanitation) have wisely
chosen to specialize. In general, less devel- oped countries are at a
disadvantage due to limitations on S&T capacity.14 Developing countries
tend to be consumers of 'technical cooperation' programmes, but when it
comes to genuine technology transfer, successful examples are harder to
come by. Also, the prospects for SD are often contextual, and thus can
vary with time and place. For exam- ple, it is difficult to imagine
initiating SD activity at this time with the Islamic State, or with the
Taliban government of Afghanistan when it was hosting al-Qaeda. Not all
science diplomacy is devoted to the achievement of pacific ends, as was
illustrated by the programmes of covert collaboration involving,
variously, Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, China and Libya on
nuclear-explosive and missile-propulsion technologies orches- trated by
Pakistani physicist Abdul Qadeer (A.Q.), Khan. Science and technology
offer keys to security and development, but are also capable of
generating insecurity, environmen- tal devastation and war.
Nevertheless, [the key assumption underlying scientific thought -- that
all events are caused, that misery is not fated, that the answers are
out there and that all problems can eventually be solved -- under- score
its positive and transformative potential.]{.underline} Key Points •
[[The world's most pressing threats]{.mark} and challenges to peace and
prosperity [are]{.mark} [rooted in science]{.mark}, driven by technology
[and immune to military solution]{.mark}. • Science diplomacy is
well-suited to address these issues, and was prominent during the Cold
War, but today has become marginal, with armed force entrenched as the
international policy instrument of choice.]{.underline} • While science
diplomacy offers a preferable way forward towards a more sustainable and
resilient future, science and technology may also give rise to
heightened insecurity and underde- velopment. HOW HAS SCIENCE DIPLOMACY
DEVELOPED HISTORICALLY? If I have seen further it is by standing on the
shoul- ders of giants. (Isaac Newton) The term 'science diplomacy'
emerged during the 1990s. [Science and diplomacy, however, may be seen
to have played a criti- cal role together in shaping perceptions and
dominant world views, and to have contrib- uted to the strength and
durability of nations and empires throughout recorded
history.]{.underline} Long before the Greco-Roman period initi- ated the
rise of the 'West', great strides in medicine, astronomy, engineering
and math- ematics were made in the ancient Near East, China and in
India. Further scientific pro- gress continued in the Mediterranean,
where mainly Greek thinkers like Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Plato,
Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes and Ptolemy made the links between
science, power and politics more explicit. From the end of the Western
Roman Empire, as the Dark Age enveloped Europe, and even more so after
the long decline and eventual fall of Byzantium, the centre of sci-
entific enquiry and experimentation shifted to the Arab/Islamic world,
and remained there through the medieval period until the late Middle
Ages.15 At about that time, the pendulum swung back to Europe. With the
Renaissance era's Scientific Revolution (Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler),
Age of Enlightenment (Newton, Pascal, Franklin, Descartes), and the
great voyages of explora- tion (Cook, Bougainville) science and tech-
nology took off and innovation soared to unprecedented heights. Science
and diplomacy became more explicitly intertwined when Britain's Royal
Society, founded in 1660, appointed Henry Oldenburg as its first foreign
secretary in 1723.16 This preceded by 78 years the appointment of
Britain's first foreign min- ister. Benjamin Franklin, who in addition
to being a founding father of the American Revolution was also a
scientist and inventor, served as the first US Ambassador to France,
1776--85. Science and technology played central roles in the European
imperial and colonial enterprises of the nineteenth cen- tury, and in
the two World Wars and the Cold War of the twentieth. During and since
those centuries, Europe, the USA, and for a half century the USSR, have
dominated the world of international S&T.17 That locus of geographic
leadership, as reflected in publi- cations and the pathfinding work of,
among many others, Darwin, Pasteur, Mendel, and, later of Einstein,
Bohr, Heisenberg and Oppenheimer,18 is gradually being eroded by
discoveries originating in other parts of the world. Although by most
measures still far behind, countries such as Japan and Korea have made
great strides, while India, China and the ASEAN members, as well as
Brazil and South Africa, are all beginning develop their capacities for
leadership and innovation in S&T.19 Even if not referred to as such
until rela- tively recently, SD per se and as practised by international
organizations, foreign ministries and science-based agencies can be
traced to the middle reaches of of the twentieth century. In 1931, for
example, a number of countries decided to launch an umbrella
organization for scientific organizations world-wide, the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), known now as the International
Council of Science.20 A second early exam- ple is the European
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)21, which was founded in 1954
and whose work continues today with recent discoveries such as the Higgs
Boson 'God Particle'. Although managed by 20 European member states,
scientists from over 600 universities and research institutes around the
world are regularly offered access to CERN's facilities. Another
signature suc- cess is the 1959 Antarctic Treaty,22 with 52 signatories
and a long record of achievement. In a few instances, SD has also been
facilitated by well-resourced individuals, such as the American
philanthropist Cyrus Eaton, who in 1957 hosted a meeting of 22
scientists23 in the village of his birth -- Pugwash, Nova Scotia,
Canada. The impe- tus for the first Pugwash Conference was the
publication in 1955 of a manifesto prepared by Bertrand Russell and
Albert Einstein, and signed by many of the leading scientists of the
day. That document invited scientists of all ideological persuasions to
address the threat to civilization posed by thermonuclear weapons. Over
time the remit of the Pugwash meetings has broadened to include other
weapons of mass destruction, and the confer- ences now attract the
attention of a variety of politicians and senior government officials.24
Today, many inter- and non-governmental institutions and agencies engage
in SD. The African Scientific Institute25 was cre- ated in 1967 to
facilitate pan-African sci- entific cooperation. In 1996, all countries
with territory and/or interests in the Arctic agreed to establish the
Arctic Council,26 a body dedicated to advancing the goals of
environmental protection and sustainable development. Other important --
even if not always well-known -- examples include: the International
Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA);27 the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA);28 the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR);29CRDF Global;30 UNESCO;31 the
International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP);32 The World Academy
of Science (TWAS);33 the Inter Academy Council (IAC);34 SciDev.Net;35
Scientists Without Borders;36 the International Network for Government
Science Advice,37 and the OECD Global Science Forum.38 Nevertheless, the
creation of multilateral scientific organizations does not necessar- ily
correlate with solving global problems. Indeed, there have been
significant setbacks, and [[during]{.mark} [the past few decades]{.mark}
the overall frequency and intensity of [science diplomacy has declined
markedly]{.mark}. After the Cold War, many of the well-established
international pro- grammes that had promoted science (and edu- cation
and culture) as part of a broader public diplomacy strategy to
positively influence foreign publics were wound down or drasti- cally
reduced by Western countries.]{.underline} Post-9/11, there has since
been some recovery, but [there remains a long way to go to compensate
for lost capacity at a time of growing demand.]{.underline} Ironically,
compared to present levels of activity, both PD and SD, at least in the
senses of science in diplomacy and science for diplomacy outlined above,
enjoyed their hey- day during Cold War. During that period, PD and SD
were more than anything else about winning hearts and minds in a
competitive ideological and territorial context, yet there was an
important distinction. While much of the mainstream PD content was
highly prop- agandized, [[SD]{.mark} [offered an alternative form of
engagement for advancing]{.mark} the [vital arms con- trol and
non-proliferation agendas.]{.mark} Science was seen as a neutral,
non-political milieu which could be used to mitigate ideological
differences. In the early 1970s, [SD played a]{.mark}n early and
[central part in the]{.mark} [restoration of US--China bilateral
relations]{.mark} [and continues to be]{.mark} used as a reliable way of
[produc]{.mark}ing con- crete [results from]{.mark} broader
[negotiations]{.mark}.]{.underline} [During the Cold War, SD played an
impor- tant role in achieving arms control and dis- armament agreements,
for example, the Non-Proliferations Treaty, the Strategic Arms
Limitation Agreements, plus conventions on biological and chemical
weapons]{.underline}. [It also produced important environmental agree-
ments,]{.underline} including the Montreal Protocol on
SubstancesthatDepletetheOzoneLayerand
theCanada--USacidraintreaty.TheLawofthe Sea Convention defined the
rights and respon- sibilities of states with respect to their use of the
world's oceans, [and established guidelines governing the environment,
the management and use of marine resources, and economic
exploitation]{.underline}. [And just after the Cold War, in 1992 at the
UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), delegates agreed
on Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the
Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological
Diversity, and the Statement of Forestry Principles]{.underline}.39 As
the difficulties with the Kyoto Protocol illustrate, the subsequent
record has been far less impres- sive40 (see Chapter 49 in this
Handbook). Disappointing and uneven progress in SD since the Cold War
notwithstanding, the efforts of some countries do stand apart. US
international science policy, for example, has in recent years included
the Presidential appointment of Science Envoys; the expan- sion of the
State Department's American Association for the Advancement of Science41
and Jefferson Fellows programmes; enlarge- ment of the network of
Science Counsellors and attaches at missions abroad; the estab- lishment
of a high level of internal science advice; and the receipt of strong
support from specialized, science-based NGOs.42 The UK,43 with its
extensive Science and Innovation Network; Switzerland,44 with Swissnex,
its public-private partnership; the EU;45 France;46 China;47 Japan;48
and; Korea,49 as well as several other countries, have also moved
forward with ambitious SD programmes. Among less developed coun- tries,
more could be done by making better use of existing diplomatic
infrastructure, for instance by establishing mission-based net- works of
international S&T representatives. Many of the principal achievements of
SD continue to be in the policy domain of arms control, disarmament and
monitoring. And several major states, including Germany, Russia and
Canada, have demonstrated sur- prisingly little interest in SD. Key
Points • Beginning in the ancient Near East, China, India, through the
Greco-Roman period, and later in the Islamic world, Europe and the
Americas, the combination of science and diplomacy has been present in
global affairs for millennia. • Science diplomacy, and the establishment
of international S&T institutions and NGOs, reached its apogee during
the Cold War, but activities have diminished in the interim. • Following
a striking record of achievement in areas such as arms control,
disarmament and environmental conservation and protection, the pace of
international progress has slowed, resources have been cut and
underperformance has become the dominant theme. WHY ARE SCIENCE,
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION IMPORTANT TO CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS? Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to
humanity and is the torch which illumi- nates the world. (Louis Pasteur)
[[The need to strengthen]{.mark} and build [SD is]{.mark} now [greater
than ever]{.mark}]{.underline} and will require a fundamen- tal
re-ordering of international policy priori- ties and resources.
[Science, technology and innovation are now central to all aspects of
our lives and are at the heart of the processes asso- ciated with
globalization]{.underline}. The abundance of information generated
through connectivity and networks is widely believed to be chang- ing
everything.50 Nevertheless, [at the level of social and political
discourse, the profound consequences associated with S&T together with
their implications for SD are accorded relatively little
attention.]{.underline} [The focus of the great powers remains on their
armed forces and 'military diplomacy' even though [there are no military
solutions to the]{.mark} 'wicked' [issues presented by climate change,
genomics, bio- technology and the rise of cyberspace]{.mark}. Today,
[long]{.mark}-term, equitable and [sustain- able development]{.mark},
rather than defence, [is]{.mark} becoming [the basis of
security]{.mark}. Anger, resent- ment and recourse to violence and
extremism often arise from exploitation, disenfranchise- ment, poverty
and exclusion]{.underline}. [Achieving secu- rity is bound up with
solving these problems, and the solutions depend on SD harnessing S&T to
the attainment of development objec- tives. In fields such as
urbanization, public health, environmental protection and remedi- ation,
agriculture, food and water, population and demographics, hygiene and
energy, the impact of science and technology, combined with good
governance, greater economic equality and social justice, are
key.]{.underline} And [good governance results, in part, from adopting
values and procedures which enable progress in science -- for example,
openness, merit and evidence-based decision making. These qualities
underpin the advance of democracy and human rights and enjoy a high
degree of universal applicability]{.underline}. [Through SD and the
sense of cooperation, collaboration and soli- darity which its practice
almost inevitably engenders, this sense of universal applicabil- ity can
be communicated to others, thereby strengthening the prospects for
tackling the 'wicked issues' identified above.]{.underline}51 S&T and
indeed SD, as noted above, are not always on the side of the angels.
They can provide tools for those who threaten peace and obstruct
justice. Troubling though groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS, as well as some
increasingly authoritarian states, may be, however, the threats they
pose remain small compared to those which SD aspires to address. Indeed,
it is mainly the militarized response presently adopted by the great
pow- ers which affords religious extremism and political violence the
opening to become major problems. [[SD]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
contrast, [[offers the prospect of removing]{.mark} [the sources]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the legit- imate [discontent which terrorists and authori-
tarian regimes]{.mark} attempt to [exploit]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As a
global enterprise, it is clear that sci- ence, technology and innovation
are directly relevant to finding solutions to some of the world's most
pressing problems.]{.underline} There exists, however, a fundamental
difficulty: within most international policy institu- tions, S&T issues
are almost invisible. With few exceptions, foreign ministries, develop-
ment agencies and indeed most multilateral organizations lack sufficient
scientific and technological expertise, the cultural pre- disposition,
and the R&D network access and links required to understand and man- age
S&T issues effectively. And although scientists increasingly work
together and share information among themselves, the scientific
community seems to cherish their independence from politics and
government. On the many occasions when diplomats or politicians gather
to discuss international pol- icy, the substance of their discussions
rarely includes S&T. When scientists get together to exchange views on
topics of shared interest, their discussions rarely touch upon matters
of diplomacy or international policy. The skill sets, activities, time
frames and cultural ori- entations of the two groups differ markedly.
Few people have managed to straddle the worlds of diplomacy and science
effectively. These worlds exist almost as two solitudes. Major hurdles
would remain even if scien- tists, politicians, diplomats, foreign
ministries and multilateral institutions were more favour- ably disposed
towards one another. When it comes to S&T, R&D and innovation, the
perspectives and interests of the public sec- tor, private sector, NGOs
and the academic community are not always aligned or com- plementary.
More often they are competitive or contradictory. For the private
sector, the over-arching goal is to maintain exclusive ownership and
control over essential S&T intellectual property (patents, trademarks
and copyrights limit transfer of technology and spread of innovation).
For the constituent ele- ments of what President Eisenhower famously
described as the Military Industrial Complex,52 the issues are budget
protection, public policy advocacy and the influence over the research
agenda (many governments are still spend- ing more on defence research
than on health research).53 Add to that the militarization of
international policy more generally,54 and the size of the problem
becomes clear. Absent a shift away from defence research towards public
and civic applications (for instance health, transportation, alternative
energy, environmental protection, conserva- tion) and a shift in
emphasis in international relations from defence to diplomacy and deve-
lopment, progress will remain impossible.55 The relationship between
S&T, on the one hand, and diplomacy and international pol- icy, on the
other, needs to be reconstructed to produce greater areas of shared
space and functional overlap. Anxiety over the unknown on the part of
the diplomats, and discomfort with politics and diplomacy on the part of
the scientific community, must be overcome and give way to a pattern of
closer association, cross-fertilization and the habits of regular
exchange and interaction. In part through the creation of connections,
networks and col- laborative commons, the two solitudes must be brought
together. As is happening else- where in the worlds of commerce and pub-
lic administration, the lateral and the supple must replace rigid
hierarchy and authoritarian interpersonal relations. By way of an
instruc- tive model, Silicon Valley style skunkworks56 merit closer
examination. [As we have seen, [science]{.mark} was once more deeply
embedded in diplomacy than is the case today. That inti- macy should be
re-instated, but on a much larger and more comprehensive scale. S&T
capacity [in diplomatic]{.mark} and multilat- eral [institutions must be
broadened]{.mark}, deep- ened and, where it does not exist, built up
from scratch. This can in part be achieved [through]{.mark} [the
injection]{.mark} [of]{.mark} more and bet- ter expert [scientific
advice]{.mark} directly [into]{.mark} the [policy development]{.mark}
and decision-making throughout the apparatus of government and the
international governance process]{.underline}. Accessible, more easily
intelligible sci- ence communications should be developed. Such
synergistic outcomes could be further encouraged through career
specialization and more purposeful use of the promotion and recruitment
processes. Perhaps the fastest way to build capacity would involve the
pro- vision of incentives, programmes of training and professional
development, plus expanded secondments and exchanges. Unnecessary
obstacles and constraints would have to be removed, and replaced by a
commitment to information sharing and critical thinking, tolerance for
dissent and an openness to the management of risk (as opposed to its
aver- sion). After all, the goal is not the creation of failsafe
systems, but to engineer a system of bureaucratic process that is safe
-- and can be learned from -- when it fails. High dividends would accrue
to the appli- cation of unorthodox thinking about how best to engineer
more productive S&T teamwork through SD. Creative use could be made of
open source problem solving, collaborative intelligence,57 web-based
policy development and global value chains. In order to leverage
international S&T cooperation, institutional linkages and
public--private partnerships -- between governments, corporations, think
tanks, universities and NGOs -- need to be bet- ter resourced and
encouraged. With enhanced planning and closer coordination, interna-
tional research institutions, science academies and intergovernmental
science networks could play a larger role in pursuing these objectives.
To that end, it would be useful to embrace dynamic new actors and forces
which would go well beyond the tapping of usual suspects. This could
include involving private philan- thropists and foundations, venture
capital firms and small and medium sized enterprises. And, as a final
element, all measures intended to improve performance in science
diplomacy and international S&T would require rigorous benchmarking,
monitoring and evaluation. Psychologist Hans Eysenck once remarked that:
'Tact and diplomacy are fine in interna- tional relations, in politics,
perhaps even in business; in science only one thing matters, and that is
the facts'. While that may be so, it would nonetheless benefit both the
scientific and diplomatic communities to recognize that they share at
least some fundamental objectives: each strives to use reason and
rational argument to establish norms and to bring order, structure and
systemic function to their otherwise disparate and disorderly realms.
That is a significant, if in large part unrecognized, commonality and
represents a point of departure for strengthening SD and thus the
prospects for more peaceful and prosperous international relations.
[What the world needs now is develop- ment and security. These two sides
of the same coin are best achieved through more science, better
technology and accelerated innovation internationally. Towards that end,
and as a response to the negative attributes of globalization --
including the tendency to socialize costs while privatizing benefits,
and the abetting of polarization at all levels -- SD can make an
indispensable contribution.]{.underline} Key Points [• A 'wicked' issue
CUTS all ways; unlike terrorism, political violence or religious
extremism, these threats and challenges are imperilling the planet. • In
an increasingly heteropolar world order, the capacity to generate,
absorb and use S&T will play a critical role in solving problems,
reducing inequality, resolving differences and advancing security and
development prospects.]{.underline} • Science and technology, on the one
hand, and diplomacy and international policy, on the other, exist in
floating worlds which rarely intersect. [• Performance could be improved
by injecting expert scientific advice into the international policy
development process, by making greater use of scientific collaboration
in pursuit of dip- lomatic objectives, and by better harnessing the
activities of foreign ministries and multilateral institutions in
support of advancing the scientific agenda.]{.underline}

#### Specifically, the aff boosts data collaboration -- that's critical to mitigate anti-biotic resistance diseases

[As concerns mount about the growing risk of drug-resistant microbes,
scientists and health professionals are scrambling]{.underline} for
solutions. **[[Data science can play a central role in the fight against
the looming global threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Since the dawn of our
species, we co-evolved with bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other
microbes that inhabit our bodies and environs. Many of these microbes
are harmless; some are symbiotic and even essential for our health.
Others are dangerous, but [thanks to miraculous advances in public
health]{.underline} and medical science over the past century, [we can
prevent and treat many common microbial infections. Yet some in the
health industry fear that may be changing. We misuse and overuse
antimicrobial drugs on a massive scale, and the bad bugs are beginning
to evolve new resistance mechanisms. As the world flattens and gets more
connected, drug-resistant pathogens can spread faster than ever.
Meanwhile, we are not developing new medicines and upgrading global
health systems fast enough to keep up with our microbial foes. The
result could be new strains of "superbugs" with devastating
impacts.]{.underline} Scientists have long warned about these risks, but
[a recent study]{.underline} by the Review on Antiomicrobial Resistance
(AMR), a UK-based initiative to provide research and policy guidance on
AMR, [lends a new urgency to the issue]{.underline}. Commissioned by the
UK Government and the Wellcome Trust, the study makes some frightening
predictions about the scale of the threat. They estimate that
[drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other
pathogens already kill around 700,000 people per year. By 2050, the
annual toll could reach 10 million. The report]{.underline} advocates
for an array of economic, political, and social interventions to tackle
the problem. It also [acknowledges the importance of data science in
supporting those interventions. In fact, the report devotes an entire
section to ideas for improving AMR surveillance in humans and
animals]{.underline}. Fortunately, many organizations are already
working to improve the availability and quality of AMR data. The World
Healthcare Organization leads one major effort. In 2015, it launched a
Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System that aims to create
standards and processes for data collection and sharing. It will
initially focus on clinical monitoring of eight high-risk bacterial
strains, but may eventually morph into a platform for sharing AMR data
of many types. Advances in bioinformatics could supercharge these
efforts. Andrew [McArthur]{.underline}, a researcher who holds the Cisco
Research Chair in Bioinformatics at McMaster University, [imagines a
future in which clinicians can instantly sequence the DNA of a
disease-causing microbe and use that data to determine the best course
of treatment for the patient. That data could then be shared with global
AMR surveillance networks and analyzed in real time.]{.underline} "We
can already sequence bacterial DNA with remarkable speed and
affordability," says McArthur. "**[[The big challenge is creating
software]{.mark} and protocols [to make all that data useful for
AMR]{.mark} surveillance." Since [overuse of antibiotics in humans is
one of the biggest AMR risk factors]{.mark}, [tracking their consumption
is]{.mark} also [critically important]{.mark}. [Almost everywhere in the
world, physicians routinely prescribe antibiotics]{.mark} when they are
not needed]{.underline}**. In some places, including many emerging
markets where the burden of infectious disease is particularly high,
antibiotics are sold as over-the-counter medicines and used with
virtually no discretion. My own work at mClinica, a Singapore-based
health data and technology firm, involves building health data
collection and patient engagement platforms in Asia's emerging markets.
Antibiotics are among the most overprescribed medicines in every country
we cover, and our data shows that sub-therapeutic dosing is common.
While this may be discouraging, we can also use this data to identify
hotspots of antibiotic misuse and plan targeted interventions.
Pharmaceutical companies, whose R&D pipelines for antibiotics have all
dried up in recent years, recognize that they must be part of the
solution. At the World Economic Forum in January 2016, [[many of the
world's top pharmaceutical]{.underline}]{.mark}, biotech, and
diagnostics companies [signed a declaration that [called for efforts to
encourage]{.mark} prudent [stewardship of currently-available therapies,
hasten]{.mark} drug [discovery, and undertake]{.mark} other [measures to
prevent]{.mark} us from [slipping into a post-antibiotic era.]{.mark}
[Achieving these goals will be all but impossible without]{.mark} smart
use of [lots of data]{.mark}. Enter the data scientists.]{.underline}
Armed with an array of technical skills, from statistical methods to
data visualization techniques, [they can help bring together complex
datasets from varying domains, find patterns in the noise, and develop
actionable strategies for fighting AMR. [Data science can
provide]{.mark} insights that help us develop [new antimicrobial
medicines]{.mark}, [prevent overuse of the ones we already have]{.mark},
[and reshape health systems]{.mark} to reduce their need in the first
place.]{.underline} It is not a silver bullet for the AMR problem, but
**[[it can turbocharge efforts to find and implement
solutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Antibiotic resistant superbugs will cause extinction -- traditional impact D doesn't apply

**Adams, 14** -- founding editor of NaturalNews.com, the internet\'s No.

(Mike, "Drug-resistant superbug infections explode across U.S.
hospitals: 500% increase foreshadows \'new plague\' caused by modern
medicine", July 17^th^,
http://www.naturalnews.com/046041_CRE_superbugs_drug-resistant_infections_modern_plague.html#)

[[Drug-resistant superbug infections have reached]{.mark} near-[epidemic
levels across U.S. hospitals, with a]{.mark}n alarming [500%
increase]{.mark} now documented in a study just published in the August
issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (the journal of the
Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America).]{.underline} (1) Lead
author of the study, Dr. Joshua Thaden, warned \"This dangerous bacteria
is finding its way into healthcare facilities nationwide\... A CRE
epidemic is fast approaching\... Even this marked increase likely
underestimates the true scope of the problem given variations in
hospital surveillance practices.\" The study also found that an
astonishing [94 percent of CRE infections were caused by healthcare
activities or hospital procedures. CRE superbugs explained CRE
(carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) is an incredibly dangerous
superbug causing nearly a fifty percent fatality rate once a patient is
infected. The World Health Organization calls it \"one of the three
greatest threats to human health,\" and [all known antibiotics are
useless in treating]{.mark} [it]{.mark}]{.underline}. CRE arose out of
the systematic abuse of antibiotics by doctors, who inadvertently
created the perfect breeding ground for deadly bacteria by using
narrowly-targeted chemical medications that lack the kind of
full-spectrum action found in nature (in herbs like garlic, for
example). Because of their highly-targeted chemical approach,
[[antibiotics encouraged bacteria to develop molecular defenses that
resulted in]{.mark} widespread [resistance to]{.mark} Big Pharma\'s
[drugs]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [situation is so bad today that the
entire pharmaceutical industry has no drug, no chemicals and no
experimental medicines which can kill CRE superbugs.]{.underline} Even
worse, [there are virtually no new antibiotics drugs in the research
pipelines, either]{.underline}. Drug [companies have discovered that
it\'s far more profitable to sell \"lifestyle management\" drugs like
statin drugs and blood pressure drugs than to sell antibiotics which
treat acute infections]{.underline}. Antibiotics simply aren\'t very
profitable because relatively few people acquire such infections.
Meanwhile, everyone can be convinced they might have high cholesterol
and therefore need to take a statin drug for life. Drug companies, in
other words, have all but abandoned the industry of treating infections.
Instead, they now primarily engage in the promotion of disease symptoms
while selling drugs that attempt to alter measurable markers of those
symptoms such as cholesterol numbers. Even though drug companies caused
the superbug pandemic that\'s now upon us, in other words, they have
deliberately abandoned humanity in defending against those superbugs
because it\'s simply not profitable to do so. The end of antibiotics has
arrived: Humanity faces a new plague caused by modern medicine The CDC
has admitted that we are now living in a \"post-antibiotics era.\" As
Infection Control Today states, \"Antibiotic resistance is no longer a
prediction for the future. It is happening right now in every region of
the world and has the potential to affect anyone.\" (2) Dr. Arjun
Srinivasan, associate director at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, went even further in a PBS interview, stating: (3) We\'ve
reached the end of antibiotics, period\... We\'re here. We\'re in the
post-antibiotic era. There are patients for whom we have no therapy, and
we are literally in a position of having a patient in a bed who has an
infection, something that five years ago even we could have treated, but
now we can\'t. Keep in mind that doctors refuse to use natural
substances to treat infections, which is why they believe no defenses
against superbugs exist. Their indoctrination into the world of
pharmaceuticals is so deeply embedded in their minds, in other words,
that they cannot even conceive of the idea that an herb, a food or
something from Mother Nature might provide the answer to superbugs. See
this Natural News article on natural antibiotics that kill superbugs.
The list includes honey. Hospitals are the perfect breeding grounds for
superbugs By their very design, hospitals are prefect breeding grounds
for superbugs for six very important reasons: 1) They put all the
infected people under one roof, creating a high density infectious
environment. 2) They allow doctors and medical staff to quickly and
easily carry and transmit infectious diseases to new patients. Previous
studies have documented how superbugs easily ride on doctors\' ties, for
example, or their mobile phones. 3) Medical staff still don\'t wash
their hands as frequently as they should. The intense time demands
placed on them discourage careful hand washing, causing many to skip
this crucial step between patient visits. 4) Hospitals almost
universally refuse to use broad-spectrum antibacterial remedies which
are not drugs. Natural substances like honey and garlic show
extraordinary multi-faceted antibacterial properties, as do certain
metals such as silver and copper. Yet because these substances are not
developed by pharmaceutical companies which dominate the field of
medical practice, they are simply ignored even though they could save
many lives. (And a doctor who prescribes \"honey\" doesn\'t sound as
amazing and all-knowing as a doctor who prescribes \"the latest,
greatest laboratory breakthrough patented chemical medication.\") 5)
Hospital practices suppress human immune function to the point of
systemic failure. Rather than boosting immune function, conventional
medical treatments such as antibiotics and chemotherapy cause immune
system failure. Hospitals lack sunlight and hospital food lacks key
immune-boosting minerals such as zinc and selenium. On top of that, most
of the drugs prescribed to patients by hospitals deplete key nutrients
required for healthy immune function, leaving patients even more
susceptible to superbug infections. 6) Hospital staff spread infectious
diseases to their private homes. After acquiring an infection at work
(at the hospital), staffers easily spread those infections to their own
family members at home. The antibiotics plague is upon us [[We
are]{.mark} right now [living through]{.mark} the [early stages of a
global plague]{.mark} caused by modern medicine. [The industry]{.mark}
that created this plague [is utterly defenseless]{.mark} against it,
leaving humanity to fight for survival in a world that\'s now far more
dangerous than the one that existed before the invention of
antibiotics]{.underline}. Antibiotics have indeed saved millions of
lives, and they forever have an important place in any medical practice.
Yet [their [careless use \-- combined with medicine\'s willful]{.mark}
and foolish [abandonment of natural antibiotics]{.mark} that work far
better \-- [has led **humanity down the path of its own
destruction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, a simple scrape of your arm
or leg might now be fatal. Infections that occur during routine medical
procedures which would have once been considered minor issues are now
deadly. And [the worst part is that the bacteria continue to evolve more
elaborate defenses against drugs while increasing their
transmissibilit]{.underline}y. Human hospitals (and entire cities) are,
by design, ideal pandemic hubs that rapidly spread disease. Like it or
not, [[humanity has created the perfect storm for a pandemic decimation
of the global population.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[International collaborations embed American
scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and students [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
vibrant, globally [collaborative [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[strengthen]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} [science, technology, and
innovation]{.underline} ([[STI]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[enterprise]{.underline}]{.mark}, while benefiting both America and the
world. Because [[such benefits have not been]{.mark} systematically
[explored]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United States, we present a
framework for organizing and enumerating them, with national-level
examples provided to illustrate scientific, economic, health, national
security, educational, societal, and diplomacy and development
advantages that can result from international [[STI
collaborations.]{.mark}]{.underline} Our objectives in presenting this
organizing structure are threefold. First, the framework [[can help
those in government, academic, and private sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}
who [[make decisions]{.mark} with national impact [better]{.mark}
understand how and what kinds of positive outcomes can
result]{.underline} from international STI cooperation. Second, [given
the distributed and decentralized nature of the U.S. STI
community,]{.underline} [[the framework can serve as a starting point
for subnational decision makers to identify benefits of STI]{.mark}
internationalization at their [operational scales]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Third, [[this]{.mark} organizing [structure]{.mark} and its examples
[can serve as a call to action for scientists to]{.mark} more clearly
[articulate to decision makers and the public how work]{.mark}ing
[in]{.mark} areas of [mutual scientific interest]{.mark} with
international colleagues can [advance U.S]{.mark}.
national]{.underline}, regional, local, or institutional
[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ As a group of individuals who have
worked across national and global science landscapes for many decades,
we were motivated to develop a framework for better understanding and
communicating the benefits of international science,1 technology, and
innovation collaboration to the United States. The global STI system has
seen dramatic change in the last several decades. For example, it is now
marked by worldwide growth in investment that is significantly reducing
U.S. global scientific market share, e.g., in expenditures, globally
mobile students, publications, patents, and technology revenue."2 3 The
construction of advanced STI infrastructure is now more often built
outside the United States by other nations or consortia. And the
geography of scientific knowledge creation and use has shown new
dynamics within and across many world regions.4 5 These changes have
kindled a dialogue in the United States about how the nation, facing
both a more worldwide distribution of STI excellence and domestic budget
constraints, can best adapt to the twenty-first-century environment of
international partnerships and globally distributed knowledge networks.6
7 8 9 10 Missing thus far from this dialogue has been a comprehensive
and deliberate exploration of how international STI collaboration
provides benefits to America at many levels.¶ We undertake such an
effort by presenting an organizing structure or framework for such
benefits that we hope achieves three objectives. First, given the
complexity of the U.S. STI enterprise, this framework can help decision
makers (including government officials at all levels, as well as
academic and private sector leaders) better understand how and what
kinds of positive national impacts can result from international STI
cooperation. We do this by providing examples within our framework of
who can benefit, in what ways, from which types of activities undertaken
by different sets of U.S. and foreign partners working in various policy
sectors. Second, the framework can serve as a starting point for
subnational decision makers to identify benefits of STI
internationalization at their operational scales. Third, this organizing
structure and its examples can serve as a call to action for scientists
to more clearly articulate the benefits of their international
collaborations to decision makers and the public.¶ The Underappreciated
Value of International Scientific Collaborations at Home¶ [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has been
slow]{.mark} among developed]{.underline} and emerging economy
[countries [to recognize how increased]{.mark} international
[collaboration can advance domestic science]{.mark}
excellence.]{.underline}11 12 13 This is likely [[due to America's
historic STI dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}, relative geographic
isolation, and critically, to a complex STI community that is large,
diverse, and decentralized. Much U.S. scientific activity is of a
bottom-up, merit-based nature, driven by scientists working in domestic
or international teams to address specific scientific challenges, rather
than being dictated by centralized, top-down mandates.¶ The nation
distributes federal support for basic scientific research from a number
of agencies and across many universities and research institutions. U.S.
higher education is a private or state, not a federal, responsibility,
so academic [[STI internationalization is characterized by strong
competition among states and institutions]{.underline},]{.mark} few
national policy levers, [[and little coordination among and within
institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}"14 Likewise, the various [[U.S.
government science agencies operate in a]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively
[[decentralized manne]{.underline}r, [undertaking international
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} [to meet their different missions [with
little policy direction]{.mark}, and with limited]{.underline} central
and [strategic coordination]{.underline}."15 16 Congress and State
Houses respond to local constituencies, yielding few broad national
advocates for international STI collaboration. Finally, because STI
results and impacts, especially those that occur in overseas
collaborations, are primarily communicated across networks of scientific
professionals, little feedback on international STI outcomes is
available in forms that are accessible to decision makers or the general
public.¶ [[Given these]{.underline}]{.mark} historical and structural
[[considerations, we]{.underline}]{.mark} chose to [[focus
on]{.underline}]{.mark} benefits derived from [[federal
government]{.underline}]{.mark} and university [[involvement in
international STI activities]{.underline}]{.mark} that advance national
objectives such as national security, economic vitality, and
diplomacy.17 We focus on Americans going abroad for STI collaboration
because this has received less attention than the impact of foreign STI
researchers and students working in America. We recognize that the
mutual benefit realized by the collaborating foreign partner(s) is
essential to this STI cooperation, but we do not address that here.¶
Crafting a Framework to Capture Benefits of International [[STI
Collaborations]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ Our framework organizes benefits
into seven sectors (i.e., scientific, economic, health, diplomacy and
development, national security, educational, and societal) with distinct
(or overlapping) policy drivers and potential policy outcomes (e.g.,
leading, accelerating, building, safeguarding, sustaining).18 Because
our primary objective is to inform those whose decisions have major
impacts at a national level, most of the examples in Table 1 focus on
how international collaboration in national programs can help the United
States. The examples illustrate an overarching benefit of international
collaboration, i.e., it [[yields outcomes that]{.mark} **[no one nation
could achieve alone]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[international
groups]{.mark} can [leverage more resources]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g.,
funding, expertise, facilities) [[to accomplish something faster
and]{.mark} can [combine diverse contributions]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., unique expertise, data, phenomena, facilities) [[to allow
specialization and reduce duplication. Such
collaborations]{.underline}]{.mark} can also [[increase collective
participation]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., comprehensive global or
regional monitoring) [[to yield more rigorous scientific synthesis and
shared responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} for future action. The
examples also document how international [[STI collaboration can
strengthen relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., [[with improved
networks and collaboration tools, and increased trust, generosity, and
cultural understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[with mutual scientific
and diplomatic benefit to all participants.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Finally, the examples sampled in Table 1 demonstrate the wide potential
scope and complexity of projects, with various types and numbers of
international partners, and diverse types of scientific activities
undertaken to yield the set of benefits described.¶ Many of the
activities cited in Table 1 are part of a rich fabric of cooperation
that produces benefits across multiple sectors. For example, in the
category of societal benefits, when U.S. engineers work with their
Japanese counterparts on building safety, they contribute to society's
resilience to earthquakes by co-designing and sharing data from
experiments in Japan on the world's largest "shake table," subjecting
large, sensor-laden reinforced concrete buildings to different types and
severity of shaking. A recent U.S.-Japan workshop on risk communication
yielded additional societal benefit by providing cross-cultural insights
into how to increase effective engagement with the public in natural
disaster preparedness and response. Universities in the earthquake-prone
nations of Japan, New Zealand, Chile, and the United States are linked
in a virtual network that generates scientific benefit by sharing data
on earthquake impacts on various kinds of buildings, as well as
educational benefits to the participating countries by engaging their
future engineers in jointly taught classes and international
collaborative frameworks. The graphic of nanoHUB users around the world
(Figure 1, see also Table 1), illustrates another international
collaboration that yields multiple types of benefits. In addition to
building a community of shared practice around nanotechnology safeguards
that spreads the costs of nanotechnology safety across many countries, a
main focus of nanoHUB is distributing nanoscience educational materials
from around the world and providing access to computing and simulation
tools in many areas of nanoscience. The United States benefits from the
resultant global knowledge networks and thriving national and
international educational and research collaborations in the
pre-competitive areas of nanoscience.¶ We highlight direct positive
impacts of STI collaboration for the wellbeing of Americans and
emphasize how [[U.S. leadership in solving global STI challenges can
benefit the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. We hope that our focus on the
benefits of leveraging increased worldwide STI excellence provides a
positive counterbalance to concerns that such global STI growth is
primarily a threat that diminishes U.S. advantage.19 We recognize that
global technology markets are fiercely competitive, that there are
ongoing threats to [[American i]{.mark}ntellectual
[p]{.mark}roperty]{.underline}, and that the nation needs to safeguard
its technology for national security. But these [[concerns need not
interfere with global engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}---[many safeguards
exist and are continually reinforced]{.underline}. [[There are numerous
examples of international cooperation in pre-competitive
research]{.mark} that are successfully integrated into domestic
technology]{.underline} programs and subsequently implemented by U.S.
business and government agencies. Many American industries have adopted
a strategy of open collaboration to stay competitive.20 Given the
breakneck speed at which STI developments emerge and expand across the
globe, we endorse the view that "[American security and
prosperity]{.underline} now [depend on maintaining active engagement
with worldwide developments in science and technology]{.underline}, and
with the global economy."21 Embedding American scientists and engineers
in robust, global STI networks can add value by placing local knowledge
in global contexts and by bringing global knowledge back for local
use.22¶ Embedding American scientists and engineers in robust, [[global
STI networks can add value by placing local knowledge in global contexts
and by bringing global knowledge back for local
use.]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ Our second objective in presenting the
information in Table 1 is [that [it serves as a starting point to help
various subnational decision makers and stakeholder groups better
understand]{.underline}]{.mark} [the potential benefits of international
STI [collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline} at the levels at which they
operate. Each state has a unique set of universities, industries,
populations, and political and economic drivers. To paraphrase the late
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, the states can be America's
"laboratories of STI globalization," where state policies allow
experimentation and local fine-tuning, delivering benefits from each
state's distinctive comparative advantages.¶ We know that the map of
innovation has been "spiky," with a few key regions (e.g., San Francisco
and Boston) dominating.23 Looking ahead, [America's challenge is to
sustain existing hubs and incubate new ones that can achieve
site-specific local-to-global [STI]{.mark} integration]{.underline};
this is especially pressing as more emerging economies devise their own
recipes for innovation's "special sauce," that is, mega-cities that
co-locate workforce, intellectual capital, investment in science, and
industrial growth.24 Finally, students, researchers, and technologists
are embedded within institutional, local, state, and national structures
that vary in how their policies on international STI engagement yield
benefit within a global context.24 25 26 Because the dynamic global STI
landscape offers American institutions, regions, and states the
potential to realize tremendous value in a global context, we encourage
these groups to freely consider or modify our framework as they develop
their international agendas.¶ As an example, one can consider in Table 1
the international science and engineering internships that yield
national economic benefit by bringing into the national workforce U.S.
students with globally relevant work skills, cultural experience, and
professional networks. Such internships can also provide great benefit
at subnational scales. For example, at a state level, public university
international engagement, private sector strengths, demography, and
geography can make certain regions of the world natural partners.
Students returning from internships in those foreign regions are more
able to work in culturally diverse teams, are more knowledgeable about
business approaches, customs, and markets of countries there, and are
plugged into border-spanning networks and partnerships in that region.
They can help meet local American needs by using the international
skills, savvy, and connections they acquired during their internships to
bolster focused international ventures of a state's private sector.¶ Our
final objective is that [our framework serves as a call to action that
[stimulates]{.mark} [internationally engaged scientists to better
document the positive impacts of their]{.mark} international
[activities]{.mark} at national, state, local, and institutional levels.
U.S. scientists]{.underline} and institutions [have strong traditions of
free scientific inquiry with international colleagues and of training
students from around the world.]{.underline} Many are part of global
scientific networks and clamor for facilitation of bottom-up
international STI collaboration. Better articulation of the positive
impacts of such collaboration is needed to inform national priorities,
policies (e.g., on visas, intellectual property, data sharing), and
funding (e.g., to globally link students, researchers, institutions,
databases, and facilities), as well as to build support for and reduce
impediments to international STI engagement at subnational levels.¶
Broad support is needed at many levels for those in the American STI
community who want to "go global." Thus [[there is an urgent need for
scientists to help decision makers]{.mark} and especially citizens
understand and value not just the scientific benefits of international
research, but also how it meets basic human and national
needs]{.underline}.28 In [[the "Public Messaging"]{.underline}]{.mark}
column in Table 1, we provide model language, as suggested by Alan Alda
at the 2014 AAAS Annual Meeting, which we believe [[is
straightforward]{.underline}]{.mark}, compelling,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} linked to the lives of the American people.29
We emphasize outcomes that [[can motivate domestic action and political
consensus and can be conducive to international
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., [national pride, economic and
social wellbeing, national security, generosity, the value of knowledge,
civics]{.underline}). With the language in that column as a guide, we
challenge our fellow scientists to describe, in ways that their
relatives, neighbors, institutional leaders, and civic leaders can
understand, how their collaborating in international science helps
America.¶ A Forward-looking, Dynamic Conversation¶ We welcome discussion
and further exploration of the benefits of international STI engagement
by decision makers at all levels and across all sectors, as well as by
scientific professional societies and scientists themselves. We see
these activities as an essential part of ongoing consideration of how to
develop a broad, comprehensive, globally framed strategy for U.S. STI,
as well as the supportive strategies at subnational levels. We hope that
our framework will contribute to the nation's narrative about how [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can "lead
through collaboration" to build and sustain broad and deep partnerships
of mutual interest]{.mark} that keep our scientists and students at the
forefront of STI, [while bolstering synergistic cooperation for the
benefit of America and the worl]{.mark}]{.underline}[d]{.mark}.30

[COVID-19 has been a systemic wake-up call, exposing vulnerabilities in
health, international cooperation, and the global economy. NATO showed
reliability and solidarity under the initiative of its civil and
military personnel amid COVID-19. Yet, one could only imagine how easier
and more efficient NATO's response would have been if the alliance did
not have to overcome tense political issues between member states and if
NATO's stronger member, the United States, had adopted a more
cooperative approach]{.underline}78 [to the virus response both
internationally and domestically]{.underline}, similarly to what had
been done for Ebola in 2014.79 [This could not only have helped the NATO
Public Diplomacy Division's outreach in pushing back against
disinformation, but also used the resources of the organization ---
constantly targeted in Trump's complaints because of its financial
burden --- to share costs and responsibilities and ultimately reassure
partners and markets.]{.underline} Instead, from a political
perspective, [the global pandemic revealed that American leadership can
no longer be taken for granted]{.underline}.80 Trump not only denied the
gravity of the virus, but also imposed travel bans without coordinating
with European allies, abdicated leadership of the G-7 which the United
States was chairing,81 withdrew from the World Health Organization,82
and refused to join international efforts to produce a vaccine.83 This
behavior will leave significant scars in the trans- Atlantic
partnership, of which NATO is the main pillar, and has pushed Europeans
to talk more concretely about increasing their own defense
capabilities.84 In spite of its respectable performance during COVID-19,
one might be tempted to argue that there is not a lot to be optimistic
about when it comes to NATO's future, given widespread fatigue with
multilateralism, political tensions within and between member states,
and a global economic recession. With GDP plummeting worldwide,
policymakers and public opinion may be reluctant to support an increase
in defense spending. Because of shrinking economies, the 2% of GDP
commitment for NATO members will, ironically, be easier to achieve, in
the very short term. However, once GDP recovers to earlier levels there
may be significant downward pressure on defense budgets throughout the
alliance. Yet, in the short to medium term it is reasonable to worry
about defense sector supply chains and how this will impact NATO's
fighting capabilities.85 It is therefore of paramount importance that
the alliance rethink the defense spending requirement, adapting it to
new technological challenges which entail not only more cost-effective
options but also a broader concept of security that encompasses
protection of supply chains, infrastructure, and humanitarian
operations. Although disruptive, COVID-19 will not be the main factor
that influences the future of NATO, which has survived sharper political
divergences between its members in the past, like on the U.S.- led Iraq
War in 2003. With major challenges ahead, including nuclear deterrence,
Chinese and Russian geopolitical ambitions, terrorism, and increased
migration flows, [it is critical for NATO allies to build a common
vision]{.underline}. As Stoltenberg recently remarked,[86 the alliance
needs to become "more global," and to do so it is paramount for the U.S.
and Europe to develop a common stance]{.underline} towards China,
increase efforts to fight terrorism, and make defense more sustainable
in the future. [While the COVID-19 crisis will hopefully be overcome
with a vaccine and NATO will benefit from this experience to increase
its resilience towards future challenges, the future of the alliance
itself depends on the trust between the allies]{.underline}. In this
regard, the outcome of the U.S. election will have a major impact on the
alliance itself and on its focus, and will determine either a relaunch
of the trans-Atlantic cooperation on strategic infrastructure,
environmental security, and deterrence against outside powers, or an
historical retrenchment occurs that leaves it up to Europeans to take
the lead in one way or another.

#### The plan sets standards and ensures interoperability.

Emerging Technologies,\"

\*EDT: emerging and disruptive technologies

[The third driver is to foster the interoperability of military
capabilities that are enabled by emerging technologies]{.underline}13
[and to incentivize transatlantic defense cooperation on EDTs to avoid
or bridge technology gaps between allies]{.underline}. This goes to the
core of NATO's mission to deter and defend against threats, but it is an
enduring challenge. [Streamlining standardization and testing,
evaluation, verification, and validation procedures remains
important]{.underline}. However, [NATO should also double down on its
efforts to ensure greater compliance with interoperability and baseline
requirements for the security of critical infrastructure]{.underline}.
Recent challenges in relation to national compliance with the 2019 NATO
requirements for security of telecommunications infrastructure are a
case in point, but there are wider and enduring challenges with hardware
and communications interoperability.14 While the plans for the new
Defence Innovation Accelerator promise to contribute to maintaining
NATO's technological edge, [it also remains to be seen whether they will
contribute sufficiently to building technology capacity among some of
the smaller and more vulnerable allies]{.underline}. As they establish
governance procedures and participation rules, allies need to mitigate
the risk that the accelerator could contribute to a two-speed, two-tier
alliance, dividing the technology haves from the technology have-nots.

[The fourth driver is a desire to lead in setting global, normative EDTs
governance]{.underline}. [The Advisory Group on Emerging and Disruptive
Technologies]{.underline}, for example, [has emphasized that **NATO "is
exceptionally well placed to be a global driver of a values-based
innovation agenda**]{.underline}."15 [Democratic values are at the core
of what defines security for transatlantic allies and the target of
adversarial subversive measures]{.underline}. Consequently, embedding
democratic values into the development, adoption, and use of EDTs by the
allies is key to NATO's mission. Thus, [innovation efforts need to be
closer linked to NATO's democracy-centered tech diplomacy]{.underline}
with like-minded global partners, some of whom could be invited to join
the Defence Innovation Accelerator.

[The fifth driver is organizational and procedural change, notably to
build "a resilient innovation pipeline for the alliance"16 and a
sustainable innovation ecosystem]{.underline}. This is a more
challenging undertaking than it may first appear. [Military
organizations have **historically innovated more coherently and
efficiently** than other public organizations.]{.underline}17 However,
in the case of EDTs, this pattern is challenged[. NATO and allied
military organizations are not driving technological progress, are not
the main agents of innovation, and depend on effective civilian-military
collaboration for their own innovation efforts]{.underline}.

#### NATO already has an operational telemedicine framework, but it needs to be applied to disease mitigation -- only that enables effective cooperation

Figure 1 Omitted

Historically, most NATO medical forces were organized to fight a
large-scale Article 5 war. This organization included the requirement
for large hospitals to be deployed, containing large numbers of
specialists and all their specialized equipment. Thus, within a theatre
of operations, most specialty consultations would have been able to be
obtained within a national medical system in-theatre. At their height,
these deployable military medical facilities rivaled and often surpassed
in capabilities civilian hospitals of similar size. But, these large and
capable hospitals are increasingly being phased out of military
inventories for several reasons. Such capabilities are expensive,
difficult to move, and "have a large footprint". They require extensive
site preparation and maintenance, burn up lots of fuel, and are
excellent targets. Further, because of their size and relative
immobility they are not normally capable of being placed close to the
combat zone, but are held more to the rear. Not directly relevant to
this issue, but of concern to our military medical planners is that even
without farforward-deployed hospitals, Medical Personnel have
historically been killed and injured at an extremely high rate during
combat operations. The number of medical personnel killed or wounded
while trying to rescue or treat casualties has historically been very
high---as only one example, a recent review of medically-related Medal
of Honor citations (the highest US decoration for valor) showed that
nearly 50 % were posthumously given. It appears obvious that if we can
reduce the deployment of high-value and scarce medical personnel,while
maintaining the quality of care we provide, this will be of great
benefit. Thus, taking into account that most wars foreseen at the
present time are "small wars", there is an international tendency to
decrease the number of specialized medical personnel in the forward
areas of the battlefield, and to rely on smaller less capable facilities
(the so-called Role 2+\-- Role 2 plus a surgical capability, with early
evacuation \[and advanced care en-route\] rather than the larger and
more capable Role 3). This trend within NATO is so marked that the most
recent edition of MC 326/2 eliminated the concept of Role 2+ in favor of
requiring surgical capabilities at all Role 2 units, both Role 2 E and
Role 2 LM. However, during the same period, [our military forces have
become smaller and more technologically intense, and the types of
deployments in which they are involved have greatly increased, to
include not only war but peacekeeping, peacemaking, and humanitarian
assistance, each of which has different medical
requirements.]{.underline} Conscription has been done away with in most
countries, leading to an increased reliance on professional and more
highly skilled soldiers. It has been proven to be neither practical nor
medically possible to provide the previous level of medical deployment
to support ever-smaller troop levels, while maintaining the flexibility
needed to respond to the varying medical needs of various missions. It
has become evident that the specialty skills needed to provide care for
combat casualties may be very different from the skill mix needed to
provide humanitarian assistance, for example following a flood. The
clinical needs of a young healthy soldier with an acute traumatic injury
are very different than those of an elderly person with chronic disease
who has no access to maintenance medicines following a natural
disaster---thus, the specialty requirements vary from mission to
mission. At the same time, there has been a demand from our politicians
and our civil populaces for maintaining a very high standard of medical
care for our deployed personnel. This latter demand is exemplified by
NATO document MC 326/2, which demands that every soldier will receive
during deployment the same level and quality of care which he or she
could receive in the home country. These [changes have produced within
the NATO military forces a more streamlined organization, an increased
role for multinational shared medical resources, and an increased effort
to use new technologies to enhance military capabilities]{.underline}.
We also see a growing expectation among our civil populations and
politicians that our military operations should be casualty-free. In the
period of the so-called "CNN effect", instant transmission of images of
combat casualties has significantly raised the expectation for
sophisticated casualty care and medical services whenever and wherever
casualties may occur. On their face, these requirements would appear to
be mutually contradictory. How can we provide homecountry quality of
care to our soldiers without deploying large hospitals and extensive
teams of specialists to a far-off battle zone? Fortunately, many of our
nations have begun development of a relatively new technology which has
been proven to be able to satisfy these apparently disparate
requirements\-\-- Telemedicine. With the ongoing NATO Transformation,
the emphasis is on a reduced medical service footprint, and
hospitalization assets may not deploy into the Area of Operations until
the theater is mature, if at all. Many of the services previously
provided by deployed medical specialists will not be physically
available early in a deployment, if at all. In order to ensure that
junior providers at Roles 1 and 2 have access to specialist advice, and
to preclude unnecessary evacuation of soldiers for "routine"
consultations, telecommunications technologies must allow for clinical
consultations to occur in the physical absence of specialist providers
from the forward areas. The delivery of specialist medical advice
utilizing telecommunications and information technologies offers the
prospect of this support in austere environments. Thus, as the
traditional mechanisms for obtaining specialty consultation in the field
have been more and more disrupted, and will no longer be viable without
frequent and often prolonged patient travel, with consequent adverse
impacts on operational capabilities, there has been a great need for a
new mechanism to ensure that only those patients actually requiring
evacuation are sent away from their units for medical purposes.
[Multinational Telemedicine is one mechanism for obtaining specialty
consultation while maintaining the desired smaller medical footprint in
theatre. Additionally, it can provide increased access to clinical
specialists who no longer need to be deployed to the conflict zone in
order to allow application of their expertise, and who can thus provide
their expertise in many locations simultaneously.]{.underline} This
concept of [telemedicine serves as the basis for developing doctrine,
training, leader development, organizations, and materiel changes
focused on the requirements for Telemedicine support to deployed and
garrison troops. It further can provide the framework to describe the
capabilities required for Telemedicine support to the NATO Reaction
Force and other NATO force deployments.]{.underline} Like any other new
concept, telemedicine means different things to different people. For
that reason, I want to share my definition with you at the outset. The
official NATO definition, found in STANAG 2517, is "The use of advanced
telecommunication technologies to exchange health information and
provide health care services across geographic, time, social and
cultural barriers." What this means is that [Telemedicine can allow us
to move expertise forward on the battlefield, rather than moving experts
to the battlefield. No longer does the expert clinician have to be
physically located next to the patient to give advice and
comfort.]{.underline} For the purposes of this paper, I use the term
"Telemedicine" in a restricted sense. I am not using it in the broadest
sense of "e-Health", with the implications of patient education,
scheduling, telesurgery, telementoring, etc. I use the term strictly to
mean "Teleconsultation", "The provision of specialty services (e.g.
dental, mental health, cardiology, dermatology, radiology, pathology) by
health care specialists to other physicians". Teleconsultation may
employ a wide range of technologies (Figure 2) from simple voice
communication through to real-time video tele-conferencing along with
the ability to handle medical specialty-specific data streams (e.g.
heart and lung sounds, electrocardiograms, video and still images)
captured with the use of specialized equipment", as defined within
STANAG 2517, but the basic concept is simple--- we are increasingly
looking to export expertise, not experts. Two examples of this are
currently deployed Telecardiology and Tele-Echography capabilities. The
broader sense of the term includes many aspects of healthcare which will
remain the responsibility of the individual nations, and which will
probably not come under the authority of a NATO Force Commander. Since
it is [Teleconsultation]{.underline} which [can potentially provide the
primary benefit within a NATO multinational medical support
operation,]{.underline} this is the Telemedicine modality to which I
have restricted my comments. Although Teleconsultation has been
practiced for many years, its use as a tool to enhance healthcare
resulted from the wide availability of personal computers, the Internet
and satellite communications. Military use of teleconsultation to
support operations, so-called deployable teleconsultation, began in the
Gulf War and has continued to be developed and refined to the present
day. Many of the concepts and practices developed to meet military
operational imperatives have now been adopted and refined to meet the
needs of peacetime healthcare around the world. Technically,
Teleconsultation may be enabled as shown in figure 2. Figure 2 Omitted
These modalities include the transfer of data in several ways: (1)
Real-time---through using dedicated two-way voice ( telephones or
radio), or by use of Real-time Video teleconferencing (VTC). (2)
Store-and-forward data -- the ability to exchange medical knowledge
asynchronously using: (a) Facsimile. (b) E-mail text only. (c) Email
with small size still image attachments. (d) Email with data and with
large size image attachments in compressed form, such as motion picture
(MPEG), digital pathology (JPEG) or digital radiography (DICOM). (e)
Dedicated Internet connectivity, such as with dedicated servers (3)
Other advanced technologies (e.g. streaming video, multimedia). While
real-time interactions imply that all parties participate simultaneously
in a teleconsultation session, store-and-forward interactions involve
sending, reviewing, and returning an opinion over a period of time.
Streaming is a method of delivery of real-time or stored data such as
audio, video, documents, still images, or other data type across
networks. With streaming, a receiving system can start displaying data
before the entire content arrives. The technological limitations of
smaller systems and the lack of availability of adequate bandwidth have
until recently limited the majority of deployable teleconsultation
systems to providing real-time voice and storeand-forward capability.
The use of real-time consultation by VTC is currently supported at Role
3 of the medical care system and above for some countries. However, the
rapid development of robust high performance and miniaturized equipment
such as handheld computers, small inexpensive high-resolution cameras,
miniature satellite telephones and image compression techniques may
enable real-time video conferencing to forward Roles of care in the
future, if it proves useful (Figure 3). Figure 3 Omitted
Teleconsultation, both peacetime and operationally deployable, is being
used to enable an ever-increasing range of clinical practices. The most
common are: (1) Tele-radiology - Primarily using store and forward
techniques. (2) Tele-dermatology - Primarily using store and forward
techniques. (3) Tele-pathology - Primarily using store and forward
techniques. (4) Tele-psychiatry - Primarily using VTC techniques. (5)
Tele-dentistry - Primarily using store and forward techniques. (6)
Tele-ophthalmology - Using a combination of VTC and store-and-forward
techniques. (7) Tele-ultrasonography - Using a combination of VTC and
store-and-forward techniques. Health Service Support Mission. [The
overall mission of military health service support has remained
unchanged for centuries. It comprises four key operational tasks and a
supporting logistic function. These are: (1) The promotion of health;
(2) The prevention of disease and injury -- now described as Force
Protection; (3) The evacuation of the sick and wounded; (4) The
diagnosis and treatment of the sick and wounded; and (5) The provision
of medical materiel and other logistic support to enable these tasks.
Teleconsultation may be employed to support each of the above missions.
Properly developed as a medical support tool, a national or NATO
teleconsultation concept can enable a "collective" health service
support environment which will augment and enhance current individual
nation support. This will be particularly vital in coalition warfare and
operational environments involving limited health care resources and/or
short warning and duration operations in which limits on logistic
support would severely constrain the medical "footprint"]{.underline}.
It is also essential in situations where different nations will provide
Role 2 and 3 support to each other, or in which various national Role 3
facilities have different levels of specialist staffing, and could
therefore benefit from the exchange of expert patient-related clinical
information. Through effective TMED utilization, various nations have
been able to develop systems for the following medical functions: (1)
Initial urgent evaluation of patients, triage decisions, and transfer
arrangements; (2) Medical/surgical follow-up; (3) Supervision and
consultation for primary care encounters where a physician is not
available; (4) Routine consultations; (5) Transmission of diagnostic
images; (6) Extended diagnostic workup or short term management of
self-limited conditions; (7) Management of chronic diseases requiring a
specialist not available locally; (8) Transmission of medical data; and
(9) Public health, preventive medicine, and patient education. To assist
nations in identifying and implementing Teleconsultation systems for use
in either a national or a NATO multinational setting, NATO has
established a Telemedicine Expert Team (TMED ET), which is open to
membership from all Allied and Partner countries. Its mission is to
facilitate national development of Teleconsultation systems, and to
assist in development of interoperability programs which will enable
these national systems to interoperate with those systems provided by
other nations. [Ideally, these will not be standalone Telemedicine or
Teleconsultation systems, but will be integrated into a NATO-wide
Medical Communications and Information System (MedCIS), such as the
MEDICS program currently being developed by Allied Command
Transformation (ACT), or its successors.]{.underline} The TMED ET is a
subordinate body to the NATO/COMEDS Medical Communications and
Information Systems (MedCIS) Panel, and if you are working in the
Telemedicine arena, I strongly would recommend that you begin to become
involved in the work of this group, which provides access in one place
to the primary TMED expertise of the Alliance. A detailed study of NATO
air, land, and maritime organizations and formations has been undertaken
by the TMED ET to identify the minimum desirable capabilities for
teleconsultation systems and technology at each Role of care (Figure 4),
and each nation should analyze these requirements as a guide to
developing its own desired deployable Teleconsultation capabilities. It
must be noted that these are minimum recommendations; if a nation wishes
to provide greater Teleconsultation capabilities at a given Role of
care, they are certainly encouraged to do so. In accordance with the
underpinning NATO principal of developing capability-based
organizations, the aim has been to identify and recommend a capability,
not a specific system or equipment. [Individual nations should attempt
to meet a specific capability requirement]{.underline} (for example, the
capability to communicate between medical support organizations using
standard internationally accepted Information Technology (IT) protocols)
[with the specific caveat that individual systems must meet NATO
interoperability standards, once those are developed.]{.underline}
Figure 4 Omitted Within the various national military health services
systems, many telemedicine initiatives have moved from the conceptual
stage to operational prototypes. These initiatives are under way at all
organizational levels within military medicine and across the continuum
of our responsibilities. I would like to share with you a few other
examples of our experience with telemedicine---the fact that I am
speaking primarily of US capabilities does not mean that the US is the
only nation with such capabilities---in fact I know that is not the
case, as several nations have very extensive TMED capabilities to
support their field forces. I am just discussing those systems which I
know the best. The US currently has connectivity from our medical
facilities in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan to our medical facilities in
Germany and also with several of our medical centers here in the U.S.
The capabilities in use include teleconsultation (using an Army-wide
Internet-based consultation system), digital X-rays, computer tomography
and ultrasound transmissions, clinical e-mail, high-resolution still
imagery, teledentistry and medical and patient information systems. In
fact, all X-Rays taken in a deployed setting are currently being
transmitted electronically and read at our Medical Center in
Germany---we no longer need to deploy diagnostic radiologists to the
front lines (and as a side benefit, we have eliminated the use of "wet
film processing", with all its logistic requirements and environmental
hazards, from the deployed setting). We are routinely making use of
teledermatology consultations, and infectious disease/internal medicine
consultations played a significant role during a recent deployment to
provide humanitarian aid in the Pakistan earthquake zone. In the future,
all of these systems will have the capability feed data into our
enterprise Electronic Health Record, called the Armed Forces Health
Longitudinal Technology Application, or AHLTA. In the military arena,
another very important component of this telemedicine capability is
medical situational awareness and command and control. This is the age
of information, and information superiority will be absolutely essential
to the military in future engagements. I predict that appropriate use of
Telemedicine and other IT technologies will be of great benefit in
ensuring that our medical and line commanders have a vastly improved
level of medical situational awareness compared to that they have had in
the past. [Other nations have their own areas of expertise in TMED, such
as the German Telemicrobiology System, and various Teleparasitology and
Telepathology programs currently in the field , not to mention both
field and shipborne teleconsultation and teleradiology
systems.]{.underline} Of note is that all nations having deployed TMED
systems have found similar benefits---what I have been discussing is not
simply a United States-centric opinion. A major goal of most NATO
nations has been the replacement of the old paper medical records, and
field medical cards, with an electronic system which would allow more
accurate, complete, and readily transmittable medical records. One
solution, being investigated by several nations for both civil and
military use, is the Battlefield Medical Information System- Tactical,
or BMIST (Figure 5). This system allows the first responder to enter
immediate treatment data at the site of treatment, and to transmit it
appropriately through several means, either by means of a transferable
electronic medium such as the EIC or wirelessly to supporting medical
organizations. Figure 5 Omitted [One item of critical importance which
cannot be overlooked is that of disease surveillance, and outbreak early
warning systems. As we develop an increased level of multinational
operations, an integrated database on infectious disease outbreaks will
be critical to force protection. No longer can national outbreak data,
often analysed months later, be considered acceptable. As we develop
more integrated NATO-wide systems, disease surveillance reporting must
be one of the earliest concepts to be integrated.]{.underline} It is
amazing to think that we have today the capability to instantly inform
the world of what the weather is like anywhere on the globe; we can
transmit stock values instantly across the world; and we share
transportation schedules which allow worldwide travel, but that [we do
not have any type of international system which can provide rapid
accurate notification of disease outbreaks, validation of a working
diagnosis, and direction of a multinational focused response to contain
an outbreak or epidemic]{.underline}. [The tools for this already exist,
yet much more must be accomplished, and telemedicine\'s capabilities
will play the key role.]{.underline} The introduction of new methods,
new systems and new ideas always gives rise to apprehension, which in
turn leads to resistance to change. We talk about "disruptive
technologies" because they disrupt the way in which we have
traditionally done our business. [As telemedicine and other similar
innovations within the military health services system become firmly
established, we recognize this adverse response as one of our major
obstacles. We simply cannot continue to do business as we have in the
past---the days of the old paperbased field medical card and the
associated medical records are numbered, and future field medical
records will accompany the soldier on some version of "electronic
dogtags".]{.underline} The new ways of doing business must be proven to
be clinically acceptable, as well as providing improvements in the care
we can offer. We must approach new conditions with new ways of doing
business, and I would point out to you that [one of the only non-science
fiction ways of accomplishing this in the NATO medical environment today
is by the effective use of multinational, cross-border, Telemedicine
systems.]{.underline} [Continuing to do business the same way we always
have is simply not an option. For operational military medicine to
change the way it functions will take investment of resources and
efforts that our people must be ready to make.]{.underline} A second
problem area that we have within the NATO military health services
system is the eagerness of some nations to fashion an information or
telemedicine system which will satisfy their particular location or
their particular special interest, without taking into account Alliance
needs. [We must all work to ensure that the systems we create will
operate across the NATO Medical Information networks once they are
fielded, that all systems can interact and that what is developed for
use in one possible scenario can be transported to any other
mission.]{.underline} To assist the nations in developing this kind of
system, the TMED ET has published STANAG 2517 on Teleconsultation. It
contains basic guidelines for development and use of teleconsultation
systems, and contains standardization tools which will ensure that
nationally-developed systems can interoperate. I strongly commend it to
you. It is very simplistic, and very useful. As this is written, Edition
2 is current, but Edition 3 has recently been submitted for national
ratification and processing. [As a change agent for the NATO
multinational military health system, telemedicine will change the way
we conduct operations, regardless of where we happen to be, and
regardless of which other nation, partner or ally, is on our
flanks]{.underline}. The twin keys to improved combat casualty care are
these forward battle area efforts and more medically intensive
evacuation capabilities. Telemedicine is critical to them both. Our
national deployed clinics and hospitals, using telemedicine, will no
longer be remote from one another. Our physicians and other health care
providers will work more closely together because distance and time will
not be factors. The primary care physicians will still be involved with
their patients while specialty care is provided via telemedicine, which
will greatly improve the continuity of care for the patient as well as
the understanding of the problem for both primary and specialty
physicians. Evacuation back to the home country simply for routine
consultations will no longer remove soldiers from the theatre for days
or weeks, thus allowing more comprehensive use to be made of our
deployed personnel as well as more rapid attention to their medical
needs. [The future of military medical care, and I would submit to you
as well that it is the future of civil medical care at least in
emergencies and disasters, is that of an integrated system, in which
data acquired by one nation can be rapidly and accurately passed to
another nation to whom the patient is being transferred.]{.underline}
Although we may have a full panoply of capabilities, from Role 1 to Role
4, including the evacuation chain, this whole system is highly unlikely
to be provided by a single nation---thus the requirement for
standardized data collection and transfer. The phenomenal capabilities
made possible because of these new tools can easily grab one\'s
imagination and attention. We must remember that these advances are
tools which enable us to accomplish things that previously were not
possible. They are tools that expand our own personal abilities, which
allow us to provide greater assistance to those who need health care.
They cannot replace clinical expertise and capability, but they can help
us make the best use of it, wherever located. These technologies, like
telemedicine, are agents of change. They carry significant implications
for how medicine will be practiced, yet medicine remains a curative art
firmly based in science. As an agent of change, telemedicine carries
significant implications for how military medicine will operate, yet the
mission responsibilities of military medicine to provide care wherever
and when ever needed remain the same. The important point here is that
telemedicine is a tool to be used to improve the delivery of health
care. It is here, and it works---I strongly recommend your consideration
of it as an enhancement to your national military healthcare system, and
as a viable aspect of your force protection program.

[When COVID-19 hit Europe, most countries in the trans-Atlantic space
turned inwards, protecting their own medical resources through bans on
the export of medical equipment35 and uncoordinated border closures36 or
travel restrictions]{.underline}, such as the one to and from the
Schengen area established by Trump.37 [These events contributed to
spread a sense of distrust toward international solidarity even among
NATO member states.]{.underline} Despite Macron's diagnosis of
[NATO]{.underline} as brain- dead, the alliance [was able to resort to
the muscle memory of its military and logistical apparatus and provide a
positive response in a moment of deep crisis. NATO officials set aside
politics to focus on operations, and drew upon the organization's
exceptional crisis management capabilities, which rely on close
coordination between civil and military personnel with both civil and
military tools]{.underline}.38 On March 25, Stoltenberg activated the
Crisis Management Mechanism to study the progression of the pandemic and
plan a comprehensive response ranging from coordination transportation
of medical equipment to dispatching NATO military doctors to countries
in need to assist in the construction of field hospitals.39 Following
these preliminary efforts, in their first virtual meeting on April 2,
[NATO foreign ministers authorized NATO's strategic planning military
headquarters --- Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in
Mons, Belgium --- to create a dedicated COVID-19 Task
Force,]{.underline} headed by Lieutenant General Olivier Rittimann,40
[to operationalize these plans. . The alliance]{.underline} had no prior
experience with a global pandemic and had never faced a crisis that hit
every member state with the same threat at the same time. Yet its
[crisis management and disaster relief record]{.underline} --- from the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission to Afghanistan41
to disaster relief support to support the United States after Hurricane
Katrina42 to the response to the 2010 tsunami in Indonesia43 --- [was
extremely helpful in quickly adapting NATO's logistical apparatus to
non- military purposes.]{.underline} In this regard, the COVID-19 Task
Force heavily relied on the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination
Center.44 After seeing their personnel previously reduced to just three
staff members, the EADRCC was supplemented by units from across NATO and
other international organizations to reach a staff of 30.45 As of July
2020,46 the EADRCC has functioned as clearinghouse to coordinate
assistance requests and offers from seven allied and nine partner
nations, as well as from the United Nations Office for the Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). Examples include Germany sending
ventilators to Spain; Spain sending facemasks to Iran; the United
Kingdom transporting a field hospital for the World Food Program (WFP)
from Britain to Accra, Ghana; Italy receiving help from Albania, the
United States,47 and Turkey (among others); and Norway donating a field
hospital to North Macedonia. Beyond efficiently pairing supply and
demand for medical aid, [NATO's added value in the response to this
crisis also relies on the ability to offer efficient logistical
solutions at a shared transportation cost.]{.underline} To coordinate
logistics, SHAPE relied on NATO's Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA),
which since 1958 has managed procurement for airfield logistics and
transport of weapon systems and medical services across the world.48
During the COVID-19 crisis, the NSPA organized rapid cost-effective
deliveries of protective medical equipment, like in the case of
Luxembourg that received field hospital tents in less than 24 hours,49
through NATO's airlift capabilities. In this respect and in connection
with NSPA, [NATO's initiatives such as the Strategic Airlift
International Solution (SALIS) and the Strategic Airlift Capability
(SAC), established in 2003 and 2009 respectively,50 have been vital to
the prompt delivery of medical aid, given their roots in a durable and
reliable link between the alliance and the private sector.]{.underline}
SALIS consists of a consortium of nine NATO allies (Belgium, the Czech
Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, and
Slovenia). It has assured access to up to five special mission- ready
aircrafts from the German company Antonov Logistics --- two of which,
the AN-124-100, can carry up to 120 tons of cargo. Building on
experience with Antonov aircrafts to transport aid to Pakistan following
the 2005 earthquake and in the airlifting of the African Union
peacekeepers in and out of Darfur, countries like Poland, Czech
Republic, and Slovakia used SALIS to import urgent medical equipment
like facemasks, surgical gloves and protective suits during the COVID-19
pandemic.51 Similar to SALIS, the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC)
initiative allows partners to share flying hours and costs. SAC involves
10 NATO members (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and the United States) and two close
NATO partners (Finland and Sweden). SAC consists in joint ownership of
three C-17 Globemaster heavy cargo aircrafts operated by the Heavy
Airlift Wing (HAW) based in Hungary and staffed with personnel from all
participating nations. Established in 2009, SAC has supported several
operations, including the Unified Protector in Libya and humanitarian
relief in Haiti. During the COVID-19 response, the SAC initiative
allowed Romania52 and Bulgaria53 to quickly receive several tons of
medical supplies. [Cooperation with multilateral organizations such as
the European Union, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United
Nations also facilitated the achievement of NATO
deliverables]{.underline}. [NATO's Rapid Air Mobility initiative, for
instance, in cooperation with EUROCONTROL (intergovernmental agency for
coordination of air traffic), allowed simplified procedures for military
relief flights.]{.underline} Conversely, [the EU also resorted to NATO
logistics apparatus to deliver aid between and even beyond EU
countries.]{.underline} Romania, for example, sent a 17-strong medical
team to Italy through the European Civil Protection Mechanism in
coordination with NATO's EADRCC.54 [In addition to it, NATO and EU
cooperated through sharing information in regular briefing on joint
procurement between the EADRCC and the EU's Emergency Response
Coordination Centre (ERCC) and between the NATO COVID-19 Task Force and
the one created by the EU's European External Action Service
(EEAS).]{.underline}55 [Another area of cooperation was medical
resilience, where NATO and EU could count on the experience of two
initiatives inaugurated in 2018, the Multinational Medical Coordination
Center (MMCC) and European Medical Command (EMC), with the goal of
increasing readiness in medical capabilities through cooperation between
military medical services and civilian health system of member
states.56]{.underline}

[Global deaths from malaria and]{.underline} tuberculosis
([TB]{.underline}) [declined]{.underline} 48 percent and 47 percent,
respectively, over this period. Maternal mortality dropped 43 percent.
Deaths for children under five have halved, which means nineteen
thousand fewer of these children die each day[. More than ten million
people with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa are on lifesaving
antiretroviral treatment, up from just one hundred thousand in
2003.]{.underline}¶ [U.S. leadership and investment helped spur this
progress]{.underline}. The U.S. President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR) program, created in 2003, remains the largest financial
commitment of any country to global health or the treatment of a
specific disease. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is among the biggest funders of the
global vaccine alliance]{.mark} GAVI and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis, and Malaria, [which immunize and treat millions]{.mark} of
people each year]{.underline}.\* The United States also provides the
most aid to fight neglected tropical diseases and poor maternal and
child health. [[These investments have been consistently
bipartisan]{.mark}, and their returns are]{.underline}, quite literally,
[measured in reduced human suffering and longer lives around the
globe]{.underline}.¶ [[Can this age of miracles endure]{.underline}?
**[Yes, but only with continued U.S. leadership and
investment]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[amid some challenging
headwinds.]{.underline}** [[The next president should build on the
recent efforts to harness]{.mark} the positive [synergies between global

Headwinds¶ [Global health needs are changing.]{.underline} First,
[population growth, warming temperatures, urbanization, and easier trade
and travel are remaking the world in ways conducive to the spread of
infectious disease]{.underline}. The recent Ebola and Zika virus
outbreaks have exacted a terrible toll, but [a more lethal infectious
disease could do far worse. The [coordination]{.mark}]{.underline} and
funding [[of]{.mark} international [pandemic preparedness and response
**continues to be ad hoc, which**]{.mark} **greatly [undermines their
effectiveness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Time and [[consistent support is
needed to develop competent national health systems and disease
surveillance, effective diagnostics and medical countermeasures, and
outbreak response and communication plans]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ Second,
rates of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other noncommunicable
diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries are accelerating in
working-age populations, rapidly outpacing declines in communicable
diseases. In 2013, NCDs killed nearly eight million people before their
sixtieth birthdays in these developing countries. Health systems in
lower-income countries are ill-prepared for the scale and speed of this
shift to chronic diseases. Most of these health systems are still built
for acute care rather than chronic or primary care. Health spending in
developing nations, though increasing, remains low. This is particularly
true in low-income countries, where foreign aid accounts for 40 percent
of health expenditures and where governments spend, on average, three
cents per capita on health for every dollar spent by high-income
countries. Medicines are still purchased out of pocket in many countries
and are often unaffordable for the poor.¶ Third, a [[combination of
overuse of existing antibiotics and underinvestment in new ones has left
the world on a precipice of a postantibiotic era]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In 2015, 580,000 people worldwide developed multidrug-resistant TB.
[Routine medical procedures]{.underline}, such as hip replacements and
kidney dialysis, [become dangerous without effective
antibiotics]{.underline}. Even childbirth becomes more risky.
[The]{.underline} U.S. [C]{.underline}enters for [D]{.underline}isease
[C]{.underline}ontrol and Prevention [reports that more than two million
people in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [become infected
with antibiotic-resistant bacteria every year]{.underline}, and more
than twenty-three thousand die as a result. [[The global consequences of
antimicrobial resistance are less clear]{.underline},]{.mark} but
estimates are seven hundred thousand deaths annually, including two
hundred thousand from multidrug-resistant TB.¶ [[The aid environment is
not favorable for addressing these]{.mark}]{.underline} new
[[challenges]{.underline}. **[Donor support for global health has
flatlined]{.underline}**]{.mark} in recent years [and may]{.underline}
be poised to [decline]{.underline}. Governments and foundations have
stepped up admirably in recent fundraising for the Global Fund, but much
more will be needed to meet the global reduction targets for HIV, TB,
and malaria. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom, [and]{.underline} Bill and

the current level of global health aid]{.underline} (Figure 1), but [the

and vote to exit the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion. [[The

### Pandemics Impact

#### Pandemics cause extinction

**Bar-Yam, 16** -- physicist and complex systems scientist, Founding
President of the New England Complex Systems Institute, Ph.D., S.B.,
physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Yaneer Bar-Yam,
"Transition to extinction: Pandemics in a connected world," NECSI,
7-3-2016, <http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/transition>)//RCU

\[ FIGURE 1 OMITTED \] The video (Figure 1) shows a simple model of
hosts and pathogens we have used to study evolutionary dynamics. In the
animation, the green are hosts and red are pathogens. [As pathogens
infect hosts, they spread across the system]{.underline}. If you look
closely, you will see that the red changes tint from time to
time --- that is the natural mutation of pathogens to become more or
less aggressive. Watch as one of the more aggressive---brighter
red --- strains rapidly expands. [After a time it goes extinct leaving a
black region]{.underline}. Why does it go extinct? The answer is that it
spreads so rapidly that it kills the hosts around it. [Without new hosts
to infect it then dies out itself]{.underline}. That the rapidly
spreading pathogens die out has important implications for evolutionary
research which we have talked about elsewhere \[1--7\]. In the research
I want to discuss here, [what we were interested in is the effect of
adding long range transportation]{.underline} \[8\]. [This includes
natural means of dispersal as well as unintentional
dispersal]{.underline} by humans, [like adding airplane
routes]{.underline}, which is being done by real world airlines (Figure
2). \[ FIGURE 2 OMITTED \] [When we introduce long range
transportation]{.underline} into the model, [the success of more
[aggressive strains]{.mark} changes. They can [use]{.mark} the [long
range transportation to find new hosts and escape local
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Figure 3 shows that the more
transportation routes introduced into the model, the more higher
aggressive pathogens are able to survive and spread. \[ FIGURE 3 OMITTED
[\]]{.mark} [As we add more long range transportation[,]{.mark} there is
a critical point at which [pathogens become so aggressive that the
entire host population dies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The pathogens die at
the same time, but that is not exactly a consolation to the hosts. [[We
call this the phase transition to extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Figure 4). With increasing levels of global transportation, [[human
civilization may be approaching such a]{.mark} critical
[threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}. Figure 4: The probability of survival
makes a sharp transition (red line) from one to zero as we add more long
range transportaion (horizontal axis). The right line (black) holds for
different model parameters, so we need to study at what point the
transition will take place for our world. In the paper we wrote in 2006
about the dangers of global transportation for pathogen evolution and
pandemics \[8\], we mentioned the risk from Ebola. Ebola is a horrendous
disease that was present only in isolated villages in Africa. It was far
away from the rest of the world only because of that isolation. Since
Africa was developing, it was only a matter of time before it reached
population centers and airports. While the model is about evolution, it
is really about which pathogens will be found in a system that is highly
connected, and Ebola can spread in a highly connected world. The
traditional approach to public health uses historical evidence analyzed
statistically to assess the potential impacts of a disease. As a result,
many were surprised by the spread of Ebola through West Africa in 2014.
[[**As** the **connectivity** of the world **increases, past experience
is not a good guide to future events**.]{.underline} [A key point about
the]{.underline}]{.mark} phase [[transition to extinction is its
**suddenness**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Even a system that seems stable,
can be destabilized by a few more long-range connections, and
connectivity is continuing to increase]{.underline}. So how close are we
to the tipping point? We don't know but it would be good to find out
before it happens. While Ebola ravaged three countries in West Africa,
it only resulted in a handful of cases outside that region. One possible
reason is that many of the airlines that fly to west Africa stopped or
reduced flights during the epidemic \[9\]. In the absence of a clear
connection, public health authorities who downplayed the dangers of the
epidemic spreading to the West might seem to be vindicated. As with the
choice of airlines to stop flying to west Africa, our analysis didn't
take into consideration how people respond to epidemics. It does tell us
what the outcome will be unless we respond fast enough and well enough
to stop the spread of future diseases, which may not be the same as the
ones we saw in the past. As the world becomes more connected, the
dangers increase. Are people in western countries safe because of higher
quality health systems? [Countries like the U.S. have highly skewed
networks of social interactions]{.underline} with some very highly
connected individuals that can be "superspreaders." [The chances of such
an individual becoming infected may be low but []{.mark}events like [a
mass outbreak pose a much greater risk]{.mark} if they do
happen]{.underline}. If a sick food service worker in an airport infects
100 passengers, or a contagion event happens in mass transportation, an
outbreak could very well prove unstoppable. Watch this mock video of a
pathogen spreading globally through land and air transportation. Long
range transportation will continue to pose a threat of pandemic if its
impacts cannot be contained.

### Bioterror Impact

#### Terror groups are trying to get them.

SECURITY THREATS

[Recent advances in synthetic biology]{.underline}, a technology that
can be used to artificially create organisms in labs, **[carry the
foreboding potential to develop biological weapons.]{.underline}**
Moreover, [the emergence of the DIY community and the open-source nature
of this movement have sparked concerns that terrorists could easily
acquire the information needed to weaponize biotechnology]{.underline},
although none of these DIY groups have exhibited any nefarious
intentions. [Nefarious actors who previously acquired pathogens from a
lab or from nature with the intention of developing a bioweapon can now
either order DNA fragments online and assemble them to create dangerous
pathogens]{.underline} or synthesize lethal pathogens from scratch using
genomic information available online. Moreover, such actors can leverage
vulnerabilities in the cyber defenses of labs and private companies to
gain access to sensitive information that is not publicly available
online.

To better understand the security threats emerging from recent
developments in biotechnology, it is worthwhile to return to the
aforementioned hypothetical Ebola scenario. Imagine for a moment that
the researchers involved, in collaboration with an editor at an esteemed
journal, decided that they would publish a redacted version of the
methods and the results section of their research due to security
concerns. A month after the paper was published, the lab noticed unusual
activity on their servers. The lab immediately reported the incident to
the university's information technology department. The department
contacted local law enforcement officials, and together they traced the
hack to a suspected terrorist organization. The group was trying to gain
access to the methodology that led to the accidental creation of a more
virulent Ebola strain so as to launch a deliberate biological attack.
Law enforcement put DNA synthesis companies on high alert for any orders
that closely aligned with research on the Ebola virus or other high-risk
pathogens. Thankfully, a company was able to flag an order and law
enforcement was able to cooperate with local officials to shut down the
unauthorized lab before it began creating and releasing harmful
products.

In reality, [individuals have at times tried to acquire deadly pathogens
and other sensitive biological information]{.underline}. For example,
[two Canadians were arrested in the city of Buffalo]{.underline}, New
York in 1984 [after they were suspected of illegally acquiring and
smuggling strains of botulism]{.underline} and tetanus to Canada. [The
Japanese cult]{.underline} Aum Shinrikyo [made]{.underline} unsuccessful
[attempts]{.underline} in 1995 [to acquire]{.underline} strains of
[Ebola]{.underline} from Central Africa to develop the group's
biological weapons program. More recently, [two Chinese hackers were
indicted in the United States for seeking to obtain intellectual
property related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines.]{.underline}
Similar incidents were reported in Spain; allegedly Chinese hackers were
trying to steal data from Spanish labs conducting vaccine research.

In addition to strategically [embedding members into research
organizations to acquire these deadly pathogens, some terrorist
organizations also have sought to rely on lab insiders to either develop
biological weapons or grant access to organisms or sensitive
information]{.underline}. For example[, a Malaysian scientist tried to
develop anthrax weapons for]{.underline} Osama [bin Laden]{.underline},
the founder of al-Qaeda.

While most countries have national guidelines for handling safety and
security threats, the examples described above highlight the global
implications of such threats. [It is therefore important to evaluate
global best practices, treaties, and conventions that deal with such
risks and devise strategies to update these safeguards to govern
dual-use applications of emerging biotechnologies]{.underline}.

Introduction [[Science diplomacy]{.mark} is the use of scientific
collaborations among nations to address common problems facing 21st
century humanity and in building constructive international partnerships
(]{.underline}Fedoroff, 2009). [This [applies]{.mark} also [in]{.mark}
the field of [health regulations]{.mark} and regulatory
science.]{.underline} Good Health and Well Being is Goal 3 of the
Sustainable Development Goals. [[Its aim is to achieve]{.mark}
[universal health coverage and provide]{.mark} [access]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} safe and affordable [medicines and vaccines]{.mark} to
all]{.underline} (United Nations, 2015a). [Supporting research and
development for vaccines is an essential part of this process as
well]{.underline} (United Nations, 2015b). Regulatory systems play a key
role in assuring quality, safety and efficacy of medical products. An
effective regulatory system is an essential component of the health
system, and it contributes to desired public health outcomes and
innovation. National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are government
entities responsible for ensuring safety, efficacy and quality of
medicines; and they play a vital role in the health- care system by
providing regulatory oversight of all medical products. Since many
decades, a growing number of networks and initiatives have been
developed to strengthen medicines regulatory systems. The region of the
Americas has developed an initiative to strengthen health regulatory
systems through an evaluation- and- certification process that allows
appointment of Regional Reference Regulatory Authorities of medicines
and biological products (NRArs). NRArs work jointly through cooperation
mechanism on capacity- building in other countries of the region;
allowing them to strengthen their regulatory systems and act as a group
with consensual positions in different international forums (Ojeda,
2016). Strengthening Regulatory Systems in the Americas National
Regulatory Authorities play a vital role in the health- care system by
providing regulatory oversight of all medical products such as
medicines, vaccines, blood products, traditional or herbal medicines and
medical devices. They perform their mandate based on a legal framework
along with a set of recommended regulatory functions that span the
medical product life- cycle, including clinical trial oversight,
marketing authorization and registration, licensing and inspection of
premises, market surveillance and enforcement activities when required.
[The [America]{.mark}s [is a region of deep asymmetries]{.mark}
[where]{.mark} [inequalities]{.mark} [to access]{.mark} [have
persisted]{.mark} in poor and vulnerable populations, [and there still
exists]{.mark} [fragmentation]{.mark} and segmentation [in the
system]{.mark}, which should guarantee access to health
technologies]{.underline}. In the case of national regulatory
authorities, large difference in structure and autonomy of the
regulatory bodies, financing systems and their regulatory capacity are
abridged to ensure effective compliance with their functions (Ojeda,
2016). In the last two decades, a group of global and regional
initiatives have been developed for strengthening NRAs' capacities,
based on the population's right to access to quality medicines
commensurate with science and technology advances. One of the
initiatives is the evaluation and certification of the Regional
Reference Regulatory Authorities' process in the Americas. [[In
2006]{.mark}, a group of [five regulatory authorities]{.mark} [from
Latin America]{.mark} (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba and Mexico) had
[met]{.mark} in Oaxaca, Mexico, [with a]{.mark} [proposal to build a
common agenda to consolidate]{.mark} mutual [trust]{.mark} in regulatory
matters [for]{.mark} the economic well-being and [public health]{.mark}
of inhabitants of the region]{.underline}.1 [[That led to]{.mark} the
proposal of an NRA evaluation process as the [regional mechanism of
certification of drugs]{.mark} regulatory authorities, focusing on
evaluation of their performance in fulfillment of their functions,
[and]{.mark} also for serving as the [capacity- building]{.mark}
mechanism in the regulation of medicinal products' field]{.underline}.
The evaluation process concludes with the rating of the authority
assessed, according to its results in one of the four levels. A Regional
Reference Authority reaches level IV---this describes an authority that
is competent and efficient in fulfilling functions recommended by
PAHO/WHO to ensure efficacy, safety and quality of medicines. The Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) acts as the facilitator of the
process leading to evaluation and giving certification to the Regional
Reference Regulatory Authority for medicinal products and biologists to
those very NRAs which reach level IV. To- date, 8 National Regulatory
Authorities have been recognized by PAHO/WHO as National Regulatory
Authorities of Regional Reference--- Argentina's National Administration
of Drugs, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT);Brazil's National Health
Surveillance Agency (ANVISA);the Center for State Control of Drug and
Medical Devices of Cuba (CECMED);the National Institute of Food and Drug
Monitory of Colombia (INVIMA);the Federal Commission for Protection
against Sanitary Risks of the United Mexican States (COFEPRlS);Canada's
Health Canada, US Food and Drug Administration and Chile's Institute of
Public Health (P AHOc, 2018) A significant milestone was the discussion
of this initiative at the 50th P AHO Directing Council meeting, in
September 2010, and the approval of Resolution CD50. R9: "Strengthening
National Regulatory Authorities for Medicines and Biologicals". In this
resolution, P AHO Member States were urged to strengthen and evaluate
their regulatory capabilities with respect to the functions
characteristic of the regulatory and oversight agency for medicines and
biologicals through examination of the performance of their essential
functions; to use the results of the qualification activity and the
designation of the regulatory authorities of regional reference to
strengthen their performance in terms of steering role of the health
authority; and to support national regulatory authorities so that they
can benefit from the processes and information from the national
regulatory authorities of reference (PAHO, 2010) The regional reference
authorities work as a network; which together with PAHO are committed to
support efforts to strengthen other regulatory agencies, based on their
own experience by promoting exchange and cooperation among countries and
by actively participating in regulatory harmonization efforts within the
framework of the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization
(P ANDRH). Considering this, they develop a wide range of cooperation
activities for capacity -building in other NRAs. From 2010 till- date,
more than 30 courses have been carried out in different countries of the
region along with bilateral consultancies and internships in the ARNr2.
They also lead different regional projects on pharmaceutical regulation
approved by PANDRH (PAHO, 2016). These reference authorities are also
working in building trust among themselves while sharing information on
their best practices and in exchanging technical information to achieve
mutual recognition of their regulatory decisions to speed-up drugs'
approval processes allowing their better access. [Regulatory
[collaboration]{.mark} through inter-agency work and data-sharing [help
to strengthen]{.mark} [the]{.mark} regulatory [capacity of all partners
by promoting sustainable exchange of]{.mark} technical
[knowledg]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}. Some bilateral agreements have
been established to highlight inspection of final report exchange,
considering large number of pharmaceutical companies, and the cost of in
situ inspections, to establish mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing
Practices Compliance. Regional Reference Authorities in Multilateral
Forums In 2011, a group of ARNr was created---this group carries out two
annual meetings; in the first semester it reviews the results of the
work of the previous year and defines strategies and working plan for
the new year3 and in the second semester, a meeting with PAHO is held to
evaluate progress of their joint work to strengthen regulatory systems
in the region. The following section highlights the regional level
initiatives: The Regional Working Group on Medical Device Regulation:
Established during the "1st Regional Meeting of the Regulatory
Authorities for the Strengthening of Regulatory Capacity on Medical
Devices in the Americas Region" held in La Habana, Cuba. It currently
comprises16 NRAs; countries joined the Working Group voluntarily with
the commitment to advance towards strengthening the Regulatory Capacity
on Medical Devices through Regional exchange of information, joint
projects, and training strategies towards the harmonization of
regulatory requirements. This group is led by CECMED, the Cuban NRA
(PAHO, 2018b): Specialist from regional reference authorities are a
collection of experts in NRA acting as PAHO advisory experts of the
system for evaluation of national reference regulatory authorities; 26
ARNs have so far been evaluated. Center for the State Control of Drugs
and Medical Devices (CECMED) is working with PAHO and the Ministry of
Health to strengthen the Nicaraguan National Regulatory Authority of
Drugs as part of the technology transfer project for production of
biologicals and immuno- biologicals between the governments of Russia
and Nicaragua (PAHO,2018a) The regional reference NRA group is
coordinated by one of its members for a period of two years. In the
meetings different international forums and meetings that take place
during the year, most current topics and initiatives, criteria, concerns
and position are discussed. After the discussion process they try to
adopt joint position responding to regional concerns. These actions are
of particular importance during the international consultation process
on the strengthening of the regulatory systems developed by WHO since
October 2014 aimed at reaching a Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for
evaluation of national regulatory system of medical products. The World
Health Organization began assessing regulatory systems in 1997 using a
set of indicators, designed to evaluate regulatory programmes for
vaccines. Since that time, a number of tools and revisions were
introduced. In 2014, work started on the development of a unified tool
for evaluation of medicines and vaccines regulatory programmes following
a mapping of existing tools in use within and external to WHO (WHO,
2018). For this, tools already applied by the organization, the tool
used by the Pan American Health Organization for the evaluation and
designation of Regional Reference Authorities, the standards established
by the ISO standards, among others, were taken into account. The final
objective was to have only one tool that replaces all tools previously
used by WHO, representing the first truly 'global' tool for benchmarking
regulatory systems. Recently, WHO has published a new document (Revision
VI) that has taken into consideration inputs received from two
international consultations with Member States in 2015, a public
consultation in early 2018 and a series of meetings involving experts
from regulatory authorities from different parts of the world. The work
of the Americas region, (represented by P AHO), was significant,
particularly as the region that already had a tool and an evaluation
process with 8 years of experience. This last document contains a large
part of recommendations and criteria, made by the NRAs and has
incorporated indicators and measures criteria of the evaluation tool
used in the process developed in the Americas. The document would be
used to evaluate and publicly designate WHO-listed authorities (WLAs),
which have objectively been documented to perform at high maturity
levels in 2019. Conclusion The process of evaluation and certification
of Regional Reference National Regulatory Authorities in the Americas
completes 9 years of establishment in 2019. During these years, the
initiative has succeeded in building capacities in the drug regulatory
agency in the region strengthening their medicines regulatory systems,.
An example is the process of strengthening the Nicaraguan National Drug
Regulatory Authority as part of the technology transfer project for the
production of biological and inmuno-biologicals, implemented by the
governments of Russia and Nicaragua and the process of development of
regional ecosystems, to evaluate the regulatory capacity on medical
devices. [The [joint work]{.mark} of the regional reference authorities
[can be an example of]{.mark} the real [implementation of]{.mark}
[science diplomacy based on]{.mark} the international
[collaboration]{.mark} of the authorities involved; showing their
engagement in value- based international partnerships. [This]{.mark}
alliance [adds values to national]{.mark} [medicines programmes]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} other Ministries of Health [missions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The development of [joint capacity]{.mark}-[building]{.mark} programmes
[enables]{.mark} [taking]{.mark} [advantage of the strengths of each
member]{.mark} of the group of authorities [for the benefit]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} their regional [counterparts]{.mark} [while sharing
responsibilities and expenditures]{.mark} with maximized results [to

Concurrently, [we face threats to our future security posed by
[**growing civil strife**, **famine**, and **refugee** and **migration

comprehensive National Security Strategy combining all elements of

Strategy**]{.underline}.

[An [American Food Security]{.mark} Strategy [is]{.mark} an
**[imperative]{.mark} factor** in **[reducing]{.mark} the [multiple
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} impacting our National wellbeing.
[**Recent history** has shown that [**reliable food supplies** and
**stable prices produce more stable** and **secure countries**]{.mark}.
Conversely, **[food insecurity]{.mark}**, particularly in poorer
countries, can [lead to]{.mark} **instability**, **unrest**, and
**[violence]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Food insecurity]{.mark} **drives mass migration around the
world**]{.underline} from the Middle East, to Africa, to Southeast Asia,
[**destabilizing neighboring populations**, **generating conflicts**,
and **[threatening]{.mark} our own [security]{.mark}** by disrupting our
economic, military, and diplomatic relationships. Food system shocks
from extreme food-price volatility can be **correlated with protests**
and **riots**. Food price related protests **toppled governments** in
Haiti and Madagascar]{.underline} in 2007 and 2008. In 2010 and in 2011,
[food prices]{.underline} and grievances related to food policy [were
one of the **major drivers** of the Arab Spring uprisings.
**Repeatedly**, history has taught us that a **[strong
ag]{.mark}ricultural sector** [is a]{.mark}n **unquestionable
[requirement]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} inclusive and
sustainable growth, broad-based development progress, and [**[long-term
stability]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The impact can be **remarkable** and **far reaching**. Rising income,
in addition to **reducing**]{.underline} the opportunities for an
upsurge in [**extremism**, leads to changes in diet, **producing
demand** for more diverse and nutritious foods
**provided**]{.underline}, in many cases, [**from American farmers** and
**ranchers**. Emerging markets currently purchase **20 percent of U.S.
agriculture exports** and that figure is **expected to grow** as
populations boom]{.underline}.

Moving early to ensure stability in strategically significant regions
requires long term planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To
combat current threats and work to prevent future ones, our national
leadership must employ the entire spectrum of our power including
diplomatic, economic, and cultural elements. [The **best means to
prevent future chaos** and the **resulting instability** is positive
engagement **addressing the causes of instability before it
occurs**]{.underline}.

[This is **not rocket science**. We know where the instability is **most
likely to occur**. The world population will grow by 2.5 billion people
by 2050]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [this massive population boom is
projected to occur **primarily in the most fragile** and **food insecure
countries**]{.underline}. This alarming math is not just about total
numbers. Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age
groups most vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million
people in Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number
expected to double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed
in Africa are young people.

[Too often these situations **[deteriorate into shooting wars]{.mark}**
requiring the deployment of our military forces]{.underline}. We should
be continually mindful that the price we pay for committing military
forces is measured in our most precious national resource, the blood of
those who serve. [For]{.underline} those who live in **[rural
America]{.underline}**, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of
those who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and
non-urban communities that make up only 16% of our population.

Actions taken now to increase [**[agricultural sector jobs]{.mark}** can
[provide **economic opportunity** and **stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for those unemployed youths while helping to feed people. [A **recent
report**]{.underline} by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
[identifies **[agriculture development]{.mark}** as the **core
essential** for **[providing]{.mark} greater [food
security]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} **economic growth**, and **population
well-being**.]{.underline}

[Our **active support for food security**, including agriculture
development, has **helped stabilize key regions** over the past 60

overall security strategy, [can **mitigate the growth of terrorism**,
**build important relationships**, and **support continued

[have]{.underline} also [been]{.underline} **[excellent examples of the

by]{.underline}** openness and **[[data sharing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[that span multiple geographies]{.underline}, fields of expertise and
professional groups. As we move towards implementing these advances
across entire health systems, this collaborative spirit needs to be
harnessed and scaled up to deliver more formalised networks for sharing
knowledge and best practice. These **[[networks]{.underline}]{.mark}**
will **[[expedite national service deployment]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
accelerate future service development and provide expert forums in which
the arduous but essential task of establishing the standards and
benchmarks of service quality can be undertaken. **[[High-level
strategic coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}** and knowledge-sharing
across health delivery organisations **[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
equally **[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, [[synergy in
the development of]{.mark} pathogen genomics [programmes across]{.mark}
animal and human health [sectors will be needed]{.mark} to deliver a
'one-health' approach]{.underline} **[[to
tackling]{.underline}]{.mark}** many of **[the most pressing [zoonotic
disease threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as avian influenza and the
spread of antimicrobial resistance from livestock to humans, as well as
the more commonplace but persistent issue of foodborne illnesses. Data
--- it's time to go big No large-scale genomics enterprise can hope to
succeed without effective data integration and sharing. In the case of
pathogen genomics for clinical or public health, [[data integration will
require]{.mark} the construction of [dedicated
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} (real or virtual) [[to
collate]{.mark}, store, [analyse and share genomic]{.mark},
epidemiological and clinical [data across complex]{.mark} national and
international health [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This integration
will be]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [[crucial to enable]{.mark}
the delivery of genomic [epidemiology services]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
which **[[the requirement]{.mark} for data sharing]{.underline}** across
locations **[[is fundamental and time]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[as in
the 2015 Ebola outbreak]{.underline}**) **[[is very much of the
essence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Data integration and access will become
equally central in diagnostic microbiology, where having an accurate and
readily accessible summary of genotype, phenotype and clinical
information for different pathogens is essential to deliver care to
patients. Notably, the Global Microbial Identifier
(http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org/Workgroups#work-group-1) and
the Global Alliance for Genomic Health
(https://genomicsandhealth.org/node/12703) projects are already
demonstrating that huge technical, regulatory and political efforts will
be required to overcome barriers imposed by the varying capabilities,
legal systems and cultural frameworks of different nations if
transnational genomic and clinical data integration is to be achieved.
As an example, such barriers led the Indonesian government to
temporarily withdraw from the Global Influenza Surveillance Network in
2007, owing to concerns that, if data were shared, proprietary interests
would be exerted over the H5N1 strains \[9\]. The same issues can also
impose barriers to sharing and data integration within individual health
systems. Staying ahead of the game [[The application of genomics to
infectious disease management is]{.mark} still [in its
infancy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we currently lack the background
knowledge, as well as the technological capability, to deliver rapid,
clinically actionable information based on genomic analysis that can
improve outcomes for patients. **[[This situation is fluid, as
sequencing tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology (in the form of devices
that are increasingly more portable, cost less and have a longer read
capability) **[[and analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[[in the form of
cloud computing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, more efficient metagenomic
analysis and implementation of automated analytic pipelines)
**[[continue to develop]{.underline}]{.mark}** apace. However,
capitalising on the current rapid pace of innovation will demand novel
approaches to public--private cooperation and co-development of the type
seen with the Oxford Nanopore Minion Access Programme, which puts new
genomic technology in the hands of its users (including those in the
health system) at the earliest possible opportunity \[10\]. These
efforts will also benefit from building on the commendably open and
collaborative approaches for the development of knowledge and analytical
methods that are already being taken by many pathogen genomics
researchers. These collaborations will ensure that the knowledge and
expertise of these researchers are shared rapidly with the clinical and
public-health communities in which their influence is most needed.

(Ross and Alex, "Infectious Disease, Endangerment, and Extinction",
1/4/13, https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijeb/2013/571939/)

Why should the possible role of infectious disease in endangerment and
extinction be regarded as a critical issue in modern conservation?
[Whether or not disease was ever a major cause of
extinction]{.underline} in the fossil record \[19\], in our times it
[plays an acknowledged but perhaps **underestimated role**]{.underline}.
[Pathogen-driven population declines have been identified in a wide
array of]{.underline} invertebrate and vertebrate [taxa]{.underline}
(cf. \[20\]), suggesting that the phenomenon is probably universal. Yet
without the kinds of monitoring methods now available, some and perhaps
most of these declines would have gone undetected, or attributed to
other causes. Further, [the processes forcing such declines are as
diverse as the pathogens themselves and are far from being clearly
understood]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} apparent [increase in zoonotic
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} during the last few decades \[21\] may be
objectively real or merely due to better monitoring, but it
[[seems]{.mark} highly [likely that]{.mark} loss or [reduction
of]{.mark} pristine [habitats and]{.mark} the overall [impact of
invasive species should promote]{.mark} the **introduction of
[opportunistic pathogens]{.mark}** into wildlife [with **increasing
frequency**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, understanding the dynamics of
disease-mediated species declines may be critical to conservation
missions concerned with a wide variety of species and habitats. [Recent
advances in molecular biology and microbiology have permitted the
detection and identification of hosts of novel microorganisms, many of
which are pathogenic, and the technology needed to assess threat levels
is becoming increasingly available.]{.underline} Although the fossil
record clearly establishes that the fate of all species is to eventually
die out, it is obvious from the same record that the rate of
disappearance of individual species varies significantly \[22\]. As
already noted, inferences about how (as opposed to when) an individual
species disappeared must be developed inductively and retrospectively.
[An important guideline is that apparent causes of extinction that are
diachronic]{.underline} (repeatedly affect species across time) [are
inherently more plausible than ones that are claimed to have occurred
only once]{.underline}, or apply to only one taxon. Although this means
that explanations about individual extinctions are not strictly
testable, they can nevertheless be evaluated in terms of likelihood,
which is the approach currently taken by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and several other conservation
organizations interested in compiling extinction statistics \[23, 24\].
[It is an accepted tenet in conservation biology that [any severe,
continuing threat to a species might]{.mark} eventually **[contribute to
its extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[25\]. From this perspective, [it
is also accepted that [diseases]{.mark} presenting [with]{.mark} very
[high]{.mark} levels of [mortality]{.mark}]{.underline}---[as in the
case of a highly transmissible infection that is newly emergent in a
population]{.underline}---[[can cause]{.mark} **outright
[endangerment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But [are there conditions under
which a disease]{.underline}, probably in combination with other
threats, [might so imperil a species to cause its **complete
disappearance**]{.underline}? MacPhee and Marx \[19\] considered this
issue from the standpoint of model [pathogenic features that a
disease-provoking organism might exhibit in forcing]{.underline} the
[extinction]{.underline} of a given species. These features
[include]{.underline}: [(1) a reservoir species]{.underline} presenting
a stable carrier state for the pathogen, [(2) a high potential for
causing infections]{.underline} in susceptible species, affecting
critical age groups, [(3) a capacity for hyperlethality]{.underline},
defined here as mortality rates in the range of 50--75%. [Only
under]{.underline} the most [extreme conditions is it conceivable that a
species would suffer extinction in a single epizootic
event]{.underline}. [Much more likely would be [repeated
outbreaks]{.mark} over a period of years **[gradually reducing the
fitness level]{.mark}** of the species, [with **final
disappearance**]{.mark} potentially [caused by stochastic events]{.mark}
(such as causally unassociated climate change).]{.underline} One way in
which [this condition might be achieved]{.underline} would be [through a
stable carrier]{.underline} (i.e., a species other than the target,
living in similar circumstances in the same environment, and in which
the infection is inapparent or at least sublethal). A well-studied
example is the transfer of simian acquired immunodeficiency virus from
one species of macaque to another \[26\]. Although this instance
occurred under captive conditions, repeated outbreaks of distemper in
lions and African wild dogs have long been thought to be due to transfer
from domestic dogs (although the mechanism is debated; see \[27\]).
Obviously, for a disease to have a very severe impact, it would be
necessary for the pathogen to occur in highly lethal, aggressive strains
that strongly impact the target species before attenuated strains arise
and become common. High potential for causing infections in a
susceptible species is usually associated with the ability to
successfully enter the organism through a major portal, such as the
respiratory tract, where it can be lodged and transmitted easily (e.g.,
via aerosol). To achieve hyperlethality and produce serious mortality,
all age groups within a species would probably have to be susceptible,
not just the very young or very old (or the immunocompromised), with
death the usual outcome. [In large-bodied mammals, a fundamental
consideration is that any process that deleteriously affects young
individuals will have a **pronounced effect** on survivorship because of
the lengthy intervals in birth spacin]{.underline}g \[19\]. [[Lethality
in the range of]{.mark} 50--[75% is]{.mark}]{.underline} obviously
extremely high and thus extremely unusual, although [[historically seen
in Ebola]{.mark} infections [in humans]{.mark}]{.underline} and in
experimental transmission studies from pigs to macaques \[28\]. High
percentages may have also been achieved in rinderpest outbreaks among
East African bovids in the early 20th century \[29\], although
quantitative data on this are largely lacking. [An important issue here,
however, is whether pathogens causing this level of lethality could
maintain themselves in nature long enough to seriously imperil a
species]{.underline}. Speculatively, a possible outcome with hyperlethal
infections producing a rapid, fatal outcome is that affected populations
would be reduced to small numbers of widely dispersed and/or relatively
or completely immune individuals. Under these circumstances, the
epizootic would necessarily abate as it ran out of new hosts, leading to
the conclusion that exceptionally lethal diseases cannot be indefinitely
maintained in a population or species under normal circumstances.
However, [[if reservoirs exist]{.mark} from which the pathogen could
repeatedly emerge, in principle [epizootics might **resurge year after
year until population sizes were reduced below viable
levels**]{.mark}]{.underline} (\~50--500 individuals). [[At this point
stochastic effects might]{.mark} intervene and [lead to complete loss of
the species]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among possible examples of this
"perfect storm" of circumstances and consequences is the loss of
Christmas Island rats, detailed elsewhere in this paper. Among birds,
the severe impact of avian malaria on Hawaiian honeycreepers is also
pertinent and discussed later in this paper. Although a number of
honeycreeper species survive at high elevations, above the limit at
which introduced Culex mosquitos can survive, there are multiple
adventitious threats, such as deforestation and competition from
invasive species, which add to their endangerment picture \[30\].
Demonstrating that disease can produce endangerment and even extinction
in species of invertebrates is not inherently more difficult than
demonstrating the same thing for vertebrates. However, because there
tend to be far fewer specialists for individual invertebrate groups,
save for those having some degree of economic significance, the chances
are high that disease impacts will frequently be missed. One case that
was not missed was the loss of the last members of Partula turgida, a
snail from French Polynesia that succumbed to an infection of the
microsporidian Steinhausia sp. \[31\]. Steinhausia is a known parasite
of various taxa of bivalve molluscans, infecting oocytes and thereby
reducing fecundity (e.g., "mussel egg disease"; \[32\]). The decline of
P. turgida received an unusual level of attention (for an invertebrate)
because of this species' importance for studying evolutionary variation
and niche occupation \[33\]. This snail and several of its close
relatives were already considered extinct in the wild due to predation
by the introduced wolfsnail Euglandina when the last few known
individuals were collected and kept as a captive colony. As is
frequently the case with unmanaged natural populations, there were no
relevant baseline data for this species, and it cannot be excluded that
Steinhausia was already present in the colony. Admittedly, so small a
coterie of individuals hardly constituted a viable species and could
have been driven to extinction by other mechanisms as well. It should
also be noted that Steinhausia infections are not known to present a
severe threat to any natural populations of bivalves, or at least any
that have maintained normal populations. Other possible instances of
extinction by disease in invertebrates are few and inconclusive \[1\],
although the loss of the eelgrass limpet (Lottia alveus) may be
mentioned in this context as it demonstrates that "pathogen pollution"
can have severe indirect effects on species other than the one affected
by disease \[34\]. In this case, eelgrass wasting disease killed off
seagrasses on both sides of the Atlantic on such a massive scale that
all known populations of this limpet terminally crashed \[35\]. 4.
Extinction and Infectious Disease in Amphibians In their survey Smith et
al. \[4\] noted that amphibians account for 30% of critically endangered
animals and that they also comprise approximately 75% of critically
endangered species threatened by disease. Although ranavirus infections,
trematode infestations, and several other pathogen threats have been
proposed as driving particular cases of decline, the agent thought to
contribute most widely to amphibian endangerment is Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis, first identified in the 1990s as the cause of a fatal
chytridiomycosis \[36, 37\]. A concern that has emerged in the last few
years is the effect of the global trade in amphibians on the health of
natural populations. There are several instances of ranavirus and
chytrid infections having been detected in pet store populations \[38\];
if infected individuals were to escape, transmission to wildlife is an
obvious possibility. Release of captive-bred animals in reintroduction
experiments represent another potential danger if captives were exposed
to virulent pathogens. Amphibians are under global assault from a large
variety of impactors additional to infectious diseases, including
habitat loss, pollution, pesticides, and harmful UV radiation. Perhaps
as many as 120 amphibian species have already been driven to extinction
in recent decades; however, because of the complexity of the factors
affecting their endangerment, the number actually lost to the effects of
infectious disease remains uncertain \[4, 39\]. 5. Extinction and
Infectious Disease in Birds Smith et al. \[4\] identified 18 examples of
bird extinctions and extirpations that have been attributed at least
partly to infectious diseases. Of these, 16 cases concern endemics that
lived in the Hawaiian Islands; most were from one tribe of finches, the
Hawaiian honeycreepers (Drepanidini, Fringillidae). Warner \[40\]
proposed that these losses were due to panzootics caused by the
inadvertent introduction of Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector of avian
malaria (Plasmodium relictum). Another lethal agent, presumably
introduced as well, was avian pox (Poxvirus avium). Although there are
no empirical observations relating to the hypothesized panzootics (which
presumably occurred in the early 19th century, when the mosquito
arrived), one obvious effect of massive population depletions was that
surviving species of honeycreepers---formerly common in the
lowlands---became restricted to higher elevations where the mosquitoes
do not occur. Additional research in more recent years indicates that
such diseases limit the distribution and abundance of susceptible
species, and that it is these factors (grouped as habitat loss) that
primarily govern local or complete extinction \[41, 42\]. 6. Extinction
and Infectious Disease in Mammals Although there are several current
examples of mammalian species already under threat for various reasons
being severely impacted by infectious diseases---including canine
distemper in black-footed ferrets and lions \[43, 44\], Ebola and
Marburg hemorrhagic diseases in anthropoids \[45\], and transmissible
facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils \[46\]---none of these has
(yet) resulted in extinction. Possible examples in the mammalian fossil
record (cf. \[19\]), although compelling in some instances, lack
adequate corroboration for reasons already discussed. Indeed, to date
there is only one study \[10\] that may be said to meet appropriate
retrospective criteria for identifying disease as the primary cause of
extinction at the species level in any mammal. This study involved an
investigation of the disappearance of two endemic murid species on
Christmas Island (Indian Ocean) at the beginning of the 20th century.
That the Christmas Island extinctions could be usefully studied at all
is due in large measure to the work of the biologist Andrews \[47\] and,
later, the parasitologist Durham \[48\], both of whom spent considerable
time on the island and recorded many valuable observations on the rats
before and during their disappearance. Christmas Island was evidently
uninhabited by humans until the last quarter of the 19th century. With
the discovery of phosphate deposits on the island, its exploitation
became inevitable, and Christmas Island was formally annexed by the
United Kingdom in 1888. An immediate result was increased ship traffic,
with the result that in 1899 black rats (Rattus rattus) were
inadvertently introduced. Within 5 years, the two endemic murids, the
Christmas Island rat (Rattus macleari) and the bulldog rat (Rattus
nativitatis), were seriously affected; populations declined
precipitously, and individuals were described as behaving abnormally
(e.g., nocturnally active rodents appearing during the daytime) and
displaying evidence of infection with parasitic trypanosomiasis \[48\].
By 1908 it was believed that the native rats had become extinct, but
that some of the endemic diversity should have survived in the form of
R. rattus × R. macleari and R. rattus × R. macleari hybrids (as deduced
from pelt characteristics). Samples of hybrids, together with earlier
collections of the Christmas Island rat and the less abundant bulldog
rat, have been stored in museum collections in the UK since then. Wyatt
et al. \[10\] extracted DNA from all available remaining Christmas
Island and bulldog rats along with putative hybrid animals and black
rats collected at the same time. Mitochondrial, nuclear, and trypanosome
DNAs were amplified from the samples. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
analysis clearly indicated Rattus rattus and Rattus macleari were
biologically distinct, but that the alleged hybrids were in fact
exclusively black rat morphotypes. Thus, the Christmas Island rat is
completely extinct and its genetic endowment has not persisted in any
form. Genetic evidence of the murid-specific trypanosome Trypanosoma
lewisi was found in the true black rat and the Christmas Island rat
samples. In samples of the bulldog rat, all collected earlier than 1899,
no evidence of trypanosome infection could be found. Thus, detection of
trypanosomes correlates with the arrival of invasive black rats and the
subsequent extinction of the native rat species on Christmas Island
(only inferential in the case of the bulldog rat). Like many other
islands, Christmas Island is notable for having suffered mammal
extinctions that cannot be explained by hunting pressure or sudden
changes in climate \[49\]. The only other native ground-dwelling mammal
on the island, the Christmas Island shrew (Crocidura trichura), survived
many decades after the disappearance of the endemic rodents, but it has
not been seen since 1985 despite considerable surveying effort \[50\].
More recently, the Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi)
appears to have become extinct in 2010, following an unexplained
precipitous decline starting in the 1980s \[50, 51\]. The last remaining
native mammal is the Christmas Island flying fox (Pteopus melanotus
natalis), also declining rapidly. Whether these extinctions and declines
subsequent to the loss of the endemic rats are disease-related might be
resolved if appropriate samples were collected historically, although
this possibility has not yet been investigated. In summary, and
regardless of final cause, the rodent extinctions on Christmas Island
display two interesting features. First, the extinctions were extremely
rapid: the interval from first notice of decline to declared extinction
was 10 years, with the actual event probably occurring within an even
shorter period \[52\]. Second, the species affected would not normally
be regarded as being particularly susceptible to extinction; murid
rodents tend to be extremely adaptable, with high reproductive rates,
and thus would normally be well buffered against population collapses
sufficient to cause complete loss. The susceptibility factor at work in
these cases was almost certainly long isolation on, and restriction to,
a single small island. Among mammals the "island extinction effect" is
particularly well investigated; more than 80% of the \~80--90 species of
mammals that became extinct in the past 500 years were island dwelling
\[53\]. Such losses are usually attributed to habitat destruction and
the deleterious effects of invasive species, but under some
circumstances introduced infectious diseases might be plausible as
drivers. There are a number of other, largely anecdotal, instances of
mammalian species succumbing to unknown infectious diseases (see
\[19\]). One example of considerable interest is the Tasmanian tiger or
thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus). Although extensively hunted because
of its supposed taste for sheep, until the turn of the 20th century
thylacines were not uncommon. Thereafter they became exceedingly rare,
with no confirmed kills logged after about 1910. Distemperlike outbreaks
observed in captive thylacines, as well as widespread outbreaks in other
Australian marsupials at the same time, have been taken as anecdotal
evidence that disease played a role in the final disappearance of
thylacines \[1\]. Validation of a role for disease in this extinction
would be particularly difficult, as distemper viruses are
single-stranded RNA paramyxoviruses that are unlikely to be preserved in
museum skins or bone. 7. Recent Cases of Infectious Disease Causing
Serious Endangerment in Mammals Several excellent review articles have
analyzed the impacts of infectious disease on extant natural populations
\[1, 3, 4\]. To these may be added several more examples of verified
associations of disease and severe population decline in mammal species
living in diverse environments. Whether any of these taxa will actually
disappear is unknown at present, but the very fact that new examples are
being discovered at a much higher rate than in past decades presumably
indicates that infectious diseases have been undervalued as a
significant cause of species endangerment. 7.1. Koalas Koalas are under
siege by two major pathogens. Kola retrovirus (KoRV), frequently
observed in captive koalas, is oncogenic and causes substantial
mortality \[54\]. The virus is not distributed evenly across Australia,
as its frequency within populations decreases from north to south. Given
the history of overhunting of koalas in the last 120 years, especially
in southern Australia, it was originally concluded that KoRV must have
entered Australia within the last 200 years, travelling from north to
south \[55\]. However, a recent study \[14\] utilizing historical
samples demonstrated that KoRV was already widespread by the late 1800s
in northern Australia. Furthermore, its evolution is very slow, which is
consistent with the retrovirus having entered koala populations long
before this and likely having caused disease throughout this time. The
second pathogen decimating koala populations at present is a specific
strain of infectious Chlamydia pecorum. Infection can result in
subsequent sterility or blindness \[56\]. There is some evidence that
KoRV infection correlates with chlamydial infection \[57\]. This is
plausible, as KoRV belongs to the gammaretrovirus family, many members
of which are immunosuppressive. Infection with KoRV would thus provide
opportunities for secondary infectious agents such as Chlamydia in
less-resistant hosts. Koala populations exhibit low diversity in their
mitochondrial DNA \[58\]; this lack of genetic diversity, if it affects
overall resistance, may be emblematic of their inability to fend off
infectious agents. According to the World Wildlife Foundation \[59\],
serious overlapping infections of this kind could lead to the local
extirpation, if not the outright extinction, of koalas within the next
50 years. 7.2. Myotis Bats A cryophilous fungus (Geomyces destructans),
introduced to the northeastern USA from Europe within the last decade,
has been conclusively shown to cause massive mortality ("white nose
syndrome") in the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) \[60\]. Fungal
infections do not normally induce severe disease in mammals, except in
cases of immunosuppression (often itself caused by another pathogen).
Interestingly, Myotis myotis, a closely related species endemic to
Europe, is also infected with this fungus, but other than the
characteristic "white nose" produced by fungal growth, animals suffer no
negative symptoms and there is no increased mortality associated with
infection \[61--63\]. Geomyces destructans, which only grows at cold
temperatures, interrupts bat hibernation; this causes wintering animals
to awaken more frequently than normal, seriously impairing their energy
and water balances and ultimately leading to death. Although why these
two species differ so dramatically in their response to infection is
obscure, the consequences are clear; millions of little brown bats,
including entire populations of some hibernacula, have died as a result
of their incapacity to resist infection \[61\]. Indeed, current
mortality rates suggest that the little brown bat may eventually suffer
complete regional extinction \[64\]. 7.3. Tasmanian Devils Devil facial
tumor disease (DFTD), a severe threat to the Tasmanian devil
(Sarcophilus harrisii), is currently receiving a great deal of attention
because of its highly unusual nature \[65\]. Unlike most infectious
diseases, the agent in this case is not viral, bacterial, parasitic, or
prion-derived (infectious protein). Rather, the agent is a tumor that is
spread from individual to individual by mechanical transmission of tumor
cells during agonistic encounters, which often involve aggressive
behavior. The only similarly infectious cancer identified to date is
canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT), which affects dogs. The DFTD
source tumor evidently derived from multiple individual clones developed
in a single female; male and female devils are equally susceptible, and
the disease has now spread throughout Tasmania. Museum samples predating
1996 display no evidence of the disease, making it likely that DFTD is
newly emergent. At the same time, there are clearly complex evolutionary
dynamics at play; for example, different clonal lineages derived from
the original source tumor vary in frequency, geographical distribution,
and diversity \[65\]. How such tumors manage to escape the devil's
immune system is unknown, but the ongoing threat is very real. Unless
tumor-free populations can be established and protected, further
population collapse, if not complete extinction, will be the probable
outcome \[66, 67\]. Although host-pathogen interactions have been a
subject of interest in conservation biology for some time, [[the
possibility that disease might]{.mark} actually [drive
extinctions]{.mark} in certain contexts [has **rarely been
considered**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is partly due to a general lack
of knowledge concerning wildlife pathogens and their microbiology, but
[it]{.underline} also stems from a lack of well-researched and
unequivocal examples of disease-induced loss of naturally occurring
populations or species. We anticipate that, with the advent of endeavors
such as the Human Microbiome Project \[68\] and the further development
of next-generation sequencing, we will have an increasingly better
understanding of microbiological processes in wildlife. Because of their
relevance to human health, bat and rodent viromes are being explored
with special intensity using high-throughput approaches, with the result
that many novel---and potentially significantly pathogenic---viral
strains have been identified in recent years \[8, 69--72\]. As such
surveys increase, and sequencing costs decrease, we can expect to see a
wealth of new data concerning microbiological diversity in wildlife, as
well as new understandings of the natural history of host-pathogen
relationships. [[New insights will]{.mark} also [come from
archives]{.mark} that we [have never]{.mark} heretofore [been able to
tap]{.mark}. It is already the case that [entire genomes from historical
samples]{.mark}]{.underline} (aboriginal human genome) [or now-extinct
species]{.underline} (woolly mammoths, neandertals) [[have proven
amenable to reconstruction]{.mark} using modern
methodologies]{.underline}; it may be confidently predicted that our
ability to undertake such investigations will only improve in future
\[73\]. With regard to ancient pathogens, investigators have already
made exciting discoveries, such as the recent identification of
previously undocumented strains of Yersinia pestis retrieved from 13th
century plague pits \[16\]. At present, the most promising methods are
based on either microarray or solution-based hybrid capture methods, in
which a sequence of interest is either synthesized directly or produced
by PCR, biotinylated, and then used to "capture" target sequences in
samples from which sequencing libraries have been generated \[74\].
[With DNA microarrays, multiple targets can be collected in a single
experiment; when coupled with next-generation sequencing, extraordinary
amounts of sequence information can be recovered at minimal
cost]{.underline}. Although such methods have been primarily applied to
modern DNA, there have been some notable successes with ancient DNA
applications \[75, 76\]. Again, it is surely reasonable to assume that,
as methodologies improve and are applied to fresh questions, we will be
able to recover sequence data on ancient DNA-based pathogens at levels
that would have been unimaginable only a decade or so ago. To be sure,
RNA-based pathogens may remain resistant to study due to the poor
preservation of RNA genomes after mortem, but even here there is reason
to be optimistic. For example, improvements in protein sequencing may
provide information on the identity of RNA-based viruses (either as
such, or in the form of presence/absence information), even though the
level of analytical detail will likely be persistently poorer than we
can now achieve with DNA-genome-based pathogens \[77\]. [[Whether
epizootics]{.mark} in wildlife occupying pristine environments
[are]{.mark} in fact [increasing is a question]{.mark} that can
[only]{.mark} be [settled by **much larger pools of data** than we
have]{.mark} at present]{.underline}. Nevertheless, we believe that
understanding [[the role of disease in provoking **endangerment** and
**extinction** is critically important]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
education of conservation professionals, [if only because [the
contribution of disease to declines and outright extinction has]{.mark}
likely [been **underestimated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[What we]{.mark}
do not understand, or [ignore]{.mark}, [may be what hurts us
most]{.mark}.]{.underline}

IZP)

A military alliance such as NATO is not a first responder in a health
crisis, as most tasks must be implemented at the domestic level.
However, given the impact and the spillover effects of COVID-19 on the
very day-to-day operations of the alliance --- military personnel are
not immune from viruses --- as well as on supply chains, and economies
and societies around the world, it was paramount for NATO to take
initiative both to protect its member states against malign actors and
to offer crucial support in the spirit of solidarity. In spite of these
successful initiatives, the Operations Division of NATO headquarters in
Brussels has admitted64 that the alliance was ill-prepared to handle
such a crisis. As Rittimann noted, the alliance lacked its own means and
political bandwidth to do more.65 For this reason, [NATO and its member
states should not miss the opportunity that the COVID-19 crisis offers
to set up more structured plans to ensure readiness in crisis
management. In particular, they should expand the concept of security to
include]{.underline} the most pressing non-military global security
threats: climate change, [health risks,]{.underline} and social
resilience against disinformation. So far, NATO has set up a Lessons
Learned Steering Group (LLSG)66 on COVID-19, which collects inputs by
agencies, divisions, and delegations to help the alliance design a
strategy for both future waves of this coronavirus and for future
pandemics. Stemming from the inputs of the LLSG and from the reflections
of officials interviewed for this paper, the following recommendations
to the alliance focus on resilience and readiness in crisis management.
● Resilience: NATO must remain vigilant against malign exploitation of
crises. Under whatever circumstances may arise, the Atlantic alliance
should not shift its focus away from its main objectives of pushing back
against adversaries through deterrence and response-readiness.67 ○ [NATO
should have a protocol to follow in case of crises like pandemics to
ensure continuity of operations.]{.underline} So far, the alliance has
shown impressive adaptability and was able to keep its missions running
and continue with training and exercises, even if at a reduced level.
However, military activities have been reduced by 33% with 80% fewer
personnel participating,68 and the climate of uncertainty surrounding
the impact of COVID-19 on NATO missions, training, and exercises could
have left gaps for malign actors to exploit, especially in more fragile
settings like in Iraq. [To prevent future pandemics or similar events
from eroding NATO's readiness capabilities, it is paramount to develop
structured plans and protocols that would allow timely adaptation,
personnel protection, and resilience against external
threats]{.underline}. [To further protect core combat capabilities, it
would be necessary for NATO personnel employed in quick-response units
to receive early access to vaccines; the alliance should also be
prepared with contact-tracing capabilities to identify outbreaks
quickly]{.underline}.69 ○ NATO should increase its counter-
disinformation efforts and protect its member states against malign
actors exploiting crises to promote their geopolitical and economic
interests. Although disinformation has been included among the list of
threats to NATO since the 2014 summit in Wales, the alliance has not
established a special agency or team to focus on countering
disinformation. During COVID-19, when NATO member states were targeted
by Chinese "mask diplomacy" and Russia's claims about the inability of
Western countries to deal with COVID-19, the organization resorted to
its Public Diplomacy Division --- in cooperation with the European
Union's East Stratcom Task Force70 --- to increase its public profile
and debunk Chinese and Russian fake news. However, this is not yet
enough to counter the volume and reach of such propaganda, which
requires real-time investigation and fact-checking and outreach to the
audience that has been targeted by disinformation, with the possibility
of providing training for soldiers and commanders to react to
information warfare.71 For this reason, the alliance should consider
setting up a dedicated team and establish a framework of coordination
with the East Stratcom Task Force to broaden the scope of counter-
disinformation efforts and take more targeted actions to strengthen
societal resilience across member states. Readiness: NATO must further
enhance its crisis management toolkit. The core lesson COVID-19 taught
NATO concerned crisis management capabilities and culture. The alliance
adjusted fairly quickly and made an incredibly efficient use of its
logistical apparatus; yet, more can be done to enhance NATO readiness to
face challenges of this nature. ○ [Strengthen the Euro-Atlantic Disaster
Relief Coordination Center. As mentioned, over the past few years, the
EADRCC staff had been reduced to three people; as COVID-19 hit Europe,
NATO was forced to rapidly reallocate military personnel from other
departments to support the work of NATO's clearinghouse for aid requests
and delivery. At a time when the impact of global challenges can no
longer be ignored, NATO should invest in and expand the EADRCC's
capacity and scope to increase preparedness in preparation for
subsequent COVID-19 waves and other future catastrophic
events]{.underline}. [Along with the EADRCC, the alliance should enhance
the flexibility in the NSPA procurement process in order to speed up
access to cost-effective airlifting as well as to the procurement of
medical equipment]{.underline}. Beyond overseeing the transportation
supplies and medical assistance, the EADRCC could also play a role in
coordinating NATO's support to national armed forces in member states,
in the event that such forces experience significant losses. [○ Increase
knowledge, prediction capabilities, and awareness. Building on existing
analytical platforms and programs72 and intelligence sharing between
allied nations, NATO should increase its understanding and awareness of
how global challenges and threats such as pandemics can affect NATO
operations and personnel and increase preparation of tailored
contingency plans for suitable responses.]{.underline} Some of these
actions may include several aspects of the alliance's activities, from
decisionmaking to technological potential and research through its own
laboratory (the Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation located
in La Spezia, Italy) and its Science for Peace and Security (SPS)
Program.73 Given NATO's renewed sensitivity to biological risks,
intelligence sharing could be crucial to elaborate plans for countering
new threats such as bioterrorism.74 ○ [Coordination with the European
Union. NATO's logistical apparatus was crucial in delivering aid when
the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism was under stress, and after initial
hesitation, in coordination with the EU mechanism]{.underline}. Moving
forward, in the words of Malcom Chalmers, deputy director-general of
Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the EU-NATO
relationship will be crucial "if the West is to survive as a coherent
entity."75 Given that many NATO countries are also EU member states, all
that applies to logistics, transportations, and purchases falls under
the regulatory umbrella of the European Union. For this reason, [a more
established framework of cooperation between NATO and the EU will be
crucial to ensure a smoother application of crisis protocols and ease
the transportation of essential items within alliance territory,
similarly to what was envisaged to ensure military mobility for the
DEFENDER-Europe 20 drilling]{.underline}. In particular, the EU and NATO
should also collaborate to establish permanent stockpiles76 and reduce
the alliance's dependence from global supply chain for crucial medical
material, but also to develop cost-effective strategies for the
production and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. Such coordination
should also remain wary of duplicating efforts --- as in the case of the
NATO pandemic relief trust fund,77 which risks creating overlapping with
the Civil Protection Mechanism for the accumulation of medical supplies.

### SPS

#### SPS can specifically focus on CBRN threats like disease -- that enables effective mitigation efforts

**NATO ESCG** 20**19**. The Emerging Security Challenges Division. "THE
NATO SCIENCE FOR PEACE AND SECURITY SPS PROGRAMME." NATO OTAN. 2019.

[In line with NATO's political agenda to improve the ability of the
Alliance and its partners to protect their populations and forces from
CBRN threats, the SPS Programme supports activities under the key
priority of Defence against CBRN agents]{.underline}. [This ambition to
continuously improve NATO's capabilities and technologies to counter
CBRN threats was reiterated at the 2018 Brussels Summit by the
Alliance's Heads of State and Government. The objectives of SPS
activities under this key priority are to deliver high-quality
scientific research, develop technologies and capacity building, and
train young researchers and experts, strengthening the overall
resilience and capabilities of participating countries.]{.underline} In
this way, [SPS supports situational awareness on safety and security
developments, and enhances CRBN response capabilities, technical
competences and skills in NATO and partner nations.]{.underline} Under
this key priority, a total of 18 [SPS activities]{.underline} were
completed in 2019, involving co-directors from 21 countries. 11 MYPs
[developed technologies to rapidly and efficiently detect and identify
CBRN agents, increase the efficiency of decontamination, detect
biological agents,]{.underline} and manage radioactive dust disturbances
and leaks. 512 [specialists were trained in a single ATC on medical
counter-measures and emerging technologies against CBRN
agents]{.underline}. Moreover, three ASIs and three ARWs brought
together 72 scientists and 227 participants respectively to share their
skills and knowledge, and discuss topics such as diagnosis and exposure
assessment, detection, and nanotechnology. DIMLAB-Deployable Chemical
and Biological Analytical Laboratory \[new\] November 21-22, 2019 marked
the official launch of the MYP, "Deployable Biological and Chemical
Analytical Laboratory (DIMLAB)" in Madrid, Spain. This 30-month project,
will be run by an international consortium including Spanish non- profit
association, Adelfas, as project coordinator; the 1st Regiment of NBC
Defense "Valencia" of the Spanish Army; the Mohammed V University
Science Faculty; the General Directorate of Civil Protection, Morocco;
the Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology (INSAT); and both the
Tunisian General Directorate of Environment and Quality of Life and
National Office of Civil Protection. Two dual-use (civil and military)
deployable laboratories, one chemical and one biological, will be built
for Tunisia and Morocco respectively. In attendance at the project
launch were representatives from the SPS Programme, Adelfas members,
scientific delegations from Morocco and Tunisia, and Ministry of Defence
representatives from the three participating countries. [NATO has been
working with its partners towards strengthening its capacity to defend
against CBRN agents. Scientific research with direct applications in
defence and security, such as the DIMLAB project, is necessary to ensure
that the Alliance meets its strategic partnership objective, which calls
for mutually beneficial cooperation on issues of common interest
including CBRN defence.]{.underline} This project is a key component of
the SPS contribution to the DCB package for Tunisia, which also listed
CBRN defence as a priority area of cooperation with NATO in its most
recent IPCP. Similarly, [the latest draft of the IPCP between NATO and
Morocco highlighted "exchange of information and expertise, and capacity
building in defence against CBRN agents" as a main practical area of
cooperation through the SPS Programme.]{.underline} CBRN Exposure
Assessment and Medical Countermeasures \[completed\] This ARW was
initiated and supported by different organizations pertaining to the
French Ministry of Armed Forces, the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique
et aux énergies alternatives (CEA) and the National Federation of
Firefighters. It was embedded in the 3rd International Conference CBRNE
on Research and Innovation held in Nantes, which welcomed
internationally recognized scientists from different NATO and partner
nations. [109 participants and speakers attended three interactive days
of activities, discussing in depth all pillars of the new paradigm of
medical countermeasures, including pre-deployment aspects to supportive
care and new antidotes/ vaccine research activities or lessons learned
from recent events]{.underline}. [Presentations and posters addressed
various threats (chemical, biological, viral diseases), as well as skin
decontamination, and detection (alert and identification).]{.underline}
[This event directly addressed the strategic objective to "further
develop NATO's capacity to defend against the threat of chemical,
biological, radiological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction".
Furthermore, it contributed to strengthening ties with an important
partner in a critical area of defence and security
research.]{.underline}

### US Key

#### US leadership is key to NATO effectiveness

**NYT 2018** - Editorial Board\
\"Why NATO Matters,\" Jul 8,
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/opinion/editorials/why-nato-matters.html

Across seven decades NATO has invoked its Article 5 mutual defense
commitment only once: to rally to the defense of the United States after
the attacks of 9/11. Even today, the armed forces of 39 countries are
serving, and sometimes dying, with American troops in Afghanistan.

More than 70 (NATO and non-NATO) countries are part of the U.S.-led
fight against the Islamic State; two dozen countries have joined a
global counterterrorism initiative.

In short, [NATO remains central to major American national security
initiatives in a world shaken by the rise of an increasingly assertive
China, the expansion of]{.underline} competing power centers from India
to [Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, the surge of migration from the Middle
East and Africa [and]{.underline} the dislocations caused by
[globalizatio]{.underline}n.

[Yet NATO is being weakened from within --- by members' failure to spend
enough]{.underline} on defense; by the rise of nationalism and
authoritarianism, especially in Turkey, Hungary and Poland; and perhaps
most of all, by President Trump, who seems to prefer President Vladimir
Putin of Russia to America's European allies.

[NATO has always depended on leadership from the United
States,]{.underline} the world's biggest economy and most lethal
military power. Mr. Trump not only doesn't want to lead the West, he has
denigrated the alliance, bullied its leaders and accused NATO and the
European Union of exploiting American largess.

#### The US is key to NATO interoperability and unlocking the potential of smaller countries.

Pursuing Collaborative Innovation

[Not all allies have the defense funding, technological capacity,
skills, and military infrastructure to facilitate rapid defense
innovation, including the adoption and scaling of emerging
technologies]{.underline}. And [not all that have such resources and
knowledge are willing to share them in collaborative innovation
processes. Leading allies]{.underline}---[the United
States]{.underline}, France, the United Kingdom, and the
Netherlands---[already have national-focused approaches to the adoption
of EDTs]{.underline}. By contrast, [for most Central and Eastern
countries EDTs in defense are mainly a long-term prospect. Previous
challenges in]{.underline} integrating cyber capabilities into [NATO
operations, persistent capability gaps among the allies, and slow
standardization procedures are a good indication of the magnitude of the
challeng]{.underline}e, which is acknowledged at the highest levels of
NATO decision-making.

As Secretary-General Stoltenberg has stated[, a technological gap
between the allies would undermine interoperability and weaken alliance
cohesion]{.underline}. In [the context of the NATO AI and big data
strategies and the Defense Innovation Accelerator, allies should reflect
on how to improve and facilitate technological transfers among
themselves]{.underline}. This [could enable smaller allies to specialize
in niche EDTs capabilities]{.underline}, as has been the case with
cyber, for example, and could prevent the emergence of new technological
and capability gaps between the allies[. The Biden
administration's]{.underline} focus on shared democratic values and the
digital agenda, and [its willingness to strengthen NATO and technology
partnerships, constitute a window of opportunity for the alliance. It
should be fully capitalized on to accelerate transatlantic collaborative
defense innovation]{.underline}.

**Weinrod 16** - Former Secretary of Defense Representative Europe and
Defense Advisor to the U.S. Mission NATO (W Bruce, "We Still Need NATO,"
The American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/)

[Not only does NATO remain relevant, but more importantly it continues
to support and advance U.S. security interests]{.underline}---though
again, often in ways that do not make headlines and that casual
observers rarely appreciate in full. Most fundamentally, [NATO provides
a standing multilateral military capability that can **deter or be
deployed** should a significant security threat arise]{.underline}.
Because NATO has a military capability in place, the core elements for
mobilization, deployment, and sustainment of substantial multilateral
military forces already exist. The [ongoing training, exercises, and
regular communication among the national militaries of NATO members
allows them to **jump-start** preparations and actions when needed
**without** very lengthy preparatory work]{.underline}. [This can allow
the U.S. government to proceed in shaping and leading military
coalitions more quickly, at less cost and with greater effectiveness,
than if NATO did not exist and its functional equivalent had to be
invented from scratch at a moment's not]{.underline}ice. While the U.S.
government retains the capacity and the right to act unilaterally if and
when necessary, it makes sense for it to act with others whenever
possible, whether through NATO or ad hoc coalitions of the willing. [A
multilateral framework can provide both political cover and military
resources, and the United States very much can benefit from
both]{.underline}. [The United States also benefits significantly from
NATO's **logistics** capabilities]{.underline}. Pontificating about
grand strategies sounds impressive, but for military effectiveness and
success, [logistics capabilities are what really count]{.underline}.
[For example, while NATO did not formally participate in the 1991 Gulf
War, NATO resources, supplies, bases, and other infrastructure provided
crucial support prior to and during the U.S.-led coalition military
action to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.]{.underline} The coalition
in effect borrowed NATO capacities already in existence, and benefitted
greatly from equipment compatibility and common training and resources.
[Other coalitions of the willing assembled under U.S auspices and
utilizing NATO resources can follow the same approach]{.underline}. In
addition, [the U.S. government has access to the numerous military
facilities and resources that member nations make available to NATO. A
good example is Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, now being used against ISIS
in what is not a formal NATO operation]{.underline}. As importantly,
[working through NATO usually makes it relatively **routine** for host
governments to **agree** to U.S. requests to use facilities within their
territory for military-related purposes]{.underline}. [Without
NATO,]{.underline} in order to fulfill its security responsibilities,
the U.S. government would need to develop and maintain a complex network
of bilateral and multilateral security agreements and arrangements that
would seek to maintain the kind of connectivity and flexibility that
NATO already provides. Further, [the U.S. government would need not only
agreements to access such military facilities but also would likely need
to obtain specific approval from the host nation for each use and
perhaps even in some cases legislative approval]{.underline}. In
general, [it is much simpler, faster, and **easier politically** and
otherwise for nations to grant the United States the use of their
facilities within a NATO framework than it would be to have to grant
permission to the United States on their own]{.underline}. Over recent
decades [NATO]{.underline} has, as noted above, [developed]{.underline}
a [global security]{.underline} network that reflects formalized
relationships with non-NATO nations. For the United States, this brings
the advantage that it can work through NATO to develop or enhance
security relationships with states that belong to the PFP, the MD, the
ICI, and NATO bilateral security relationships. [Working through NATO
provides an extra dimension to U.S. efforts to enhance the military
capacities of friends and allies in various regions who, with training
and assistance, can provide supplementary support to NATO or U.S.-led
operations. NATO also supports U.S. interests by providing a
multilateral framework for a U.S. presence in nations where the U.S.
government wishes to help train and also enhance its military contacts,
but where unilateral U.S. military involvement might be politically
contentious]{.underline}.

#### American leadership in NATO solves their impacts

**Burns 2018** - former under secretary of state and ambassador to NATO,
teaches diplomacy and international relations at Harvard\
Nicholas, \"What America Gets out of NATO,\" Jul 11,
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/what-america-gets-out-of-nato.html

Third, future [American leaders will find Europe is our most capable and
willing partner in tackling the biggest threats to global security:
climate change; drugand cybercrime cartels; terrorism;
pandemics]{.underline} and mass migration from Africa and the Middle
East. And America's [NATO allies will continue to be
indispensable]{.underline} in safeguarding democracy and freedom, under
assault by Russia and China.

Mr. Trump's campaign to undermine the European Union and diminish
America's leadership in NATO serves none of these interests. He seems
driven by resentment about European trade surpluses and low defense
budgets, issues that blind him to all the other benefits Americans
derive from our alliance with Europe and Canada.

Mr. Trump may believe his blistering attacks on Europe's trade policies
and defense budgets are a good negotiating tactic before the summit. But
in fact they have already done enormous damage. While he cannot outright
kill NATO --- the American public and Congress support it too strongly
--- he has eroded significant levels of trust and good will. As it
became clear during my recent visits across Europe, a dangerous breach
has opened in the trans-Atlantic alliance --- by far the worst in seven
decades.

Mr. Trump wants Americans to believe that their allies are simply taking
advantage of them. On Sept. 11, 2001, I witnessed a far different
reality as American ambassador to NATO. Canada and the European allies
volunteered within hours of the attacks to invoke Article 5 of the NATO
treaty, which compels all members to respond to an attack on any single
member, for the first time in history. They came to our defense when we
most needed them. They sent troops to fight with us in Afghanistan. They
are still there with us 17 years later.

Are [we now going to throw off that mutual protection, and go it alone
in a dangerous 21st-century world?]{.underline} **[That would be a
historic mistake]{.underline}**. But that is where we may find ourselves
if Mr. Trump's anti-Europe vendetta continues.

### War Mod

#### The alternative is war

**Berlinski** 7-15-20**18** -- PhD in IR @ Oxford (Claire, "Europe's
Dependence on the U.S. Was All Part of the Plan: Postwar U.S. statesmen
designed our world order as it is for a reason. They had lived through
what happened without it.," *Politico*,
<https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/15/trump-nato-europe-history-dependence-219011>)

[Trump's NATO-bashing surprised no one]{.underline}. He has repeatedly
suggested the United States' postwar security architecture is a "bad
deal," one negotiated by weak and foolish "incompetents." [Foreign
policy, in his view, is a zero-sum game]{.underline}; any benefit to
another nation must of necessity be a loss for the United States. "NATO
countries," he declared on Twitter, "must pay MORE, the United States
must pay LESS. Very Unfair!" Unfair? A world that revolves around
American military, economic and cultural power, and uses the U.S. dollar
as its reserve currency? [What Trump fails to understand is
that]{.underline} the disparity in spending, with [the U.S. paying more
than its allies, is not a bug of the system. It **is a
feature**]{.underline}. [This is how]{.underline} the
[great]{.underline} postwar [states]{.underline}men [designed it, and
this immensely foresighted strategy has ensured the absence of great
power conflict]{.underline}---[and nuclear war]{.underline}---[for
three-quarters of a century]{.underline}. [The open, liberal world order
we know today]{.underline} was built in the wake of World War II and
expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it [is led
by the United States; by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military
hegemony over Eurasia while uniting Europe under the U.S.'
protection]{.underline}. The goal of this American grand strategy is to
prevent any single power from dominating the region and turning on the
United States and its allies. [American hegemony serves]{.underline},
too, [to quell previously intractable regional rivalries,
preventing]{.underline} further [world wars]{.underline}. Dean Acheson,
George Marshall and the other great statesmen of their generation
pursued this strategy because they had learned, at unimaginable cost,
that the eternal American fantasy of forever being free of
Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in other words---was just
that: a fantasy. Four hundred thousand American men lost their lives in
the European theaters of the First and Second World Wars. (American
fatalities in all of the other 20th-century conflicts---including
Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total one-quarter of that
number.) Our postwar statesmen were neither weak nor incompetent. They
were the architects of the greatest foreign policy triumph in U.S.
history. [So successful was this policy that Americans
now]{.underline}---most of whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of
these wars---[see peace, unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's
natural state]{.underline}. **[This is an illusion]{.underline}**. For
centuries, Europe was the fulcrum of global violence. With the age of
global exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of violence,
the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every century with
improvements in technology for violence. The Scramble for Africa, the
division and colonization of that continent by Europe, is a case in
point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, which assembled the
representatives of 13 European powers to settle their colonial claims to
Africa by diplomacy in place of arms, did lead to peace in Europe for
several years. Africans, however, would not recall these years for their
exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King Léopold
II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property. Ten
million Congolese souls perished under his ministrations. In recognizing
this history of blood, however, we must recognize something equally
true: In the wake of World War II, liberal democracy saw its fullest
realization in the West. This flourishing of peace and human rights
cannot be explained by a sudden outbreak of European pacifism. (Consider
the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an infuriated President Dwight
Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) It happened because
during World War II, Europe destroyed itself, leaving the United States
overwhelmingly powerful by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union.
Through the application of economic, diplomatic and military force
majeure, the United States suppressed Europe's internal security
competition. This is why postwar Europe ceased to be the world's leading
exporter of violence and became, instead, the world's leading exporter
of luxury sedans. [Only America, and massive power as the U.S. exercised
it, could have pacified and unified Europe]{.underline} under its aegis.
No other continental country possessed half the world's GDP. No other
country had enough distance from Europe to be trusted, to a large
extent, by all parties and indifferent to its regional jealousies. No
other country had a strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe that
its inhabitants could be persuaded gladly to share. Indeed, Europeans
cooperated with the U.S. program because it created conditions under
which both the United States and Europe flourished. The United States
assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13 billion of aid in
the form of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars, roughly \$113
billion.) It midwifed the groupings and treaties that would become the
European Union. It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella with
the NATO treaty. Article V of the treaty, its most important element,
declares that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all
members. These policies were intended not only to counter the Soviet
Union, but to condition Europe's prosperity upon its integration into a
single market, with free movement of goods, capital and labor. The
founders of these institutions fully intended them to be the foundations
of a United States of Europe, much like the United States of America.
Profound economic interdependence, they believed, would make further
European wars impossible. At the same time, [the United States built an
open, global order upon an architecture of specific
institutions]{.underline}: the United Nations, the International
Monetary Fund and the International Court of Justice. [This order is in
many respects an empire]{.underline}---a Pax Americana---[but it is more
humane than any empire that preceded it]{.underline}, with institutions
that are intended to benefit all parties. Postwar U.S. statesmen
believed that prosperous, [liberal democracies that traded
freely]{.underline} with each other would [neither go to war with each
other nor the United States]{.underline}. They ascribed, in other words,
to the so-called Democratic Peace theory---a theory with overwhelming
empirical support. The U.S. military was always an integral part of the
plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War II,
U.S. troops have been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot
be dominated by a single power capable of monopolizing its resources and
turning them against the U.S. The United States has built overwhelmingly
massive military assets there to deter local arms races before they
begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S. protection
that there is no need to begin local arms races, for their safety is
guaranteed. American grand strategy rests upon the credibility of its
promise to protect American allies; this credibility rests, in turn,
upon U.S. willingness to display its commitment. (The Berlin Airlift,
when U.S. troops airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade,
was precisely such a display.) In return for the United States'
commitment, U.S. allies have accepted America's dominant role in the
international system. In the postwar era, just as now, the enemies of
liberal democracy sought to undermine the order the U.S. was building.
Precisely because the Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West
under the United States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda
organs cranked into overdrive to denounce it. A cartoon, for example,
published in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's
administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on destroying the
sovereignty of European nations. The French paper L\'Humanité, which
reliably parroted Moscow's line, wrote, "After disorganizing the
national economies of the countries which are under the American yoke,
American leaders now intend conclusively to subjugate the economy of
these countries to their own interests." The Soviet Union's criticism of
the Marshall Plan and other American involvement in Europe was eerily
similar to the language Russia's now uses in its campaign to undermine
NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and tropes of Russian propaganda are
widely echoed, wittingly or unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and
other antiliberal politicians, parties and movements throughout the
West. With the men who built the postwar world order now in their
graves, and the memory of carnage and horror buried with them, a very
sizable constituency of Americans has forgotten that their country built
this system for a reason---that [the United States does not maintain its
alliances as an act of foolish largesse]{.underline}. The loudest
exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the European
Union was "created to destroy us," and that multilateral institutions
such as the World Trade Organization assault the "sovereignty" of the
nations concerned is, unfortunately, the president of the United States.
It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are.
[History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is
never so cooperative]{.underline}. [Global free trade sustains modern
economic life. An interruption to this trade]{.underline}---carried out
chiefly on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S.
military---[would bring modern life to an end]{.underline}. The Second
World War proved not only that isolationism and American-Firstism were
fantasies, but exceptionally childish and dangerous ones, at that. In
the age of hyperglobalized trade, international air travel, the
internet, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, these
fantasies are even more childish and dangerous. The U.S. may be on
another continent, but it is not on another planet. It is true that the
U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was always part of
the deal. The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight a war anywhere
in the world, invade any country at will, and (at least in theory) fight
multiple simultaneous major wars---even in space. Of course this costs
more. It is in America's advantage to be the only power on the planet
that can do this. Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage
for other countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do.
Europe is America's biggest export market, as designed. We want
Europeans to spend their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not
razing Flanders to the ground yet again. [Yet Trump's refusal
to]{.underline} deter our shared enemies and [protect our allies risks
provoking a regional European **arms race**]{.underline}---exactly what
the U.S. has sought to avoid for 74 years[. It is an invitation to
adventurism from Putin]{.underline}. Trump's refusal to adopt the
encouraging language of past presidents toward European integration,
language that until now has been transformed into policy by professional
and experienced State Department employees, puts further strain on an
already-weakened Europe. Above all, Trump's overt support for sordid,
Kremlin-backed actors who seek to undermine Europe's unity is
unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's interest, or in ours, for the
American president to lend the United States' prestige and support to
Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal Marxists, populists,
authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists, particularly since all of them
are ideologically hostile to the United States? The damage
[Trump]{.underline} has deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability
[comes at a uniquely dangerous time]{.underline}. Democracy's so-called
third wave---the global blossoming of open political systems after the
Cold War---has long since receded. [A threat to liberal
democracy]{.underline}, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology---illiberal democracy---[is ascendant]{.underline}. We see it
today in Russia and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and
hollow form of democracy that spreads and consolidates itself through
the new technologies of the 21st century. The global order the U.S.
built was based on the principle that [only a world of liberal
democracies can be peaceful and prosperous.]{.underline} That principle
is correct. [Should the unraveling of the order the U.S. built
proceed]{.underline} at this pace, [the world will soon be neither
peaceful nor prosperous]{.underline}. [Nor will the effects be confined
to regions distant from the United States. America will feel
them]{.underline} gradually, and then, probably, overnight---[in the
form of a devastating, sudden shock]{.underline}. Charles de Gaulle
believed the Anglophone world could not, in the long term, be trusted
with French security. It led him to withdraw France from NATO's military
integrated command and launch an independent nuclear development
program. The independent nuclear program was real, but the withdrawal
from NATO wasn't---a secret agreement kept France in NATO anyway. But,
today, with other NATO members obliged to consider the costs and
benefits of an independent accommodation with Russia and the risks and
rewards of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, de Gaulle is
saying from the grave, I told you so. [The American-led world
order]{.underline}, undergirded by the ideal of liberal democracy, has
been highly imperfect. But it [has been the closest thing to Utopia our
fallen and benighted species has ever seen. Its benefits are not just
economic, although those benefits are immense]{.underline}. [Its
benefits must be measured in wars not fought, lives not
squandered]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline} many [Americans have turned
their backs]{.underline} on history and reality alike. [Let us hope
pride does not prevent them from realizing this mistake before it's far
too late]{.underline}.

#### [Consensus]{.underline} goes aff\-\--NATO [eradicates]{.underline} war 

**Beauchamp 16** -- senior reporter at Vox, where he covers global
politics and ideology, citing multiple political science professors
(Zach, "Donald Trump needs to clarify his position on NATO before
something scary happens," *Vox*,
https://www.vox.com/2016/7/21/12247074/donald-trump-nato-war)

[Trump's comments about NATO are like an **arrow** pointed straight at
the **heart of the alliance** \-- and]{.underline}, if implemented,
[would directly threaten the foundations of global peace
itself]{.underline}. Any president could simply choose not to abide by
Article 5. But [abrogating NATO agreements was always deemed
**unthinkable** by both parties, which has played an important part in
maintaining credible deterrence vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline}. [Trump
has put the idea of the US **not defending NATO on the table**, in a
very real way]{.underline}. **[This threatens]{.underline}** the very
integrity **[of NATO itself]{.underline}**. [If NATO allies start to
think that the United States can't be trusted to defend them, that NATO
is just on paper, then they'll start to wonder why they bother to adhere
to this alliance]{.underline} in the first place. If Trump wins the
election, [this could cause them to exit the security agreement
altogether]{.underline}. According to the best available research,
**[this would make war on the European continent far more
likely]{.underline}**. [One study]{.underline}, from professors Jesse C.
Johnson and Brett Ashley Leeds, [surveyed about 200 years of data on
conflicts and concluded that \"defensive alliances lower the probability
of international conflict and]{.underline} are [thus]{.underline} a good
policy option for states seeking to [maintain peace in the
world]{.underline}.\" [Another study looked specifically at the period
from 1950 to 2000 and found that \"formal alliances]{.underline} with
nuclear states appear to [carry significant deterrence benefits.\" The
US\'s formal agreements]{.underline}, then, [deter aggression against
its non-nuclear partners (like Germany and the Baltics]{.underline}). In
their new book on American grand strategy, Dartmouth scholars Steven
[Brooks and]{.underline} William [Wohlforth]{.underline} also surveyed
research from regional experts and [found a similar
consensus]{.underline}. In Europe, they write, [\"most
assessments]{.underline} nonetheless [sum up to the conclusion that NATO
is a net security plus]{.underline}.\" [Trump, then, could end up
weakening one of America's most important security
agreements]{.underline} --- and may already have done so.

### Middle East Invasion Mod

#### US abdication of NATO responsibilities greenlights Russian invasion of the Middle East

**Shapiro 2019** - Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Institute for
National Security Studies in Tel Aviv Daniel, \"The Most Dangerous Thing
Trump Could Do Yet, and Its Nightmare Fallout for Israel,\" Jan 17,
<https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-trump-leaving-nato-a-nightmare-for-israel-netanyahu-1.6846949>

[Remove the United States from NATO]{.underline} - and forward-deployed
U.S. forces from Europe, which would certainly follow - [and the United
States' ability to respond to a Middle East]{.underline} crisis [would
be diminished.]{.underline}

Could U.S. support for Israel be shifted and coordinated instead through
U.S. Central Command, based in the Persian Gulf? It has been proposed
before as an efficiency measure. But Israeli generals have always
resisted the proposal. Their worry is that they would find it
challenging to enjoy the same level of intimacy they currently have with
Europe-based U.S. commanders, with commanders who maintain a similar
closeness with Arab militaries.

True, Israel is closer strategically today with the Arab Gulf states
than at any time in its history, because of a focus on the common threat
of Iran and the lower priority of the Palestinian issue. But those
relationships are a long way from being normalized - and could still
backslide.

Israeli security planners are, therefore, still most likely to want to
maintain separation between their relationships with the U.S. military
and with their Arab neighbors. Having observed the intense friendships
formed between Israeli military commanders and their U.S. counterparts
based in Europe, I can say that these ties will not be easily replaced.

The broader Middle East would also experience the effects of NATO's
demise in the form of further empowerment of Russia. That is happening
already, but losing NATO would turbocharge those trends.

Already, [Russia's brutally decisive intervention in Syria, combined
with successive U.S. administrations' preference to reduce active U.S.
military engagements in the region, have led many regional states to
explore expanded security ties with Russia]{.underline}.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets more frequently with
Putin than he does with Trump, and the IDF and Russian Air Force
deconflict their operations in Syria. The leaders of Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, all close partners of the United
States, have visited Moscow and explored acquiring advanced Russian
weapons systems in addition to their American-supplied arsenals.

[Should Russia decide to exert leverage, such as by constraining Israeli
freedom of action against Iranian military targets in Syria, the United
States would be ill-equipped to push back]{.underline}.

[A U.S. withdrawal from NATO would unmistakably be understood as a major
pullback]{.underline} from the United States's leadership in global
affairs. [The effect of expanding Russian influence would be
felt]{.underline} far [beyond Europe and the Middle East]{.underline}.

#### That makes WWIII inevitable 

**Hanson 2016** - classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution,
Stanford University\
Victor Davis, \"The return of appeasement, collaboration and
isolationism,\" Feb 18,
tribunecontentagency.com/article/the-return-of-appeasement-collaboration-and-isolationism/

By the start of the Great Depression in 1929, America was mostly unarmed
and determined never to get involved in European feuding again. Most
Americans complained that the huge death toll of World War I had led to
neither perpetual peace nor even a peaceful Germany. [America's
isolationism and disarmament also helped prompt another global war. Had
the U.S. kept its military strong after World War]{.underline} I, and
had it entered into a formal alliance with its former World War I
partners, [Germany never would have risked a second war]{.underline}
against the combined strength of a fully armed Britain, France and
United States. Instead, Hitler assumed the U.S. either could not or
would not offer much military help to his intended European targets.
Why, then, did a relatively weak Nazi Germany between 1939 and 1941
believe that it could take on much of the world, and inspire Axis
partners such as Italy and Japan to follow its suicidal lead? The answer
is obvious. British and French appeasement, Soviet collaboration and
American isolation had together convinced Hitler and his Axis allies
that the victors of World War I were more eager to grant concessions at
any cost than were the defeated. [The world of 2016 is eerily beginning
to resemble the powder keg of 1939 Europe. Iran, China and North Korea,
along with radical Islamic terrorist groups,]{.underline} all [have
particular contempt for Western democracies.]{.underline} Almost daily,
various aggressive nations or [organizations seek provocation by
shooting off intercontinental missiles, boarding American boats, sending
millions of young male Middle Easterners into the West, and issuing
unending threats]{.underline}. China is creating new artificial islands
to control commercial routes to and from Asia. The European Union is
largely unarmed. Yet it still trusts that it can use its vaunted \"smart
diplomacy\" to reason with its enemies. Meanwhile, Vladimir [Putin's
Russia cuts deals with Iran, Syria and most of the enemies of the
West.]{.underline} Like Stalin before, [Putin cynically assumes that his
triangulations will turn aggressive powers exclusively against the
West]{.underline}. Recently, [he warned the West of a \"new world war\"
starting in the Middle East. America is slowly withdrawing from
involvement abroad]{.underline}, using the same isolationist arguments
heard in the 1920s. Past interventions in the Middle East have worn on
the nation. Ingrate nations did not appreciate American sacrifices. In
tough economic times, some contend that defense spending should be
diverted to more social programs. [Appeasement, collaboration and
isolationism always prove a lethal mix --- past and
present]{.underline}.

### Multilat Key -- Diplomacy

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

Moreover, [in places where the U.S. military has maintained a long-term
presence]{.underline} (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Germany), [we see that
military interoperability enhances regions economically---directly
through commercial contracting and the resulting employment,
servicemember contributions through commerce, and in some cases,
contributions of military gear and equipment through foreign military
sales or otherwise]{.underline}. [The resulting "military diplomacy,"
also referred to as "defense diplomacy," "**soft power**," "military
public diplomacy," and "strategic communication," allows the military to
have a **direct impact** on foreign policy through other means. Although
not diplomacy in the traditional sense of a State Department mission,
**military relationships between countries build**]{.underline} a
foundation on which [**further connections** between

[Since military people know better than anyone the true cost of waging
war, the U.S. military has a **vested interest** in working to **build
capabilities and partnerships** to maintain **worldwide peace and
stability**. Although the lines between what are doctrinally military or
diplomatic missions may blur, it is to the advantage of both the State
Department and the military to capitalize on any opportunity to advance
the policy and security of the United States. The military, known as a
hard-power tool, can also be used as a soft-power one. Military members
serving overseas in any capacity are already often the forefront of
American diplomacy, moving their mission set beyond traditional
warfighting]{.underline} to an extended role in support of the National
Security Strategy of the United States, [with great
success]{.underline}. The fact that China is increasingly involved in
regions like Africa and Latin America---giving Beijing influence
there---is further reason for the United States to take a more active
approach and mitigate vulnerabilities. [China has learned from our
greatest strategic achievement, the Marshall Plan, and has formulated a
long-term strategy to, among other things, **undermine U.S. influence**.
We need a coordinated, long-term plan **of military

### Restraint Fails

#### Restraint will fail -- the US needs to wield its power for good. 

**Brands \'22** - The Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies \[Hal,
Jun1, \"The World Doesn't Need a More Restrained
America,\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-world-doesnt-need-a-more-restrained-america/\]

It has been a bumpy year for the restraint coalition --- that loose
network of analysts, advocates and politicians calling for a sharply
reduced US role in the world. Having reached peak influence with the
withdrawal from Afghanistan, this group initially found itself
marginalized by Russia's war in Ukraine. Now, the restraint crowd is
offering a renewed critique of US policy, one that will probably prove
to be persistent, though not persuasive.

Restraint is a broad church. It features anti-interventionist academics,
who often style themselves as non-ideological "realists," alongside
well-funded think tanks such as the Quincy Institute. It includes
libertarians such as Senator Rand Paul who deplore the financial costs
of US foreign policy and progressives who contend that American
globalism is a cover for imperialism and neoliberalism. There are
pacifists who believe that all wars are criminal, as well as
nationalists such as Senator Josh Hawley who argue that being
appropriately hawkish on China requires being more dovish on nearly
everything else.

[Some restrainers seek wholesale global retrenchment; others mainly
decry ongoing US involvement]{.underline} in Europe and the Middle East.
[What unites them is a conviction that the overuse of US power has been
catastrophic for America and the world]{.underline}.

This coalition seemed ascendant a year ago, when President Joe Biden
denounced the "forever wars" while pulling out of Afghanistan. That
decision, two analysts argued, marked Biden as a hard-nosed realist ---
and perhaps an ally in the struggle to reshape American diplomacy.

Yet the moment didn't last. [The collapse of the Afghan state even
before the US finished withdrawing showed that, while waging wars is
expensive, losing them can impose a serious cost. Then came Russia's
assault on Ukraine]{.underline}. As Vladimir [Putin's forces sought to
restore the Soviet empire and murdered Ukrainian citizens]{.underline},
they revealed just how awful a world shaped by great powers other than
Washington might be.

Indeed, Biden isn't getting much praise from self-proclaimed realists
today. While refusing to intervene militarily, Biden has otherwise
backed Ukraine with money, weapons and other support. NATO --- whose
peaceful expansion allegedly forced Putin to order a campaign of
aggression and murder --- now appears likely to add two new members,
Finland and Sweden. [Biden has even invoked the rhetorical legacy of his
cold war predecessors, declaring that Ukraine is a vital front in the
struggle to save the free world]{.underline}.

In response, [the restraint coalition has itself opened a new front,
finding multiple reasons to attack Biden's Ukraine policy]{.underline}.

First is cost. [Sustaining a medium-sized country under a ferocious
military assault is fantastically expensive]{.underline}. The latest US
support package for Ukraine totals some \$40 billion --- money, Hawley
complained, that could be better spent on giving US military personnel a
generous raise. Some Republicans in Congress seem to agree --- 57
representatives and 11 senators voted, unsuccessfully, against the aid
package.

Second is risk. [No one knows how the war in Ukraine will end. If the US
helps Ukraine defend itself too successfully]{.underline}, the thinking
goes[, then perhaps a humiliated Russia will escalate wildly rather than
accept defeat.]{.underline}

Finally, there is politics. With Biden having gone all-in on Ukraine,
there's little space for the restraint contingent on the left. But
Hawley and other Republicans seeking to inherit Donald Trump's political
base clearly believe that there is a constituency for claims that
supporting a vulnerable democracy equates to putting "America last."

It is uncharitable to label such arguments "pro-Putin." Forty billion
dollars is real money, given that the Pentagon is struggling to find a
10th of that for urgent near-term improvements to America's military
posture in the Pacific. There is, undoubtedly, danger in a scenario
where Putin worries that he is losing the war --- and in consequence
loses his head.

[But the perpetual problem with restraint is the corresponding
unwillingness to consider what happens after America pulls
back]{.underline}. [Suppose Washington does slash support to Ukraine and
leave European security to the Europeans. What does that
bring]{.underline}?

Judging by the past century --- or even the past six months --- [the
answer is not a stable Europe and a more solvent America.]{.underline}
Rather, [the result is likely to be a partially successful Russian war
of conquest that creates pervasive insecurity in Europe]{.underline}; a
continent that, [lacking American leadership, is less united and
confident in opposing Putin; and greater global instability that
ultimately makes it harder to contain China]{.underline}, as well.

[Similarly in the Middle East, reasonable people can debate the proper
level of U.S. involvement,]{.underline} or what constitutes a reasonable
risk to accept on a variety of issues, from containing Iran to opposing
Putin's ambitions in Ukraine. But [recent events have reminded us that a
world less influenced by the US will be one in which autocratic
predation becomes more common]{.underline}. The Ukraine [war has
reminded the world about the stubborn persistence of evil.]{.underline}
In doing so, [it has also illuminated the virtues of American
power]{.underline}.

### Multilat Key -- Biotech

#### A coordinated framework is necessary to check the dual-use aspects of biotech.

Threats of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology*, pp 13--36\]

Biosecurity threats include biological weapons and accidental releases
as demonstrated in the Sverdlovsk anthrax event, but they have also
become more diversified and complicated as researchers develop and
utilize advanced biotechnology techniques for the betterment of society
across other sectors. [Gene drives for mosquito population control,
engineered algae for biofuel creation, and recreation of extinct
pathogens for novel vaccine development have unique and potentially
unknown associated risks]{.underline}. [The envisioned coordinated
biosecurity framework would allow for beneficial innovation to
proliferate while simultaneously reducing anticipated and unanticipated
risk of harm to humans, animals, agricultural, and the
environment]{.underline} (Trump et al. 2020b; Wells et al. 2020).

### Sustainability

#### Spreading capitalism creates [global prosperity]{.underline} and [environmental sustainability]{.underline}. Abandoning it is [disastrous]{.underline}.

**Rhonheimer, 20**---teaching professor at the Pontifical University of
the Holy Cross (Martin, "Capitalism is Good for the Poor -- and for the
Environment,"
<https://austrian-institute.org/en/subjects-en/catholic-social-doctrine-2/capitalism-is-good-for-the-poor-and-for-the-environment/>,
dml)

[It is **not social policy** but **capitalism** that has **created
today's prosperity**]{.underline}.

What is important is that [what **made today's mass prosperity
possible** -- a phenomenon **unprecedented in history** --
was]{.underline} not social policy or social legislation, organised
trade union pressure, or corrective interventions in the capitalist
economy, but rather [**market capitalism** itself, due to its **enormous
potential for innovation** and the **ever-increasing productivity** of
human labour that resulted from it.]{.underline}

[Increasing prosperity and quality of life are **always the result** of
increasing labour productivity. **Only increased productivity** enabled
**higher social standards**, **better working conditions**, the
**overcoming of child labour**, a **higher level of education**, and the
**emergence of human capital**. This process]{.underline} of increasing
triumph over poverty and the constantly rising living standards of the
general masses [is taking place on a **global scale** -- but **only**
where the **market economy** and **capitalist entrepreneurship are able
to spread**]{.underline}.

From industrial overexploitation of nature to ecological awareness

[The **first phase** of]{.underline} industrialisation and [capitalism
was characterised by]{.underline} an enormous
**[consumption]{.underline}** of resources [and]{.underline} frequent
**[overexploitation]{.underline}** of nature, [which]{.underline} soon
[**gave the impression** that this process **could not be
sustainable**]{.underline}. Since the end of the 19th century,
[**disaster** and **doom** scenarios have **repeatedly been put
forward**, but]{.underline} in retrospect they [have **proved to be
wrong**: The combination of **technological innovation**, **market
competition**, and **entrepreneurial profit-seeking** (with the
compulsion to **constantly minimise costs**) have meant that these
scenarios **never occurred**. The **ever-increasing population** has
been **increasingly better supplied** thanks to **innovative
technologies**, **ever-increasing output** with **lower consumption** of
resources **less harmful** to the environment]{.underline} -- e.g.
[**less arable land** in agriculture, or **oil** and **electricity**
instead of **coal**]{.underline} for rapidly increasing mobility. [More
recent disaster scenarios]{.underline}, such as those [spread by
**reputable scientists**]{.underline} since the late 1960s and in the
1970s, [have also proved to be **inaccurate**]{.underline}.

[The **reason** things developed differently was the **always
underestimated innovative dynamism** of the **capitalist market
economy**, a **growing ecological awareness** and]{.underline}, as a
result, [legislative intervention that **took advantage** of the logic
of market capitalism]{.underline}: As a result of the ecological
movement that had come out of the United States since 1970, wise
legislation began to use the price mechanism to apply market incentives
to internalize negative externalities. [Environmental pollution was
**given a price-tag**]{.underline}.

[This led to an **enormous decrease in air pollution** and **other
ecological consequences** of growth, which is **only possible in free**,
**market-based societies**, because the production process here is
characterized by **competition** and **constant pressure to reduce
costs**]{.underline}, i.e. [to the **most profitable use** of
resources]{.underline}. On the other hand, **[all forms of
socialism]{.underline}**, i.e. a state-controlled economy, [have proved
to be **ecological disasters** and have left behind **destruction of
gigantic proportions**, without providing the population with
**anything** that is **near comparable in prosperity**, often even by
**destroying existing prosperity**, such as happened in
**Venezuela**]{.underline}.

Capitalist profit motive combined with digitalization as a solution:
Increasing decoupling of growth and resource consumption

Moreover, [**technological innovations** combined with **capitalist
profit-seeking** and **market competition** have led to a new and
surprising phenomenon]{.underline} over the past decades, [which is
still **hardly noticed**]{.underline} in the public debate: [the
**decoupling** of growth and resource consumption]{.underline}
("**[dematerialization]{.underline}**"). [In a **wide variety** of
industrial sectors, the developed countries]{.underline}, above all the
U.S., [are now achieving **ever greater productive output** with
**increasingly fewer resources**]{.underline}. This has a lot to do with
technology, especially the digitalization of the economy and of our
entire lives.

As the well-known MIT professor Andrew McAfee shows in his book More
from Less, published in October 2019, [this]{.underline} process also
[follows the logic of **capitalist profit maximization**]{.underline}.
To get it going, we do not need politics, even though wise, properly
incentivizing legislation can be helpful and sometimes necessary. Above
all, however, it is [the **combination of technological innovation**,
**capitalist profit-seeking**, and **market-based entrepreneurial
competition**]{.underline} that [will]{.underline} also
**[solve]{.underline}** the problem of man-made **[global
warming]{.underline}**.

In addition, [**property rights** and their protection are **decisive**
for the **careful use of natural resources**]{.underline}. And where
this is not possible, legal support for collective self-governing
structures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, are
important---as is analysed by Nobel Economic Prize winner Elinor Ostrom.
By contrast, the growing ideologically motivated [**anti-capitalist
eco-activism**, and the policies influenced by it, are leading in the
**wrong direction**, **distracting precisely** from what would be **best
for the climate** and the **environment**---and **distracting us** from
what could **help protect us** against the **inevitable consequences of
global warming**]{.underline}.

#### Innovation and growth are good -- any less capitalist or less growth-oriented model wrecks it, which impoverishes society and ensures violent conflict 

**Tudoreanu '20** \[Mihnea; 9/23/20; doctoral candidate in economics at
the University of Massachusetts Amherst; David M. Kotz; professor
emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst;
\"Stable Jobs or iPhones? The Dilemma of Innovation in Socialism,\"
Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 52, Vol. 4, p. 642-649\]

**Note: DPS = Democratically Planned Socialism**

[One]{.underline} of the [advantage]{.underline}s [for innovation in DPS
is]{.underline} that [it can]{.underline} effectively [take into account
social and environmental costs,]{.underline} including the jobs lost or
disrupted by the introduction of a new technology.8 [But this can also
be **problematic**, in that it is likely to make **innovation slower**
in **socialism** than in **capitalism**. Democratic majorities are **not
immune** to]{.underline} some of [the **same factors** that caused
**Soviet managers** to be technologically conservative]{.underline}.

On the one hand, DPS should not suffer from taut planning, unrealistic
plan targets imposed from the top down, or an incentive structure that
discourages risk-taking by trying out new technologies. But on the other
hand, [innovation is **always disruptive** in **any** kind of **economic
system**. As old technologies are **superseded**, product lines become
**obsolete** and production processes are changed, and as a result
certain]{.underline} kinds of [jobs are **no longer needed**. Even
with]{.underline} an [employment guarantee, the loss of one's job may
have to involve **retraining**, **changing careers**, or
**moving**]{.underline} across the country. So, [it is reasonable to
expect]{.underline} that [workers will **resist new
technologies**]{.underline}.9 Yet at the same time, in their capacity as
consumers, they will demand new and better products.

[This is]{.underline} the "[Stable jobs or iPhones?" dilemma. We can
prioritize]{.underline} cutting-edge [consumer products, or]{.underline}
we can prioritize [stable employment, but]{.underline} perhaps **[not
both]{.underline}**.10 In DPS, the people will be able to decide between
one and the other, on a case-by-case basis, so that [some
innovations]{.underline} will be pursued, others [will be scrapped
because of their **disruptive effects**, and some]{.underline} will be
[introduced at a **deliberately slow pace**. Meanwhile, capitalism
always comes down in favor]{.underline} of the iPhones despite the
conflict with stable jobs. [Since socialism will not]{.underline} always
do this, [it is likely that socialism will have]{.underline} more job
security but [fewer **cutting-edge**]{.underline} consumer [products
than capitalism]{.underline}.

[If there is]{.underline} an [**international rivalry** between
**socialism** and **capitalism**, the citizens of the two]{.underline}
kinds of [societies will]{.underline} be able to [compare their
lifestyles]{.underline} with those in the other economic system. Workers
living under capitalism may be attracted by the stable jobs, shorter
working hours, democratic workplaces, and social benefits provided by
socialism. However, [those]{.underline} living [under socialism will
likely also be **attracted** by the **rapid introduction** of
new]{.underline} consumer [goods under capitalism]{.underline}.
Moreover, [as long as the **speed of innovation** in socialism is
**lower**]{.underline} than that in capitalism, [the "**consumer gap**"
with capitalism would **grow**]{.underline} over time.

This may not be considered a problem for socialism if most of the
population value stable jobs more than iPhones, but there would likely
be a minority who do not. If the consumer gap is large enough, and/or
that dissenting minority has an overriding preference for new consumer
goods, then [we have a category of people with a **material interest**
in **supporting capitalism**, which values a **new
technology**]{.underline} over job stability, [even though they are part
of the working class]{.underline}.

[A common response to]{.underline} the [flaws of Soviet socialism has
been]{.underline} to [propose **other models of socialism** that would
not have those **flaws**. But the **trade-off** between **job security**
and **innovation** is not one that can be **easily eliminated** within
socialism. It is not due to]{.underline} the [overly centralized or
undemocratic nature of Soviet socialism]{.underline}.

Furthermore, there is **[a]{.underline}** [military]{.underline} aspect
to the [innovation]{.underline} problem. Innovations that aid the
military are also likely to have a disruptive effect on employment, as
in the case of consumer-oriented innovations. This is a problem because
it might [put DPS at a **military disadvantage** with respect to
capitalism, which would **hurt** the **socialist side** in
**international relations** even if no military conflict takes place. If
one side knows it would **lose any war**]{.underline} that did take
place, then [that side will **act timidly** and avoid even nonviolent
confrontation]{.underline}, so as [to **avoid provoking** the other
side]{.underline} into war. [For both sides to stand]{.underline} a
[good chance of success in a peaceful rivalry, they must be]{.underline}
more or less [evenly matched]{.underline} militarily, [so that neither
feels that it can do whatever it wants with impunity]{.underline} or
that it must tread lightly to avoid confrontation.

[The Cold War was]{.underline} a [multifaceted struggle]{.underline}
between two different systems. [Any future socialist economic order will
most likely face capitalism in a]{.underline} somewhat [similar
struggle]{.underline}. Can such a struggle be won by socialism without
matching capitalism's rate of technological development? That is the
question.

### Cap S War

#### The spread of capitalism causes [world peace]{.underline}!

**Mousseau, 19**---Professor in the School of Politics, Security, and
International Affairs at the University of Central Florida (Michael,
"The End of War: How a Robust Marketplace and Liberal Hegemony Are
Leading to Perpetual World Peace," International Security, Volume 44,
Issue 1, Summer 2019, p.160-196, dml)

Is war becoming obsolete? [There is **wide agreement** among scholars
that war has been in **sharp decline** since]{.underline} the defeat of
the Axis powers in [1945]{.underline}, even as there is little agreement
as to its cause.1 [Realists **reject** the idea that this trend will
continue, citing]{.underline} states\' concerns with [the "**security
dilemma**"]{.underline}: that is, in anarchy states must assume that any
state that can attack will; therefore, power equals threat, and changes
in relative power result in conflict and war.2 Discussing the rise of
China, Graham Allison calls this condition "Thucydides\'s Trap," a
reference to the ancient Greek\'s claim that Sparta\'s fear of Athens\'
growing power led to the Peloponnesian War.3

This article argues that **[there is no Thucydides Trap]{.underline}**
in international politics. [Rather, the world is **moving rapidly toward
permanent peace**, **possibly in our lifetime**]{.underline}. Drawing on
economic norms theory,4 I show that [what sometimes appears to be a
Thucydides Trap may instead be a function of factors **strictly
internal** to states and that these factors **vary** among
them]{.underline}. In brief, [leaders of states with advanced
market-oriented economies have **foremost interests** in the principle
of **self-determination** for all states, large and small, as the
foundation for a **robust global marketplace**. **War** among these
states, **even making preparations** for war, is **not possible**,
because they are in a **natural alliance to preserve** and **protect the
global order**]{.underline}. In contrast, [leaders of states with **weak
internal markets** have **little interest** in the global marketplace;
they pursue wealth **not through commerce**, but through **wars of
expansion** and **demands for tribute**]{.underline}. For these states,
power equals threat, and therefore they tend to balance against the
power of all states. [Fearing stronger states, however, minor powers
with weak internal markets tend to **constrain their expansionist
inclinations** and, for security reasons, **bandwagon** with the
**relatively benign market-oriented powers**]{.underline}.

I argue that [this liberal global hierarchy is **unwittingly** but
**systematically buttressing states\' embrace of market norms** and
**values** that, if **left uninterrupted**, is likely to culminate in
**permanent world peace**, perhaps even]{.underline} something close to
[**harmony**. My argument **challenges the realist assertion** that
great powers are engaged in a **timeless competition** over global
leadership]{.underline}, because hegemony cannot exist among great
powers with weak markets; these inherently expansionist states live in
constant fear and therefore normally balance against the strongest state
and its allies.5 [Hegemony can exist **only among market-oriented
powers**, because only they care about global order. Yet, there can be
**no competition for leadership** among market powers, because they
**always agree** with the goal of their strongest member]{.underline}
(currently the United States) [to **preserve** and **protect the global
order** based on the principle of self-determination. If another
commercial power, such as a rising China, were to **overtake the United
States**, the world would take **little notice**, because the new
leading power would **largely agree** with the global rules promoted and
enforced by its predecessor]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin\'s Russia, on
the other hand, seeks to create chaos around the world. Most other
powers, having market-oriented economies, continue to abide by the
hegemony of the United States despite its relative economic decline
since the end of World War II.6

To support my theory that domestic factors determine states\' alignment
decisions, I analyze the voting preferences of members of the United
Nations General Assembly from 1946 to 2010. I find that [states with
weak internal markets tend to **disagree** with the foreign policy
preferences of the largest market power]{.underline} (i.e., the United
States), [but more so if they are major powers or have stronger rather
than weaker military and economic capabilities. The power of states with
**robust internal markets**, in contrast, appears to have **no effect**
on their foreign policy preferences, as market-oriented states align
with the market leader **regardless of their power status** or
**capabilities**]{.underline}. I corroborate that [this pattern may be a
**consequence of states\' interest** in the **global market order** by
finding that states with **higher levels of exports** per capita are
**more likely**]{.underline} than other states to have preferences
**[aligned]{.underline}** with those of the United States; [those with
**lower levels** of exports are **more likely** to]{.underline} have
interests that do **[not align]{.underline}** with the United States,
but again more so if they are stronger rather than weaker.

Liberal [scholars]{.underline} of international politics
[have]{.underline} long offered explanations for why the incidence of
war may decline, generally beginning with [the assumption that although
the security dilemma **exists**, it can be **overcome** with the help of
factors external to states]{.underline}.7 Neoliberal institutionalists
treat states as like units and international organization as an external
condition.8 [Trade interdependence is **dyadic** and thus an **external
condition**]{.underline}.9 Democracy is an internal factor, but theories
of democratic peace have an external dimension: peace is the result of
the expectations of states\' behavior informed by the images that
leaders create of each other\'s regime types.10 In contrast, I show that
[the security dilemma **may not exist at all**]{.underline} and how
[peace can **emerge in anarchy** with states pursuing their interests
**determined entirely by internal factors**]{.underline}.11

### Cap S Biotech

#### Capital is [crucial]{.underline} for biotechnology -- solves a laundry list of impacts

**Chris Edwards '21, Director of Tax Policy Studies and Editor,
Down​siz​ing​Gov​ern​ment​.org, "The Triumph of Biotechnology and Private
Capital", CATO, 9/24/21,
https://www.cato.org/commentary/triumph-biotechnology-private-capital**

[People often claim that capitalism focuses only on short-term
profits]{.underline}. [But the venture capitalists and angel investors
who fund firms such as Moderna and BioNTech are hugely patient, and they
lose money on most of their investments]{.underline}. Typically, their
model rests on the calculation that a small percentage of their
investments will generate a sufficiently high return on going public or
being sold to both "pay" for those that --- as will often be the case in
a very tricky sector --- lose money (or make very little) and make the
sort of good money that they and their clients are expecting when
putting together an investment portfolio.

[In biotechnology and other leading-edge industries, after-tax investor
gains are often reinvested in the next round of risky startups, thus
creating a virtuous cycle]{.underline}. [If the government had taxed
away the Struengmanns' capital gains from selling Hexal, they might not
have had the cash or incentive to invest in BioNTech]{.underline}.
**[One of the reason that nearly all high-income countries keep
capital-gains taxes low is to help ensure that investors and
entrepreneurs are incentivized to take the risk of committing time and
resources to ventures that can offer no promise of a good
return]{.underline}**, the sort of ventures, in other words, **[so
typical of ventures relying on scientific and technical
innovation]{.underline}**. Those who take high risks should be rewarded,
if that risk works out, with high rewards.

Unfortunately, that logic eludes President Biden and congressional
Democrats. They not only would like to raise capital-gains-tax rates,
but some of them would also like to broaden the capital-gains-tax base,
including by taxing gains before they are realized. If applied to
startup investing, that could do terrible damage to the ability of early
stage companies to secure the patient capital that they need. Punishing
capital gains makes no sense if we want investors and entrepreneurs to
pursue valuable but risky growth opportunities.

[Some cynics are griping about the big profits that Moderna and BioNTech
are now making, but investors in those firms absorbed losses for a
decade]{.underline}. [Besides, there is no better place for profits to
flow right now than to biotech firms and their research]{.underline}.
[BioNTech announced that it will build on its mRNA advances to develop
shots against malaria and tuberculosis, which together kill more than a
million people a year. And numerous biotech firms are now aiming to
create more effective influenza vaccines based on mRNA
technologies]{.underline}.

One of the key moments in the development of the biotech sector as we
know it today was the launch of Genentech in 1976, backed by
venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins. The success of that pioneering
firm "gave credence to the view that scientific research, infused with
start-up firm spunk, could be a critical component of economic growth,"
noted a history of the industry by Walter Powell and Kurt Sandholtz.

[To undermine an approach that has worked so well, and delivered so
much, by raising capital gains makes no economic sense]{.underline}.
[Worse still, as we consider the lives saved or improved by companies in
biotechnology and other innovative sectors, companies that relied on
private risk capital, it may well come at considerable human cost,
too]{.underline}.

#### Stable regs key to pharma innovation.

Needless to say, [no one involved in U.S. patent law or policy wants the
pandemic or its multi-faceted consequences]{.underline}. [Nor would a
contrary ruling in Athena, supra, have meant that an innovator would
have had at the ready the desired diagnostic testing for
coronaviru]{.underline}s. Nor a ready-made or known treatment, cure or
vaccine. That said, the famous Burkean wisdom of course applies here. To
paraphrase, "evil" or horrendous things can prevail if good people stand
by and do nothing---and allowing bad precedents to go uncorrected has
consequences. Unfortunately, [we are seeing those consequences play out
with U.S. **patent law in real time**]{.underline}. For nearly 15 years,
[the [Supreme Court's]{.mark} IP [opinions]{.mark} that have had the
effect of [de-valuing]{.mark} U.S. [patent rights,]{.mark} making
it]{.underline} increasingly [difficult]{.underline} (for example) [for
U.S. intellectual-property owners to obtain injunctive relief against
those who infringe,]{.underline} trespass on, [or]{.underline} otherwise
[steal their patented ideas and property rights.]{.underline} See, e.g.,
eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). (By contrast,
the patent laws of China have made such injunctive relief available as a
matter of course, with some reporting that prevailing patentees there
obtain injunctions for nearly 90% of all requests.) And through the
years, whether by Supreme Court precedent or other law-making[, it has
become [**increasingly easy to** invalidate]{.mark} U.S.
[patents]{.mark}]{.underline}, see, e.g., KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex,
Inc., 550 US 398, 415 (2007), and to render the subject matter of a
patent ineligible for protection under §101. (We do not tackle here the
separate pitfalls created by the 2011 America Invents Act.) [This
includes ineligibility not just for diagnostic testing, but for
software, business methods, and quite possibly anything else in a patent
claim that can be subjectively deemed]{.underline} "directed to" [an
"abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomena]{.underline}"; and
doesn't reflect an "inventive concept," per the Supreme Court's
Mayo-Alice "framework" for Section101. To be sure, this is not an
article focused on Supreme Court Section101 precedent and the harms to
innovation that it has wrought, though that has certainly played a major
or even primary role in the harm to U.S. innovation. (And indeed, the
proper analysis of that Section 101 precedent is a subject that warrants
separate, in-depth treatment.) The larger point here is that, [given the
[expanding uncertainty]{.mark} with the case law on U.S.
patents---]{.underline}and whether, for example, they'll protect the
subject matter of a million- (or even billion-) dollar
investment---[**U.S. [investment in R&D has
dropped]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And perhaps most notably[, it has
dropped [among innovative bio-pharmaceutical
companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. See, e.g., [Unpredictability in Patent
Law and Its Effect on Pharmaceutical Innovation,]{.underline} by

it.]{.underline} See, e.g., id. (explaining that the "[high level of

#### Pharma industry solves disease spread.

**Sachs 14** --- Jeffrey D. Sachs, professor of sustainable development,
health policy, and management at Columbia University, director of the
Earth Institute at Columbia University, special adviser to the UN
Secretary-General on Millennium Development Goals, 8-18-2014 ("Important
lessons from Ebola outbreak", *Business World Online*,
http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Opinion&title=important-lessons-from-ebola-outbreak&id=92924)

[Ebola]{.underline} is the latest of many recent epidemics, also
including [AIDS, SARS, H1N1]{.underline} flu, [H7N9]{.underline} flu,
[and others]{.underline}. AIDS is the deadliest of these killers,
claiming nearly 36 million lives since 1981. Of course, [even larger and
more sudden [epidemics are possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the
1918 influenza during World War I, which claimed 50-100 million lives
(far more than the war itself). And, [though the 2003 SARS outbreak was
contained]{.underline}, causing fewer than 1,000 deaths, [the disease
was on the verge of deeply disrupting several East Asian economies
including China's]{.underline}. [There are four crucial facts to
understand]{.underline} about Ebola and the other epidemics. First,
[most emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses]{.underline}, meaning
that [they [start in animal populations]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometimes
[with a genetic mutation that enables the jump to humans]{.underline}.
Ebola may have been transmitted from bats; HIV/AIDS emerged from
chimpanzees; SARS most likely came from civets traded in animal markets
in southern China; and influenza strains such as H1N1 and H7N9 arose
from genetic re-combinations of viruses among wild and farm animals.
[New zoonotic [diseases are inevitable]{.mark} as humanity pushes into
new ecosystems]{.underline} (such as formerly remote forest regions);
[the food industry creates more conditions for genetic recombination;
and climate change scrambles natural habitats and species
interactions]{.underline}. Second, [once a new infectious disease
appears, its [spread through airlines, ships, megacities, and
trade]{.mark} in animal products is likely to be extremely
rapid]{.underline}. These [epidemic diseases are new markers of
globalization, revealing]{.underline} through their chain of death [how
vulnerable the world has become from the pervasive movement of people
and goods]{.underline}. Third, [the poor are the first to suffer and the
worst affected]{.underline}. The rural poor live closest to the infected
animals that first transmit the disease. They often hunt and eat
bushmeat, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Poor, often illiterate,
individuals are generally unaware of how infectious diseases \--
especially unfamiliar diseases \-- are transmitted, making them much
more likely to become infected and to infect others. Moreover, given
poor nutrition and lack of access to basic health services, their
weakened immune systems are easily overcome by infections that better
nourished and treated individuals can survive. And "de-medicalized"
conditions \-- with few if any professional health workers to ensure an
appropriate public-health response to an epidemic (such as isolation of
infected individuals, tracing of contacts, surveillance, and so forth)
\-- make initial outbreaks more severe. Finally, [the [required medical
responses]{.mark}, including diagnostic tools and effective medications
and vaccines, inevitably [lag behind]{.mark} the [emerging
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}. In any event, [such tools must be
continually replenished. [This requires cutting-edge
biotech]{.mark}nology, immunology, and]{.underline} ultimately
[bioengineering [to create large-scale]{.mark} industrial
[responses]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as millions of doses of vaccines
or medicines in the case of large epidemics).

### Perm

#### The perms solve best -- restructuring capitalism is possible

**Mazzucato '21** \[Mariana; Jan 28; Professor in the Economics of
Innovation and Public Value at University College London where she is
the founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public
Purpose; "Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism," p.
204-10\]

This book has applied what I believe is the immensely powerful idea of a
mission to solving the 'wicked' problems we face today. In it, I have
argued that [tackling grand challenges will only happen if we reimagine
**government as a prerequisite for restructuring capitalism** in a way
that is inclusive, sustainable and **driven by
innovation**.]{.underline}

First and foremost, this means reinventing government for the
twenty-first century -- equipping it with the tools, organization and
culture it needs to drive a mission-oriented approach. It also means
bringing purpose to the core of corporate governance and taking a very
broad stakeholder position across the economy. It means changing the
relationship between public and private sectors, and between them and
civil society, so they all work symbiotically for a common goal. The
reason for the emphasis on rethinking government is simple: **[only
government has the capacity to bring about transform]{.underline}**ation
**[on the scale needed.]{.underline}** The relationship between economic
actors and civil society shows our problems at their most profound, and
this is what we must unravel.

[We can start by recognizing that capitalist markets are an outcome of
how each actor in the system is organized and governed, and how the
different actors relate to one another]{.underline}. This holds for the
private and public sectors and for other sectors such as non-profits.
**[No particular kind of market behaviour is inevitable]{.underline}**.
[For example, the market pressure often cited as forcing a business to
neglect the long term in favour of the short term, as too many companies
do today, is the product of a particular organization of the
market]{.underline}. **[Nor is there anything inevitable in government
bureaucracies]{.underline}** [being too slow to react to challenges such
as digital platforms and climate change.]{.underline} Rather, [both are
outcomes of agency, actions and **governance** structures that are
chosen inside organizations, as well as the legal and institutional
relationships between them. It is all down to design within and between
organizations.]{.underline}

Capitalism is, indeed, in crisis. But the good news is that we can do
better. We know from the past that public and private actors can come
together to do extraordinary things. I have reflected on how, fifty
years ago, going to the moon and back required public and private actors
to invest, to innovate and to collaborate night and day for a common
purpose. Imagine if that [collaborative purpose]{.underline} today was
to [build a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism: green production
and consumption]{.underline}, [less inequality]{.underline}, greater
personal fulfilment, **[resilient health care]{.underline}** and healthy
ageing, sustainable mobility and digital access for all. But small,
incremental changes will not get us to those outcomes. We must have the
courage and conviction to lift our gaze higher -- to lead transformative
change that is as imaginative as it is ambitious, aiming for something
far more ambitious than sending a man to the moon.

To do this successfully, [governments need to invest in their internal
capabilities -- building the competence and confidenc]{.underline}e to
think boldly, partner with business and civil society, catalyse new
forms of collaboration across sectors, and [deploy instruments that
reward actors willing to engage with the difficulties]{.underline}. The
task is neither to pick winners nor to give unconditional handouts,
subsidies and guarantees, but to pick the willing. And missions are
about making markets, not only fixing them. They're about imagining new
areas of exploration. They're about [**taking risks**, not only
'de-risking']{.underline}. And if this means making mistakes along the
way, so be it. Learning through trial and error is critical for any
value-creation exercise. [Ambitious missions also have the courage to
tilt the playing field.]{.underline}

If [government]{.underline} is indeed a value creator that is driven by
public purpose, its [policies should reflect and reinforce]{.underline}
that. Too many green policies today are just minor adjustments to a
trajectory that still favours the old waste-prone behaviours and the
financial casino that worsens inequality. [A healthy economy that works
for the whole of society must tilt the playing field consistently to
reward behaviours that help us achieve agreed and desirable
goals.]{.underline} That means achieving [coherence in a **multiplicity
of fields**]{.underline}, from **[taxes]{.underline}** to
**[regulation]{.underline}**, from **[business law]{.underline}** to the
**[social safety net]{.underline}**.

As emphasized throughout the book, [it is key to not pretend that social
missions are the same as technological ones]{.underline}. With
challenges that are more 'wicked' it is essential that moonshot thinking
is linked with support to underlying government systems. For example, a
[moonshot around]{.underline} disease testing or **[health
priorities]{.underline}** [must interact closely with the public-health
system, not **replace** or **circumvent** it]{.underline}. Similarly, a
moonshot around [clean growth]{.underline} must [interact with transport
systems and planning authorities and understand behavioural
change]{.underline}. Thus it is [critical to]{.underline} perceive
missions not as siloed projects but as being intersectoral, bottom-up,
and [building on existing]{.underline} systems (such as **[innovation
systems]{.underline}**, among others).

Governments cannot pursue missions alone. They must work alongside
purpose-driven businesses to achieve them. As I've argued in this book,
this requires addressing one of the biggest [dilemmas of modern
capitalism]{.underline}: **[restructuring business]{.underline}** [so
that private profits are reinvested back into the economy rather than
being used for short-term financialized purposes]{.underline}. Missions
can accelerate this shift by shaping expectations about where business
opportunities lie and also getting a better return for public
investment. In this sense they can begin to walk the talk of stakeholder
value. This means creating a more symbiotic form of partnership and
collaboration in different sectors, whether in health, energy or digital
platforms. A market-shaping perspective requires governing these
interactions so that intellectual property rights, data privacy, pricing
of essential medicines and taxation all reflect what needs to happen to
reach the common objective. [In health that must mean health innovation
driven by the mission of better health care for all; in energy it must
mean divestment from fossil fuels and the creation of public goods like
green infrastructure and green production systems]{.underline} that
protect the earthly oasis that Armstrong referred to; and in the digital
domain it must mean the use of [digitalization to improve the access of
all people to the power of the technologies of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- while ensuring both data privacy and that our
welfare states are strengthened, not weakened, by digital platforms.

**[Doing capitalism differently]{.underline}** [requires reimagining the
full potential of a public sector driven by public purpose --
democratically defining clear goals]{.underline} that society needs to
meet by investing and **[innovating together]{.underline}**. It requires
a fundamentally new relationship between all economic actors willing and
able [to tackle complexity to achieve outcomes that matter.]{.underline}

### Transition Wars

#### Alt fails\-\--[transition wars]{.underline} and [domestic pressure]{.underline} means the alt [abandons fidelity]{.underline} to the environment.

**Smith \'19** \[Noah; 4/5/19; Bloomberg Opinion columnist, former
assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University; \"Dumping
Capitalism Won't Save the Planet,\"
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism\]

[It has become **fashionable**]{.underline} on social media and [in
certain publications to argue that **capitalism is killing the
planet**]{.underline}. Even renowned investor Jeremy Grantham, hardly a
radical, made that assertion last year. [The **basic idea** is that the
**profit motive** drives the **private sector** to **spew
carbon**]{.underline} into the air with reckless abandon. Though many
economists and some climate activists believe that the problem is best
addressed by modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, [many
activists believe that the problem can't be addressed **without
rebuilding** the **economy**]{.underline} along centrally planned lines.

[The climate threat is certainly dire]{.underline}, and carbon taxes are
unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [But eco-socialism
is]{.underline} probably [**not** going to be an **effective method** of
addressing that threat. **Dismantling** an **entire economic system** is
**never easy**, and probably would **touch off armed conflict** and
**major asdasd upheaval**. In the scramble to win those battles, even
the socialists would almost certainly abandon their limitation on
**fossil-fuel use**]{.underline} --- [either to support **military
efforts**, or to keep the population from turning against them. The
precedent here is the **Soviet Union**, whose multidecade effort to
**reshape its economy** by **force** amid **confrontation** with the
West led to profound **environmental degradation**. The world\'s climate
does not have several decades to spare]{.underline}.

[Even **without international conflict**, there's **little guarantee**
that moving away from capitalism would **mitigate our impact** on the
environment]{.underline}. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power
[in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially]{.underline}
for the average Bolivian, which is great. [But this has come at the cost
of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed to **decrease
its per capita emissions**]{.underline} a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, [in terms of **economic growth** and **carbon
emissions**, Bolivia looks]{.underline} similar to more
[capitalist]{.underline} developing countries. [That suggests that
**faced with a choice** of enriching their people or helping to save the
climate, even **socialist leaders** will often choose the former. And
that same political calculus will probably hold in China and the
U.S.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [leaders who
demand **draconian cuts** in **living standards** in pursuit of
environmental goals will have **trouble staying in power**]{.underline}.

[The **best hope** for the climate therefore lies in **reducing the
tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon emissions**.
That requires **technology**]{.underline} --- [**solar**, **wind** and
**nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars** and other
vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The **best climate
policy** plans all involve **technological improvement** as a **key
feature**.]{.underline}

## Disease

### AT Disease

#### Disease can't cause extinction

Dr. Toby **Ord 20**, Senior Research Fellow in Philosophy at Oxford
University, DPhil in Philosophy from the University of Oxford, The
Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity, Hachette Books,
Kindle Edition, p. 124-126

Are we safe now from events like this? Or are we more vulnerable? [Could
a pandemic threaten **humanity**'s future?]{.underline}10

The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. In 541 CE the
Plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine Empire. Over three years it
took the lives of roughly 3 percent of the world's people.11

When Europeans reached the Americas in 1492, the two populations exposed
each other to completely novel diseases. Over thousands of years each
population had built up resistance to their own set of diseases, but
were extremely susceptible to the others. The American peoples got by
far the worse end of exchange, through diseases such as measles,
influenza and especially smallpox.

During the next hundred years a combination of invasion and disease took
an immense toll---one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90 percent of the population of the Americas
during that century, though the number could also be much lower.12 And
it is very difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed
to war and occupation, rather than disease. As a rough upper bound, the
Columbian exchange may have killed as many as 10 percent of the world's
people.13

Centuries later, [the world had become so interconnected that a truly
[global pandemic]{.mark} was possible]{.underline}. Near the end of the
First World War, a devastating strain of influenza (known as the 1918
flu or Spanish Flu) spread to six continents, and even remote Pacific
islands. At least a third of the world's population were infected and 3
to 6 percent were killed.14 This death toll outstripped that of the
First World War, and possibly both World Wars combined.

[Yet even events like these [**fall short** of]{.mark} being [a threat
to **humanity**]{.mark}'s longterm potential]{.underline}.15

\[FOONOTE\]

[In addition to]{.underline} this [**historical** evidence, there are
some **[deep]{.mark}**er **[biological]{.mark}** observations and
[theories **suggest**]{.mark}ing that **[pathogens are unlikely to lead
to]{.mark} the [extinction]{.mark}** of their hosts. [These
include]{.mark} the **empirical [anti-correlation]{.mark}** [between
**infectiousness** and **lethality**]{.mark}, the **[extreme
rarity]{.mark}** of diseases [that kill more than 75%]{.mark} of those
infected, the observed **[tendency]{.mark}** of pandemics [to **become
less virulent**]{.mark} as they progress [and]{.mark} the theory of
**[optimal virulence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, there is no
watertight case against pathogens leading to the extinction of their
hosts.

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

[In the great bubonic plagues we saw [civilization]{.mark} in the
affected areas falter, but **[recover]{.mark}**. The
regional]{.underline} 25 to [[**50 percent** death rate was **not
enough** to **precipitate**]{.mark} **a continent-wide
[collapse]{.mark}** of civilization]{.underline}. It changed the
relative fortunes of empires, and may have altered the course of history
substantially, but [if anything, [it gives]{.mark} us [reason to
believe]{.mark} that human [civilization is **likely to make it
through** future events]{.mark} with similar death rates, **[even
if]{.mark}**]{.underline} they were **[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
scale.

The 1918 flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little apparent
effect on the world's development despite its global reach. It looks
like it was lost in the wake of the First World War, which despite a
smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the course
of history.16

It is less clear what lesson to draw from the Columbian exchange due to
our lack of good records and its mix of causes. Pandemics were clearly a
part of what led to a regional collapse of civilization, but we don't
know whether this would have occurred had it not been for the
accompanying violence and imperial rule. [The [strongest]{.mark} case
[against existential risk]{.mark} from natural pandemics [is]{.mark} the
**[fossil record]{.mark}**]{.underline} argument from Chapter 3.
[Extinction [risk]{.mark} from natural causes [above **0.1
percent**]{.mark} **per century** [is **incompatible** with]{.mark} the
**evidence** of [**how long** humanity]{.mark} and similar species have
[lasted]{.mark}]{.underline}. But this argument only works where the
risk to humanity now is similar or lower than the longterm levels. For
most risks this is clearly true, but not for pandemics. We have done
many things to exacerbate the risk: some that could make pandemics more
likely to occur, and some that could increase their damage. Thus even
"natural" pandemics should be seen as a partly anthropogenic risk.

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, [[Homo sapiens have been
around for **200,000 years**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Homo genus for
around six million years [[without being]{.mark} [exterminated]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} an infectious [disease]{.mark}, which is
evidence]{.underline} that **[the base rate of extinction-risk natural
pathogens is low]{.underline}**.82 Indeed, past disease [[outbreaks have
not **come close**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to rendering humans
extinct]{.underline}. Although bodies were piled high in the streets
across Europe during the Black Death,83 human extinction was never a
serious possibility, and some [economists even argue]{.underline} that
it was [a boon for the]{.underline} European [economy]{.underline}.84
Secondly, [infectious [disease]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[only
contributed to the]{.mark} [extinction of a **small minority of animal
species**]{.mark}]{.underline}.85 [The only confirmed case of a
mammalian species extinction]{.underline} being caused by an infectious
disease [is **a type of rat** native **only to Christmas
Island**]{.underline}. Having said that, the context may be importantly
different for modern day humans, so it is unclear whether the risk is
increasing or decreasing. On the one hand, due to globalisation, the
world is more interconnected making it easier for pathogens to spread.
On the other hand, [[interconnectedness could]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[**[increase immunity]{.mark}** [by **increasing exposure** to
**lower**]{.mark} **[virulence strains]{.mark} between
subpopulations**]{.underline}.87 Moreover, [[advancements in
**medicine** and **sanitation**]{.mark} [limit]{.mark} the]{.underline}
potential [[damage]{.underline}]{.mark} an outbreak might do.

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, there are some reasons to
believe that [natural [pandemics are **very unlikely** to
cause]{.mark}]{.underline} human [[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Analysis of [the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
red list database has shown that [of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[833]{.mark} [recorded]{.mark} plant and animal species
[extinctions]{.mark}]{.underline} known to have occurred [[since 1500,
less than 4%]{.mark}]{.underline} (31 species) [[were ascribed]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} infectious [[disease]{.underline}]{.mark}.38
[No]{.underline}ne of the [mammals]{.underline} and amphibians on this
list [were globally dispersed]{.underline}, and [other
factors]{.underline} aside [from]{.underline} infectious
[disease]{.underline} also [contributed to their
extinction]{.underline}. It therefore seems that [[our own species,
which is]{.mark} **very [numerous]{.mark}**, **[globally]{.mark}
[dispersed]{.mark}**[, and **capable of a rational
response**]{.mark}]{.underline} to problems, [[is]{.mark} **[very
unlikely]{.mark}** [to be killed off]{.mark} by a natural
pandemic.]{.underline} One underlying explanation for this is that
[[highly lethal pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[kill]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[hosts before
they]{.underline}]{.mark} have a chance to [[spread, so there]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**selective [pressure for
pathogens]{.mark}** [not to]{.mark} [be]{.mark}]{.underline} highly
[[lethal]{.underline}]{.mark}. Therefore,
[[pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark} are likely to
[[co]{.mark}-[evolve]{.mark} with]{.underline} their [hosts rather than
kill]{.underline} all possible hosts.39

#### No extinction -- their impacts are all media fear-mongering -- ebola proves

**Dean 14** \[Alex, \"Fear Not, Ebola Won\'t Wipe Us Out\", Spiked,
8/6/14,
www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/fear-not-ebola-wont-wipe-us-out/15549#.VaAbVvlViko\]
// SKY

[[When]{.mark}ever a [disease breaks out, we are bombarded with doomsday
predictions]{.mark}. Coverage of ebola has conformed to this
pattern]{.underline}. Major newspapers have bombarded us with page after
page of pharmaceutical puffery; some journalists speak as though we are
headed for an apocalypse. Commentary has been speculative, pessimistic
and quick to apportion blame. The Guardian's West Africa correspondent
says that 'new hotspots have flared up, fuelled by cross-border trade',
while US Republican politician Phil Gingrey has been making
unsubstantiated rants about 'illegal immigrants carrying deadly
diseases'. The head of the World Health Organisation stoked panic with
his statement that the virus 'is moving faster than efforts to control
it'. [We must [compare this reportage]{.mark}, all these 'the end is
nigh' performances, [with the reality]{.mark}. A quick look at hard
[science shows there is a dramatic mismatch]{.mark} and that
commentators have wildly exaggerated the threat ebola
poses.]{.underline} [[We are not headed for extinction]{.mark}. John
Oxford, a virologist at the University of London, has explained that the
hysteria surrounding ebola is disproportionate to the threat. He points
out that [ebola 'doesn't spread very easily']{.mark}, and that the
virus's reproductive number - how many people are infected by each
carrier - is very low. Where measles has a reproductive number of 12,
ebola's number is 1.]{.underline} Moreover, virologists have been quick
to point out that ebola is very easily destroyed, for a virus. A quick
wash of the hands and it's gone. Ebola can devastate families and
communities, yes, but when you consider that it has a low death toll
compared with other viruses in Africa, we must conclude that reports
have been hyperbolic and scaremongering. Yet this disproportionate panic
over ebola was to be expected. [[We saw similar responses when swine flu
broke out]{.mark} and the UK's chief medical officer predicted 65,000
deaths and the media swallowed it up, and again when the House of Lords
told us that 65,000 Britons would die from bird flu. Perhaps political
and medical bodies have a duty to err on the side of caution -- to
over-prepare and over-predict -- but the media and some of the public
also gobbled up these doomsday predictions with relish.]{.underline}
What's the explanation for this? Why do some observers seem to be
ravenously awaiting the next big pandemic? Why do we want these viruses
to be worse than they are? I think some people long for doomsday
predictions because they want their anti-progress attitudes to be
validated. [Ours is an era in which we are told to fear other people for
their unpredictability and to see our fellow humans as a
threat.]{.underline} Relationships are sometimes described as 'toxic' -
such is our misanthropy that we now even describe our ultimate forms of
intimacy in the language of disease. [Today's anti-human scaremongers
are desperate for their attitudes to be affirmed, and so they exaggerate
viruses which are spread through human contact and
movement]{.underline}. People convince themselves that ebola is the
result of immigration and human contact and modern forms of travel
because then their regressive attitudes feel truer, more real. They
don't see the hectic globalised world as exciting; they see it as
unnerving and are thrilled when a virus gives them reason to complain
about it. [[These ridiculous attitudes have found no real
affirmation]{.mark}, though. Humankind will deal with ebola, and a
disease spread through contact should never serve as a reason to despise
that contact: intimacy makes life worth living and immigration and trade
are the seeds of social and economic progress. [We must not allow the
fearmongers to undermine our rational convictions]{.mark}. Pay no
attention to the miserablists. Fear not, humankind -- we are doing
okay.]{.underline}

### AT Bioterror

#### Bioterrror fails

**Pinker 18** -- Steven Arthur Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive
psychologist, Professor at Harvard University. \[Enlightenment Now: The
Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Viking, Penguin
Group\]//BPS

[[Biological agents]{.mark} are **particularly [ill-suited]{.mark}** [to
terrorists, whose goal]{.mark}]{.underline}, recall,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not damage but
**[[theater]{.underline}]{.mark}** (chapter 13).58 The biologist Paul
Ewald notes that [natural selection among pathogens **works
against**]{.underline} the terrorist's goal of [sudden and spectacular
devastation]{.underline}. 59 Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person
contagion, like the common-cold virus, are selected to keep their hosts
alive and ambulatory so they can shake hands with and sneeze on as many
people as possible. Germs get greedy and kill their hosts only if they
have some other way of getting from body to body, like mosquitoes (for
malaria), a contaminable water supply (for cholera), or trenches packed
with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish flu). Sexually transmitted
pathogens, like HIV and syphilis, are somewhere in between, needing a
long and symptomless incubation period during which hosts can infect
their partners, after which the germs do their damage. [[**Virulence**
and **contagion**]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[trade
off]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [the **evolution of germs** will
**frustrate the terrorist's aspiration** to launch a headline-worthy
epidemic that is]{.underline} both [swift and lethal]{.underline}.
Theoretically, a bioterrorist could try to bend the curve with a
pathogen that is virulent, contagious, and durable enough to survive
outside bodies. But [[breeding]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a
**fine-tuned germ**]{.mark} would [require **Nazi-like
experiments**]{.mark} **[on living humans]{.mark}** that even
terrorists]{.underline} (to say nothing of teenagers) [are [unlikely to
carry off]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may be more than just luck that [the
world]{.underline} so far [has seen just **one successful bioterror
attack**]{.underline} (the 1984 tainting of salad with salmonella in an
Oregon town by the Rajneeshee religious cult, **[which killed no
one]{.underline}**) and one spree killing (the 2001 anthrax mailings,
which killed five).60 To be sure, advances in synthetic biology, such as
the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, make it easier to tinker with
organisms, including pathogens. But [[it's difficult to re-engineer a
complex evolved trait by inserting **a gene**]{.mark} **or
two**]{.underline}, since the effects of any gene are intertwined with
the rest of the organism's genome. [Ewald notes, "[**I don't think that
we are close** to understanding how]{.mark} to insert combinations of
genetic variants in any given pathogen that act in concert to generate
high transmissibility and stably high virulence for
humans."]{.underline}61 The biotech expert Robert Carlson adds that "one
of the problems with building any flu virus is that you need to keep
your production system (cells or eggs) alive long enough to make a
useful quantity of something that is trying to kill that production
system. . . . Booting up the resulting virus is still very, very
difficult. . . . I would not dismiss this threat completely, but frankly
I am much more worried about what Mother Nature is throwing at us all
the time."62 And crucially, [[advances in biology work the other way as
well]{.mark}: they]{.underline} also [[make it easier for the good
guys]{.mark} \[public protectors\]]{.underline} (and there are many more
of them) [[to identify pathogens, invent antibiotics]{.mark} that
overcome **a**nti**b**iotic **r**esistance, [and **rapidly
develop**]{.mark} **vaccines**]{.underline}.63 [An example
is]{.underline} the [Ebola]{.underline} vaccine, developed in the waning
days of the 2014--15 emergency, after public health efforts had capped
the toll at twelve thousand deaths rather than the millions that the
media had foreseen. Ebola thus joined a list of other falsely predicted
pandemics such as Lassa fever, hantavirus, SARS, mad cow disease, bird
flu, and swine flu.64 Some of them never had the potential to go
pandemic in the first place because they are contracted from animals or
food rather than in an exponential tree of person-to-person infections.
Others were nipped by medical and public health interventions. Of course
no one knows for sure whether an evil genius will someday overcome the
world's defenses and loose a plague upon the world for fun, vengeance,
or a sacred cause. But [journalistic habits and the Availability and
[Negativity biases **inflate the odds**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is
why I have taken Sir Martin up on his bet. By the time you read this you
may know who has won.65

Challenges to Myth 5 [There are two dimensions to Myth 5. The first is
about the intention of would-be terrorists]{.underline}, [and the
assumption is that terrorists would seek to produce mass casualty
weapons and pursue capabilities on the scale of twentieth century
state-level bioweapons programs.]{.underline} While [[most]{.mark}
leading [bio]{.mark}logical disarmament [and non-prolif]{.mark}eration
[experts believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that the risk of a small-scale
bioterrorism attack is very real and very present, they consider **[[the
risk of]{.mark} sophisticated large-scale [bioterror]{.mark}ism attacks
[to be very small]{.mark}]{.underline}** (65). [[This is **backed up by
historical evidence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The three confirmed
attempts to use biological agents against humans in terrorist
[attacks]{.mark} in the past [were small]{.mark}-scale]{.underline},
[[low casualty events]{.mark} aimed at causing panic, and disruption
rather than]{.underline} [excessive death tolls]{.underline}: (i) the
Rajneesh cult's use of Salmonella on salad bars in local restaurants to
sicken potential voters and make them stay away from the polls during
Oregon elections in 1984; (ii) the 1990--95 attempted use of botulinum
toxin and anthrax by the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult; (iii) and the
"anthrax letters" sent to media outlets and members of US Congress in
2001 resulting in at least 22 cases of anthrax, five of which were fatal
(66, 67). [The second dimension to Myth 5 is the implicit assumption
that [producing]{.mark} [a pathogen]{.mark}ic organism [equates
producing a w]{.mark}eapon [of]{.mark} [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction.]{.underline} [**[It does not]{.underline}**.
[Considerable]{.underline}]{.mark} [knowledge and [resources are]{.mark}
[necessary for]{.mark} the processes of [scaling up, storage, and
developing a]{.mark} suitable [dissemination
method]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These]{.underline}]{.mark} [processes
[present]{.mark} **[significant]{.mark} technical and [logistical
barriers]{.mark}**[. Drawing from her in-depth study]{.mark} of the
Iraqi, Soviet, and US bioweapons programs]{.underline} (3, 4), Ben
Ouagrham-[[Gormley explains: Scaling up]{.mark} fragile
[microorganisms]{.mark}]{.underline} that are sensitive to environmental
conditions and susceptible to change --- and viruses are more sensitive
than bacteria --- [[has been one of the stiffest challenges]{.mark} for
past bioweapons programs to overcome, [even]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
appropriate [expertise]{.mark} at hand.]{.underline} [Scaling-up
requires a gradual approach]{.underline}, moving from laboratory sample,
to a larger laboratory quantity, to pilot-scale production, and then to
even larger-scale production. During each stage, the production
parameters need to be tested and often modified to maintain the lethal
qualities of the agent; the entire scaling-up process can take several
years (68). [The [dissemination]{.mark} of biological agents [also
poses]{.mark} difficult technical [challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Whereas persistent chemical agents such as sulfur mustard and VX nerve
gas are readily absorbed through the intact skin, no bacteria and
viruses can enter the body via that route unless the skin has already
been broken. Biological agents must either be ingested or inhaled to
cause infection. [To expose large numbers of people]{.underline} through
the gastrointestinal tract, [possible means of delivery are
contamination of food and drinking water, yet neither of these scenarios
would be easy to accomplish.]{.underline} [Large urban reservoirs are
usually unguarded, but unless terrorists added massive quantities of
biological agent, the dilution effect would be so great that no healthy
person drinking the water would receive an infectious dose]{.underline}
(66). Moreover, [modern sanitary techniques such as chlorination and
filtration are designed to kill pathogens from natural sources and would
probably be equally effective against a deliberately released
agent.]{.underline} [Bacterial contamination of the food supply is also
unlikely to inflict mass casualties.]{.underline} Cooking, boiling,
pasteurization, and other routine safety precautions are generally
sufficient to kill pathogenic bacteria. The most likely way to inflict
mass casualties with a biological agent is by disseminating it as a
respirable aerosol: an invisible cloud of infectious droplets or
particles so tiny that they remain suspended in the air for long periods
and can be inhaled by large numbers of people. A high-concentration
aerosol of B. anthracis or some other pathogen, released into the air in
a densely populated urban area, could potentially infect thousands of
victims simultaneously. After an incubation period of a few days,
depending on the type of agent and the inhaled dose, the exposed
population would experience an outbreak of an incapacitating or fatal
illness. [Although [aerosol delivery]{.mark} is potentially the most
lethal way of delivering a biological attack, **it [involves major
technical hurdles that most terrorists would be unlikely to
overcome]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To infect through the lungs, infectious
particles must be microscopic in size -- between 1 and 5 μm in diameter.
[Terrorists would]{.underline} therefore [have to develop or acquire a
sophisticated delivery system capable of generating an aerosol
cloud]{.underline} with the necessary particle size range and a high
enough agent concentration to cover a broad area. Overall, an important
trade-off exists between ease of production and effectiveness of
dissemination. The easiest way to produce microbial agents is in a
liquid form, yet when such a "slurry" is sprayed into the air, it forms
heavy droplets that fall to the ground so that only a small percentage
of the agent is aerosolized. In contrast, if the bacteria are first
dried to a solid cake and then milled into a fine powder, they become
far easier to aerosolize, yet the drying and milling process is
technically difficult. The Aum Shinrikyo cult struggled with
dissemination (67, 69, 70). In one of its anthrax dissemination
attempts, it sprayed unknown, but probably very large, quantities of a
liquid aerosol (most likely crude culture, unprocessed in any way) of B.
anthracis from the roof of the Aum's headquarters building in Tokyo. For
the dissemination, the Aum set up two sprayers on the roof of the
eight-story building, each within a large round cooling tower. Pipes
were extended from the cooling towers to tanks below, which were filled
with a liquid suspension of B. anthracis. The device worked poorly,
producing large droplets rather than the very fine aerosol needed for
effective transmission of anthrax. It also appears the spore
concentration was very low (at least five orders of magnitude below that
necessary for a highly infectious wet aerosol). In another dissemination
attempt, targeting the area around the Kanagawa prefectural office and
the Imperial Palace, the Aum equipped vehicles with spraying devices,
but according to prosecutors' statements, the nozzle of the sprayer
clogged and the operation failed. Despite its 200 m2 laboratory
containing, amongst other equipment, a glove box, incubator, centrifuge,
drier, DNA/RNA synthesizer, electron microscope, two fermenters each
having about a 2,000 litre capacity, and an extensive scientific
library, and despite its repeated attempts at dissemination, the Aum was
unsuccessful in causing any disease, and in retrospect it is clear that
the cult did not even make the first substantive step toward an
effective bioweapon. [If, despite the odds, aerosolization was achieved,
the [effective delivery]{.mark} of biological agents in the open air
[is]{.mark} highly [dependent on atmospheric]{.mark} and wind
[conditions, creating additional uncertainties]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Only under highly stable atmospheric conditions would the aerosol cloud
remain close to the ground where it can be inhaled, rather than being
rapidly dispersed]{.underline}. Moreover, most [[microorganisms are
**sensitive to
u**]{.underline}]{.mark}ltra**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**iolet
[[radiation and cannot survive]{.mark}]{.underline} more than 30 min
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} bright [[sunlight]{.underline},]{.mark}
limiting their use to night-time attacks. One major exception is
anthrax, which can be induced to form spores with tough outer coats that
enable them to survive for several hours in sunlight. Terrorists could,
of course, stage a biological attack inside an enclosed space such as a
building, a subway station, a shopping mall, or a sports arena. Such an
attack, if it involved a respiratory aerosol, might infect thousands of
people, but even here the technical hurdles would by no means be
trivial. [Finally, even if a biological weapon had been disseminated
successfully, the outcome of an attack would be affected by factors like
the health of the people who are exposed to the agent]{.underline}, [and
the speed and manner with which public health authorities and medical
professionals detected and were able to respond to the resulting
outbreak.]{.underline} [[A prompt response with]{.mark} effective
medical [countermeasures]{.mark}, such as antibodies and
vaccination]{.underline}, [**[can significantly blunt the impact of an
attack]{.underline}**. [Simple, proven ways]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
curtail epidemics, such as wearing face masks, hand washing, and
avoiding hospitals where transmission rates might soar, [can]{.mark}
also [prove effective in stemming]{.mark} [the spread]{.mark} of a
disease]{.underline}. Indeed, this aspect of a bioterrorism attack is
often underplayed in scenarios like Tara O'Toole's "Dark Winter" and
"Atlantic Storm," where the rates of contagion used are often
significantly higher than those in historical cases of natural outbreaks
(71).

### AT Food Wars

Once again it seems to me that the appropriate response is "maybe, but
maybe not." [Though climate change can cause plenty of
misery]{.underline}... [it will not necessarily **lead to armed
conflict**.]{.underline} The **[political scientists]{.underline}** who
track war and peace, [such as]{.underline} Halvard
**[Buhaug]{.underline}**, Idean **[Salehyan]{.underline}**, Ole
**[Theisen]{.underline}**, and Nils **[Gleditsch]{.underline}**, [are
skeptical of the popular idea that people **fight wars** over **scarce
resources**]{.underline}. **[[Hunger and]{.mark} resource

(such as the disastrous one in the Indian Ocean in 2004) [do not

Certainly any connection to terrorism is in the imagination of the
terror warriors: terrorists tend to be underemployed lower-middle-class

finds it convenient to blame violence in Darfur on desertification,
distracting the world from its own role in tolerating or encouraging the
ethnic cleansing. [[In a regression]{.mark} analysis on armed conflicts
from 1980 to 1992]{.underline}, [Theisen found that [conflict

### AT Science Diplomacy

#### Science diplomacy fails

**Dickson, 10** (David, director of SciDev.net (science for the
developing world) and 20+ years in science policy journalism, 6/28/10,
"Science in diplomacy: "On tap but not on top,"
https://scidevnet.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/the-place-of-science-in-diplomacy-%E2%80%9Con-tap-but-not-on-top%E2%80%9D/)

[There's a general consensus]{.underline} in both the scientific and
political worlds that [the principle of science diplomacy]{.underline},
at least in the somewhat restricted sense of the need to get more and
better science into international negotiations, [is a desirable
objective.]{.underline} [There is less agreement,]{.underline} however,
[on how far the concept can -- or indeed should -- be extended to
embrace broader goals and objectives, in particular attempts to use
science to achieve political or diplomatic goals at the international
level.]{.underline} [[Science]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite its
international characteristics, [[is no substitute for effective
diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Any more than diplomatic initiatives
necessarily lead to good science. [These seem to have been the broad
conclusions to emerge from a three-day meeting at Wilton Park in Sussex,
UK, organised by the British Foreign Office and the Royal Society, and
attended by scientists, government officials and politicians from 17
countries around the world.]{.underline} The definition of science
diplomacy varied widely among participants. Some saw it as a subcategory
of "public diplomacy", or what US diplomats have recently been promoting
as "soft power" ("the carrot rather than the stick approach", as a
participant described it). Others preferred to see it as a core element
of the broader concept of "innovation diplomacy", covering the politics
of engagement in the familiar fields of international scientific
exchange and technology transfer, but raising these to a higher level as
a diplomatic objective. Whatever definition is used, three particular
aspects of the debate became the focus of attention during the Wilton
Park meeting: how science can inform the diplomatic process; how
diplomacy can assist science in achieving its objectives; and, finally,
how science can provide a channel for quasi-diplomatic exchanges by
forming an apparently neutral bridge between countries. There was little
disagreement on the first of these. Indeed for many, given the
increasing number of international issues with a scientific dimension
that politicians have to deal with, this is essentially what the core of
science diplomacy should be about. Chris Whitty, for example, chief
scientist at the UK's Department for International Development,
described how knowledge about the threat raised by the spread of the
highly damaging plant disease stem rust had been an important input by
researchers into discussions by politicians and diplomats over
strategies for persuading Afghan farmers to shift from the production of
opium to wheat. Others pointed out that the scientific community had
played a major role in drawing attention to issues such as the links
between chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere and the growth of the
ozone hole, or between carbon dioxide emissions and climate change. Each
has made essential contributions to policy decisions. Acknowledging this
role for science has some important implications. No-one dissented when
Rohinton Medhora, from Canada's International Development Research
Centre, complained of the lack of adequate scientific expertise in the
embassies of many countries of the developed and developing world alike.
Nor -- perhaps predictably -- was there any major disagreement that
diplomatic initiatives can both help and occasionally hinder the process
of science. On the positive side, such diplomacy can play a significant
role in facilitating science exchange and the launch of international
science projects, both essential for the development of modern science.
Europe's framework programme of research programmes was quoted as a
successful advantage of the first of these. Examples of the second range
from the establishment of the European Organisation of Nuclear Research
(usually known as CERN) in Switzerland after the Second World War, to
current efforts to build a large new nuclear fusion facility (ITER).
[Less positively, increasing restrictions on entry to certain countries,
and in particular the United States after the 9/11 attacks in New York
and elsewhere, have significantly impeded scientific exchange
programmes. Here the challenge for diplomats was seen as helping to find
ways to ease the burdens of such restrictions.]{.underline} The
[[broadest gaps in understanding the potential of scientific diplomacy
lay in]{.underline}]{.mark} the third category, namely the [[use of
science as a channel of international diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark},
either [as a way of helping to forge consensus on contentious issues, or
as a catalyst for peace in situations of conflict.]{.underline} On the
first of these, some pointed to recent climate change negotiations, and
in particular the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
as a good example, of the way that the scientific community can provide
a strong rationale for joint international action. But [others referred
to the failure of the Copenhagen climate summit]{.underline} last
December [to come up with a meaningful agreement on action]{.underline}
as a demonstration of the limitations of this way of thinking. It was
argued that [this [failure]{.mark} had been]{.underline} partly [[due
to]{.mark} a misplaced [belief]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[scientific
consensus would be sufficient to generate]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[commitment to collective action]{.underline}]{.mark}, [without taking
into account the political impact]{.underline} that scientific ideas
would have. Another example that received considerable attention was the
current construction of a synchrotron facility SESAME in Jordan, a
project that is already is bringing together researchers in a range of
scientific disciplines from various countries in the Middle East
(including Israel, Egypt and Palestine, as well as both Greece and
Turkey). The promoters of SESAME hope that -- as with the building of
CERN 60 years ago, and its operation as a research centre involving, for
example, physicists from both Russia and the United States -- SESAME
will become a symbol of what regional collaboration can achieve. In that
sense, it would become what one participant described as a "beacon of
hope" for the region. But others cautioned that, however successful
SESAME may turn out to be in purely scientific terms, its potential
impact on the Middle East peace process should not be exaggerated[.
[Political conflicts have deep roots that cannot easily be papered
over,]{.mark} however open-minded scientists may be to professional
colleagues coming from other political contexts.]{.underline} Indeed,
there was even a warning that in the developing world, [high profile
scientific projects]{.underline}, particular those with explicit
political backing, [could end up doing damage by inadvertently favouring
one social group]{.underline} over another. Scientists should be wary of
having their prestige used in this way; those who did so could come over
as patronising, appearing unaware of political realities. Similarly,
[those who hold science in esteem as a practice committed to promoting
the causes of peace]{.underline} and development [were reminded of the
need to take into account how advances in science]{.underline} --
whether nuclear physics or genetic technology -- [have also led to new
types of weaponry]{.underline}. Nor did science automatically lead to
the reduction of global inequalities. "Science for diplomacy" therefore
ended up with a highly mixed review. The consensus seemed to be that
science can prepare the ground for diplomatic initiatives -- and benefit
from diplomatic agreements -- but cannot provide the solutions to
either.

## Solvency

### Multilat Fails

#### Multilateralism fails -- countries won't cooperate, causing fragmentation.

relations at Durham University, "Global Cooperation Buckling Under Past
Successes," The Globalist, Global Cooperation Buckling Under Past
Successes, *\*fc*)

A Systemic Crisis [**While the need for global cooperation continues to
grow, the [ability of multilateral institutions to delive]{.mark}r the
[policy coordination]{.mark} we need [has not kept pace.]{.mark}** The
provision of [effective global governance]{.mark} isn't just lacking in
one area --- like, say, climate change. It [is systematically
underperforming across a range of issues.]{.mark} These [include]{.mark}
the management of [the]{.mark} global e[conomy]{.mark} to human security
[and environmental problems]{.mark}.]{.underline} While many have
pondered the many pressing global dilemmas facing the world today,
[there is a paradox accompanying the global situation as a whole. We are
failing under the weight of our own success. Decades of multilateral
agreements, new institutions and an increasingly robust system of
international law have enabled a radical increase in economic
globalization]{.underline}, with substantial benefits for a wide range
of countries. **[But [our ability to manage]{.mark} all this [complexity
of progress has not kept pace.]{.mark} Our more integrated global
economy demands more, and more effective, collective
management.]{.underline}** The problems that confront us now are
challenges we never would have encountered without the progress made by
the existing network of institutions. [The various committees based in
Basel, the IMF, the G20, and beyond facilitated a sharp deepening of
financial interdependence. When the crisis arrived[,]{.mark} they proved
adequate --- albeit just adequate --- to coordinate a minimally
sufficient series of policy responses to avoid another Great
Depression.]{.underline} Instead of an unmitigated disaster we got a
mitigated one. **[[They wer]{.mark}e of course [unable to prevent the
crisis from occurring in the first place]{.mark} and have not been able
to take the measures needed to prevent the next one.]{.underline}**
Moreover, [just as existing international institutions are useful
vehicles for cooperation, **they can also come to hinder
it.**]{.underline} [International institutions like the
IMF,]{.underline} for example, contain a vast array of resources and
expertise for addressing global problems. Yet [because of their past
behavior and the lock-in of US dominance that was secured over six
decades ago, [many countries **do not trust the IMF**]{.mark} **as a
global governor.**]{.underline} Newer institutions like the G20 are a
testament to successful development of countries like Brazil, India and
China, who have been able to strategically engage with economic
globalization in recent years. Yet, **[[with a greater plurality of
voices at the negotiation table, cooperation becomes more
difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Fragmentation From Cooperation [When
institutions proliferate, **[the overall system may slide toward
dysfunctional fragmentation]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Our current set of
institutions arose from ad hoc crisis management over the postwar
period. Each crisis saw the addition of a new committee, a new joint
task force or some other institutional addition. But the sum is not
greater than the parts. Indeed, [the lack of coherence in global
economic governance is directly responsible for a number of the
challenges we now face.]{.underline} For example, [the reform efforts
surrounding complex financial instruments like derivatives are as
complex as the instruments themselves.]{.underline} There is not one
international institution handling the reform process. Rather, there are
five different organizations all handling different pieces, separate
initiatives at the EU level and a panoply of different countries all
acting simultaneously. Some claim that global economic governance has
utterly failed, pointing to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression and a sluggish recovery. Others regard global economic
governance as "good enough." They point out that we averted an even
worse disaster and --- despite a global recession --- didn't collapse.
In fact, both views are correct: [global economic cooperation is failing
under the weight of its own success. Across a range of issue areas, the
remarkable success of global cooperation in the last several decades has
made human interconnectedness weigh much more heavily on politics and
the economy than it did in the past. But that [process of growing
cooperation has now stalled, unable to manage the deep interdependence
it has created.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Multilateralism empirically fails

**Naim '9** (Moises; 6/21/09; Distinguished Fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace; "MISSING LINKS Minilateralism The
magic number to get real international action," accessed 6/26/16,
http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/06/21/minilateralism/)

Never say never. Because of the global economic crisis, habits that
seemed unalterable are suddenly being altered. Americans are now saving
more and consuming less. Financial institutions are no longer betting
the house on risky investments they do not understand. Wealthy
oil-exporting countries are tightening their belts. At least some
emerging markets long prone to financial accidents are behaving with
uncharacteristic prudence. Everywhere, change is in the air.
[Everywhere, that is, except in the way humanity responds to its most
menacing threats. You know the list: climate change]{.underline},
nuclear proliferation, terrorism, pandemics, trade protectionism, and
more. [Not one can be solved, or even effectively contained, without
more successful international collaboration. And that is not happening.
When was the last time you heard that a large number of countries agreed
to a major international accord on a pressing issue? Not in more than a
decade]{.underline}. **[[The last successful multilateral trade
agreement dates back to 1994]{.underline}]{.mark}**, when 123 countries
gathered to negotiate the creation of the World Trade Organization and
agreed on a new set of rules for international trade. [Since then, all
other attempts to reach a global trade deal have crashed.]{.underline}
The same is true with multilateral efforts to curb nuclear
proliferation; the last significant international nonproliferation
agreement was in 1995, when 185 countries agreed to extend an existing
nonproliferation treaty. In the decade and a half since, multilateral
initiatives have not only failed, but India, Pakistan, and North Korea
have demonstrated their certain status as nuclear powers. [On the
environment, the [Kyoto Protocol,]{.mark} a global deal aimed at
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, has been ratified by 184 countries
since it was adopted in 1997, but the United States, the world's
second-largest air polluter after China, has not done so, and many of
the [signatories have missed their targets]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
most recent multilateral initiative successfully endorsed by a large
number of countries was in 2000, when 192 nations signed the United
Nations Millennium Declaration, an ambitious set of eight goals ranging
from halving the world's extreme poverty to halting the spread of
HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education---all by 2015.
Although some progress toward achieving these goals has been
made---mostly thanks to Asia's spectacular economic performance---the
failure of rich countries to fully fund these efforts, execution
problems in poor countries, and the global economic downturn make the
achievement of the goals by 2015 unlikely. [The pattern is
clear:]{.underline} Since the early 1990s, the need for effective
multicountry collaboration has soared, but at the same time
**[[multilateral talks have inevitably failed; deadlines have been
missed; financial commitments and promises have not been honored;
execution has stalled; and international collective action has fallen
far short]{.underline}]{.mark}** of what was offered and, more
importantly, needed. These failures represent not only the perpetual
lack of international consensus, but also a flawed obsession with
multilateralism as the panacea for all the world's ills. So what is to
be done? To start, let's forget about trying to get the planet's nearly
200 countries to agree. We need to abandon that fool's errand in favor
of a new idea: minilateralism. By minilateralism, I mean a smarter, more
targeted approach: We should bring to the table the smallest possible
number of countries needed to have the largest possible impact on
solving a particular problem. Think of this as minilateralism's magic
number. The magic number, of course, will vary greatly depending on the
problem. Take trade, for example. The Group of Twenty (G-20), which
includes both rich and poor countries from six continents, accounts for
85 percent of the world's economy. The members of the G-20 could reach a
major trade deal among themselves and make it of even greater
significance by allowing any other country to join if it wishes to do
so. Presumably, many would. Same with climate change. There, too, the
magic number is about 20: The world's 20 top polluters account for 75
percent of the planet's greenhouse gas emissions. The number for nuclear
proliferation is 21---enough to include both recognized and de facto
nuclear countries, and several other powers who care about them. African
poverty? About a dozen, including all the major donor countries and the
sub-Saharan countries most in need. As for HIV/AIDS, 19 countries
account for nearly two thirds of the world's AIDS-related deaths. Of
course, countries not invited to the table will denounce this approach
as undemocratic and exclusionary. But the magic number will break the
world's untenable gridlock, and agreements reached by the small number
of countries whose actions are needed to generate real solutions can
provide the foundation on which more-inclusive deals can be subsequently
built. Minilateral deals can and should be open to any other country
willing to play by the rules agreed upon by the original group. The
defects of minilateralism pale in comparison with the stalemate that
characterizes 21st-century multilateralism. **[[It has become far too
dangerous to continue to rely on large-scale multilateral negotiations
that stopped yielding results almost two decades
ago]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The minilateralism of magic numbers is not a
magic solution. But it's a far better bet at this point than the
multilateralism of wishful thinking.
