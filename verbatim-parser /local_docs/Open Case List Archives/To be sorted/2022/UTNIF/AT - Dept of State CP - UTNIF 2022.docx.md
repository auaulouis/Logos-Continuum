### 2AC -- PDB 

#### Perm do both -- coordination key to access high-demand experts -- the counterplan alone fails to solve deterrence 

**Kreuttner et al. 18** (Col. Tim Kreuttner, U.S. Army; Lt. Col. Sami
Alnaqbi, United Arab Emirates Navy; Lt. Col. Jarrod Knapp, U.S. Air
Force; Maj. James Woodard, U.S. Marine Corps"A Joint and Operational
Approach for Security Assistance to Georgia and Ukraine," Military
Review, March-April 2018, WC)

The U.S. and NATO's ability to deliver training, education, and advice
at the operational level will face challenges. [Synchronization of
operational maneuver and the ability to integrate joint capabilities in
a coherent campaign is something that even the best militaries have to
work hard at to do well.]{.underline} [The requisite **expertise** to
train partners in operational planning and execution **is not
plentiful** and usually resides in combatant command or other major
command staffs, with the majority not dedicated to training, exercises,
or other security cooperation activities.]{.underline}

[Subject-matter experts capable of leading training are]{.underline}
**[low-density, high-demand assets]{.underline}** [whose own
organizations are often reluctant to part with for "secondary" security
cooperation tasks]{.underline}---namely planners, strategists,
joint-fires-qualified experts, and other joint doctrine and technical
experts. [The United States needs to manage the joint and operational
expertise closely to]{.underline} **[leverage the right expertise at the
right time while not levying an undue burden on owning
organizations]{.underline}**. But, for partnerships with Ukraine and
Georgia to progress, this is necessary.

Conclusion

Ukraine and Georgia are on the front lines of strategic competition.
While the United States and NATO have provided robust tactical training
and strategic development over the last twenty years, there is a gap in
joint training and development at the operational level. [The U.S. and
NATO security assistance to these geopolitically key nations contributes
to deterrence of Russia]{.underline} while improving the
interoperability and capability of important partners. **[An integrated
joint approach to security cooperation]{.underline}** [focusing at the
operational level will strengthen Ukraine and Georgia and serve as
an]{.underline} [**appropriate deterrent to Russian aggression**. A
joint approach to partnership programs would significantly enhance
the]{.underline} **[defense capability and
interoperability]{.underline}** of Ukraine and Georgia to participate
[in NATO operations and exercises]{.underline}. [Expanding combined,
joint interoperability at the operational level should be the next
critical focus of our partnerships.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- PDCP

#### Perm do the counterplan -- normal means security cooperation includes the state department 

**Anderson et al. 16** (R. Reed Anderson, Patrick J. Ellis, Antonio M.
Paz, Kyle A. Reed, Lendy "Alamo" Renegar and John T. Vaughan *"STRATEGIC
LANDPOWER AND A RESURGENT RUSSIA: AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH TO
DETERRENCE*: Chapter 4 THEATER SECURITY COOPERATION IN EUROPE,"

\*\*\*Foreign internal defense (FID) is the participation by civilian
and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs
taken by another government or other designated organization, to free
and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency,
terrorism, and other threats to their security\*\*\*

Although the United States TSC efforts are facilitating many of the
military-focused assurance and deterrence tasks NATO has recently
undertaken, [there is room for improvement in gaining U.S. interagency
support for conducting FID training]{.underline}. [The goal for this
type of FID would be to assist with strengthening the **resilience of a
NATO ally** to ensure they are less vulnerable to Russian ambiguous
actions.]{.underline} The challenge for conducting what might be thought
of as "interagency FID" would be establishing priority countries,
identifying focus areas, and getting the appropriate trainers in place.
The key in every case is for the United States and allied or partner
countries to jointly determine the lines of effort necessary to achieve
specific and attainable objectives while considering NATO defense
planning process priorities. [The United States must be cognizant of the
strategic end states for each Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) and associated
country specific **Security Cooperation** Sections]{.underline}, which
should lay out the end states and the ways to achieve them, [and should
be coordinated]{.underline} with the U.S. Embassy Integrated Country
Strategy and associated foreign assistance plans.

There are several challenges to employing an interagency FID effort to
build resilience among NATO allies. First, [the U.S. Department of State
(DoS) and EUCOM must ensure that the DoS Regional Strategies and EUCOM's
TCP are mutually supporting]{.underline}. There is no clear chain of
command in this process, and it will certainly involve intense personal
engagement from leaders across the interagency. [The primary
stakeholders, DoS and EUCOM, operate differently with respect to
generating strategy.]{.underline} The presidentially appointed
ambassadors are the lead for developing their country plans, which are
then forwarded to the DoS in Washington for inclusion in the regional
strategies. In the DoD, the policy offices of the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSDP) and EUCOM generate the strategy
and then push it down to subordinate elements for execution. [The common
ground for decision-makers can be hard to determine since the Ambassador
is the lead for DoS and is country focused and the EUCOM commander is
the lead for DoD and is regionally focused]{.underline}. [Achieving
unity of effort toward building resilient partners will require a
constant, integrated engagement from both bureaucracies]{.underline}.
[Additionally, it would be invaluable to generate some form of
**interagency resilience strategy** that would **synchronize
efforts**]{.underline}.23

### 2AC -- CP links to NB

#### Perm shields the link and the CP links to DoD DA -- their budgets are [synchronized]{.underline} and DoD is essential to security assistance 

**Doubleday 17** (Justin Doubleday, managing editor of Inside the
Pentagon until June 2021, where he focused on defense-wide topics
including budgets, acquisition policy, combatant commands, missile
defense and cyber, "DOD, State Department establish security assistance
steering committee," Inside the Pentagon , September 28, 2017, Vol. 33,
No. 39, pp. 1, 10-11, WC)

[The Pentagon and the State Department have set up a high-level group to
help **synchronize the two agencies' control over billions of dollars'
worth of security assistance** to foreign countries]{.underline}.

[The Security Sector Assistance Steering Group was established this past
spring by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis]{.underline}, according to Todd Harvey, acting assistant
secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities. Harvey
testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sept. 26.

[The steering committee will help "oversee a collaborative planning
process, identifying top national security priorities and synchronizing
investments to maximize results]{.underline}," according to Harvey's
written testimony.

[One of the committee's immediate priorities]{.underline} is to develop
a process for fiscal year 2018 security sector assistance planning to
"[permit State and DOD to validate security assistance requirements for
countries that directly support this administration's top
priorities]{.underline}," according to Tina Kaidanow, acting assistant
secretary of state for the bureau of political military affairs.
Kaidanow and Harvey are co-chairs of the new steering committee.

[The committee will also ensure DOD's expanding security assistance
programs match up with the State Department's traditional lead role for
that function]{.underline}, according to Kaidanow's testimony. The State
Department requested \$5.1 billion for Foreign Military Financing in
FY-18, with \$3.1 billion earmarked for Israel and \$1.3 billion planned
for Egypt.

But Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-MD)
expressed concern over the growing security assistance role played by
the Pentagon. [DOD oversees several security assistance
programs]{.underline}, [including the \$1.5 billion Counter-Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria fund and the \$4.2 billion Afghanistan Security
Forces Fund.]{.underline}

Cardin called such programs "necessary and important," but worried about
the [control over security assistance shifting from the State Department
to the Pentagon.]{.underline}

"My chief concern, however, [is that DOD is setting up an essentially
parallel security assistance structure without sufficient State
Department oversight, input and coordination]{.underline}," Cardin said.
"[Combine this with the current administration's profoundly unwise
proposal to **slash the Department of State's budget**, **opaque
reorganization efforts** and increasing **loss of experienced
personnel**, and one could easily see us in a scenario in which the
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense could become the **dominant source of
U.S. security assistance."**]{.underline}

Cardin pointed to section 333 of Title 10, which mandates the secretary
of state concur with any train-and-equip program proposed by the
Pentagon.

[The new steering committee will]{.underline} ["optimize]{.underline}
section 333 military assistance and \[Foreign Military Financing\]
[resources to effectively advance national security
objectives]{.underline}, leverage each Department's expertise and
authorities, and reinforce our respective requests to Congress,"
according to Kaidanow's testimony.

"In the longer term[, the intent is to strategically integrate State and
DOD planning and resourcing processes for a wider range of SSA
resources, including by synchronizing budget requests and rationalizing
and refining the use of SSA authorities,"]{.underline} her testimony
added. \-- Justin Doubleday

### 2AC - DoD key - AI

#### DoD action better than DoS -- leaders have already allocated leadership to them

**Horowitz and Kahn 22** (Michael C. Horowitz and Lauren Kahn --
Professor on American foreign policy at John Hopkins -- "Why DoD's New
Approach to Data and Artificial Intelligence Should Enhance National
Defense" -- March 11, 2022 --
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-dods-new-approach-data-and-artificial-intelligence-should-enhance-national-defense//daxw>)

[The ability of the United States to compete in the 21st century depends
on U.S. leadership in data and artificial intelligence (AI). In
response, **the Department of Defense (DoD) is taking a new and
much-needed approach to U.S. defense efforts in data and AI**. David
Spirk, the departing Chief Data Officer of the Pentagon, made clear
yesterday that the office of the Chief Digital and AI Officer (CDAO), in
addition to its other functions, will be the successor organization for
and replace DoD's much-touted Joint Artificial Intelligence Center
(JAIC). While the]{.underline} JAIC symbolized DoD's efforts to get
smart on AI beginning in 2018, the integration of data and AI represents
a maturation of the U.S. AI approach---one that elevates the importance
of AI in national defense. The JAIC itself was not as important as what
the JAIC stood for---**[DoD's commitment to U.S. defense AI
leadership]{.underline}**. In paving the way forward and getting AI on
the agenda, the JAIC succeeded. [From this point on, a more cohesive
approach to AI and data through the CDAO is more likely to accelerate AI
adoption throughout the U.S. military because it links DoD's AI efforts
with]{.underline} data, the fuel AI requires. [For U.S. defense AI
adoption, in particular, aligning these organizations could be
game-changing. Addressing DoD's siloed data, standardizing and improving
its quality and access, is a precondition to having the data necessary
to train algorithms for many defense uses, and any future technologies
that rely on collecting, processing, and using information]{.underline}.
Implementation will be critical and heavily dependent on two things.
First, to catalyze AI adoption, the CDAO will need to develop close
relationships with the military services and combatant commands. Second,
the CDAO will need to coordinate with DoD's research and development
organizations, such as the Defense Innovation Unit, leading on AI
experimentation and research. There is hard work ahead, but the new
organizational design is promising. The office of the CDAO brings
together previously independent components of DoD: the JAIC, the office
of the Chief Data Officer, the Defense Digital Service (DDS), and the
Office of Advancing Analytics (ADVANA). The office of the Chief Data
Officer is in charge of data management and coordination, DDS finds
digital solutions for internal data and security issues, and ADVANA
aggregates data and conducts data analytics. The combination of these
offices raised questions about whether an independent JAIC was necessary
for U.S. defense AI leadership. Departing CDO Spirk says that the CDAO
will be "taking the best parts of all the organizations it is overseeing
and redistributing them for faster and better decision-making." We
agree. At present, not only is DoD's data siloed but its AI efforts and
initiatives are as well. According to the company Govini, in FY21,
fifteen separate departments and organizations funded and worked on AI
and AI-adjacent technologies, often without formal coordination or
throughlines. This has led to redundancies, gaps, inconsistencies in
application and access to data and resources, and an overall hodge-podge
of AI efforts. [DoD has acknowledged this and is making organizational
changes necessary to accelerate AI adoption even more by restructuring
its AI approach from the ground up]{.underline}. Now, CDAO will have
teams working on policy and governance, technology development, and
rolling out data and AI for the Pentagon and the military services, to
avoid bureaucratic duplication and confusion that could undermine the
CDAO's overall authority. In particular, bringing the data and AI teams
[together will improve the data DoD needs for AI development. Some might
fear that the reorganization of the JAIC's functions within the CDAO
means the United States is not as committed to the role of AI in the
future of U.S. national defense.]{.underline} Based on current
information, this concern is misplaced. First, the JAIC was created so
the U.S. military could effectively take advantage of the way AI will
shape the future of war. It succeeded in many ways. Recognition of the
importance of AI for the future of U.S. defense, and national security
in general, is much more widespread. The JAIC made headway on AI
adoption and data literacy, with initiatives like "AI 101," and on the
data integration issue, as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Data
Initiative (AIDA). The military services are investing more in AI and
related technologies such as autonomous systems. This, ironically, makes
an independent JAIC less necessary. Renewing America Ideas and
initiatives for renewing America's economic strength. Email Address View
all newsletters \> Second, the JAIC has also faced challenges that the
CDAO approach can address. The JAIC had multiple missions, including
advising DoD on AI adoption, funding AI research, and building AI tools
itself. The JAIC also lacked the authority to advance military service
adoption of AI on its own, or to itself transform the connection between
AI and overall DoD policy and strategy. The JAIC ended up arguably not
policy-focused enough to lead on policy, and not technically equipped
enough to lead on algorithm development. While the JAIC encouraged AI
investment within DoD, its existence also highlighted how the
uncoordinated DoD AI portfolio required even more organization. The CDAO
approach will address some of these issues by fusing DoD data and AI
efforts, as will a growing focus on AI in other DoD components, from
Research & Engineering on the technology development side to OSD-Policy
(Office of the Secretary of Defense Policy) on the strategy and
governance side. Third, it is difficult to get things immediately right
when it comes to converting emerging technologies into adopted
innovations, especially for conservative institutions like militaries.
We think about experimentation as a critical part of how the technology
invention process works, but the same is true when it comes to
transforming organizations. Given the way data access and integration
are essential to innovation, consolidating data and AI, rather than
having a specific JAIC only [focused on AI, will make technological
adoption across DoD more likely]{.underline}. While it will hopefully
spur AI forward within the department, subsuming the JAIC into the CDAO
does come with some risks. Currently, there is a widespread
understanding that AI is essential for U.S. success in strategic
competition and defense leadership. However, we may be taking the
prioritization of AI for granted, and future DoD leaders might have a
different perspective even if the capabilities of AI tools continue to
mature and advance. If that were to happen, the absence of an
independent JAIC could lead to a withering of focus on AI, and a
downplaying of its importance and relevance, just at the key moment
advances in algorithms become more relevant for many military functions.
Reward requires risk, especially when it comes to innovation with
emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Technology
development is not a linear process and often involves failure along the
way. Innovation becomes even more challenging when it requires
organizational change to facilitate adoption. Saying goodbye to the JAIC
will be bittersweet---the JAIC played a critical role in advancing the
U.S. military's emphasis on AI and set the table for what is next.
Moving forward, however, bringing the JAIC into the CDAO will create a
more integrated approach to AI and data that is likely to help the
United States achieve defense AI leadership.

#### Counterplan can't solve hybrid warfare - DoD key to harden capabilities and deter cyber attacks

[Another challenge will be getting the right interagency trainers in the
right country at the right time.]{.underline} With no overall
decision-maker across the interagency other than the President,
organizations will have to choose to contribute to the effort versus
being compelled to contribute. [**In a resource-constrained
environment**, the ability of agencies to surge people forward will
remain difficult.]{.underline} A [potential **DoD** contribution in this
area would be to **leverage the unique capabilities and relationships**
that exist in the National Guard State Partnership Program
(SPP]{.underline}). Although it would not be a systemic fix, the
National Guard frequently has citizen soldiers who have unique skills
from their civilian life that would transfer over to assisting with FID
efforts. Stereotypically, there are a high number of police officers in
the Guard who would have the ability to train in civil disturbance
response. [Information technology professionals would also be invaluable
assets in assisting the Allies with **hardening** their **networks
against Russian cyberattacks**.]{.underline} Additional funding and
authorities would be required to effectively pursue this course of
action but, in the short term, [the National Guard could assist with
filling this gap]{.underline}. [The relationships already built through
years of the SPP would serve to enhance this type of
training.]{.underline}

[The United States must also take into account the nature of the threat
and the operational environment facing each ally when it considers
training and equipping efforts]{.underline}. Each ally will use their
forces in a manner informed by culture, history, geopolitics, and other
factors, which ideally should shape the scope and breadth of U.S.
efforts. For example, [FID activities could enable the Baltic States in
their efforts to counter ambiguous threats ultimately emanating from
Moscow, but U.S. planners must be cognizant of Baltic State
sensitivities toward their Russian-speaking populations]{.underline}. A
large amount of the recommended FID training is already taking place
under EUCOM's TSC efforts. [**What is currently lacking is a
synchronized interagency effort** that is focused on building national
resiliency as a component of an overall country specific
strategy.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- DoD key -- Funding

#### DoD is better -- they have the budget flexibility key to solve

**Epstein and Rosen 18** (Susan B. Epstein, Specialist in Foreign
Policy. Liana W. Rosen, Specialist in International Crime and
Narcotics,"U.S. Security Assistance and Security Cooperation Programs:
Overview of Funding Trends" Congressional Research Service,"
Congressional Research Service, Feb. 1, 2018,
https://crsreports.congress.gov R45091, WC)

Moreover, funding data for security assistance and data on historical
security assistance funding are incomplete. [Although DOS has long been
required to track most security assistance funding by aid account and on
an individual country basis, DOD has not]{.underline}. As a result,
comparisons between security assistance funding provided by both
departments are challenging, and totaling the two may leave gaps.

The 115th Congress is continuing scrutiny and debate on security
assistance matters. [Within the **Department of State**, Foreign
Operations, and Related Programs FY2018 budget request, the
Administration is seeking to]{.underline} reduce [international security
assistance by about \$2.3 billion, or 24.4%.]{.underline} [Each of the
security assistance programs would be reduced by amounts ranging from 9%
to more than 54%.]{.underline} [In addition, the Administration proposes
making changes to security assistance programs, such as **designating
95%** of the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program to four
countries]{.underline}. [The r**emaining 5% of the funds**, rather than
being made available on a grant basis globally as FMF is currently
implemented, would be made available to all other countries with a
combination of grant and loan assistance]{.underline} to be coordinated
with DOD. Congress is also debating a possible increase of Overseas
Contingency Operations (OCO) funds for defense and nondefense, including
for funding security assistance activities in FY2018.5

Currently, [**there is no DOD budget request** for security cooperation
programs and activities that is **comparable** **to the Department of
State**]{.underline}, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs FY2018
budget request for State Department-managed security assistance
accounts. Soon, however, this may change; Section 1249 of the FY2017
NDAA added a new section to Title 10 of the U.S. Code, requiring the
President, beginning with the FY2019 budget, to submit a formal,
consolidated budget request for all DOD's security cooperation efforts,
including the military departments and, as practicable, by country or
region and by authority.

### 2AC -- CP fails -- Staffing

#### DoS is structurally flawed and can't solve -- lack of talent and funding 

**Zeya and Finer 20** (Uzra S. Zeya, CEO and president of the Alliance
for Peacebuilding, a network of more than 130 organizations working in
over 180 countries to end conflict through peaceful means. Jon Finer,
adjunct senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign
Relations, "Revitalizing the State Department and American Diplomacy,"
Council on Foreign Relations, No. 89, November 2020,
<https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/csr89_final.pdf>,
WC)

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that [principled
**American leadership has waned** but remains in demand around the
world]{.underline}. Moreover, America's network of international
relationships is its foremost strategic asset, even as the agency
charged with advancing U.S. interests through diplomacy---the
[Department of State (DOS)--- has fallen into a deep and **sustained
period of crisis**]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing
assumption: that the current crisis offers an opportunity to address
this predicament and revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the
decades-long failure to implement essential reforms---and even in the
face of sustained hostility from the current administration---diplomacy
remains the best tool the United States has to advance its foreign
policy interests.

The role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid
the onslaught it has suffered under the Donald J. [Trump
administration]{.underline}, which has [treated American diplomats and
diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of the challenges
facing the DOS have existed for decades]{.underline}. [Deficits in
diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization are endemic to
the State Department as an institution, and a diminished policy role for
career officials persisted under previous administrations]{.underline}.
Too often, leaders from both major parties have taken public support for
U.S. leadership in the world for granted without making a strong enough
case to the American public for why it is essential. Concrete steps can,
and should, be taken solely through executive action in the first year
of an administration committed to revitalizing American diplomacy, with
thought to cementing change through legislation.

The most [pressing challenges facing the State Department]{.underline}
[include]{.underline} a twenty-first-century [policy environment
tha]{.underline}t has, in some priority areas, [evolved beyond the core
competencies of most Foreign and Civil Service officers and an
institution hollowed out by three years of **talent
flight,**]{.underline} [mired in excessively layered structure, and
**resistant to reform.**]{.underline} Perhaps most important, they
include the multigenerational challenge of a [diplomatic workforce that
falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves,]{.underline} particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising
its effectiveness and [fostering a **homogeneous and risk-averse
culture**]{.underline} [that **drives out** rather than cultivates fresh
**perspectives**]{.underline}. [The State Department today risks
**losing the "war for talent**,"]{.underline} [not only to the private
sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to inflexible
career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack of
commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered by Congress's** failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation]{.underline}, [leading to **budgetary
pressures** and **diminishing DOS's status** i]{.underline}n the
hierarchy of national security agencies rather than reinforcing the
nation's paramount foreign policy institution.

In an era in which the United States' military and economic advantages
over its nearest rivals are eroding and the more than \$5 trillion spent
in the U.S. war on terrorism since 9/11 has corresponded with a fivefold
increase in global terrorist attacks annually, alliances and
relationships with partners around the world are ever-important
components of U.S. national power.1 [In recent years]{.underline}, for a
range of reasons, the [United States' international relationships have
**atrophied** along with its diplomatic capacity to leverage them
against the threats and opportunities it faces]{.underline}. The
profoundly challenging moment at home--- interrelated crises of public
health, economic prosperity, and racial justice---is all the more reason
to take stock of how to participate in the wider world, not turn away
from it.

#### The DoS is ill-staffed to undergo a major AI crusade now

#### Buble 20 Courtney Buble, staff correspondent who covers federal management, oversight, contracting and regulations, "Watchdog Finds Serious Staffing and Leadership Problems at State Department", JANUARY 23, 2020, https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2020/01/watchdog-finds-serious-staffing-and-leadership-problems-state-department/162621/

[The State Department's mission is compromised by "staff shortages,
frequent turnover, poor leadership, and inexperienced and undertrained
staff]{.underline}," the department's inspector general warned in a new
report. "Workforce management issues are pervasive, affecting programs
and operations domestically and overseas and across functional areas and
geographic regions," the watchdog
[reported](https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/fy_2019_ig_statement_on_department_management_challenges.pdf)
Wednesday. [The [16-month hiring
freeze](https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2018/05/after-16-months-state-department-ends-hiring-freeze/148219/) imposed
by the Trump administration in early 2017 continues to affect operations
and morale]{.underline}, the IG found, noting that department officials
anticipate it will take until 2021 to fully recover from its impact. All
38 bureaus and offices that responded to the IG's survey and 97% of the
embassies and consulates reported that the hiring freeze had either a
somewhat negative or very negative effect on employee morale and
welfare. "[Employees told OIG that the hiring freeze contributed to
excessive workloads, and the lack of transparency about the objectives
intended to be achieved by the hiring freeze caused some to be concerned
about losing their jobs,"]{.underline} the IG reported. Not all
workforce problems can be attributed to the hiring freeze, however. The
report cited challenges at the U.S. embassy in Nassau, Bahamas, stemming
from senior leadership vacancies that date back years---[the embassy has
been without a permanent confirmed ambassador since November
2011]{.underline}. At the same embassy, [the acting director of the
Office of Foreign Mission was "overburdened and
overwhelmed"]{.underline} from holding three positions and there was a
disproportionate workload from the realignment of other personnel. In
addition to staffing shortages, ["under-qualified staff is an issue that
frequently intersects with the department's difficulties managing and
overseeing contracts,"]{.underline} the IG said. For example, [in Iraq,
there was a lack of qualified employees to serve as contracting officer
representatives and, in India, officers in charge of human rights and
counterterrorism did not have the necessary training. ]{.underline}In
its response to the IG's findings, State agreed that it is "critically
important" to maintain adequate staffing levels and said the department
has made significant progress: "Under Secretary Pompeo's leadership,
currently the department is just 1% shy of its goal to have over 13,000
Foreign Service employees by January 2020, with nearly 12,800 FS staff
on board as of October 2019." The department also aims to increase civil
service hiring by about 7%, and is taking steps to improve retention and
recruitment. Beyond staffing and training, the [IG also cited a number
of examples of poor leadership. At the Bureau of International
Organization Affairs, which has 11 offices that carry out U.S. policy in
the United Nations and other international organizations, the IG found
allegations of political appointees disrespecting, retaliating against,
and harassing career staff.]{.underline} Compounding the problems,
leadership failed to address the issues. At the Libreville Embassy in
Gabon, Africa, the problems were rife: a senior leader's verbal
outbursts rattled staff; [supervisors failed to address poor
performance; and the deputy chief of mission urged staff to find a job
for his spouse, which possibly violated the anti-nepotism
policy.]{.underline} "The department acknowledges that combatting a
toxic workplace starts at the top; holding leadership accountable is key
to maintaining a productive and mission-focused workplace," State said
in its response.

[A growing, bipartisan number of lawmakers are expressing alarm over
anticipated personnel cuts at the State Department]{.underline}, saying
they have contributed to plummeting morale and will undermine diplomacy
and foreign policy for years to come. In the latest example, Sens.
Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) urged Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday to lift a hiring freeze and promote
experienced Foreign Service officers, requesting in a letter more
details about Tillerson's reorganization plan. Citing [reports
of declining morale, recruitment and retention levels, the senators
wrote that \"America\'s diplomatic power is being weakened internally as
complex, global crises are growing externally.\"]{.underline}
Tillerson\'s management decisions, they say, \"threaten to undermine the
long-term health and effectiveness of American diplomacy.\" The letter
reflects mounting concern on Capitol Hill and among foreign policy
experts about the **[loss of experienced diplomats]{.underline}** under
the Trump administration. On Tuesday, the Republican and Democratic
heads of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said the State
Department's cuts are endangering the nation. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin
(D-Md.) called the cuts a risk to national security and a "high-level
decapitation of leadership." "Folks, this situation is alarming," Cardin
said. "We put our country in danger." \[[Senators sharply question State

[The Office of Management and Budget has directed the State Department
to slash its almost 76,000 employees by 8 percent]{.underline}. To meet
that goal beyond normal attrition, the State Department is offering
buyouts and early retirement incentives of \$25,000 --- before taxes ---
to the first 641 eligible people who sign up by April 30. The buyouts
are being directed by the White House, not the seventh floor of the
Harry S. Truman Building where Tillerson sits. [Tillerson, who has
proposed cutting almost 30 percent of his budget, has described his
\"redesign\" of the State Department as his most important
task]{.underline}. He has disputed accounts of low morale in Foggy
Bottom, telling Bloomberg News recently, [\"I\'m not seeing it, I\'m not
getting
it.\"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/how-rex-tillerson-is-remaking-the-state-department)
But anecdotes abound in the agency's halls. Former ambassadors recalled
to Washington feel humiliated about being assigned menial jobs such as
reviewing Freedom of Information Act requests to clear a large backlog.
[Competition for overseas jobs has become fiercer as more young
diplomats seek to escape the turmoil for the next few
years]{.underline}. Many employees are still bristling over Trump's
assertion this month that while a number of [**key positions** at the
State Department still **have no nominees** to fill them,]{.underline}
"I'm the only one that matters" in formulating foreign policy. Job
opportunities also are shrinking at the U.S. Agency for International
Development, which recently notified 97 applicants for overseas postings
that the positions had been canceled, a tacit admission that the hiring
freeze will be in place for a long time. \[[USAID cancels jobs for

Nevertheless, State Department figures show that the number of employees
remains about the same as it was when Tillerson took the reins in early
February. Two-thirds of the 76,000 employees are locally employed in 276
missions around the world, leaving almost 14,000 Foreign Service
officers and almost 11,000 civil service employees. Although the hiring
freeze is still in effect, Tillerson has mitigated the impact by
approving more than 2,300 exemptions to the freeze as of late October.
Among the hires are about 300 new Foreign Service officers and almost
150 civil service employees. The numbers underscore a flight of
experienced leadership. Barbara Stephenson, who heads the American
Foreign Service Association union, wrote in a recent newsletter that
senior leaders are departing at a "dizzying speed." Among the figures
she cited, three of the five career ambassadors, the highest rank for
diplomats, have quit or retired since Tillerson took over. The number of
career ministers, the next level down, also has decreased, from 33 to
19. The next-level ministers are down by 62 diplomats, to 369, just
since Labor Day, "and are still falling," she wrote. Stephenson also
said that fewer Foreign Service officers are being recruited, and far
fewer are taking the entrance exam, although State Department officials
attribute this to an improving economy rather than a lack of interest.
Stephenson thinks the damage will be felt for years. "The talent being
shown the door now is not only our top talent but also talent that
cannot be replicated overnight," she wrote. This is not the first time
the State Department has been hit with big staff cuts. Under President
Bill Clinton, the department cut more than 2,000 employees, largely by
shuttering the U.S. Information Agency, and closed consulates in 26
foreign cities. USAID, which runs foreign aid programs, closed 23
overseas missions. According to congressional aides who deal with State
Department operations, the goal is again to reduce the ranks by 2,000
people, a proposed cut that has held steady since Trump came to office
and before Tillerson took over. [But the latest round of staff cuts is
far less transparent than previous efforts, with almost no details
provided to Congress]{.underline}, [they say. "It's being done behind
the scenes,]{.underline}" said one aide, speaking on the condition of
anonymity to offer frank insight about what they are hearing from State
Department employees who don't normally speak to Congress. "They dismiss
the legitimacy of Foreign Service officers. They started working at
breaking down morale from the get-go. There's not a lot of trust there."
In their letter to Tillerson, Shaheen and McCain cited the union's
statistics to paint a picture of a State Department floundering. Shaheen
sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and McCain heads the
Senate Armed Services Committee. "Taken together," they wrote,
"[questionable management practices at the Department of State; the
attitudes of some in the Administration on the value of diplomacy;
declining morale, recruitment and retention; the lack of experienced
leadership to further the strength and longevity of our nation's
diplomatic corps; and reports of American diplomacy becoming less
effective paint a disturbing picture."]{.underline}

[Congressional barriers exacerbated the **DOD-State Department

a Republican-controlled Congress skeptical of the State Department made
giving more resources to the department a nonstarter]{.underline}.39
Senior DOD officials urged Congress to grant the agency new authorities,
such as in a 2008 House Armed Services Committee hearing with the
secretary of defense and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.40 [Faced
with these constraints, the Obama administration opted to create more
authorities at the DOD]{.underline} through the annual must-pass
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Meanwhile, the Senate Foreign
Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees, with jurisdiction only
over the State Department's security assistance programs, did little to
correct the imbalance.41 According to one study before the recent
consolidation efforts, the [DOD managed 48 out of 50 new programs

more resources from Congress to conduct their own security assistance
programs, [giving them added flexibility to work with partners in the
field that their State Department counterparts lacked]{.underline}.45 A

assistance programs do not require any involvement from the State
