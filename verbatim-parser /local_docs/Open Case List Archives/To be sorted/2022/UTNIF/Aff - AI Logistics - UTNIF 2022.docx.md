The [tech]{.underline}nological [advancements in]{.underline} Artificial
Intelligence ([AI]{.underline}), machine learning, big data analytics,
robotics, quantum computing and virtual reality [have led to the rise in
use of autonomous systems in military applications. This is changing the
face of the battlefield by enabling new forms of military
functions,]{.underline} over and above the conventional systems, thus
enabling the execution of higher coercive actions. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [countries are]{.underline}
also [adopting such emerging technologies to maintain their strategic
advantage and to mitigate transnational threats]{.underline}.

R[ussia's offensive cyber hostilities and China's military adoption of
AI]{.underline} for augmenting its high-tech warfare mechanisms [have
emerged as the contributing factors for NATO to upscale its
technological efforts in Emerging and Disruptive
Technologies]{.underline} (EDTs). NATO is making ambitious investments
in EDTs to ensure interoperability and standardisation among member
states.

This Issue Brief takes stock of the current strategic surge by NATO in
AI adoption and its ongoing efforts to exploit EDTs for defence
innovation and adoption. It discusses the role of AI in contemporary
conflicts, specifically NATO's response to the Russia--Ukraine conflict,
and explores the vulnerabilities in the AI systems as well as the
challenges and limitations in AI adoption by NATO.

NATO's Technological Push

The US National Security Commission Report of 2021 states that [China is
leapfrogging to new technologies by investing in intelligentised warfare
like swarm drones and using AI for reconnaissance, electromagnetic
countermeasures and coordinated firepower strikes]{.underline}.1 [The US
is jointly working with its allies on the policy implications of such
new technology]{.underline}. It is also partnering with countries like
Canada, Denmark, Estonia, the UK, France and Norway, to work on military
standards on AI.2

In October 2021, [NATO formally adopted the first AI strategy on the
responsible military use of AI with three core tasks]{.underline}:
collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security.3 NATO's
strategy aims to accelerate the uptake of AI for military systems.4 The
six principles of the NATO's AI strategy include: Lawfulness,
Responsibility and Accountability, Explainability and Traceability,
Reliability, Governability and Bias Mitigation.5 This strategy aims to
protect, monitor and innovate AI and related disruptive technologies in
a phased manner to establish political support for AI military projects.

[The strategic surge in EDTs is driven by the accelerated investment
towards the military adoption and innovation of EDTs]{.underline} and
maintaining a sustainable innovation ecosystem that can be achieved
through civil--military collaboration. In [2021, NATO endorsed the
strategy on EDTs that included AI]{.underline} [and machine learning
among the seven identified key technologies]{.underline} (Data, AI,
Autonomy, Quantum, Space, Biotechnology, and Hypersonic).6 The strategy
plans to invest US\$ 1 billion in building test centres across Europe
and North America, focusing on emerging technologies like AI, Quantum
and hypersonics.7

In the NATO Summit held at Brussels in 2021, as a part of the NATO 2030
Agenda, NATO's new Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
(DIANA) was launched. It aims to maintain NATO's technological edge
compared to nations like China and Russia, which are challenging the
West with their accelerated investments to build technological capacity
and use offensive subversive measures.

DIANA has been assigned to manage the NATO Innovation Fund, receiving a
funding of US\$ 82.6 million a year for 15 years.8 It will explore the
future roadmap of implementation of advanced technologies and
competition to foster transatlantic cooperation.9 At present, there are
10 accelerator sites with more than 50 test centres in technological
hubs across the states.10 The NATO advisory group on EDTs is an external
body that advises NATO on the optimisation of its innovation efforts.
This group provides recommendations on improving collaboration and
partnerships with the private sector, industry, and academia. In
addition, there are other bodies like the NATO Advisory board, Allied
Command Transformation (ACT), NATO's Science and Technology Organisation
(STO), and NATO Communication and Information Agency (NCIA) that support
the alliance's adoption of deep technologies and EDTs.

NATO's AI Influence in Russia--Ukraine Confrontations

[AI has been a contributing agent in weaponising cyberspace and
augmenting cyberwarfare]{.underline} to the next level [in modern
battlefield scenarios.]{.underline} While some of its uses such as in
scaling of data analytics, data fusion, deep fakes, cyber defence have
matured, [its use in autonomous weapon systems and other complex
operational applications are at a nascent stage.]{.underline}

[AI has been aggressively used to spread disinformation in the
Russia--Ukraine War. Machine learning algorithms have been used to
amplify misleading and fake content]{.underline} on social media
platforms, like doctored videos of invading forces and fake live
streams. On the other hand, [it has also been used for anomaly
detection, identification of disinformation and for cybersecurity. AI
uses natural language processing algorithms, machine learning and deep
learning to identify anomalies in the text data, images and
videos.]{.underline}

[Russia is said to have used AI-enabled systems not only on the
battlefield but also in cyberspace, targeting the critical
infrastructures of Ukraine]{.underline}.11 [Russian troll farms have
been alleged to have used AI-enabled systems to generate human faces for
fake propagandist personas]{.underline} on social media platforms like
Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.12 [NATO countries have]{.underline}
also [used AI to help Ukraine counter such AI-based
attacks]{.underline}. [Private companies are also playing a role in the
unfolding AI battlespace]{.underline}. US-based companies like Snorkel
AI, a data science platform, has made its services accessible to federal
authorities for the detection of anomalous signals and adversary
communications in order to access high-value information for better
decision-making.13

Similarly, Ukraine has been given free access to Clearview AI facial
recognition software, which has a database of 2 billion photos crawled
from Russian social media platforms. This software is being used for the
detection of Russian forces and to identify the dead and gauge the
spread of disinformation in cyberspace.14 AI's analytical potential has
been tapped by companies even before the Russia--Ukraine war started. In
December 2021, a geospatial data firm, SpaceKnow, claimed to have
detected a military presence in Yelna, a Russian town.

**[The Russia--Ukraine conflict has become a test case for AI adoption
in modern warfare]{.underline}**. [The US is using the conflict as a
test-bed for many of its AI projects]{.underline} with the Pentagon's
'Maven' project having contributed to the detection and classification
of objects of interest from various drone footage through AI and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms. It has been reported that [the Pentagon has
been using AI and ML tools to collect a vast amount of data on the
Russia--Ukraine war and analyse it to learn and generate battlefield
intelligence about the Russian command and control
strategies]{.underline}.15

The [advanced AI-enabled systems with the]{.underline} US Department of
Defense ([DoD]{.underline}) are said to have been used [for overseeing
the battlefield and collecting and archiving signals
intelligence]{.underline}. It was stated at the Defense One's Genius AI
Summit in April 2022 that all [this information will be fed into systems
for training of machine learning algorithms to support future
decision-making processes]{.underline}.16 It is believed that [the US
and NATO allies have already built such AI-enabled cyber weapons and
defences]{.underline}, information about which is said to be highly
classified.17

#### NATO is key to countering this new front of modern warfare -- absent adoption multiple theaters of conflict make escalation likely

Changes And A Transformed International Security Environment" Nato
Decision-Making In The Age Of Big Data And Artificial Intelligence, Nato
Allied Command Transformation Università Di Bologna Istituto Affari
Internazionali

[Digital revolution has substantially transformed the world we live
in]{.underline}, providing great opportunities but also [making
societies more vulnerable and transforming the meaning of]{.underline}
state [borders. Tech]{.underline}nology [makes]{.underline} external
[interferences cheaper, faster and all-encompassing:]{.underline}
citizens can potentially become direct targets of information warfare,
[all members of a society can be part of conflicts one way or
another]{.underline}. [From advanced weaponry to command and control,
most security-related domains are undergoing deep transformations as
data availability and transmission increase exponentially]{.underline}.
This is especially true as [the emergence of so-called hybrid tactics
contributes to universalize the battlefield]{.underline}. Also,
[attackers may lose control of their offensive cyber weapons, and
'collateral damages' across the private sector and the public worldwide
might be more and more difficult to contain]{.underline}. Less visible,
yet important [challenges connected with]{.underline} Information
Communication Technologies ([ICTs]{.underline}) also
[exist]{.underline}. For instance, [data overload can create problems
for decisionmakers that are unable to detect important
signals.]{.underline} [Losing sight of how machines make their
calculations]{.underline} -- a somewhat inherent feature of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) -- [can hinder deeper understanding of phenomena as
well as learning]{.underline}, besides having dense ethical
implications.

A crucial question for Western societies and governments is how to deal
with technological changes by exploiting their many benefits while
managing to limit their risks. Broadly speaking, [observers have long
noticed the potentialities of technologies in the security domain:
better]{.underline} situational [awareness, early warning]{.underline}
against threats and risks, [the ability to prevent]{.underline} and/or
stop [attacks]{.underline} to happen, [the use of technology against the
adversaries' own technologies, and eventually deterrence of high-end
hybrid warfar]{.underline}e or, at least, the increase of resilience
against it. In particular, [in order to harness the potential of new
tech]{.underline}nologies, [higher levels of security are
needed.]{.underline} While [internet]{.underline} is unfortunately not
secure by design, it [has to be somehow retrofit to guarantee a certain
level of protectio]{.underline}n -- for instance [by avoiding a single
point of failure]{.underline}, developing better firewalls, etc.
Ultimately, the digital revolution poses challenges to decision makers
both as potential users of new technologies and as leaders of targeted
societies. Learning to achieve political aims through the support of
technological innovations and at the same time acquiring the ability to
prevent and manage interferences, if not attacks, have become paramount.

However, [achieving such results is not only about engineering.
Technologies need ad hoc governance]{.underline}, organizations and
skilled users to properly function. Actually, history is full of
examples of good technologies that were improperly used and/or unable to
provide the expected gains. Therefore, [a joint, multi-disciplinary
efforts is needed to think and manage technologies in a more
comprehensive and secure way across various domains]{.underline}. For
instance, the very same design of AI needs exchanges with social
scientists in order to limit analytical biases and increase the quality
of data that will then be processed through Machine Learning (ML).
Moreover, many public policies involve technologies with a strong
security dimension. [This is one of the main reasons security standards
should be harmonized across individual government's policies as well as
among Allies]{.underline}: [this is what has been leading NATO's renewed
efforts on standardization beyond the strictly military
perimeter]{.underline}, for instance towards the 5G domain.

[While digital technologies continue to dramatically increase in scope
and relevance, they are deeply embedded into the broader geopolitical
framework, with the re-emergence of multipolarism and looming great
power confrontation]{.underline}. This connection has to be discussed
and understood as it affects not only security but also economic and
technological domains. [The globalized supply chain of technology
building block entails vulnerabilities and dependencies on unreliable
supplier]{.underline}s. Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) in hightech
companies, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and critical
infrastructures are guided not only by an economic rationale but also by
a politico-military one, and have to be monitored accordingly. C[yber
space and]{.underline}, partly, [outer space are de facto unregulated
global commons where the ability to set regulations and standards could
be a matter of competition and/or cooperation among major
countries]{.underline} worldwide. The notions of 'whole-of-government'
and 'whole-of-society' approaches confirm that these problems should be
dealt with comprehensive strategies.

[Great and middle powers increasingly rely on stand-off
weapons]{.underline}, both physical and cyber ones, [able to create
damages rapidly, worldwide and on a large scale]{.underline}. **[This
trend is going to be accelerated by AI.]{.underline}** Some countries
are adopting principles on responsible use of AI, including in terms of
control and accountability. However, [a vacuum remains in international
law. And such vacuum is more difficult to fill because of the
aforementioned interaction between geopolitics and
tech]{.underline}nologies. [Different powers conceive
technology]{.underline} -- and what it can bring them in terms of
benefits -- [in different ways, and they are unwilling to regulate
internationally this field of competition and warfare.]{.underline}

[In such a rapidly changing security environment,]{.underline} NATO and
allied activities directly or indirectly defend citizens' daily life. In
the age of Big Data, AI and the pervasive use of internet, [the
challenge is to defend the ever-expanding information environment while
maintaining all its functionalities.]{.underline}

Against this backdrop, in the post-Cold War period NATO somehow missed
the opportunity to involve Allies and partners in a debate on how
defense technologies and norms have been changing with the ICT
revolution. The result is that the web is not secure by design, and both
private and public actors struggle to mitigate risks and threats in an
unregulated environment where attackers are structurally advantaged over
defenders. Today, [the Alliance should not miss the opportunity twice
vis-à-vis Big Data, AI and, broadly speaking, the current and
future]{.underline} [(r)evolution of ICT]{.underline}. The aim of the
2020 Academic Conference was precisely to explore some fundamental
aspects of the challenges and opportunities posed by technological
change to the security environment in which NATO works. Below follows a
brief introduction to NATO, cyber defense and three sets of issues
investigated in closer detail: Big Data and decision-making; hybrid
threats to allied decision-making; AI adoption by allied armed forces.

NATO, Cyber Defense and Emerging Disruptive Technologies [NATO begun to
focus on cyber defense already in 2008, and over time it built up
institutions and frameworks to deal with it from a well-limited military
perspective]{.underline}. Allies recognized a cyber attack could lead to
the activation of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty on collective
defense. In that case, there is a clear procedure where NATO authorities
take the military lead. Article 5 does not prescribe a clear procedure
factoring in new technologies. On a regular basis, headquarters and the
Secretary General cabinet carry on exercises on situational awareness,
whereby they receive intelligence and military advice and are immersed
in an information space with blue and red teams. Moreover, every two
years, there is a large-scale exercise involving national governments.
[These efforts aim to build familiarity with the technology-related
security challenges.]{.underline} [However, further evolution of
AI-based cyber attacks can constitute an increasing threat for
datareliant organizations such as NATO.]{.underline}

Beyond cyber defense, the Alliance started to work on the broader issue
of Emerging Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) only in 2019, by setting up
an innovation board co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary General and the
Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. Moreover, a dedicated unit was
created in the Emerging Security Challenge Division. Two White Papers
were produced, respectively on AI and on autonomous weapons, to provide
inputs for Allies' decisions in this regard. The current NATO approach
is based on the motto "adopting and adapting", entailing five
complimentary goals: (1) better understand emerging disruptive
technologies; (2) properly look at their implications for defense; (3)
decide about their use; (4) mitigate their risks; and (5) exploit their
advantages.

Noticeably, [the traditional defense industrial ecosystem entails long
planning, oligopolistic supply and monopsonic demand. Over time, it was
characterized by substantial technology transfers from the military to
the civilian domain]{.underline} (the so-called 'spin offs'), including
the very same embryonic Internet. In recent years, [several new
technologies with relevant implications for security and defense have
been emerging from a different ecosystem, marked by bottom-up
innovation, a rapid development-to-market cycle, and a technology
transfer from the civilian to the military domain.]{.underline} As a
result, with the relevant exception of certain space assets and
hypersonic technologies, [the civilian sector is increasingly developing
into the innovation driver, and defense one has become quite
dependent]{.underline}. Such a shift implies that priority setting for
current and future technology development is not substantially driven by
states anymore. In the US, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) struggles to develop a dialogue with the private
sector gravitating around the Silicon Valley to embrace certain research
lines. The [NATO]{.underline} Industry Partnership on the cyber domain
[serves as platform for Alliance's officials and industrial
representatives to exchange notes, yet major ICT players do not seem
very interested in having such a structured dialogue]{.underline}.
Moreover, investments in these technologies require venture capitals and
the acceptance of the risks to fail -- something which usually states,
and particularly Ministries of Defense, cannot afford. The US, the UK,
France, Germany, the Netherlands and other Allies made certain steps to
adapt their defense innovation models in these domains, but this is only
the beginning of a long transformation process.

As a matter of fact, [adapting to emerging and disruptive technologies
is harder for some Allies than others. The related risk is moving
towards a multi-layer Alliance, with some member states holding new
technologies, and others not having such advantage]{.underline}.
Ideally, [the solution would be to collectively adopt certain new
technologies, but this represents a challenge for the NATO Defence
Planning Proces]{.underline}s[, military procurement, common funding,
etc. A technology group of experts has been appointed to reflect upon
issues including but not limited]{.underline} to these, and the
Secretary General will probably present a report to the next summit of
Heads of state and governments.

#### Incorporating AI into military logistics and sustainment reinvigorates the defense industrial base -- that ensures supply chains capable of rapid response

**Low 2022** - junior fellow at NDIA

By Thomas Low 3/25/2022 "U.S. Must Ready Defense Industrial Base to Aid
NATO"
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2022/3/25/us-must-ready-defense-industrial-base-to-aid-nato

[People across the globe have witnessed first-hand Russia's renewed
aggression towards Ukraine]{.underline}, a conflict resulting in the
largest land war in Europe since World War II. [If the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its NATO allies cannot
deter such action, it could be possible for similar scenes to occur
in]{.underline} other countries bordering Russia. A prime example are
[the Baltic states:]{.underline} Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Though
now tied to the West through economic cooperation, as well as military
alliances such as NATO, these nations previously existed as part of the
Russian sphere of influence. They have sizable Russian minorities who
speak Russian and consume Russian news. Recent events have put paired
action to what has up to now been mere verbal antagonism toward NATO's
eastern expansion. While a conflict with NATO members would result in a
wholly different set of ramifications, member countries should not fail
to take the steps required to deter wider regional conflict. [In order
to adequately remain vigilant]{.underline} against any possible
scenario, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates in its own right
[needs to take the steps necessary to prepare its defense industrial
base]{.underline}. Yet an important question remains: What is the
current state of this vital economic sector? To answer this, one should
examine [the National Defense Industrial Association's]{.underline}
annual [report]{.underline}, "Vital Signs 2022: The Health and Readiness
of the Defense Industrial Base." While the report does not assess
individual defense companies, it does analyze the environment in which
they are asked to operate. This year's report [assigned the industrial
base an overall "unsatisfactory, failing" grade of 69.]{.underline}
While this score is obviously disappointing, for the purposes of this
analysis, [two]{.underline} particular [sections are]{.underline}
particularly [relevant]{.underline}. First, "[Production Capacity and
Surge Readiness" capabilities dropped]{.underline} a significant 15
points compared to the previous year. This [can partly be attributed to
the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic but is nonetheless a cause
for serious concern]{.underline}. [When coupled with the current status
of NATO's Eastern European members]{.underline}, the problems are only
compounded. [In the Baltic region]{.underline}, for example, [NATO lacks
a significant military presence]{.underline}. In January of this year
alone, there were only 4,000 NATO troops stationed in the Baltic states,
without any accompanying tanks or warplanes. [It would be difficult and
time-consuming to try and surge much-needed personnel into the Baltic
region should it prove necessary.]{.underline} [The lack of current
personnel and infrastructure, coupled with existing capacity challenges
in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [would place NATO in an
unenviable position if an industrial and deployment surge became
necessary]{.underline}. A massive effort would be required as the
industrial base maneuvers to produce countless weapon systems and
munitions. There is also another factor that must be considered when
addressing the build-up of deterrence forces in NATO member territories.
This is the development of new and evolving technologies. In the
"Emerging Technologies" section, the report details several
modernization priorities that can deliver technical capabilities needed
to cope with an evolving security environment. Of those areas,
hypersonics stand out as one technology particularly crucial to keeping
pace with other emerging great powers. By definition, hypersonic weapons
are those which can travel more than five times the speed of sound, or
Mach 5. For numerous nations, including the United States, they
represent the next frontier in missile technology. However, for far too
long, research and development necessary to cultivate this technology
have been lacking. In "Vital Signs 2022," Congressional interest in
these capabilities expressed in committee hearings decreased six
percent. This is a troubling trend, especially when considering the
significant resources near-peer adversaries are devoting to developing
this technology. Hypersonic systems, which could be utilized for a
variety of deterrence purposes, remain a crucial element within NATO's
security apparatus. Yet as previously mentioned, efforts have been
neglected for far too long. Development has accelerated and then been
halted while developmental testing has happened at a painfully slow rate
if at all, resulting in years of slow progress allowing other nations to
leap ahead. Russia recognizes this, as their Defense Minister Sergei
Shoigu recently confirmed hypersonic missiles will make up the core of
his nation's non-nuclear deterrence. Russia's key strategic partner,
China, is also cognizant of these developments, having accelerated its
own hypersonic program through extensive investments and testing---over
10 times the rate of U.S. testing. Since the Soviet Union's collapse,
there has been a relative peace in Europe. Gone were thought to be the
days of vast European land wars that displaced populaces and reduced
cities to rubble. This collective idea has been shattered by the recent
actions of Russia in the Ukraine. At the same time, competition
continues to heat up in the Western Pacific as China notes the Western
response to aggression. When NATO was established in 1949, its purpose
was to provide a collective security measure in the event of future
conflict with the Soviet Union and later its Warsaw Pact allies. It
sought not to conquer or provoke additional tension. The same principles
exist today, as NATO members seek to secure their future and establish a
peaceful existence. To achieve this goal, especially in more
geographically sensitive regions, [the U.S. and its NATO allies should
closely examine current capabilities in order to deter
future]{.underline} costly [confrontations]{.underline}. [A renewed
priority must be placed on industrial capacity and capabilities,
investments in emerging technologies, and force posture.]{.underline}

to modernize military logistics and supply chain security"
https://www.ey.com/en_us/strategy/four-actions-to-modernize-military-logistics-and-supply-chain-security

[For the US to remain in stride with warfighting demands]{.underline}
across vast distances, **[now is the time to rethink US military
logistics and integrate commercial supply chain]{.underline}** practices
and **[capabilities]{.underline}**. [Defense operations can catch
up]{.underline} with two decades of rapid [advances in technology that
have enabled commercial supply chains globally]{.underline}. These
Industry 4.0 technologies, including **[artificial
intelligence]{.underline}** and machine learning used in predictive
analytics, supply chain intelligence and more autonomous functionality,
**[can quickly bridge gaps and increase speed in contested defense
scenarios]{.underline}**. [The result can be greater cargo
visibility]{.underline}, [smarter warehousing and better transportation
utilization.]{.underline} C[hallenges during the COVID-19 pandemic
highlight the need for greater resiliency, responsiveness and military
supply chain visibility. The U.S. Navy can get ahead of economic, cyber
and other contested scenarios that could disrupt logistics.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DoD]{.underline}) [can make
the investment to re-architect a defense supply chain and logistics
infrastructure that fosters resilience, velocity and
agility]{.underline} at enterprise scale before the next major
challenge. History can inform new military supply chain partners
Throughout 20th century conflicts, **[the cornerstones of US military
dominance were an agile warfighting force; a defense industrial base
that excelled at research-driven manufacturing; and a global logistics
capability that set the bar for planning]{.underline}**, stockpiling and
large-scale transportation. [That logistics dominance]{.underline},
however, [is eroding as readily available tech]{.underline}nological
[tools enable potential adversary abilities to deny access and impede
sustainment operation]{.underline}s. In addition, [new disruptive and
asymmetric capabilities in the cyber and space domains have global
reach.]{.underline} At the same time, [hypersonic weapons put logistics
at risk from a great distance.]{.underline} Recent enemy cyber threats
to a US low-orbit satellite and to US energy pipeline infrastructure
show that attacks can be extremely focused and result in acute domestic
risk. [The US military can work more closely with commercial partners
and allies to identify vulnerabilities and build agility into critical
supply chains. In this military supply chain transformation, private
partnerships can foster greater diligence by tapping commercial supply
chain lessons and big data to ferret out solutions to major
issues]{.underline}, such as a lack of supply availability, limited to
no end-to-end visibility and a lack of resiliency. 1. Design a more
modern and agile IT infrastructure Design a more modern and agile IT
infrastructure to operate logistics when communications are compromised.
Systems can have multiple nodes and support deep, predictive analytics
that function afloat, ashore or at enterprise scale without
connectivity. [Many companies and federal agencies have created such
networks, which can be phased and adaptive when an IT system is
degraded.]{.underline} 2. Embrace better end-to-end (E2E) visibility
tools [Gaining better E2E visibility can start with a supply chain risk
management assessment that can expose risks at critical supply
points]{.underline}, including energy infrastructure, [as well as deep
relationships at resupply locations, at ports, and with allied and
commercial partners.]{.underline} A vulnerability assessment can expose
and remediate weaknesses among DoD partners, especially commercial and
foreign partners, and build agility across all supply classes. Another
E2E tool is the creation of a supply chain digital twin, a model to
generate predictive analysis and visualizations on potential supply
chain disruptions across the world. Built on real-time data, simulation,
machine learning and reasoning, a digital twin can improve the
decision-making process. 3. Predict real-time supply needs and create
surge capacity. By knowing what is needed when and where, AI can advance
predictive logistics and execute preplanned push logistics. [Commercial
industrial supply chain resiliency was lacking at the height of the
COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lessons in U.S. Navy supply chain
readiness. During supply surges in conflic]{.underline}t, when
cybersecurity breaches could disrupt the supply chain, [the Navy of the
future needs the ability to mobilize supply production at any
location]{.underline}, especially in the context of great power
competition. [The use of Industry 4.0 technology enablers at scale can
deliver data-driven insights to commanders and wrench turners
alike]{.underline}. In addition to forecasting with AI and machine
learning, this can include predictive maintenance and other
applications: Predictive logistics: Using machine learning, internet of
things data, natural language processing and advanced analytics to help
drive and operate the system in a more autonomous mode Process
optimization: Business process reengineering and modernization, which
can drive fundamental change, rather than applying incremental
improvement with new systems [There are also lessons to learn from the
US government and private industry coordination of medical supply chains
and logistics at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic]{.underline}. The
problem: critical medical supplies were largely produced outside the
United States[. After initial medical supply inventories were exhausted,
there was no ability to quickly expand production to meet the
need]{.underline}. [The critical lesson was that you can't immediately
surge what you don't have]{.underline}, even with the Defense Production
Act (DPA). The nation had limited visibility on medical supply
production, lacked surge contracts and lacked data infrastructure to
augment visibility on everything from raw materials to alternative
sources. However, [with private commercial supply data combined with
government COVID infection statistics, shipments eventually could be
distributed quickly and equitably]{.underline}. [The lessons showcase
that military supply chain leaders can get ahead of the next
challenge]{.underline} [and collaborate with the private
sector]{.underline}, and illustrate the need for greater DoD agility. A
contested logistics situation would be even more difficult than the
COVID-19 pressures on labor, materials sourcing, production and
delivery.

#### Great power conflict is inevitable absent leadership in the application of artificial intelligence 

Matthew **Kroenig 18**, Deputy Director for Strategy, Scowcroft Center
for Strategy and Security Associate Professor of Government and Foreign
Service, Georgetown University, 11/12/18, "Will disruptive technology
cause nuclear war?"
https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war/

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why [new technology might cause **nuclear
conflict**: by upending the existing balance of power among
nuclear-armed states. This latter concern is more probable and dangerous
and demands an immediate policy response.]{.underline}

For more than 70 years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and
many attribute this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of
mutually assured destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to
start a conflict because doing so will only result in its own
annihilation. The key to this model of deterrence is the maintenance of
secure second-strike capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy
nuclear attack and respond with a devastating counterattack.

Recently analysts have begun to worry, however, that new strategic
military technologies may make it possible for a state to conduct a
successful first strike on an enemy. For example, Chinese colleagues
have complained to me in Track II dialogues that the United States may
decide to launch a sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear
command and control, essentially turning off China's nuclear forces.
Then, Washington will follow up with a massive strike with conventional
cruise and hypersonic missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons.
Finally, if any Chinese forces happen to survive, the United States can
simply mop up China's ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile
defenses. China will be disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be
sitting on the shelf, untouched.

If the United States, or any other state acquires such a first-strike
capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be
tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to
use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped
out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem.

According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response
would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that might
threaten second-strike capabilities.

This way of thinking about new technology and stability, however, is
open to question. Would any US president truly decide to launch a
massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack because he or she thought
s/he could get away with it? And why does it make sense for the country
in the inferior position, in this case China, to intentionally start a
nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose? More important, this
conceptualization of how new technology affects stability is too narrow,
focused exclusively on how new military technologies might be used
against nuclear forces directly.

Rather, [we should think more broadly about how new technology might
affect global politics, and, for this, it is helpful to turn to
scholarly international relations theory]{.underline}. [The **dominant
theory** of the causes of war in the academy is the "**bargaining
model** of war." This theory identifies rapid shifts in the balance of
power as a primary cause of conflict.]{.underline}

International politics often presents states with conflicts that they
can settle through peaceful bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down,
war results. [Shifts in the **balance of power** are problematic because
they **undermine effective bargaining.**]{.underline} After all, [why
agree to a deal today if your bargaining position will be stronger
tomorrow?]{.underline} [And, a clear understanding of the military
balance of power can contribute to peace. (Why start a war you are
likely to lose?) But shifts in the balance of power muddy understandings
of which states have the advantage.]{.underline}

You may see where this is going. [New technologies threaten to create
potentially **destabilizing shifts** in the balance of
power.]{.underline}

For decades, stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US
military power. In recent years, however, the balance of power in Asia
has begun to shift, as **[China has increased its military
capabilities]{.underline}**. Already, [Beijing has become more assertive
in the]{.underline} region, claiming contested territory in the South
China Sea. And the results of Russia's military modernization have been
on full display in its ongoing intervention in Ukraine.

Moreover, [China may have the lead over the United States in emerging
technologies that could be **decisive** for the future of military
acquisitions and warfare, including]{.underline} 3D printing, hypersonic
missiles, quantum computing, 5G wireless connectivity, and [artificial
intelligence]{.underline} (AI). [And]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin is building new unmanned vehicles while ominously
declaring, "**Whoever leads in AI will rule the world."**]{.underline}

**[If China or Russia are able to incorporate new technologies into
their militaries before the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[then this could lead to the kind of rapid
shift in the balance of power that often causes war.]{.underline}**

[If Beijing believes emerging technologies provide it with a newfound,
local military advantage over the United States, for example, it may be
more willing than previously **to initiate conflict over
Taiwan**]{.underline}. And if Putin thinks new tech has strengthened his
hand, he may be more tempted to launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a
NATO member.

[Either scenario could bring these nuclear powers into direct conflict
with the United States, and once nuclear armed states are at war, there
is an **inherent risk** of **nuclear conflict** through limited nuclear
war strategies, nuclear **brinkmanship**, or simple **accident** or
**inadvertent escalation**]{.underline}.

This framing of the problem leads to a different set of policy
implications. [The concern is not simply technologies that threaten to
undermine nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but]{.underline},
rather, [any technologies that can result in a meaningful shift in the
broader balance of power.]{.underline} And **[the
solution]{.underline}** is not to preserve second-strike capabilities,
but to [**preserve prevailing power balances** more
broadly.]{.underline}

When it comes to new technology, this means that the United States
should seek to maintain an innovation edge. Washington should also work
with other states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new
set of arms control and nonproliferation agreements and export controls
to deny these newer and potentially destabilizing technologies to
potentially hostile states.

[These are no easy tasks, but the consequences of Washington losing the
race for technological superiority to its autocratic challengers just
might mean **nuclear Armageddon**]{.underline}.

#### Unrestrained great power competition causes extinction

**Litwak 2021** - Senior Vice President and Director of International
Security Studies, Wilson Center

Robert S. Litwak \"Geostrategic Competition and Climate Change: Avoiding
the Unmanageable\" September 15.
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/geostrategic-competition-and-climate-change-avoiding-unmanageable

Humanity faces two catastrophic, indeed existential, threats---climate
change and nuclear war. These risks play out before us as if on split
screen. On one side are the here-and-now impacts of climate change:
wildfires from Siberia to California to southern Europe, scorching "heat
domes" over the Pacific Northwest, and "once in a thousand years"
flooding in China. On the other, [heightened geostrategic competition
carrying the greatest risk of war between nuclear powers since the
depths of the Cold War]{.underline}: in the month of April 2021 alone,
[a Russian troop surge on the Ukraine border]{.underline} triggered an
"imminent crisis" alert in NATO while [Chinese naval vessels and bombers
conducted a largescale war-game encircling Taiwan]{.underline}. [Though
ostensibly discrete, the events playing out on the split screen are
linked]{.underline}. **[This new nexus between geostrategic competition
and climate change must be understood and integrated in policy if the
twin threats are to be averted]{.underline}**.¶ In his landmark book,
Hot, Flat, and Crowded, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman
stated that the central challenge of climate change to humanity is now
"to manage what is already unavoidable and avoid what will truly be
unmanageable." To that compelling formulation can be added a corollary
reflecting the new nexus: **[avoiding unconstrained geostrategic
competition is a prerequisite for managing the climate
threat.]{.underline}**¶ [The window for humanity to avoid unmanageable
climate change is narrowing]{.underline}. The United Nations'
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that global
temperatures will inexorably rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels by mid-century because of the projected level of
atmospheric carbon. The IPCC starkly warns that the [dire consequences
arising from a temperature increase beyond that point can only be
averted through prompt concerted global action to bend the curve and
sharply reduce atmospheric carbon]{.underline}. UN Secretary-General
António Guterres called the report a "code red for humanity." [China,
the **U**nited **S**tates, and Russia are]{.underline}, respectively,
[the first, second, and fourth largest carbon emitters.]{.underline}¶
Yet **[at the precise historical juncture when unprecedented global
cooperation is necessary to forestall catastrophe, the world is on the
brink of unconstrained geostrategic competition.]{.underline}** Indeed,
[U.S. relations with Russia and China are the worst they have been since
the end of the Cold War, with a recent Department of Defense policy
document warning of an "increased potential for regional conflicts
involving nuclear-armed adversaries ... and the potential for
adversarial nuclear escalation in crisis or conflict]{.underline}.\"¶
One could logically argue against a linkage---that if the great powers
have a mutual interest in averting a climate catastrophe then
cooperation in that area could be compartmentalized from geostrategic
tensions. But [the onset of unconstrained geostrategic competition
negates the possibility of compartmentalization]{.underline}.
Contrasting positions on the nexus---the linkage between geopolitical
competition and climate change---were evident in an exchange between
Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi and former Secretary of State John
Kerry, now the Biden administration's Special Presidential Envoy for
Climate during his visit to China in August 2021. [Wang warned that
cooperation on climate change "cannot possibly be divorced" from other
geopolitical tensions]{.underline}, while Kerry countered that climate
change is neither "a geostrategic weapon" nor "ideological"....but "a
global, not bilateral, challenge."¶ These contending perspectives divide
along political theorist Arnold Wolfers's classic dichotomy between
"possession goals" and "milieu goals." Possession goals relate to the
preservation or enhancement of a state's narrow national interest---for
example, in relation to territory or trade relations. In contrast,
milieu goals pursued by a state aim to shape and improve the
international political environment beyond parochial national
interest---which in this context relate to the fostering of favorable
conditions for concerted action on climate change.¶ Applying this
framework, the Chinese Foreign Minister's comment suggests that climate
change is viewed within the context of furthering conventional Chinese
possession goals---that cooperation on climate change can be leveraged
to gain advantage on another issue (such as Taiwan). Kerry's rejection
frames climate change as a milieu goal whose existential stakes
transcend any one state's national interests. Through Kerry, the Biden
administration has signaled its aspiration to eschew efforts by other
states to relegate climate change to just another issue in transactional
diplomacy.¶ Yet on a macro level---elevating climate change to a milieu
goal---**[the linkage between geostrategic competition and climate
change is unavoidable]{.underline}**. [Even if unconstrained
geostrategic competition does not lead to conflict that might itself
trigger catastrophic global destruction, virulent relations between the
United States and its great-power adversaries create a political
environment in which close cooperation on climate change becomes
difficult, if not impossible]{.underline}. [For that reason the
**avoidance of unconstrained geostrategic competition is a prerequisite
for** addressing **climate change**]{.underline}. To be sure, [avoidance
does not mean the **elimination of** geostrategic **competition**, but
rather, bounding it to **mitigate the risks of conflict through
effective management.**]{.underline}¶ Avoiding Unconstrained
Competition¶ [New **risk factors have brought the great powers to the
verge of unconstrained geostrategic competition**]{.underline}. An
understanding of those risks provides insight into how they can be
mitigated and thereby managed.¶ A New Calculus of Risk¶ [Contemporary
geopolitics is driven not by Cold War ideology, but by nationalism and
expansive assertions of state sovereignty. Nuclear powers are engaged in
strategic competition with the United States over the territorial status
quo in areas of vital interest---for China, Taiwan and the South China
Sea; for Russia, Ukraine and the periphery of the former Soviet
Union]{.underline}. This contrasts with the Cold War era in which the
superpowers engaged in competition in the regions of what was then
called the Third World, which were clearly of peripheral interest. [This
geostrategic competition runs the risk of war through inadvertent
escalation driven by miscalculation and misperception]{.underline}.¶
[The territorial dimension, which could be the occasion for great-power
conflict, is compounded by key developments affecting the nuclear
deterrent relationship between the United States and its great-power
adversaries.]{.underline} All the nuclear-weapon states have embarked on
ambitious force modernization programs, and they are developing
capabilities, such as low-yield nuclear weapons, which critics warn make
them more usable in a crisis. The Trump administration's Nuclear Posture
Review claimed that the Russians had adopted an "escalate to deescalate
posture" involving the first use of tactical nuclear weapons. Moreover,
military escalation has traditionally been conceived as progressing from
conventional to nuclear forces. [With the advent of new technologies,
however, escalation during a crisis would most likely occur in a
non-traditional domain]{.underline}---cyber or space. [Conflict
escalation could plausibly take the form of a cyberattack to interfere
with an adversary's communications with its nuclear systems or an attack
on reconnaissance satellites to blind an adversary]{.underline}. [These
developments could have the destabilizing consequence of creating an
incentive for one side or the other to take preemptive action during a
crisis.]{.underline}¶ Managed Competition¶ The
[contemporary]{.underline} pursuit of [strategic stability is
conditioned by]{.underline} the [recasting]{.underline} of the
traditional [tension between]{.underline} two Cold War dynamics. The
[first]{.underline} is the so-called "[stability-instability
paradox,"]{.underline} which captures the dynamic in which a nuclear
stalemate between adversaries may embolden lower-level aggression on the
regional level. The second is what Cold War strategist Albert
Wohlstetter described as the "delicate balance of terror" which
emphasized [the maintenance of a **stable and robust
deterrence**]{.underline}, [thereby removing any incentive for one power
or another to strike first in a crisis]{.underline}.¶ As during the Cold
War, **[this tension can be managed, but it cannot be
resolved]{.underline}**. [Key elements]{.underline}---some aspirational,
others operational, many surrounded by uncertainty---[will affect the
prospects for successful management]{.underline}:¶ Resolve/Manage
regional flashpoints---The best way to avoid conflict among
nuclear-weapon states is to redouble diplomatic efforts to address the
territorial disputes that could precipitate it. To be sure, if these
territorial issues were easy to resolve, they would have been. In some
instances, domestic politics in one or both parties may be an impediment
to resolution; in others, the discrete territorial issue may be a proxy
for a more deeply rooted source of enmity or grievance. If resolution is
not possible, conflict management may be. For example, the Code for
Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), to which both China and the United
States are signatories, may be a mechanism for managing maritime
tensions between their navies.¶ Maintain the residual arms control
architecture---The new START treaty has been extended until 2026 and
provides certainty and time for Russia and the United States to agree on
a successor arrangement and outstanding issues (such as non-strategic
nuclear weapons and engaging or taking Chinese capabilities into
account).¶ Do not blur conventional and nuclear operations to prevent
inadvertent escalation---Placing conventional warheads on ballistic
missiles, such as that envisioned through the "Conventional Prompt
Global Strike," has utility (the ability to reach any target on the
globe in under one hour), but runs the risk that Russia may perceive
(and respond to) the launch of a ballistic missile that it associates
with U.S. nuclear capabilities as the initiation of such an attack.
Another potential driver of inadvertent escalation, with implications
for both Russia and China, is the targeting of an adversary's
conventional capabilities that are co-located with its nuclear
capabilities.¶ Mitigate risks through strategic dialogue---In the
absence of an arms control architecture, each nuclear power in the
multipolar system will have strategic autonomy to structure its
offensive and defensive systems. All of the nuclear-weapon states have
long been uncomfortably ambivalent with vulnerability captured in the
acronym MAD---mutual assured destruction. But since the Cuban missile
crisis, assured retaliation---eliminating incentives for a surprise
first strike---has been the sine qua non of strategic stability. The
risk now is that an unconstrained arms race (unregulated numbers of
offensive and defensive systems, in tandem with new weapons technologies
and cross-domain threats to space and cyber assets) could revive those
incentives and undermine the deterrent relationships. In the past, arms
control negotiations provided a forum for strategic discourse. "On a
bilateral or a multilateral basis," scholars Christopher Chyba and
Robert Legvold argue, "the United States, Russia, and China should
pursue discussions intended to improve understanding of one another's
strategic concerns and views on which actions by an adversary would be
especially concerning or dangerous." The focus should be on negotiated
restraints (e.g., a ban on the deployment of anti-satellite weapons) to
enhance stability and reduce incentives for one side or the other to act
preemptively during a crisis.¶ Managing the Geopolitics of Climate
Change¶ When George Kennan, the diplomatic architect of U.S. containment
policy, declared the end of the Cold War, he explained that the Soviet
Union under Mikhail Gorbachev had evolved from a revolutionary state
into an orthodox great power---the country "should now be regarded
essentially as another great power, like other great powers." Kennan was
essentially arguing that Russia's post-Soviet foreign policy, stripped
of ideology, was a renationalized version of traditional Russian foreign
policy with strategic priorities starting with the "near abroad" of the
former Soviet republics abutting the West.¶ A "risen" China presents an
analogous case of an orthodox great power making assertive claims of
territorial sovereignty on its periphery. This new superpower is deeply
integrated into the global economy and presents a variegated challenge
in a way that Russia, a one-dimensional superpower, does not. [War
between the **U**nited **S**tates and China is not inevitable, but the
world's two dominant powers could mismanage their way into
it]{.underline}.¶ **[That Russia and China are orthodox great powers,
not revolutionary states seeking the overturn of the international
order, creates political space for the United States to initiate
strategic dialogues with them separately or together to lower tensions
and reduce the risks of conflict---thereby fostering a favorable
international milieu to address the exigencies of climate
change]{.underline}**.

US security thinking" New Atlanticist
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/a-multipolar-world-requires-more-adaptive-us-security-thinking/

[While the scale and volume of military interventions by China, Russia,
and Iran are]{.underline} reportedly [lower now than at the height of
Cold War, the]{.underline} increasing [risks of disruptive actions by
these state actors and their proxies in a multipolar world require
deterrence featuring]{.underline} robust [technological solutions, which
can only emerge from]{.underline} smart, [adaptive policy]{.underline}.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its security partners
are awaiting]{.underline} the Biden administration's Global Posture
Review, along with [the]{.underline} potential [expansion of security
cooperation procedures]{.underline}, expanded congressional reviews, and
a revision of the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy---[which would
further protract an already lengthy arms-sale process]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [dictatorial adversaries of democracy and freedom in Beijing,
Moscow, and Tehran are aggressively seeking opportunities for disruption
wherever Washington might expand or reduce security
cooperation]{.underline}, or simply withdraw its presence. [Ready access
to low-cost, but effective, commercial tech]{.underline}nologies [render
that threat even more potent]{.underline}.

[For the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to remain a leader in
this new multipolar world]{.underline} and more effectively plan its
global posture, [it must snap out of a Cold War-style
mindset]{.underline}, cut down on bureaucracy, [and refrain from
expanding processes that hamstring security cooperation.]{.underline}

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [made some notable
advances]{.underline} to promote innovation and protect US technological
advantage through its 2017 National Security Strategy; 2020 National
Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technologies, designed to actively
promote innovation; and its commitment [to revise the US export policy
for Unmanned Aerial Systems]{.underline} (UAS). These [policies
were]{.underline} a good start, but [not enough]{.underline}. Now
President Joe [Biden has an opportunity to bring them to
fruition.]{.underline}

[To understand the rapid emergence of UAS threats, look no further than
the growth of Iran's military drone program]{.underline} in recent
years, [which]{.underline} also [extends to Iran-backed groups across
various regional conflicts. This includes Houthi rebels in Yemen using
drones against Saudi Arabia, Hamas deploying them against
Israel]{.underline} in the Gaza Strip, [and Iraq-based Shia militia
using them to attack US troops]{.underline}---likely including the
recent drone attack on Al Tanf, a remote US outpost on the
Syrian-Jordanian border. [Iran's increasing use of this
technology]{.underline}, specifically "suicide" or "kamikaze" drones
that fly into their targets and explode, [requires integrated air
defenses and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems]{.underline} (C-UAS)
[technology]{.underline}. Regional US partners in the Middle East, which
have increasing requirements to deter Iranian aggression, will seek
every opportunity to acquire it from the US government.

The [US security establishment]{.underline} has long
[acknowledged]{.underline} that adversaries like [China and Iran are
pursuing commercial, off-the-shelf technologies that can threaten US
personnel, penetrate allies' and partners' air defenses, and generally
challenge regional stability]{.underline}. But [the US approach still
has room for improvement.]{.underline}

As part of its new CAT policy, the [Biden]{.underline} administration
[is considering expanding bureaucratic processes for arms sales to
better safeguard US interests]{.underline}---[but this inadvertently
chips away at the prime placement of American aerospace and defense
industries in the global marketplace]{.underline}. [Extending the
processes for]{.underline} military [arms sales]{.underline} [and
transfers risks ceding the security cooperation]{.underline} space [to
US adversaries. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has a
unique role in the world]{.underline}, [and its]{.underline}
national-security interests---including its [defense industrial
base]{.underline}---[shouldn't be compromised]{.underline} (certainly
not by the government) in pursuit of a "level playing field," as
recently advocated by Assistant Secretary of State for
Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis. For the US government to
suggest putting US industry on par with competitors is counterintuitive;
[it is a national- and economic- security imperative for the government
to bolster US industry to excel with every possible
advantage.]{.underline}

US security cooperation historically encompasses facilitating arms
sales, staging military training and exercises, developing
interoperability among allies and partners, and bolstering the sovereign
defense capabilities of security partners. All these efforts need to
continue at a deliberate pace---but in a post-Cold War world, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [no longer has a monopoly on
arms sales with an overt technological advantage in all
areas.]{.underline}

In recent years, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
capabilities became the focus of Chinese UAS production, and as then
Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford noted in 2018,
"[Whoever has the competitive advantage in artificial intelligence and
can field systems informed by artificial intelligence]{.underline},
**[could very well have an overall competitive
advantage]{.underline}**." [Many]{.underline} of us [in the
national-security enterprise at the time were]{.underline} also
[concerned with how AI innovation would shape the development of drones
and integrated air-defense systems]{.underline}. **[With that
technological competition heating up, allies and partners matter more
than ever.]{.underline}**

**[To remain the "partner of choice" for its allies and
partners]{.underline}**, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[needs to work closer with them in collaborative
partnerships]{.underline}, such as the trilateral AUKUS defense pact
among the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. [It
can]{.underline} also [develop]{.underline} other [proactive
collaborative schemes]{.underline} in emerging technologies [to enhance
shared capabilities and interoperability, help security partners
successfully meet updated UAS export policy, and aggressively advocate
for and develop integrated air-defense capabilities.]{.underline}

For the sake of American interests, [the US government must carefully
foster its partnerships and spark a level of defense innovation to keep
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its partners truly
secure]{.underline}.

#### The aff is a key first step to creating international standardization around harmonized, democratic governance on AI 

**Heikkila 2021** -- staff writer @ Politico

BY MELISSA HEIKKILÄ March 29, 2021 4:14 pm "NATO wants to set AI
standards. If only its members agreed on the basics."
https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/

On paper, [NATO is the ideal organization to go about setting standards
for military applications of artificial intelligence]{.underline}. But
the widely [divergent priorities]{.underline} and budgets of its 30
members [could get in the way.¶]{.underline} [The Western military
alliance has identified artificial intelligence as a key
technology]{.underline} needed to maintain an edge over adversaries[,
and it wants to lead the way in establishing common ground rules for its
use. ¶]{.underline} "We need each other more than ever. No country alone
or no continent alone can compete in this era of great power
competition," NATO Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the
alliance's second in command, said in an interview with POLITICO.¶ [The
standard-setting effort comes as China is pressing ahead with AI
applications]{.underline} in the military largely [free of democratic
oversight.]{.underline}¶ David van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary
general for emerging security challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of
concern with the tech\'s ethical implications has sped along the
integration of AI into the military apparatus.¶ \"I\'m \... not sure
that they\'re having the same debates on principles of responsible use
or they\'re definitely not applying our democratic values to these
technologies," he said.¶ Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll
out the world\'s first binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is
seeking closer collaboration with Washington to oversee emerging
technologies, including artificial intelligence. But those efforts have
been slow in getting off the ground.¶ For Geoană, that [collaboration
will happen at NATO]{.underline}, which is working closely with the
European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on "high risk"
applications.¶ The pitch¶ NATO does not regulate, but "**[once NATO sets
a standard, it becomes in terms of defensive security the gold standard
in that respective field]{.underline}**," Geoană said.¶ [The
alliance\'s]{.underline} own [AI strategy]{.underline}, to be released
before the summer, [will identify ways to operate AI systems
responsibly, identify military applications for the technology, and
provide a "platform for allies to test their AI to see whether it\'s up
to NATO standards]{.underline}," van Weel said. ¶ **[The strategy
will]{.underline}** also **[set ethical guidelines around how to govern
AI systems]{.underline}**, for example [by ensuring systems can be shut
down by a human at all times, and to maintain accountability by ensuring
a human is responsible for the actions of AI systems]{.underline}.¶ "If
an adversary would use autonomous AI powered systems in a way that is
not compatible with our values and morals, it would still have defense
implications because we would need to defend and deter against those
systems," van Weel said. ¶ "[We need to be aware of that and we need to
flag legislators when we feel that our restrictions are coming into the
realm of \[being detrimental to\] our defense and
deterrence]{.underline}," he continued.¶ Mission impossible?¶ The
problem is that NATO\'s members are at very different stages when it
comes to thinking about AI in the military context.¶ The U.S., the
world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use of AI in the
defense realm. But in Europe, most countries --- France and the
Netherlands excepting --- barely mention the technology's defense and
military implications in their national AI strategies. ¶ "It's
absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI strategy before
it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did it exactly the
other way around,\" said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy fellow at the
European Council on Foreign Relations, said:¶ That echoes familiar
transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S. President Donald
Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also highlights the
different approaches to AI regulation more broadly.¶ The EU\'s AI
strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as \"human-centric,\"
focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping citizens\' data safe.
The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation and keen on defense,
sees things differently.¶ There are also divergences over what
technologies the alliance ought to develop, including lethal autonomous
weapons systems --- often dubbed "killer robots" --- programmed to
identify and destroy targets without human control. ¶ Powerful NATO
members including France, the U.K., and the U.S. have developed these
technologies and oppose a treaty on these weapons, while others like
Belgium and Germany have expressed serious concerns about the
technology.¶ These weapons systems have also faced fierce public
opposition from civil society and human rights groups, including from
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who in 2018 called
for a ban. ¶ Geoană said the alliance has "retained autonomous weapon
systems as part of the interests of NATO." The group hopes that its
upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical use of the technology
without "stifling innovation." ¶ Staying relevant¶ These issues threaten
to hamper NATO\'s standard-setting drive. \"I think **[there's a certain
danger that if NATO doesn't take this on as a real challenge, that it
may be marginalized by other such efforts,]{.underline}**" Franke said.¶
She pointed to the U.S.-led AI Partnership for Defense, which consists
of 13 countries from Europe and Asia to collaborate on AI use in the
military context --- a forum which could supplant NATO as the
standard-setting body. ¶ That could have consequences for human rights,
too.¶ "[NATO... is a great place to responsibly think about how to
harness the good parts of this technology and how to prohibit the parts
that would be catastrophic for]{.underline} humanitarian law and [human
rights]{.underline} law, and people at the end of the day," said Verity
Coyle, a senior adviser at Amnesty International, which is part of the
Stop Killer Robots campaign. ¶ "[Without oversight mechanisms to ensure
ethical standards]{.underline} and measures, which would guarantee that
this technology will operate under meaningful human control" [NATO's
strategy could head into an "ethical vacuum,"]{.underline} Coyle said.¶
Franke said [it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the basics, like
increased data sharing to develop and train military AI and cooperating
on using artificial intelligence in logistics]{.underline}.¶ "**[If NATO
countries were to cooperate on that,]{.underline}** [that could create
good procedures and set precedents. And I think we should then move on
to the more controversial things such as autonomous weapons
systems,"]{.underline} she said.

and partners [to shape the trajectory of **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence
in ways that will **promote liberal democratic values** and **protect

[This question is both important and urgent]{.underline}. It is

Russia, receive training on these technologies, or simply imitate

uphold basic principles, set international rules of the road, and
articulate a positive vision for the future in the age of
AI]{.underline}.

Within the United States, and certainly within allied countries, [debate
persists over the threat of digital authoritarianism and how to counter
it.]{.underline} [While U.S. allies will likely vary in their strategic
orientations toward China and Russia, **there is a growing consensus on
the need to showcase a democratic way of AI**]{.underline}. [These
debates will take shape in a world of globalized markets for AI talent
and integrated supply chains]{.underline}. In this context, [the right
U.S. approach would leverage its network of allies and partners to
safeguard democracy and liberal values**. An alliance-centric strategy
provides a competitive advantage over any single country that attempts
to develop a robust AI ecosystem on its own.**]{.underline}

[The **U**nited **S**tates and its allies should play to their
strengths.]{.underline} This positive agenda [begin]{.underline}s [with
shaping the ecosystems for the development and deployment of safe and
reliable AI]{.underline}. The most effective approach would capitalize
on advances in AI and machine learning to foster sustainable and
inclusive economic growth, improve service delivery, and promote
transparent and accountable governance. The United States and its allies
should pursue a vision of the future in which AI enables strengthened
data privacy standards and respect for civil liberties; economic
empowerment of citizens within rules-based market economies; cleaner,
safer, and more efficient transportation; precision medical diagnosis;
greater access to education; and more effective disaster response.

#### Democracy solves extinction

[There is an intimate]{.underline} and neglected [relationship between
existential risk and democracy]{.underline}. **[Democracy must be
central to efforts to prevent and mitigate catastrophic
risks.]{.underline}** It is also an antidote to many of the problems
manifest in the TUA. Do those who study the future of humanity have good
grounds to ignore the visions, desires, and values of the very people
whose future they are trying to protect? [Choosing which risks to take
must be a democratic endeavour]{.underline}.

We [understand democracy]{.underline} here in accordance with Landemore
[as the rule of the]{.underline} cognitively [diverse many who are
entitled to equal decision-making power and partake in a democratic
procedure that includes both a deliberative element and one of
preference aggregation]{.underline} (such as majority voting)45,115.
Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or non- democratic,
but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less democratic,
inclusive, and diverse.

We posit [three reasons]{.underline} for why we should democratise
research and decision-making in existential risk: [the nature of
collective decision-making about human futures, the superiority of
democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe mechanisms.]{.underline}

**[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, or crafting a desirable
long-term future, **[is a communal project]{.underline}**. Scholars of
existential risk who take an interest in the future of Homo sapiens are
choosing to consider the species in its entirety. If certain views are
excluded, the arguments for doing so must be compelling.

**[Democracy will improve our judgments in both the governance and the
study of existential risks]{.underline}**. [Asking how our actions today
influence the long-term future is one of the most difficult intellectual
tasks to unravel, and if there is a right path, **democratic
procedures** will **have the best shot at finding it**]{.underline}.
Hong and Page116,117 demonstrate **[both theoretically and
computationally that a diverse group of problem-solving agents will show
greater accuracy than a less diverse group, even if the individual
members of the diverse group were each less accurate.]{.underline}**
**[Accuracy gains from diversity trump gains from improving individual
accuracy]{.underline}**. Landemore115, builds on this work to advance a
probabilistic argument that **[inclusive democracies will, in
expectation, make epistemically superior choices to oligarchies or even
the wise few]{.underline}**. This is [supported by promising results in
inclusive, deliberative democratic experiments from around the
world]{.underline} 118. [In the long run, democracies should commit
fewer mistakes than alternative decision-making procedures]{.underline}.
If this is true, it should improve the accuracy of research efforts and
decision-making. We are more likely to make accurate predictions about
the mechanisms of extinction, probable futures, and risk prevention if
the field invites cognitive diversity, builds flat institutional
structures, and avoids conflicts of interest.

Thereare many ways to consider the interests of the many. Democratic
assemblies could allow global citizens to deliberate about the futures
they prefer, citizens could be surveyed, and the field of ERS itself
could be diversified. At the moment, the field is, as many academic
disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity at large and variably
homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology, age, ethnicity,
gender, nationality, religion, and professional background. The latter
issue is particularly true of existential risk, which, despite being an
inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at the highest levels
dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to be vigilant to what
perspectives are not represented in the study of existential risk. An
awareness of bias will go some way towards mitigating its negative
effects. To get close to replicating the cognitive diversity found among
humans, we must begin by inviting different thinkers with different
values and beliefs into the field.

**[Democracies can limit harms]{.underline}**. [Any approach to
mitigating existential threats could create response risks]{.underline},
and the TUA seems particularly vulnerable to this. [Despite good
intentions and curiosity-driven research, it could justify violence,
dangerous technological developments, or drastically constrain freedom
in favour of (perceived) security]{.underline}. If we hope to explore
ideas but minimise harms, [democracies can]{.underline} be used to
[moderate]{.underline} the [measures taken in response to harmful
ideas]{.underline}. It seems, for example, vanishingly unlikely that a
diverse group of thinkers or even ordinary citizens would entertain the
idea of sacrificing 1 billion living, breathing beings for an
infinitesimal improvement in reaching an intergalactic techno-utopia. In
contrast, the TUA could recommend this trade-off.

[The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be a form of
collective selfinterest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate global
catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable portion
of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be
affected]{.underline}. We expect that scholars who do not support
sacrificing current lives in the name of abstract calculations, but
would still like to explore the use of expected value theory in
existential risk, will be in support of [democratic fail-safe
mechanisms]{.underline}.

[Empirically]{.underline}, this fail-safe mechanism [seems to
work]{.underline}. [Even deeply imperfect democracies, like the ones we
inhabit now, often avert detrimental outcomes.]{.underline} [Democracies
prevent famines]{.underline} 119 (although not malnutrition)120. They
[make war]{.underline} --- a significant driver of GCRs --- [less
likely]{.underline} 121. The [inclusion of diverse preferences in
democracies]{.underline}, such as those achieved through women's
suffrage, further [decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict]{.underline} 122. [Citizens]{.underline} often
[show]{.underline} a [significant risk aversion in comparison to their
government]{.underline}. While surveys are notoriously difficult to
collect and interpret, existing **[data suggest that the public has
little support for nuclear weapons use]{.underline}** 123--125, **[but
strong support for action against climate catastrophe]{.underline}**
126--128. We can further show that **[when citizens deliberately engage
with the subject at hand, their concern and readiness for action often
increases]{.underline}** 118. For example, [citizen assemblies on
climate change have recommended widespread policy-changes across
sectors, amendments to incentive structures and laws against ecocide to
reach emissions targets]{.underline} 129. Indeed, many lament that when
it comes to genetically modified organisms and nuclear power, citizens
are far too riskaverse130 . The problem is not that the public is
riddled with cognitive biases that make them unconcerned about global
catastrophes.

**[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought. Navigating humanity
through crises will involve many value-laden decisions under deep
uncertainty.]{.underline}** Democratic procedures can deal with such
hard choices. Greater cognitive diversity should be represented amongst
scholars of ERS. Recommendations on [policies that would reduce risk
should be passed through deliberative assemblies and await the approval
of a wider pool of ordinary citizens, as they will be the ones who will
bear this risk]{.underline}. A homogenous group of experts attempting to
directly influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair or safe way of
traversing the precipice.

### 1AC Solvency 

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over the use of artificial intelligence in military logistics and sustainment.

#### The plan solves -- establishing a cooperative framework for AI applications in military logistics and sustainment ensures interoperability amongst allies, maintains readiness, and encourages feedback models that can quell skepticism

**Konaev and Chahal 2021** -- research fellow and research analys with
the Center for Security and Emerging Technology

Margarita Konaev Husanjot Chahal April 2021 "The Path of Least
Resistance: Multinational Collaboration on AI for Military Logistics and
Sustainment" CSET Issue Brief

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies face
powerful technical, political, and strategic reasons to
pursue]{.underline} and deepen [collaboration on AI applications for
logistics and sustainment]{.underline}. Whether working within existing
frameworks or building new partnerships, there are multiple pathways for
collaboration. The final NSCAI report, for example, offers a
comprehensive list of ongoing multilateral efforts on AI and associated
technologies as well as security alliances and partnerships, some of
which could serve as a forum for allies to work together on AI-enabled
logistics.64 Below, we recommend four options for allies to explore
depending on their interests and capabilities.

1[. The United States and its allies should establish joint standards
and protocols for the safe and secure sharing, pooling, and storage of
nonsensitive datasets relevant to AI applications for logistics and
sustainment.]{.underline}

[Data relevant to AI-enabled logistics and sustainment includes data on
licensing, maintenance personnel, and repair schedules]{.underline} for
predictive maintenance; video and navigation data from ground and aerial
semiautonomous and autonomous resupply systems and convoys; data
supporting maritime awareness and global shipping, and many other tasks
and functions.

[Considering that data is the foundation of AI/ML-based applications,
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates a[nd its allies will have
to agree on standards regulating data sharin]{.underline}g, storage, and
analysis to ensure privacy, fairness, security, and respect for civil
liberties. [Identifying the governmental body to lead standardization
efforts is a key step]{.underline}. [Within the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense, for example, the responsibility
for "the use and implementation of standardization" rests with the
Defense Standardization Program Office International Standardization
Program.65 Another option is to build on the NSCAI recommendation that
the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology lead efforts to
"promote international standardization in areas that further U.S. and
allies' national security and defense interests in the appropriate and
responsible use of AI."66 Allies will also need to decide on the scope
of such standardization efforts. [One pathway for alliance-wide
collaboration is through NATO standardization agreements that facilitate
interoperability]{.underline}, in part [by ensuring the commonality of
doctrine, procedures or equipment used and compatibility between allies'
products, processes, and services]{.underline}.67 That said, the lead
body and institutional configuration for standardization efforts and
data partnerships related to AI-enabled logistics and sustainment can
and should vary depending on allies' needs, interests, and capabilities.

2\. The United States and its allies should collaborate on R&D
initiatives related to AI for logistics and sustainment.

When taken together, the R&D spending of the United States and just six
like-minded nations---France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, and
the United Kingdom---account for more than 50 percent of global R&D
investment.68 This is a massive capacity for innovation. And when
coupled with the shared interest in AI solutions for logistics and
sustainment, there are many opportunities for collaborative R&D projects
related to these technologies.

One option is to add joint research and development initiatives related
to AI for logistics and sustainment to the agenda of early- stage
collaborative efforts like the JAIC's AI Partnership for Defense. Future
meetings coordinated by this partnership could serve as a launchpad for
R&D projects that include any number of the interested member states.
Another option is to expand existing bilateral and multilateral R&D
collaborations to include projects related to AI applications for
logistics and sustainment. The Technical Cooperation Program, for
example, is a collaboration forum for defense research and development
activities among Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and
the United States.69

3\. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies [should
promote multinational private-public partnerships to advance research,
development, procurement and fielding of AI- enabled logistics and
sustainment technologies. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
and its allies [are home to many small, midsized, and large-scale
private companies with international presence and expertise in AI
solutions]{.underline} for financial and business processes, healthcare,
autonomous vehicle technology, maintenance management, and other areas
relevant to logistics and sustainment. [Private companies are at the
forefront of innovation in A]{.underline}I[, and there are great
opportunities to leverage their expertise and commercial interests in
defense to establish new and strengthen existing multinational
private-public partnerships with a focus on AI applications for
logistics]{.underline} and sustainment. The United States could work
with allies on a bilateral basis; for example, building on Germany or
South Korea's competitive edge in autonomous vehicles technology to
explore opportunities for public-private partnership for innovation in
autonomous resupply technologies. There is also the option of working
with and through regional bodies like the EU to support existing
initiatives and public-private partnerships located in allied countries.
70 Another pathway suggested by experts at the Center for a New American
Security in their report on building an alliance innovation base is to
"launch a cross-national platform to build new companies" focused on
national security technologies.71

4\. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies should
include AI-enabled logistics and sustainment technologies and
capabilities in joint military exercises]{.underline}.

[As AI-enabled technologies become more commonplace, it is vital to
include them in joint multinational military exercises]{.underline}.72
Fr[om simulations and computer assisted command post exercises to major
field exercises]{.underline} that include combined arms live-fire
maneuvers integrating air, naval, marine, land, and cyber forces as well
as civilian elements, [multinational military exercises help forge
personal and professional partnerships between allies]{.underline},
[ensure]{.underline} doctrinal and [technical
interoperability]{.underline}, [and strengthen readiness]{.underline}.73
[Multinational logistic support is different from unilateral logistic
support]{.underline}. Thus, **[if allies expect to use AI-enabled
logistic and sustainment technologies in multinational missions, they
would benefit from experimenting and training to do so
together.]{.underline}**

[Incorporating AI-enabled technologies into joint military exercises
will allow allies to test and assess the technologies' performance and
viability in uncontrolled and dynamic environments]{.underline}---
conditions in which AI systems are known to be brittle and vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. [Utilizing AI-enabled logistical elements and
functions in joint exercises can also help allied militaries collect
feedback from users and assess compatibility between the new
technologies and existing concepts]{.underline} of operations, tactics,
techniques, and procedures. [User feedback can serve to improve the
technology]{.underline}, while lessons learned about the ways in which
new technologies fit with operational doctrine can inform necessary
adjustments, ultimately, [strengthening interoperability and
readiness.]{.underline}

Moreover, [including AI-enabled logistics and sustainment technologies
and capabilities in military exercises can help build trust between
human operators and intelligent technologies]{.underline}. [The issue of
trust in human-machine teaming is particularly consequential in the
context of multinational coalition because people from different
countries can differ in their attitudes toward technology which in turn
could affect interoperability, military effectiveness, and mission
success as a whole]{.underline}.74

#### Partnerships through NATO are key -- it\'s the only way to attract investment and direct the private sector towards ethical development

**Warrell 2021** -- staff writer @ Financial Times

HELEN WARRELL "High-tech warfare will be high on agenda at summit, but
most members are playing catch-up with China" Financial Times
https://www.ft.com/content/61c1945c-d153-4d58-b9c5-dffd99a6919e

[As Russia intensifies cyber hostilities and China weaponises artificial
intelligence]{.underline}, [joining forces in the field of high-tech
warfare will feature high on the list of topics discussed by Nato
allies]{.underline} at a summit next week. But **[the transatlantic
alliance]{.underline}**'s 30 members **[will need to move fast if they
aim to make up lost ground.¶]{.underline}** Nato is proposing a new tech
innovation centre bringing together military personnel with industry to
foster digital defence start-ups. Some of these might be financed by a
separate initiative, also set to be debated: a venture capital fund for
innovation which member states could choose to opt in to.¶ The efforts
are belated, as Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg himself
acknowledged. "[For decades, Nato allies have been leading when it comes
to tech]{.underline}nology, [but that's not obvious any
more,]{.underline}" he told the Financial Times in an interview last
week. "[We see China]{.underline} especially [investing heavily in new,
disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence]{.underline},
autonomous systems, big data, and they implement them into new advanced
weapon systems, drones, submarines, aircraft and so on."¶ He is not the
first to sound the alarm. Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief
executive who now chairs the US's National Security Commission on AI,
warned earlier this year that [Beijing was planning to undermine
conventional military forces by "leapfrogging" to new
technologies]{.underline}. The commission's report, published in March,
raised concerns that [China would use AI for "reconnaissance,
electromagnetic countermeasures and co-ordinated firepower
strikes".¶]{.underline} [Part of the problem is that western defence
institutions have been slow to recognise the potential of
innovation]{.underline} beyond their own industry.¶ "For decades, [a lot
of technological development would happen within the defence
sector]{.underline} --- the internet, nuclear, GPS, all of that was
[developed by the defence industry and then shared with the civilian
sector,]{.underline}" Stoltenberg said. "Now, it goes the other way
around. It's a civilian sector which is leading in the development of
artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and many of the new
disruptive technologies."¶ [Some NATO members are ahead of others. The
US and France have published military AI strategies,]{.underline} while
the UK announced this year that it is to establish a centre for defence
AI. For the first time, Britain's intelligence agency, MI6, is
recruiting from the private sector for a new head of its "Q" branch ---
the technical lab made famous in the James Bond films.¶ **[Establishing
a new NATO hub]{.underline}** --- [known as an
"accelerator]{.underline}" --- [in which tech companies and members of
the armed forces can experiment with new ideas has
advantages]{.underline}, according to Professor Fiona Murray,
co-director of MIT's innovation initiative.¶ [Start-ups and investors do
not always have the time to tackle defence challenges when solutions are
"hard to test, markets are fragmented and procurement is
slow",]{.underline} Murray said.¶ [Working together]{.underline} [would
create a wider market for new products and enhance collective
security]{.underline}, she noted. **[It was "not enough" for countries
to be handling this individually]{.underline}**, she said.¶ [The US has
started marshalling allies on the policy implications of using new
tech]{.underline}nology. The Pentagon's "AI Partnership for Defense",
comprising 13 countries (including Nato members Canada, Denmark,
Estonia, the UK, France and Norway) met virtually for the first time
last year to agree joint military standards on AI. Schmidt's commission
has called on the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance (the US, UK,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand) to work more closely on developing AI
systems.¶ Ulrike Franke, an expert in military technology at the
European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that **[NATO's tech centre
will be most effective if it prioritises systems designed to facilitate
joint military operations]{.underline}**. [The alliance should look at
areas such as AI-enabled command and control,]{.underline} she said,
w[hich could give members a unified picture of the battlefield across
multiple regions, using intelligent data analysis to sift
information]{.underline}.¶ Franke said that [in the vast arena spanning
drones to quantum computing, there was a temptation to cover too much.
"It makes massive sense for Nato to look more at this
\[technology\]]{.underline}", she said. "The question is, what exactly
are they focusing on? There's a danger of Nato spreading itself too
thin."

#### Key members of NATO will say yes

the Center for Security and Emerging Technology

Margarita Konaev Husanjot Chahal April 2021 "The Path of Least
Resistance: Multinational Collaboration on AI for Military Logistics and
Sustainment" CSET Issue Brief

This is not to say that adopting and developing, let alone collaborating
on AI-enabled logistics will be an easy task for the U.S. military and
allied defense organizations. The ML and deep learning algorithms behind
commercial AI-enabled logistics are generally not optimized for military
needs.39 And if the experience of the Department of Defense is any
indication, there are multiple challenges with regards to the data
needed to power AI applications---from lack of data to problems with
traceability, access, and interoperability of data collected by
different systems.40 Moreover, data security and privacy concerns as
well as different legal frameworks for how personal data is collected,
handled, processed, and stored remain a critical barrier to
international collaboration. Lack of clarity surrounding how to
implement the exemptions for research incorporated into the General Data
Protection Regulation, for example, has stalled collaboration between
the U.S. National Institutes of Health and some European counterparts.41

These and other technical barriers and privacy-related concerns are
indeed significant. But [developments in privacy-preserving ML
techniques]{.underline}, [including homomorphic encryption]{.underline},
[secure multi-party computation, and federated learning offer
opportunities for allies to share and pool data without compromising the
privacy of]{.underline} individual [users and organizations]{.underline}
whose data is being used.42 [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can]{.underline} also [work with allies to develop
technical standards and protocols for harmonizing data collection,
formatting, storage, and archiving to ensure data security and
integrity.]{.underline}43

Overall, the U.S. military and allied defense organizations will face
nonnegligible technical barriers whether adapting commercial AI
technologies or building AI-enabled systems and tools in-house. From a
comparative standpoint, however, [**military logistics and sustainment
applications**]{.underline} that fall under the broader category **[of
enterprise AI applications present "low hanging fruit" for the U.S.
military]{.underline}** (and presumably for other technologically
advanced militaries).44 Moreover, [**international collaboration on
AI-enabled military logistics and sustainment is likely more within
reach** than collaboration on AI integrated into weapons
systems]{.underline} [or applications that feed on sensitive data
collected by proprietary weapons and sensor systems.]{.underline}45

[With key U.S. allies]{.underline} like the United Kingdom, Germany,
France, South Korea and Japan [already pursuing efforts to leverage AI
for military logistics]{.underline} and sustainment,
[collaboration]{.underline} in this area [seems politically
feasible.]{.underline}

The integration of AI into weapons systems has raised ethical concerns
and opposition in some communities across the United States and in
allied countries. Yet by [focusing collaboration on AI applications for
military logistics and sustainment functions, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies could potentially sidestep
the]{.underline} contentious ["killer robots" debate. Collaborative
efforts to develop and apply AI tools to]{.underline} areas such as
[defense supply chain management, personnel management, and equipment
maintenance can improve existing processes and functions]{.underline},
[save costs and increase efficiencies]{.underline} in defense
organizations. [Multinational collaboration around this set of goals and
applications is less likely to galvanize]{.underline} widespread
grassroots [opposition]{.underline} than programs on AI-enabled drones
or autonomous ground combat vehicles.

Moreover, [some of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[closest allies are already investing in AI and ML technologies for
logistics]{.underline} and sustainment. [The U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom's Ministry of Defense's (MOD) Autonomy Programme,
for example, [identifies defense resupply and logistics
challenges]{.underline} through the Defense and Security Accelerator [as
one of its key activities]{.underline}.46 In 2019, MOD also allocated
£66 million (about \$83 million) to accelerate robotic projects for the
British Army, including autonomous logistics vehicles supporting
resupply missions in conflict zones.47 Notably, the UK's Defense Science
and Technology Laboratory and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities
Development Command's Ground Vehicle Systems Center have been working
together since 2016 on the Coalition Assured Autonomous Resupply
project, prototyping semiautonomous logistics convoys, along with ground
and aerial autonomous resupply systems, and demonstrating the
interoperability of the two nations' armies with autonomous driving
technology.48

[France's military AI strategy]{.underline} also [views "logistics and
operational readiness" as one of the priority areas for the defense
ministry]{.underline}, including a focus on predictive maintenance.49
Notably, the strategy states that "mission performance and assisted
maintenance applications, especially for cooperation with countries that
have the same systems" as [France pose no significant problems in terms
of sharing classified data]{.underline}. And [in addition to its key
European partners, **France is**]{.underline} also **[open to
collaboration]{.underline}** [with the U]{.underline}nited
[St]{.underline}ates [given the similar approach to AI
development]{.underline}. 50 Along similar lines, [the German Army
identifies AI for personnel and material management]{.underline},
including predictive maintenance, [as one of the main areas for action
on AI development.]{.underline}51

Japan and South Korea are also increasingly investing in military
applications of AI, including for logistics and sustainment. South
Korea's National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence lists national
defense as a key area for AI applications, including using AI to
"quickly analyze and process large-scale defense data and develop and
support common services such as medical care, logistics, and
administration."52 Meanwhile, Japan's Acquisition, Technology and
Logistics Agency (ATLA) has identified "logistical support technologies"
in its medium- to long-term defense technology outlook back in 2016.
More recently, ATLA has been working with private sector partners on
research and development projects applying AI for defense logistics and
"streamlining system maintenance work."53

## EXT -- NATO Advantage

### UQ -- Hybrid Warfare Now

#### Adversaries are engaged in hybrid warfare now that compromises decisionmaking -- risks escalation 

**Lucarelli et al 2021** - Professor at the University of Bologna,
member of the Board of Directors of the Forum on the Problems of Peace
and War and of the Institute of International Affairs

Sonia Lucarelli Alessandro Marrone Francesco N. Moro "Executive Summary"
Nato Decision-Making In The Age Of Big Data And Artificial Intelligence,
Nato Allied Command Transformation Università Di Bologna Istituto Affari
Internazionali

[Digital revolution has]{.underline} substantially [transformed the
world we live in]{.underline}, [providing great opportunities but also
making societies more vulnerable. Tech]{.underline}nology [makes
external interferences cheaper, faster and all-
encompassing]{.underline}: citizens can potentially become direct
targets of information warfare, **[all members of a society can be part
of conflicts one way or another.]{.underline}** [From advanced weaponry
to command and control]{.underline}, most [security-related domains are
undergoing deep transformations as data availability and transmission
increase]{.underline} exponentially. In this context, three
interconnected aspects are explore through this publication with a view
to the Alliance's evolution: Big Data and organizational challenges for
NATO; hybrid threats to Allies' decision- making; the adoption of AI in
the defense domain and NATO's role.¶ Big Data and Organizational
Challenges for NATO. [Basing decisions on a]{.underline} much [larger
amount of information than was previously possible could lead to a real
revolution in the decision-making processes of complex
organizations]{.underline}, especially because this information would
concern different dimensions of reality and it would be constantly
updated. [Beside the]{.underline} huge [quantity]{.underline} of
information available, [the]{.underline} high [speed at which the data
are generated and need to be processed is another defining
factor]{.underline} of Big Data. Also, they will typically be acquired
from diverse sources and their trustworthiness has to be carefully
evaluated. Finally, any data can have different value in different
phases of the decision-making process. All [these features impose
specific requirements on organizations that aim at using Big Data to
reduce the uncertainty]{.underline} in which they operate. For instance,
the huge volume of data compels to acquire new data storage
technologies, while the high speed demands new processing tools and the
variable trustworthiness and value force organizations to elaborate new
methods of analysis. Accordingly, any actor that seeks to exploit Big
Data should have clear goals and a well-defined strategy to delineate
and implement its specific objectives.¶ A key issue with Big Data is
providing decision makers with data that are truly relevant for their
purposes, and not simply interesting. Chief data officers and senior
data-related leadership positions will acquire a crucial importance in
the analysis of information and in the actual decision-making process,
but these positions require a special mix of talent and tools that are
currently scarce in many large organizations, especially in the public
sector and even more in the military one.¶ Another key issue lies in the
emerging tension between centralization and decentralization of the
decision- making process of organizations that are introducing Big Data
analysis in their work. Paradoxically, while Big Data should promote
widespread responsibility and tactical awareness, at the moment advanced
digitalization seems to be linked to clear centripetal forces in large
organizations. The centripetal tendency leads towards the
de-responsibilization of the lower ranks and to a progressive loss of
practice in choosing. Thus, it would be advisable to integrate Big Data
in the Alliance's decision-making favoring diffused ownership and
devising different tools for different branches of the organization,
based on their specificities. It would also be helpful to create
well-designed and reliable evaluation procedures to measure the
effectiveness of organizational innovations as well as of the execution
of the new decision-making processes. In particular, identifying the
initial failures is especially important, to learn from them and avoid
structural problems.¶ [Hybrid Threats to Allies'
Decision-Making.]{.underline} Hybrid threats [is a broad category
encompassing a variety of actors, actions and targets.]{.underline} As
for actors, due to their actual capabilities, intentions and recent
track records, [China and Russia can be identified as the most gathering
threats]{.underline}.¶ Concerning actions, [information is key under
several respects]{.underline}. It refers to Big Data and
[AI]{.underline} taken together, as the latter entails the use of
[algorithms]{.underline} to [learn from the former with a view to
exploit the target's vulnerabilities.]{.underline} [Digital connections
are the underlying infrastructure used to perpetrate hybrid
threats]{.underline} in the information domain. [Western societies rely
on virtual world platforms that can be targeted]{.underline} by
potential attackers. **[Since global networks defy
borders]{.underline}** and limit state jurisdiction, **[they are harder
to defend and allow potential attackers to act below the threshold of
detection and attribution.]{.underline}** [Hybrid threats]{.underline}
also [benefit from the unprecedent speed and scope of
information.]{.underline} **[This]{.underline}** is not new in
principle, but it **[has reached game- changing levels]{.underline}**.
On the one hand, [managing this massive flow of information
is]{.underline} just [prohibitive for NATO]{.underline} and its member
states; on the other hand, [high speed of circulation translates into
increased operational tempo]{.underline}.¶ [Hybrid threats may take aim
at a variety of targets]{.underline}, yet particularly concerning are
offensive actions [that might lead to societal polarization, elite
disagreement and biased perceptions of foreign actors. These actions
have the potential to affect decision-making]{.underline} at different
levels, [even undermining democratic states' institutions]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [these hybrid threats could undermine decision-making
process of Allies]{.underline} -- and by reflex, NATO's too. Decision
makers face in particular three main set of problems when crafting a
response to hybrid threats.¶ 1) How to respond in non-escalatory ways?
[Since hybrid attacks exploit the grey zone to create
ambiguity,]{.underline} including by manipulating the threshold of
detection and granting plausible deniability, [decision makers are faced
with the risk of overreaction]{.underline}.¶ 2) How to respond in
democratic ways? Potential attackers may severely impair the
decision-making process of democratic systems, putting under stress, for
example, the constraint to abide by domestic and international law.¶ 3)
How to get public support? [Since hybrid threats are]{.underline}
usually covered or [difficult to attribute, policy makers also have to
persuade the public opinion of the very same existence of the
threat]{.underline}.

### Solvency -- NATO Key 

#### NATO is key -- it provides a framework for understanding and integrating AI

[The AI Adoption in the Defense Domain and NATO's Role.]{.underline} In
discussing what AI will mean for allied militaries and the Alliance as
such, a basic question should be addressed: is AI a technological
revolution or is it an instance of technological evolution? Different
pieces of evidence can support both interpretations. It would probably
be hard for Allies, from a political perspective, to adapt swiftly to a
rapid technological revolution. NATO approach, because of the consensus
characterising its procedures, will have to be more evolutionary,
granular and nuanced. In any case, it is unlikely to see in the next
future AI making decisions for the North Atlantic Council (NAC) or the
Nuclear Planning Group (NPG). There are psychological, cultural,
organizational, political as well as technical reasons for this. The
journey to AI is likely to be rather troublesome. Agile software
development, for instance, enables the development of superior software
but, at the same time, also calls for different procedures,
organizational structures and processes, touching upon organizations'
identities, missions and culture.

Another topical issue is [the private-public partnership on
AI]{.underline}. This [is key in the AI race between the US and
China]{.underline} -- possibly [leading to disadvantages for Allies
vis-à-vis China --]{.underline} [and in the relations between NATO and
major civilian companies]{.underline} working on AI and Big Data. [There
is also the fundamental need to ensure interoperability in a fragmented
scenario in terms of the Allies' adoption of AI
technologies]{.underline}. [NATO has historically been an important
player in the processes of standardization and could be such also in
this case]{.underline}. In this context, some creativity may be needed:
for instance, should NATO provide cloud computing services, namely
enablers, the same way it provides air-space management or ground
surveillance? Could the Alliance envision an integration of
nationally-owned AI assets as it does for the integrated air and missile
defense? These are important questions which, however, highlight the
fact that defense is a sovereign issue and most decisions are taken by
national governments, not by NATO as such.

[The Alliance could play a prominent role in the AI domain]{.underline}.
For instance, [NATO could establish an AI champion to help Allies
understand, adopt and integrate AI. Such champion could start with small
projects aiming at validating the effectiveness of the solution, and
then it could help Allies in training.]{.underline} A key, related issue
in this regard is education and training. Similarly, the importance of
wargames, simulations and experimentations is going to grow, and [NATO
has a role to play here, as the unique avenue to convene allied military
and political bodies]{.underline}.

Changes And A Transformed International Security Environment" Nato

Internazional

Digital revolution has substantially transformed the world we live in,
providing great opportunities but also making societies more vulnerable
and transforming the meaning of state borders. Technology makes external
interferences cheaper, faster and all-encompassing: citizens can
potentially become direct targets of information warfare, all members of
a society can be part of conflicts one way or another. From advanced
weaponry to command and control, most security-related domains are
undergoing deep transformations as data availability and transmission
increase exponentially. This is especially true as the emergence of
so-called hybrid tactics contributes to universalize the battlefield.
Also, attackers may lose control of their offensive cyber weapons, and
'collateral damages' across the private sector and the public worldwide
might be more and more difficult to contain. Less visible, yet important
challenges connected with Information Communication Technologies (ICTs)
also exist. For instance, data overload can create problems for
decision- makers that are unable to detect important signals. Losing
sight of how machines make their calculations -- a somewhat inherent
feature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) -- can hinder deeper
understanding of phenomena as well as learning, besides having dense
ethical implications.

A crucial question for Western societies and governments is how to deal
with technological changes by exploiting their many benefits while
managing to limit their risks. Broadly speaking, observers have long
noticed the potentialities of technologies in the security domain:
better situational awareness, early warning against threats and risks,
the ability to prevent and/or stop attacks to happen, the use of
technology against the adversaries' own technologies, and eventually
deterrence of high-end hybrid warfare or, at least, the increase of
resilience against it. In particular, in order to harness the potential
of new technologies, higher levels of security are needed. While
internet is unfortunately not secure by design, it has to be somehow
retrofit to guarantee a certain level of protection -- for instance by
avoiding a single point of failure, developing better firewalls, etc.
Ultimately, the digital revolution poses challenges to decision makers
both as potential users of new technologies and as leaders of targeted
societies. Learning to achieve political aims through the support of
technological innovations and at the same time acquiring the ability to
prevent and manage interferences, if not attacks, have become paramount.

However, achieving such results is not only about engineering.
Technologies need ad hoc governance, organizations and skilled users to
properly function. Actually, history is full of examples of good
technologies that were improperly used and/or unable to provide the
expected gains. Therefore, a joint, multi-disciplinary efforts is needed
to think and manage technologies in a more comprehensive and secure way
across various domains. For instance, the very same design of AI needs
exchanges with social scientists in order to limit

### UQ -- Defense Industrial Base

#### Ukraine puts the US and NATO Defense Industrial Base on the Brink

the U.S. Defense-Industrial Base Keep Up?" Heritage Foundation
https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/the-war-ukraine-continues-can-the-us-defense-industrial-base-keep

[Three months after Russia's latest invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian
army continues to fight]{.underline} valiantly. [Weapons provided by
NATO members have sustained the resistance]{.underline} thus far, [but
more will be needed]{.underline} if Ukraine is to stand a fighting
chance against Russia's far-larger military. [The West]{.underline}
clearly [intends to keep the arms and munitions flowing]{.underline},
[but will its atrophying defense-industrial base be up to the
task?]{.underline} [Do the U.S. and NATO have enough
weapons]{.underline} to supply Ukraine for a prolonged conflict? [The
U.S. is not the "arsenal of democracy" that it used to]{.underline} be.
Indeed, many [experts doubt it has the capacity needed to meet its own
needs]{.underline}, considering the possibility of conflict with China
or perhaps even a two-front war. [Supplying Ukraine with
weapons]{.underline}, although necessary, [will]{.underline} almost
certainly [exacerbate the issue of an already depleted American
arsenal]{.underline}. Even as they push for accelerated deliveries to
Ukraine, multiple government officials have stressed the need for the
U.S. to replenish its own munitions stockpiles. \>\>\> Biden's Defense
Budget Is Detached From Reality Undersecretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante recently said that the
Pentagon needs "to have more hot production lines," even if it means
having "redundant production lines" to fix single-point failures. Sen.
Jack Reed, Rhode Island Democrat and chairman of [the Senate Armed
Services Committee]{.underline}, stated that his panel [is pushing the
Pentagon to replenish its inventory]{.underline} of weapons sent to
Ukraine[, but multiple issues stand in the]{.underline}
[way]{.underline}. [These issues include stagnant assembly lines, the
scarcity of specialized parts and disrupted international supply
chains.]{.underline} Take, for example, the FIM-92 Stinger. A portable,
shoulder-fired antiaircraft missile, the Stinger has been vital for
Ukraine's defense against air attacks and troop deployments by Russian
helicopters. [The problem is that]{.underline}, prior to the invasion,
[the U.S. had not planned to refresh its stockpile of Stingers until at
least the 2030s.]{.underline} The focus, instead, was on gearing up to
eventually start production of a more advanced Stinger. Now, [the U.S.
is scrambling to overcome difficulties, like obsolete parts and
workforce issues, in order to produce more 1970s-era Stinger
missiles]{.underline} for Ukraine. [Raytheon]{.underline}, the
manufacturer, [said]{.underline} [this week that it will take "years"
before they can build new Stingers]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [our allies
have even bigger problems]{.underline}. [Multiple NATO allies' defenses
are based on old Soviet systems that need to be replaced or
augmented]{.underline}. [Poland's offer to send its entire operational
MiG-29 fighter-jet fleet to Ukraine]{.underline} shed light on this
fact. [Some NATO allies]{.underline}---mainly Poland, Slovakia and
Bulgaria---[continue to use outdated Soviet-Russian
equipment]{.underline} inherited from their predecessor regimes after
the 1989-91 collapse of Communism. Slovakia has sent another aging
Soviet-era platform, the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system, to Ukraine.
The MiG-29 entered service in 1982 and the S-300 system in 1978, and
getting spare parts and replacement missiles would be a real challenge
even if the source weren't a hostile Russia. [The conflict
has]{.underline}, however, [given rise to silver linings. Many of our
allies are waking up to the need to boost their defense
spending.]{.underline} Germany has decided to buy F-35s from the U.S.
and pledged an increased defense budget, exceeding NATO's 2%-of-GDP
target. Poland has moved to increase its defense spending as well, with
the goal of reaching 3% of GDP by 2023. To some degree, [the
Russia-Ukraine conflict has served as a stress test for the West's
defense industrial base. From that has come a growing recognition
that,]{.underline} for too long, [America has underestimated the amount
of munitions and platforms required in modern warfare. Due to the
complexity and time required to manufacture]{.underline} today's
precision [weapons, we must start thinking now, before a war breaks out,
about whether America has enough weaponry to sustain a
conflict.]{.underline}

America Could Clash Over Ai" European Council on Foreign Relations

[International competition on technology]{.underline}, such as 5G, [has
recently attracted significant attention]{.underline}. At the 2020
Munich Security Conference, for example, tech was an important topic --
yet the discussion was not really about tech, but about power, as the
rivalry over who builds 5G telecommunications infrastructure turned into
a US-Chinese competition. This was despite the fact that the leading 5G
providers are European and Chinese.

[There is a growing realisation that]{.underline} the adoption of
[AI-enabled systems may have geopolitical consequences and]{.underline}
eventually [affect the global balance of power]{.underline}. In
particular, [AI may give one actor considerable power over
others]{.underline}, be it [in the form of an economic]{.underline}
boost [or]{.underline} an AI-enabled [military]{.underline}
[advantage]{.underline}, or [through control over crucial technology
components and standards]{.underline}.

[In the US, there is growing concern over the possibility that China
might become too strong]{.underline} an AI actor. [The competition over
global leadership between the US and China is intensifying,]{.underline}
**[with]{.underline}** technology in general, and **[AI in particular,
as battlefields]{.underline}**. [The US fears that AI may give China a
competitive edge]{.underline}. Therefore, [countering China's AI
ambitions]{.underline} -- as [embodied in]{.underline} its [attempts to
dominate international technology standards]{.underline} bodies, for
example -- [has become an important motive for the US to seek
international cooperation.]{.underline} In this context, Joe [Biden has
proposed an "alliance of liberal democracies" to present an economic and
political alternative to China.]{.underline}

#### AI key to logistical streamlining -- that\'s key to military power

Margarita Konaev Husanjot Chahal April 2021 "The Path of Least
Resistance: Multinational Collaboration on AI for Military Logistics and
Sustainment" CSET Issue Brief

Focusing on AI-enabled Military Logistics and Sustainment¶ In military
affairs, [logistics is tasked with managing the global supply chain for
the armed services, including "the transfer of personnel and
materiel]{.underline} from one location to another, as well as the
maintenance of that materiel."27 Sustainment is a broader term,
encompassing logistics as well as financial management, personnel
services, and health services which together provide the support
necessary to maintain operations until the mission is accomplished.28
The two functions are closely intertwined. NATO's Allied Joint Doctrine
for Logistics, for instance, offers a comprehensive definition of
logistics that also entails elements of sustainment, encompassing the
aspects of military operations that deal with "design and development,
acquisition, storage, movement, distribution, maintenance, evacuation
and disposition of materiel; transport of personnel; acquisition,
construction, maintenance, operation and disposition of facilities;
acquisition or furnishing of services; and medical and health service
support."29¶ **[Logistics and sustainment are essential to military
effectiveness, readiness, survivability, and endurance,
and]{.underline}** in many ways, **[constitute the lifeblood of military
power]{.underline}**.30 [The D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense, in turn, [sees]{.underline} great [promise in
leveraging AI]{.underline}/machine learning (ML)
[tech]{.underline}nologies [for military logistics and sustainment to
better maintain equipment, reduce operational costs, and improve
readiness.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} Department of Defense's AI
[strategy]{.underline}, for example, [includes]{.underline} efforts
related to [AI-enabled logistics and sustainment]{.underline}, such as
"implementing predictive maintenance and supply, and streamlining
business processes," [as part of its strategic approach to "delivering
AI-enabled capabilities that address key missions]{.underline}."31
[Joint Logistics]{.underline}, in turn, [is]{.underline} one of the
JAIC's key mission initiatives, [dedicated to "improving fleet readiness
through AI-driven diagnostics, training, process
improvements]{.underline}, demand forecasting, [and supply chain
optimization]{.underline}."32¶ The discussion below outlines the
technological, political, and strategic imperatives and opportunities
for multinational collaboration on AI-enabled military logistics and
sustainment.¶ Naturally, the principal mission of militaries is national
defense and the force (including logistics and sustainment functions)
must be prepared for combat at any time. Modern militaries, however, are
massive organizations that employ hundreds of thousands of people, if
not more. The Department of Defense, for example, employs 2.91 million
people, and less than half of them, or 1.3 million, are active duty
personnel.33 And unlike military functions such as fires or movement and
maneuver of forces and equipment, many of the tasks related to military
logistics and other financial, personnel, and health services are
administered in noncombat settings.

#### Collaboration is key to ensure interoperability of military operations

Resistance: Multinational Collaboration on AI for Military Logistics and
Sustainment" CSET Issue Brief

[There is a strong consensus among U.S. national security experts that
collaboration with allies on artificial intelligence can
promote]{.underline} common [security interests and ensure that the
future of emerging technologies reflects shared democratic values and
ethical principles]{.underline}. The Department of Defense Artificial
Intelligence Strategy, for example, calls for engaging with
"international allies and partners" as a key step toward harnessing AI.2
Putting the strategy into practice, the Joint Artificial Intelligence
Center (JAIC) has launched an AI Partnership for Defense, bringing
together representatives of defense organizations from 13 nations to
"create new frameworks and tools for data sharing, cooperative
development, and strengthened interoperability."3

[U.S. allies are generally supportive of collaboration, including around
military applications of AI, and are particularly interested in ensuring
common standards for interpretability, safety, and security of
AI-enabled, safety-critical systems]{.underline}.4 As the NATO Deputy
Secretary General Mircea Geoană has noted, "[there are considerable
benefits of setting up a transatlantic digital community cooperating on
AI," with NATO playing a key role "as a facilitator for innovation and
exchange.]{.underline}"5 [The]{.underline} congressionally mandated
National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence
([NSCAI]{.underline}) [has]{.underline} explicitly [urged the
D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense and the
State Department [to support NATO's AI initiatives as well as negotiate
formal AI agreements with allies]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific.6

[That the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates a[nd its allies are
voicing interest in collaboration on AI is a positive
development]{.underline} considering that [**failing to work together
could be costly.** Because]{.underline} of [the gap in]{.underline}
technological and military [capabilities]{.underline} [between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies, the
development and integration of AI into military systems will not proceed
at the same rate]{.underline} or scope. [These disparities could create
new problems and amplify existing challenges for coordination and
interoperability in multinational coalitions, with]{.underline}
potentially [adverse]{.underline} [implications for cohesion and
military effectiveness]{.underline}.7 Indeed, as the NSCAI warns, [U.S.
allies]{.underline} already "[concerned]{.underline} [about being able
to operate effectively together as the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [fields]{.underline} greater numbers of [autonomous
systems]{.underline}."8

[The push toward]{.underline} closer [collaboration]{.underline}, then,
[stems]{.underline} in part [from]{.underline} the
[understanding]{.underline} that [gaps in]{.underline} technological and
military [capabilities]{.underline}, amplified by uneven progress in AI,
could harm the long-term health of U.S. alliances. Yet **[despite both
this growing urgency and shared interest]{.underline}** in multinational
collaboration on AI, [there are notable political, bureaucratic, and
technological challenges that could impede progress.]{.underline}

#### Military Incorporation of AI is key to maintaining supremacy 

**Gould 2022** - senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the
intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense
industry

By Joe Gould June 1 2022 "US military may need innovation overhaul to
fight future wars, Milley says"
https://www.c4isrnet.com/congress/2022/06/01/us-military-may-need-innovation-overhaul-to-fight-future-wars-milley-says/

[The U.S. military may need to reorganize to fight future wars, which
will be profoundly changed by artificial intelligence]{.underline},
robotics and other advanced technologies, according to Army Gen. Mark
Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.¶ The nation's top
military officer said during a trip to Europe this week that he's
working on recommendations that could lead to a high-level
reorganization. After launching Army Futures Command in 2018 to drive
modernization when he was that service's chief of staff, Milley said
he's mulling a similar effort for the joint force.¶ ["You're going to
have to do really fundamental changes to our military in order to take
advantage of this change in the character of war. In order to do that,
you need organizations to drive that]{.underline}," he told reporters.
"You look at what the Army did with Army Futures Command, for example.
[Can that be done at the]{.underline} joint level, at the [DoD
level]{.underline}?"¶ How Army Futures Command could be adapted across
the services, which have innovation efforts of their own, is unclear,
and Milley wasn't ready to say whether he'd be proposing an umbrella
"Joint Futures Command." Army civilian leaders have moved some of the
service's command's powers back to its senior civilian acquisitions
office, though it shepherded 24 modernization programs since its
inception.¶ The comments follow a warning he gave graduating cadets at
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point last week that the military's
technological edge is in danger. [No longer the unchallenged global
power, America is being tested in Europe by Russian aggression and in
Asia by China's dramatic economic and military growth.¶]{.underline}
"[We're going to have to really think hard about fundamental shifts to
our military]{.underline}," Milley said in London. "**[The country that
maximizes development of these technologies]{.underline}** **[with their
doctrines and organizations, in the time we have available, could be
decisive in the next conflict]{.underline}** \... I would suggest, in 10
to 15 years, you have to do these fundamental changes."¶ The Pentagon
has been trumpeting its stepped up investments in emerging technologies
and last week made its latest tech-focused organizational move. An
Emerging Capabilities Policy Office will help integrate autonomous
systems, hypersonic tech, directed-energy weapons, and other innovations
into the department strategy, planning guidance and budget processes.¶
The principal military advisor to the president and the secretary of
defense, Milley said he is also thinking through the implications of
emerging technologies, following the lead of Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin. The military is examining options for operational design and
structure of the force ― its brigades, divisions and fleets ― but also
its institutions.¶ "The institutions we have today may or may not be
optimally designed to leverage these technologies," he said.¶ Drawing a
parallel with the horse bit and stirrups that allowed for mounted
warfare some 3,000 years ago, Milley said that the existing technology
behind Fitbits and iPhones allow soldiers to sense their environment
like never before while accurate, long-range precision munitions let
them destroy targets like never before.¶ [Coupled with AI's potential to
speed battlefield decision-making and the robotics and the autonomous
technologies that are transforming the character of labor, militaries
and warfare could be entirely transformed]{.underline}. Trucking, which
is already adapting to driverless vehicles, and other **[industries that
lend themselves to robotics will fundamentally change]{.underline}**,
Milley said.¶ "With respect to the military, that's no less true. [We
have a wide variety of tasks that can be and probably will be conducted
by some form of robot]{.underline}," he said. "The unmanned aerial
vehicle is an example, but you could see in the future, pilotless air
forces ― manned/unmanned teaming where you have one aircraft that's got
a human in it and the rest of the squadron are robots.¶ "You could see
tank formations where maybe one armored vehicle is manned and the rest
are robotic," Milley said. "You could see a sailor-less Navy where one
or two ships are command-type ships and the rest are all robotic
ships."¶ With the potential to reduce casualties and manpower costs, and
revamp logistics, the implications are "almost infinite," he said,
adding that the Pentagon should be investing in those technologies, and
changing the concepts of how it fights, its doctrine, organizations,
leadership development.¶ "I believe we that [we are in a fundamental
change in the character of war, and by that I mean how you fight, where
you fight, the doctrine, the equipment, the tactics, techniques and
procedures]{.underline}, and so on," Milley said. "[We're in the middle
of a real, unbelievable fundamental change, which is probably the
biggest fundamental change in the history of warfare."]{.underline}

### Tech Leadership Key to Readiness

#### US proactive leadership is key -- it\'s the [only]{.underline} way to effectively counter China 

**Gude 2022** -- Executive Director of the think tank Trusted Future

Ken Gude May 31, 2022 "The U.S. Must Lead a New Transatlantic Alliance
on Tech Policy"
https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2022/05/31/the_us_must_lead_a_new_transatlantic_alliance_on_tech_policy_834883.html

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Europe have
reinvigorated the transatlantic security alliance in response to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. The galvanizing event of a
major war in Europe has spurred greater action on security cooperation
than at any point in decades. More importantly, [it has accelerated the
discussion about the importance of a common strategic
vision]{.underline} for the United States and Europe to work together
[to counter autocratic adversaries]{.underline}. ¶ [Despite the emerging
consensus on defense needs, disagreements on]{.underline} important
issues such as how we deal with increasingly [vital emerging
technologies continue to frustrate a common path forward]{.underline} on
democracy and technology. The NATO security alliance was essential for
meeting the challenges of the 20th century, but today\'s growing
challenges, including **[leading the global technological future, will
require even better cooperation]{.underline}** in more areas. [To
ensure]{.underline} that [democracies remain at the
forefront]{.underline} of economic development through this rapidly
changing international environment, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should lead a new transatlantic technology
alliance with our European allies]{.underline} based on our shared
democratic values.¶ Well over half of the economic growth since the end
of World War II has been directly attributable to technological
innovation. The American people see the importance of innovation with
large majorities telling us in a recent survey that they want U.S.
technology leadership so that the United States becomes a home for the
good paying jobs of the future, and that Congress should promote that
leadership through bipartisan investment. In a rare recent feat of that
bipartisanship, a conference committee of the House and Senate is now
considering bipartisan legislation that will invest billions to expand
American innovation, strengthen our cyber workforce, and diversify our
STEM pipeline.¶ [We need to increase investment]{.underline} in this
[innovation]{.underline} ecosystem [because China is outpacing the U.S.
in establishing leadership in]{.underline} the critical [emerging
technology]{.underline} sectors [that will drive the new jobs and
industries]{.underline} for decades to come. [China's]{.underline}
remarkable growth and [investment]{.underline} in its technology sector
[has caught many]{.underline} around the world [by
surprise]{.underline}. According to Harvard University's Belfer Center
for Science and International Affairs, [China "has displaced the U.S. as
the world's top high-tech manufacturer," and, "has become a serious
competitor in the foundational technologies of the 21st
century]{.underline}." But [just as the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is utilizing a powerful alliance with Europe to
assist Ukraine]{.underline} as it fights to counter Russian aggression,
[we need a strong partnership with]{.underline} our
[Europe]{.underline}an allies [to meet this new challenge of winning the
technological future]{.underline}. NATO was established to ensure that
the security architecture of Europe was not defined by undemocratic
forces. Likewise, the global technology future should be forged through
democratic values. As Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said, "We,
together with our allies, who care about privacy, freedom, individual
rights, individual protection, we need to write the rules of the road."¶
Unfortunately, [current proposals in Europe will hinder transatlantic
cooperation]{.underline} in this critical sector, [undermine American
innovators, and potentially strengthen the hand of organized criminals
and nation states that want to abuse technologies for malign
purposes]{.underline}. For example, the bipartisan leadership of the
Senate Finance Committee voiced concerns that [the European Digital
Markets Act would "unfairly disadvantage U.S. firms to the benefit of
not just European companies, but also powerful state-owned and
subsidized Chinese and Russian companies]{.underline}, which would have
negative impacts on users' privacy, security, and free speech." [Despite
the issues with the European approach]{.underline} expressed by their
colleagues, [some American legislators are pushing for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to follow Europe's
lead]{.underline}. A group of former Cabinet-level national security
officials recently warned that [these U.S. proposals "would provide an
open door for foreign adversaries to gain access to the software and
hardware of American technology companies]{.underline}... \[[which\]
could result in major cyber threats, misinformation, access to data of
U.S. persons, and intellectual property theft."]{.underline} However
well-intentioned these American and European proposals are, [this is the
wrong framework for a transatlantic technology alliance.]{.underline}

Second, [incorporating AI-enabled capabilities into alliance planning
exercises and wargames will help prepare policymakers and commanders to
better employ AI]{.underline}.132 Wargames, for instance, might ask
leaders to employ AI-enabled capabilities or respond to a rival's use of
AI-enabled weapons. [These]{.underline} events [allow leaders to test
and refine institutional processes in a low-risk environment, while also
socializing practitioners to the potential uses, limitations, and risks
of AI-enabled warfare]{.underline}.

Conclusion

As additional funding and research drive increases in the effectiveness
and reliability of AI, the military use of AI technologies will likely
expand. And [as more states integrate AI into their armed forces, the
United States will find itself working with allies to build and exercise
AI capabilities that are interoperable and support alliance
decision-making processes]{.underline}. **[Failure to
cooperate]{.underline}** early and often **[on the development and use
of AI may leave allies ill-prepared for operations in an era in which AI
is an increasingly common fixture in the arsenals of both friends and
foes.133]{.underline}**

[Alliances face two broad sets of challenges when integrating AI into
operations.]{.underline} [First, AI complicates alliance
operations]{.underline}. [The resource and data requirements needed to
build and maintain AI systems pose obstacles to burden-sharing and
interoperability]{.underline}. Adversaries can also use AI to launch
military deception campaigns that complicate operational coordination.
Second, [AI can significantly strain alliance
decision-making.]{.underline} New AI technologies promise to increase
the speed with which allies and adversaries conduct operations,
decreasing the time partners have to debate potential courses of action.
Decision-making can also be disrupted if adversaries use AI to generate
misinformation that can degrade trust among allies. [To overcome these
challenges, allies will need to establish multinational agreements and
standardization guidelines that help ensure data is structured in ways
that promote interoperability, while technical measures will help
preserve data privacy, allow for data sharing, and minimize the
consequences of AI use on the part of adversaries.]{.underline}

**[Whether and how states grapple with these challenges will shape the
conduct of multinational operations and has implications for alliance
politics and the global balance of power]{.underline}**. [Alliances that
effectively integrate AI technology will be better positioned to counter
threats, while those that allow AI to stymie decision-making and
operations may find themselves disadvantaged on the
battlefield.]{.underline} Within alliances, member states that quickly
master the integration of AI into their militaries may gain significant
influence, even if they are less powerful than other alliance partners
in conventional terms. Because of their AI know-how, these states may
play a dominant role in developing the norms, standards, and doctrine
for AI use and help set an alliance's AI strategy. In a similar vein,
Estonia leveraged its cyber warfare expertise to bolster its position in
NATO. Despite being territorially small and weak in conventional
military terms, Estonia's specialized expertise allowed it to play a
leading role in shaping NATO's cyber doctrine.134 A state's successful
development of AI can therefore increase its voice and sway within
complex multinational institutions.

[The existence of "AI haves" and "have-nots" within an alliance can
complicate burden-sharing]{.underline} --- [a central tenet of military
alliances]{.underline}. [On one hand, states with robust AI capabilities
can specialize their contributions to alliance operations and focus on
providing AI-related capabilities]{.underline}. If, however, AI
applications become a necessity for warfighting in the future, [states
that lack AI capabilities may be less able to contribute to alliance
operations.]{.underline} [States better equipped with AI capabilities
may subsequently be forced to take on a greater share of work,
generating both political and operational challenges. Politically, "AI
haves" may complain that "AI have-nots" are not adequately contributing
to a mission, straining relations between allies. Operationally,
capability gaps can hamper an alliance's ability to deploy forces or
achieve military objectives]{.underline}. During the NATO-led air war
over Kosovo in 1999, for instance, many NATO members possessed limited
numbers of precision-guided munitions in their arsenals and often lacked
the training to employ them, curtailing their ability to contribute to
operations.65 As a result, responsibility for carrying out the air
campaign fell to a small number of allies. In a larger conflict,
[burden-sharing might be critical to sustaining operations or securing
battlefield victories]{.underline}.

[Throughout NATO's history, defense innovation has been critical to its
technological edge and its deterrence and defense posture against
multiple threats]{.underline}. [The unprecedented progress in emerging
and disruptive technologies (EDTs) offers the prospect and challenge of
transformative defense innovation for allied armed forces and societies
at large]{.underline}. Technological progress in artificial intelligence
(**[AI) and machine learning]{.underline}**, advanced robotics,
biotechnologies and human enhancement, quantum technologies, big-data
analytics, and fifth-generation telecommunication systems, as well as
growing autonomy in the critical functions of military systems, [promise
to change how wars are fought, how fast, where, and by
whom]{.underline}. [These technologies enable new forms of military
presence, coercive action, and power projection in and across old and
new domains (for example, cyberspace and outer space) and below and
above the conventional threshold of armed conflict]{.underline}.

However, [NATO]{.underline} and the transatlantic allies [are neither
the only nor the most agile actors investing in emerging and disruptive
technologies. China and Russia already invest substantially in and have
accelerated their adoption of these technologies in military
applications.]{.underline} [To maintain its strategic advantage against
China and Russia, NATO needs to become an agent of innovation and be
more agile and strategic in supporting allies to jointly exploit new
technologies for deterrence, defense, and resilience
purposes]{.underline}. [NATO has]{.underline} prioritized EDTs and
[signaled it has joined "the technological adoption race" against China
and Russia]{.underline}.1 **[Much work remains to be
done]{.underline}**. [Allies remain divided on the ethical and legal
specifics of the military use of EDTs and by their national-industrial
preferences]{.underline}. [Technological capacity across the alliance
also varies significantly]{.underline} and, as always, funding is in
short supply. Concrete decisions on how to consolidate innovation in
EDTs, a critical task for NATO's mission and future adaptation, are
expected at this month's Brussels summit. Specifically, allies will
respond to calls for a "strategic surge" in EDTs2 innovation by
establishing a Defense Innovation Accelerator, an opt-in instrument
funded through dedicated national contributions, which NATO hopes will
incentivize innovation and transatlantic cooperation on emerging
technologies.3

[Long-term great-power competition has returned and it has a strong
technological dimension. The time when NATO had the luxury to adapt at
its own pace to a changing strategic environment is over. To survive and
remain relevant in a multipolar world of rapidly evolving security risks
and threats, and to compete successfully against Russia and China, NATO
needs a new framework centered on innovation as adaptation]{.underline}.
[The alliance's ongoing efforts in EDTs and the new NATO Strategic
Concept are timely opportunities to start on this new path. A focus on
inclusive innovation in NATO could increase adaptability and
competitiveness in the long-term, help to disrupt, deter or defeat
adversarial subversive actions, mitigate transnational threats and, more
importantly, maintain solidarity and the principle of indivisible
security among the allies.]{.underline}

[Recent digital and technological developments have enabled many
completely new tools, which have given rise to new virtual platforms
that fall outside current norms and rules]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} new tools have also [brought **unprecedented speed
to all kinds of action**]{.underline}. [Interconnectivity and
globalization have created new possibilities for network-based action,
lowered borders, changed geopolitics and made sure that there is more
data around us than ever before]{.underline}. [New actors]{.underline}
have emerged in international politics, who [are looking to enhance
their status]{.underline}. **[Authoritarian and democratic states appear
to be entering into a new form of ideological battle.]{.underline}** In
this situation one can ask: what are the rules of the game? [An
important weapon in this new battle is hybrid threats]{.underline}.
**[Hybrid threats constitute a shadow policy for authoritarian states
that supports their strategic aims and is based on their strategic
culture traditions]{.underline}**. The clear dividing lines, unwritten
rules, players and goals of the Cold War are history. [This situation is
challenging for planners, decision-makers and foresight
building]{.underline}.

The concept of hybrid threats has entered into political normality by
[appearing in]{.underline} the [discourses and documents of]{.underline}
the EU, [NATO]{.underline} and their member states. The concept has been
examined through many different disciplinary lenses: international
relations, strategic studies, security studies, military studies,
history and political science -- to name a few. This multidisciplinary
analytical mosaic also blurs the picture of what [hybrid
threats]{.underline} [really]{.underline} are. The Report "The Landscape
of Hybrid Threats: A Conceptual Model", issued by the European Centre of
Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE) together with the
European Union (EU) Commission's Joint Research Center, uses hybrid
threats as an umbrella concept, under which different types of activity
occur: [interference, influence, operations, campaigns and even
warfare]{.underline} (Giannopoulos, Smith and Theocharidou, 2020). [The
approach adopted would enable a comprehensive analysis including
civilian, political, military and academic thinking]{.underline}. This
chapter will take the report's conceptual model as its starting point
for hybrid threat analysis.

[Hybrid threats are]{.underline} still [difficult to define,
which]{.underline} on the one hand [complicates]{.underline} the
adoption of [strategies]{.underline} to counter them, common [positions
and a holistic approach, but]{.underline} on the other hand [gives
flexibility, greater freedom to be creative and possibility to combine
different disciplines and backgrounds]{.underline}. Consequently, the
[characterization of hybrid threats will help]{.underline} to [identify
real threats, potential threats and also]{.underline} those **[aspects
that might look like threats but are not]{.underline}**. [Too tight
definition might]{.underline}, in the worst case, point in the [wrong
direction and also tie one's hands when it comes to
responding.]{.underline}

There is still an ongoing debate regarding the usefulness of the concept
of hybrid threats. Those saying that hybrid threats are mostly "old wine
in new bottles" mean that perhaps we do not need a new concept, and we
could just adjust the old ones to current circumstances. To this Frank
Hoffman, who is often seen as the man behind the 'hybrid warfare'
concept, answered in the following way: "New language and new terms aid
us in thinking differently and characterizing what is truly new,
hopefully without overlooking what is enduring in war. A new lexicon
captures the changes better than hanging on to old terms with new
meanings" (Hoffmann, 2010).

The 'old' in the concept of hybrid threats lies in the fact that
interference and influence have always been part of international
politics. Also, the technique of combining different domains like
social, political, informational, military and legal ones has been part
of the strategic thinking behind influence, interference and military
operations. This thinking is also present in today's activities that
constitute hybrid threats. [What is new]{.underline}, then -- [although
anchored to]{.underline} traditions in the [authoritarian strategic
thinking]{.underline} -- [is related to today's security environment and
how it is different compared to the Cold War's, for
example]{.underline}. The battle between [democratic and
authoritarian]{.underline} state systems today [is not as clear-cut
as]{.underline} the division between [communist and
capitalist]{.underline} countries was during the Cold War. Furthermore,
[digital and technological developments have provided new
platforms]{.underline} for influencing, new [tools]{.underline} for both
interference and influence, [and]{.underline} have extended the
[domains]{.underline} where action happens -- from the traditional
military domains like land, air and sea, to cyber and space, to more
comprehensive domains like culture and administration. These are all
connected and, [through hybrid threats activities with a targeted
approach]{.underline}, **[even the best prepared states and alliances
can be challenged]{.underline}**.

[The logic of interference found in hybrid threats is substantially
based on authoritarian strategic culture.]{.underline} [Strategic
culture]{.underline} itself as a concept has been contested, but in
recent years it [has found its way back into security
studies]{.underline}. It is worth noting that the Cold War
juxtaposition, the bipolarity of the superpowers, crucially downplayed
the relevance of national aspects relating to cooperation, competition,
conflict, and war. In that way, the 'national character' of the enemy,
which was very important before the Second World War, was downplayed
during the Cold War years (Miklossy & Smith, 2020: xiii). Post-Cold War
studies started to pay attention again to different domestic processes
and their effects. As Glenn observed, "\[t\]he mid-nineties witnessed
the emergence of a new school of realists that sought to move beyond the
basic insights of Waltzian neorealism by investigating the interaction
of systemic pressures and domestic processes in the foreign policy
decision making process, thus providing a much richer explanatory
account of why states choose certain foreign policies over others"
(2009: 523-551). From examining national strategic cultures, the theory
can also be extended to cover strategic cultures of a particular state
system. [Here the concept of authoritarian strategic culture comes from
the studies that produce characterizations of authoritarian and
totalitarian regimes]{.underline} (Linz, 2000; Svolik, 2012; Brooker,
2014). There are national specificities when it comes to behavior, and
there are specificities that are linked to the state system. The
national specificities are more difficult to define due to the fact that
culture as a concept is complex. A state system is relatively easier. A
state system often defines the regime type as well as its relationship
to civil society, opposition and the military.

[This chapter begins by presenting the characteristics of hybrid
threats, as identified in the authoritarian strategic thinking
specifically in relation to Russia and Chinese traditions.
Those]{.underline} [characteristics are then put into the context of
decision-making following]{.underline} David Omand's [Situation
awareness, Explanation, Estimate and Strategic notice]{.underline}
(SEES) model. In the third part, the challenges that the new information
environment presents us are considered, and finally the chapter draws
some conclusions relating to allied decision-making.

Hybrid Threats and Strategic Thinking As mentioned in the introduction,
this chapter takes as its starting point the report "The landscape of
Hybrid Threats: A conceptual model". The report does not claim to be an
exhaustive source for the description of all the characteristics that
hybrid threats might have, and there might be many more that have to do
with the changing nature of the phenomenon. However, the report does
identify five characteristics deemed to be the most important with
respect to the challenges they pose to decision-making: • Usage of
multiple synchronized tools, used to create linear and non-linear
effects; • Ability to create ambiguity with plausible or implausible
deniability and to hide true intent; • Deliberate threshold manipulation
and the use of grey zones like borders between war and peace, friend and
enemy, virtual and real, internal and external, etc; • Exploitation of
the seams of democratic societies and the different jurisdictions
(local, state, international); • Use of decoys. These five challenges
are all related to Russian and Chinese interference and influence
traditions, which will be presented in the following sections. In turn,
they are part of wider strategic culture, which is the product of a
centuries-long dialogue between a people and its history (Gray, 2006:
15). Strategic culture is closely interlinked with the idea of national
interests in a spatial context that is defined by potential threats,
perceptions of friends and foes, traditions of alliances, and
institutional linkages (Miklossy & Smith, 2020: 263).

Traditions of Chinese strategic thinking Since uncovering strategic
culture is beyond the scope of this chapter, the approach is to present
**[some dominant ideas that are still present today in Chinese thinking
relating to interference, influence and winning conflicts and
wars]{.underline}**. [The Chinese thinking presented here is based on
three books; On Strategy Studies]{.underline} (2006) [published
by]{.underline} [the]{.underline} People's Liberation Army
([PLA]{.underline}), [Political Work Guidelines of the **P**eople's
**L**iberation **A**rmy]{.underline} (2003), [where the "Three Warfares"
concept is introduced, and The seven military classics of Ancient
China]{.underline} (2017), [which presents seven texts from different
times seen as cornerstones of Chinese military tradition]{.underline}.
[This is particularly relevant since President Xi Jingping has forbidden
the use of foreign theory books in education and has mandated turning
back to their own classics including those on strategy]{.underline}
(Nojonen, 2019). [Therefore, Chinese practitioners of strategy are
actively studying their own classics in building a professional identity
and practices based on the particular traditional conceptualization of
the Chinese strategy work]{.underline} (Nojonen, 2019).

The book On Strategy Studies, published in Chinese, introduces the
concept of "supraplanning": a dynamic process towards a goal -- and not
a rigid adherence to a sequence of steps that is forever fixed and
precisely worked out in advance. The authors outline three factors that
determine the strategic behavior of the Chinese military: strategic
thinking, strategic environment and military capacity. The book makes a
point that the aim is "to lure the other side into developing
misperceptions...and to \[establish for oneself\] a strategically
advantageous position by producing various kinds of false phenomena in
an organized and planned manner with the smallest cost in manpower and
materials" (Detweiler, 2009: 10).

In analyzing Chinese strategic behavior, the authors argue that [the
tradition, understanding and practice of stratagems is the dominant
pattern of Chinese strategy thinking]{.underline}. Based on the book,
the characteristics of Chinese supraplanning are: a) resourcefulness and
decisiveness; b) deep stratagems and distant deliberations; c)
comprehensive planning and preparations; d) flexibility and ingenuity.
It is important to note that different concepts found in traditional
Chinese strategic thinking are presented in a dialectic way, such as
"weakness and strength", and "clandestine manoeuvres and open
operations". This means that [concepts are not strictly defined, but
rather remain borderless and ambivalent, creating
ambiguity]{.underline}. Also, these concepts can be nouns and verbs at
the same time; in other words, they can be both abstractions of
cognitive processes as well as actual practices. This means that a solid
picture of each given situation might be very difficult to form without
a profound knowledge of Chinese language (Nojonen, 2019).

Also, the more well know Chinese concept of "[Three
Warfares]{.underline}", in the book Political Work Guidelines,
[comprises three different components: Psychological Warfare, Public
Opinion Warfare and Legal Warfare.]{.underline} The [Three
Warfare]{.underline} concept [was first made official in the revisions
of the PLA's Political Work Regulations in 2003. -]{.underline}
[Psychological Warfare is]{.underline} defined as operations that
achieve political and military aims by influencing a target's psychology
and behavior through the [distribution of specific
information]{.underline}. Situational awareness can be blurred with
[informational manipulation, and different biases can be
supported.]{.underline} In this respect, [the 'targets' are
practitioners and decision-makers]{.underline}. Psychological Warfare
methods include deterrence, coercion, deception, instigation, seduction,
bribery, inducement and confusion. These methods are part of both
theoretical and doctrinal descriptions. - Public Opinion Warfare is
defined as operations aimed at influencing both domestic and
international support with the use of selective information delivered
through different media. This is different from psychological warfare in
the way that it aims to control the masses. [The main channels for this
type of activity are the internet and traditional media sources, such as
broadcasting and newspapers]{.underline}. Towards the public opinion,
warfare concept channels also include international organizations and
academic forums that can be used from within under a tailor-made
approach. - Legal Warfare is used to attain legal superiority by using
domestic and international law to gain a political initiative or
military advantage. Rather than viewing law as a method of rational
order- making, legal warfare looks for ways to use legal advantage to
influence targets by delivering the effects of interference, response,
defeat, deterrence, or defense via legal means, including through
national or international channels.

[The third book, The seven military classics of Ancient China, gives a
comprehensive picture from a historical perspective of how Chinese
rulers and generals have analyzed the best ways to keep power, get
power, conquer land, defeat the enemy and gain control]{.underline}. The
book includes Sun Tzu's famous "Art of War", and Huang Shigong's "Three
Strategies", which discusses the Art of War. In the latter text, for
example, the line "Follow their (enemy) trends in order to break them.
Be wild with your words in order for them to make mistakes. Surround
them with your net in order to catch them", could be applied to today's
security environment, where the manipulation of information is based on
the assumption that decision-makers will make mistakes that favor the
actors providing misinformation. All these texts have psychological
elements, search for weaknesses and look for ways to covertly succeed.

This snapshot of Chinese strategic thinking already shows that it will
be very hard from outside China to identify actions that are seen and
planned by Beijing to be borderless and ambivalent. Furthermore,
different levels of decision-making are the main target. The various
tools are designed to work in the way that situational awareness is
blurred and context is lost, which means that estimates, warnings and
preparedness in the target are incomplete.

This chapter seeks to offer preliminary answers to two questions. First,
[to what degree will]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**)-[enabled information warfare **exacerbate hybrid
threats to NATO decision-making**]{.underline}? Second, [what can NATO
countries do to alleviate the threat]{.underline}? To narrow the
research scope, this chapter [will]{.underline} principally look at
threats posed by Russian AI-enabled information warfare operations under
the concept of gibridnaya voyna. The study argues that **[given that
AI-enabled information warfare has the potential to amplify societal
polarization, elite disagreement within domestic politics, and reshape
the perception of the "Russian threat" in NATO member countries, it can
have a direct negative impact on national and NATO
decision-making]{.underline}**. Such operations, however, only amplify
existing symptoms of polarization and disagreement found within NATO
member states and are not their root causes. The chapter concludes that
[NATO must better integrate tech-centric so-called "whack-a-troll"
tactics with a **whole-of-nation strategy** to better **safe-guard NATO
decision-making and alliance cohesion**. Renewed discussion of
whole-of-society defense concepts to inform national security strategies
may be useful in this regard]{.underline}.

Introduction [NATO defines hybrid threats as threats that "combine
military and non-military as well as covert and overt means, including
disinformation, cyber attacks, economic pressure, deployment of
irregular armed groups and use of regular forces]{.underline}" (2019).
[Such hybrid methods are used to blur the line between war and peace and
"attempt to sow doubts in the minds of target populations."]{.underline}
[NATO further emphasizes that]{.underline} ["\[t\]he speed, scale and
intensity of hybrid threats have increased in recent
years]{.underline}." [The latter can partially be traced back to various
technological **advances** including **in** the fields of]{.underline}
Artificial Intelligence ([**AI**) and offensive cyber capabilities,
utilized in conjunction with deliberate attempts by competitor nations
to undermine the political **cohesion of NATO** member states from
within]{.underline}.

[Hybrid threats pose]{.underline} a number of [unique challenges to
political decision-making within]{.underline} both [NATO]{.underline}
member [states and]{.underline} the Alliance's various deliberative
[bodies]{.underline}, where decisions are based on the principle of
consensus preceded by consultation processes (NATO, 2020). In
particular, [meddling]{.underline} by outside powers [in political
processes]{.underline} by means of influence operations, broadly defined
as "organized attempts to achieve a specific effect among a target
audience," [is one of the top concerns of NATO leadership]{.underline}
(Thomas et al., 2020). [In particular, Russian]{.underline}
tactical-operational influence operations under the concept of
gibridnaya voyna ('[hybrid warfare']{.underline}) have been
[receiv]{.underline}ing a great deal of [attention]{.underline} since
2014. As Ofer Fridman notes, [such operations target society at large,
seeking to undermine political cohesion in an adversary state by
employing methods that amplify the divisions and polarizations among its
citizens]{.underline} (2018).

Definitional confusion has plagued the discussion on hybrid warfare.
Fridman, who sketches the conceptual evolution of the term in both the
West and Russia, points out that at least three different phenomena have
been described as hybrid warfare in past years with no agreed upon
definition. Indeed, the term 'hybrid warfare' itself may at this point
obfuscate rather than clarify modern conflict characteristics. As
Fridman argues: "Despite the political usefulness of the term hybrid
warfare, it would appear that Russian and Western military professionals
now recognize that the term is next to useless for describing the real
nature of contemporary conflicts, leading them to promote more specific
definitions, such as information warfare, cyber warfare, which are now
prevalent in the West, or new-generationwarfare, which is currently
prevalent in Russia" (2018: 157).

Indeed, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, General Valery
Gerasimov, has publicly aimed to draw a distinction between
new-generation warfare and hybrid warfare with the former -- given its
emphasis on military capabilities -- being the main focus of the Russian
Armed Forces (Fridman, 2018).

**[Nonetheless, it is evident from a review of Russian military
literature that hybrid warfare focused on weakening societal cohesion of
an opponent still retains a prominent spot in Russian national security
thinking]{.underline}**. For example, [a 2015 article]{.underline} on
future warfare published [in the widely-read journal of the Russian
Ministry of Defence]{.underline} [stated in strong terms the centrality
of information to the Russian understanding of future war, asserting
that "it is precisely the information-psychological struggle which will,
in the main, create the preconditions for the achievement of victory
\[in future warfare]{.underline}\]". The article, authored by two
frequent contributors on future warfare, continued: "...the achievement
of strategic objectives in future wars will be impossible without the
establishment of information dominance over the enemy. In future wars,
special [disinformation]{.underline} operations [and]{.underline}
\[operations for\] [misleading]{.underline} the military-political
leadership of the other side [will include a system of interconnected
and carefully-agreed upon large-scale measures **according
to**]{.underline} the plan of new-type war ('**[hybrid
war']{.underline}**), including the use of various means of actions upon
the personnel of the armed forces and population of the state [with the
objective of creating internal tension]{.underline} (schism) in society.
[Information-psychological operations in future war will pursue by
non-forceful means the objective of achieving the significant weakening
of the military potential of the enemy by means of affecting his
information processes, misleading \[him\], demoralizing the population
and the personnel of the armed forces"]{.underline} (Bogdanov and
Chekinov, 2015: 45)

**[As part of]{.underline}** such **[future Russian]{.underline}**
gibridnaya voyna **[campaigns]{.underline}**, **[the effective
integration of AI with cyber capabilities that enable faster and more
precise weaponization of information has the potential to compromise and
undermine NATO decision-making at multiple levels]{.underline}**. This
chapter consequently seeks to offer preliminary answers to two questions
in this regard. First, to what degree will AI-enabled information
warfare1 exacerbate hybrid threats to NATO decision-making? Second, what
can NATO countries do to alleviate the threat?

To narrow the research scope, this chapter will principally look at
threats posed by Russian influence operations under the concept of
gibridnaya voyna.

Factors Influencing NATO Decision-Making In order to answer to the above
questions, it is first necessary to outline the various influences that
impact allied decision-making within NATO. According a recent RAND
study, [member states' decision-making processes on their own
participation in NATO operations can be broadly divided into three
categories: • Domestic politics; • Perception of the Russian threat; •
Alliance dynamics]{.underline} (Binnendijk and Priebe, 2019).

Notably, RAND finds that [domestic politics and perceptions of the
Russian threat have the larger impact in decision-making processes
involving a]{.underline}n unconventional (i.e. [hybrid]{.underline})
[attack]{.underline} on a NATO country. In the future, such an attack
would undoubtedly feature AI-enabled information warfare as part of
gibridnaya voyna embedded within a new-generation warfare campaign.
Consequently, this chapter will primarily focus on domestic politics and
perceptions of the Russian threat to illustrate Russian
tactical-operational AI-enabled information warfare.

According to the RAND study, domestic political considerations that
influence decision-making regarding support or opposition to NATO
military action in an unconventional environment are impacted by a
number of factors, including the proximity of public elections, general
public support for a particular course of action, elite agreement or
disagreement (coalition governments can be particularly vulnerable in
this case), and a centralized or decentralized foreign policy
decision-making structure. Perceptions of the Russian threat in turn are
also subject to a number of factors including perceptions of Moscow's
aims and motivations, escalation risks, vulnerabilities to Russian
economic sanctions as well as military retaliations, and competing
national security demands (Binnendijk and Priebe, 2019).

Most relevant for this chapter is that [in both]{.underline} instances
-- [domestic politics and perceptions of the Russian threat]{.underline}
-- [**AI**-enabled information operations have the potential to
influence factors in favor of Russia.]{.underline} For example, such
operations could expand the audience reach of NATO-skeptical parties
during election seasons, or in advance of a parliamentary vote in order
to undermine elite consensus on anti-Russian actions. Alternatively,
with the help of a carefully crafted 'what aboutism' narrative employed
part of a wider disinformation operation, Moscow could amplify
disagreement over aggressive Russian actions within a target country by
emphasizing online that Russia, like any other country, is merely
pursuing legitimate selfinterest.

AI-Enabled Information Warfare [**AI**-enabled information warfare
entails the use of algorithms capable of processing and learning from
big data to execute attacks against specific targets autonomously or
semi-autonomously in order to achieve a desired effect in the
information space]{.underline}. 2 The terms 'autonomously' and
'semi-autonomously' describe respectively the ability of the algorithm
without or with (limited) human intervention to learn from vast amounts
of data in order to execute polymorphic attacks on multiple fronts in
the information space (for example, simultaneous attacks on a
microblogging site synchronized with emails phishing attacks), in which
the algorithm is capable of changing its identifiable features (for
example, by creating multiple malicious online identities fitted with
unique malware packages). The most relevant media for AI-enabled
information warfare are audio, text and video (Giles and Hartmann,
2020). Furthermore, AI-enabled information operations target all
interrelated dimensions of the information environment -- physical,
informational, and cognitive/emotional. Herbert Lin and Jaclyn Kerr
define the information environment as, the "aggregate of individuals,
organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on
information" (2019: 4).

[AI]{.underline}-enabled information [warfare methods may plausibly be
deployed in various other ways]{.underline}. For example, [AIenabled
algorithms permit the building of realistic simulations of individuals
"to test every individual's reaction to events (both virtual and real),
advertising, political campaigns, and psychological operations, and even
to guess what might go viral through person-to-person
interactions]{.underline}" (Libicki, 2017: 52). Such simulations could
be created by deploying an algorithm capable of pattern recognition to
study the social media behavior of a select target group of individuals
in a specific country. [This]{.underline} in turn [could be used to
create personalized phishing emails for social engineering attacks, but
also]{.underline} to create so-called '[deepfakes']{.underline} to gain
access to sensitive systems or to facilitate the spreading of
disinformation. Another example is the use of [bots]{.underline} in
order [to 'hijack' public perceptions]{.underline}: "[Bots, trolls, and
sock puppets can invent new 'facts' out of thin air leading to a
polarized society and a culture of mistrust]{.underline}" (Wright, 2019:
318). [The main objective behind creating alternate facts would not be
to create a convincing alternative narrative -- which is an objective of
strategic communications -- but rather to erode the solidarity of groups
facing the same threat by **playing on** the **fears and anxieties of
individuals (**]{.underline}Libicki, 2017).

In sum, [AI-enabled information warfare differs from 'regular'
information warfare in four crucial areas]{.underline}: 1.
[Speed]{.underline}: AI can accelerate the pace of operations by, for
example, faster identifying targets due to the expedited
operationalization of cyber intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) data as a result of increased pattern recognition
capabilities of algorithms. 2. [Scope]{.underline}: AI can expand the
scope of information warfare operations by semi-autonomously or
autonomously executing polymorphic attacks on multiple platforms with
the help of bots, trolls, or sock puppets. 3. [Scale]{.underline}: AI
can increase the chances of a particular message or narrative going
'viral' in the information space by, for example, self-learning
algorithms 'wargaming' the potential impact of specific content online,
or AI-enabled facial recognition software that is capable of recognizing
emotional states of individual humans. 4. [Sophistication]{.underline}:
AI can not only increase the sophistication of microtargeting processes,
but also facilitate the creation of ever more convincing synthetic media
products (such as 'deepfakes') with the support of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) where it is increasingly difficult to
separate real from synthetic identities (Rocca, 2019).

**[Since AI is both scalable and effective, it is likely to be of
significant utility to those seeking to undermine Western democracies
because it will permit adversaries to avoid making tradeoffs between
scale and effectiveness]{.underline}**. [In particular, AI will likely
allow adversaries to expand exponentially the scale and rate of attacks,
while also increasing the number of targets]{.underline} (Rocca, 2019).
In addition, [the following factors are all likely to enhance the
utility of AI in information warfare:]{.underline} [societies' growing
dependence on cyberspace as a news source; citizens' increased reliance
on social media; the difficulties individuals face in distinguishing
between fake and genuine news sources; the unprecedented levels of
access to information; and the speed at which information can be spread
between individuals]{.underline} (Giles and Hartmann, 2020).

### Impact -- US-Sino AI Tech Race

#### The US-Sino AI arms race is [escalating]{.underline} \-\-- the aff positions [dominance]{.underline} that spills over to modernizing military tech \-\-- it's a national security question

Algorithms trained on mountains of Chinese data may soon be making
decisions that deeply affect the lives of people in the US. Take Yitu
Technology, [a Shanghai-based artificial intelligence
start-up]{.underline} that won top honours in two AI competitions in the
US last year for its facial recognition technology. The system was built
for Chinese law enforcement using data collected by the authorities. Or
as the company boasts, it was honed on the "world's largest portrait
system, covering more than 1.5bn people." Yitu is [now looking for
customers in the US to put its software to work]{.underline}. "There are
a lot of applications for this technology," says Wu Shuang, who heads
its Silicon Valley research group. This story is the first in a series
on the [**growing competition between the US and China over AI, which
will have an impact on the contest for military superiority, the
international trading system and the future of the**
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [p]{.underline}arty. It is
not alone. Shenzhen-based Malong Technologies has also trained its image
recognition algorithms on masses of Chinese data --- in its case, by
analysing hundreds of thousands of photos from fashion shows to identify
trends for clients in the garment industry. It says it is now trialing
the technology with ecommerce companies in the US. A "key difference in
China is there are just more people, more data, more businesses --- it's
just bigger," says chief technology officer Matt Scott, a former
Microsoft researcher who moved to China to co-found the company. "Having
access to that data in China, we can export \[the technology\] around
the world." Algorithms like these are the advanced guard in [a battle
that will go a long way to determining economic leadership in the era of
Big Data]{.underline} **--- a contest where [China is catching up
quickly and now vying with the US to be the dominant
force]{.underline}**[. The AI revolution]{.underline} **is often thought
of in terms of robots or drones that can do tasks once performed by
humans. But its impact** [will]{.underline} **also** [be felt
from]{.underline} **a less visible source ---** [the ability to sweat
the data the hardest]{.underline}**.** Machine learning systems that can
find patterns by analysing large data sets are at the cutting edge of
today's artificial intelligence. For some industries, deep learning ---
the most advanced form of [the tech]{.underline}**nology ---** [has the
potential to create value equivalent to as much as 9 per cent of a
company's revenues, according to a report]{.underline} **in April**
[from McKinsey Global Institute**. That translates into trillions of
dollars**]{.underline} **of potential economic value --- and the US and
China are the clear leaders. "If you look globally[, it's a two-horse
race in AI]{.underline},"** says Michael Chui, a McKinsey partner who
led the study. Visitors to the China Public Security Expo in Shenzhen in
October are scanned by facial recognition software © Reuters In China,
the AI boom has fed the country's swelling sense of self-confidence in
its expanding technology base. President Xi Jinping has made AI one of
the central pillars of the Made in China 2025 plan to transform the
country's economy and has set a goal of being the world leader in the
technology by 2030. At the same time, China's advances are also
contributing to an opposite paranoia [in the US]{.underline} **that
its** [tech]{.underline}**nology** [exceptionalism can no longer be
taken for granted]{.underline}**.** The Trump administration's plans for
a trade war with Beijing are motivated --- at least in part --- by fear
of China's advances in new technology. "It's clear that the US
government sees itself in **[a tech arms race]{.underline}** with the
Chinese government," says Robert Silvers, a partner at legal firm Paul
Hastings and former assistant secretary for cyber policy at the
department of homeland security. "The US is taking the view that
**[these kinds of technologies are so transformative that the country
that gets the lead is going to have not just economic or tech advantage
but also national security advantage]{.underline}**." One reason the
contest over AI is so charged **is** [that it is connected with a race
to find a new military edge]{.underline}**. As well as answering mundane
customer queries and piloting driverless cars, [the same technology can
also be deployed to synchronise drone swarms, analyse pictures taken by
spy drones and control autonomous boats.]{.underline}** Dominance in AI
could bring a step change in warfare, says Sean Gourley, founder of
Primer, a Silicon Valley AI start-up whose backers include the CIA's
venture capital arm. Technology shifts like this can undermine the
military advantage of great powers. ["It's likely to be coupled with the
reordering of global power. Whoever is best at this will be in a strong
position in 10 years' time]{.underline}**," he says.**

#### Chinese expansionism makes war likely in the event of tech supremacy despite international checks and M.A.D.

needs to stop playing peacemaker and start making China feel
uncomfortable" Foreign Policy Journal Online
http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/21/roiling_the_waters

Though officials on both sides of the Pacific are publicly loath to add
fuel to the fire, it is increasingly clear that [China\'s recent
regional provocations are the result of more than just knee-jerk
reactions or bureaucratic malfunctions over long-forgotten borders or
arcane historical ownership]{.underline}. [Beijing\'s]{.underline}
far-reaching claims in the East and South China seas \-- and [coercive
efforts to intimidate neighbors]{.underline} \-- have [unsettled
countries]{.underline} from Vietnam to the Philippines to Japan [because
they amount to an expansionist strategy, with profound implications for
U.S. power and regional security]{.underline}. [China\'s]{.underline}
latest act of revisionism, in late November, was [to declare an air
defense identification]{.underline} [zone]{.underline} (ADIZ) [across
la]{.underline}r[ge swaths of the East China Sea]{.underline}, including
over the disputed Senkaku Islands (called the Diaoyu by the Chinese).
[America\'s response was]{.underline} twofold: The White House indicated
[that it would not officially honor the ADIZ designation]{.underline} (a
message delivered [by sending unarmed B-52 bombers through the
zone]{.underline} on what the Pentagon called a routine and long-planned
training mission), but it initially encouraged commercial airliners to
comply with Beijing\'s request to identify themselves to Chinese air
traffic control. Meanwhile, it dispatched high-level officials to calm
the waters: When Vice President Joe Biden met with Chinese leaders in
early December, his mission, according to one senior administration
official, was to push for \"crisis management mechanisms and
confidence-building measures to lower tensions and reduce risk of
escalation or miscalculation.\" This [effort to play the role of
regional peacemaker echoes]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline}
administration[\'s approach in 2012]{.underline} during the Scarborough
Shoal standoff between China and the Philippines, as well as during the
row between Tokyo and Beijing after Japan nationalized the Senkaku
Islands. But [if China\'s ends haven\'t changed, its means
have]{.underline} \-- in the past years, [Beijing has stepped up efforts
to achieve its long-held territorial aims]{.underline}. As a former
Chinese ambassador told us in December, her country\'s position in the
world is like that of \"a new student that jumped many
grades[.\"]{.underline} Maybe so, but [Beijing\'s behavior since 2009 is
more akin to that of a brash adolescent both unaware and blithe to the
potential consequences of adventurous behavior]{.underline}. U.S.
officials have been careful to avoid provoking a China that appears
increasingly willing to flex its newfound military muscle. U.S.
officials have been careful to avoid provoking a China that appears
increasingly willing to flex its newfound military muscle. Perhaps
that\'s why Biden invoked his father\'s advice in warning on the eve of
his Beijing visit that \"the only conflict that is worse than one that
is intended is one that is unintended.\" But [an overemphasis on
stability can be dangerous]{.underline}. [While preventing inadvertent
war in Asia is obviously a worthy goal, it is just as important to
discourage China from believing that it can employ economic, military,
and diplomatic coercion to settle international disagreements without
triggering a serious response.]{.underline} [Making the risk of
escalation too low will]{.underline} at some point [start running
counter to U.S. interests]{.underline}. Why? Because [China is taking
advantage of Washington\'s risk aversion by rocking the boat, seeing
what it can extract in the process, and letting the United States worry
about righting it.]{.underline} [Beijing\'s]{.underline} playbook of
[tailored coercion relies in part on China\'s confidence that it can
weather ephemeral international outrage while Washington takes
responsibility for ensuring the situation doesn\'t get out of
control]{.underline}. This means that [reducing the likelihood of
escalation through]{.underline} high-level strategic
[dialogues]{.underline} and military-to-military hotlines, however
important, is in and of itself [insufficient to curb Chinese
assertiveness]{.underline}. [History has demonstrated the perils of
focusing too much on stability at the expense of
deterrence]{.underline}. [The Cuban missile crisis]{.underline}, the
modern world\'s closest brush with the apocalypse, [was precipitated by
Soviet Premier]{.underline} Nikita [Khrushchev\'s perception that the
United States,]{.underline} especially President John F. Kennedy[, was
overly concerned about stability and cooling tensions between the
superpowers.]{.underline} Khrushchev\'s [sense that America could be
pushed was formed by]{.underline} Kennedy\'s [cautious reactions to
assertive Soviet moves toward Berlin]{.underline}, as well as
Khrushchev\'s measure of Kennedy at the 1961 Vienna superpower summit as
\"weak\" and accommodating. Over the following year and a half,
Khrushchev and [the Soviet Union sought to exploit what they perceived
to be shaky American resolve, pressing in Berlin,]{.underline} where
East Germany built a wall closing off the free part of the city, [and
secretly deploying nuclear-armed missiles to Cuba]{.underline}. [Only
through a demonstrated willingness on the part of Kennedy to go to the
nuclear brink \-- with U.S. nuclear forces on high alert and U.S. naval
forces prepared to forcibly halt Soviet ships attempting to run the
blockade (accompanied by a U.S. concession on missile deployments in
Turkey) \-- was the United States able to get Moscow to back
down.]{.underline} Needless to say, restraint and a willingness to
negotiate were elemental to a peaceful resolution of the crisis, but
only in the context of a major mobilization of U.S. forces against Cuba,
the elevation of the U.S. alert level to Defcon 2 (one step short of
nuclear war), and chilling threats designed to convince the Soviets that
conciliation was the only viable move. OF COURSE, CHINA IS NOT THE
SOVIET UNION. And 2014 is not 1962. The point is simply that [a country
with the power of the USSR or China, unsatisfied with features of the
existing order, motivated to do something to change it, and skeptical of
the resolve of the United States, could well pursue a policy of coercion
and brinkmanship, even under the shadow of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
As historian Francis Gavin has argued, the whole history of [the Cold
War shows that]{.underline} countries like [China]{.underline} \-- and,
at times, the United States \-- [can bluff, coerce, and threaten their
way to geopolitical gain.]{.underline} The worst way to deal with such a
power is to leave it with the impression that these approaches work.
Just as the United States would have been far better off if Kennedy, at
the Vienna summit, had squelched Khrushchev\'s doubts about his resolve
to defend Berlin, it will be far better if the leadership in Beijing has
the clear sense that the United States will meet each challenge to its
and its allies\' interests resolutely. Taking a cue from history, the
United States needs to inject a healthy degree of risk into Beijing\'s
calculus Taking a cue from history, the United States needs to inject a
healthy degree of risk into Beijing\'s calculus, even as it searches for
ways to cooperate with China. This does not mean abandoning engagement
or trying to contain China, let alone fomenting conflict. [But it does
mean communicating that Beijing has less ability to control escalation
than it seems to think. China must understand that attempts to roil the
waters could result in precisely the kinds of costs and conflicts it
seeks to avoid.]{.underline} To make this work, the United States should
pursue policies that actually elevate the risks \-- political, economic,
or otherwise \-- to Beijing of acting assertively. On the high seas, the
focal point for the region\'s territorial disputes, [China has bullied
its neighbors by relying on non-military vessels]{.underline}. China is
[using its rapidly expanding coast guard to assert its expansive
sovereignty claims by harassing non-Chinese fishermen, oil companies,
and military vessels that pass through contested waters in the East and
South China seas. This has the benefit of exploiting China\'s dominant
numerical advantage while keeping the U.S. Navy on the
sidelines.]{.underline} Washington should blur the false distinction
between non-military and military ships by stating that it will respond
to physical coercion and the use of force as deemed appropriate \--
regardless of whether the perpetrator is a white- or gray-hulled ship.
Exercises that practice U.S. naval operations against aggressive
non-military vessels would be a good place to start. So would calling
upon China to end its illegal occupation of the disputed Scarborough
Shoal off the Philippine coast, while contesting Chinese administration
there by sending the U.S. Navy through the area to assert its right to
freedom of navigation. The [Chinese]{.underline} PLA [Navy]{.underline},
for its part, [hasn\'t been shy to test the waters]{.underline}. In
early December, the U.S. Pacific Fleet revealed that the guided-missile
cruiser USS Cowpens, while shadowing China\'s new aircraft carrier on a
routine mission in international seas, was forced to take evasive action
when [a PLA Navy warship attached to the carrier group approached on a
collision course, literally forcing the cruiser into a game of
chicken]{.underline}. \"The Chinese knew what they were doing,\" a
military official told CNN. Beyond the sea, [the United States must
demonstrate a willingness to push back militarily when China attempts to
coerce America\'s allies and partners]{.underline}. To do this, the U.S.
military needs capabilities and plans that not only prepare it for major
war, but that also offer plausible, concrete options for responding to
Chinese attempts to exploit America\'s perceived aversion to
instability. Leaders throughout Asia will be watching. [Too much
caution]{.underline}, especially if China is clearly the initiator, [may
be read as U.S. weakness]{.underline}, [thereby perpetuating rather than
diminishing China\'s incentives toward adventurism]{.underline}. The
United States can further raise the stakes by deepening its military
ties with Japan. This year, the two countries will rewrite the
guidelines that govern the roles and responsibilities of their
partnership. The result could be major steps forward in joint military
planning and interoperability. Washington can also play a key role in
mending fences between Tokyo and Seoul, renewing trilateral cooperation
to address the many interests \-- and common threats \-- that the three
countries share. Beyond America\'s traditional alliances in Northeast
Asia, the [Obama]{.underline} administration [must demonstrate a
concrete, long-lasting commitment to Australia, the Philippines, and
Singapore in order to provide the United States with a more diversified
set of partners and forward-operating locations in Asia, as well as
broader political legitimacy. Beijing\'s planners worry about America\'s
burgeoning military alliances and partnerships in Asia]{.underline}.
Good. [That means they\'ll be more reluctant to start a fight if doing
so means China could end up facing a multitude of the region\'s
powerhouses.]{.underline} The point, of course, is not to increase the
likelihood of conflict between the United States and China. Rather, the
goal is to cultivate real, long-term stability in Asia that doesn\'t
give China a license to push, prod, and bully. Critics might assert that
taking these steps will invite precisely the kind of Cold War-like
competition that will make conflict, if not outright war, most likely.
This is a real possibility, and U.S. policymakers will have to carefully
balance deterrence with engagement. But those who are reluctant to push
back need to ask themselves whether China\'s top leaders currently see a
sufficient downside in acting assertively. Clearly, they do not.

extent we are already witnessing these innovations on the battlefield in
Ukraine and elsewhere.¶ [Several types of AI applications]{.underline}
such as autonomous drones, electronic warfare systems, target
recognition, and the use of AI for logistics and transport
[have]{.underline} already [made their way into modern
militaries]{.underline}. **[However, unregulated research AI
applications could jeopardize meaningful human control and oversight of
the battlefield.]{.underline}** [AI applications have not]{.underline}
yet [fully]{.underline} [matured and could have a number of ethical,
moral, and legal consequences]{.underline} that necessitate greater
oversight. To address these issues, measures have been taken by the
United States, NATO, and China to implement ethical processes and
guidelines in the conduct and deployment of AI technologies.¶ In 2020,
the Pentagon adopted five ethical principles for AI that cover
responsibility, equitability, traceability, reliability, and
governability. These series of ethical principles are for the deployment
of AI for both combat and non-combat functions. Additionally, these
principles assist and guide the U.S. military in upholding ethical,
legal, and policy commitments in the domain of AI. These AI principles
aim to ensure U.S. leadership in AI for years to come.¶ In 2021, NATO
released six principles for the use of AI in defense and security that
are based on lawfulness, accountability, traceability, reliability,
governability, and bias mitigation. These principles are aimed at
aligning common values and an international commitment of allied nations
to abide by international law and ensure interoperability. The formal
adoption of an AI strategy will ensure the necessary collaboration
between transatlantic allies to meet defense and security challenges. As
NATO has been at an early stage of the research and development of AI,
the focus appears to be on the desire to nurture an innovative AI
ecosystem and reduce reliance on traditional capacity development
mechanisms.¶ While China has not formally published ethics for
artificial intelligence, it has published its first position paper on
regulating military applications of artificial intelligence. It calls
for the establishment of an "effective control regime" for "military
applications of AI," and that countries should follow the principle of
"AI for good." It asserts that AI applications should be under "relevant
human control." However, the definition of "relevant human control"
remains vague. For the governance of artificial intelligence, it
stresses international cooperation and the development of a broader
consensus on the formulation of a "universal international regime."¶ The
above governance principles of the U.S., NATO, and China address
different priorities. U.S. and NATO principles have been developed for
cooperation among allies while strengthening international
competitiveness. Whereas China primarily focuses on the development of
artificial intelligence for assisting developing countries in
strengthening their governance.¶ It has been acknowledged that [China
has bypassed the U.S. in AI development]{.underline}. [This could inform
why the focus of the U.S. and NATO has been on enhancing their
competitive capabilitie]{.underline}s. In theory, [all three have
emphasized adopting governance principles for the development and use of
artificial intelligence, however**, the practical manifestation of these
principles has yet to be seen.¶** The practical implementation of global
regulation of AI military applications has been lagging.]{.underline}
[Even states with advanced research and development in AI defense
applications are in the early phase of regulation and have not reached
their full maturity]{.underline}. Therefore, [the present is an ideal
time to develop mutually agreed principles to facilitate programmers,
developers, coders as well as manufacturers,]{.underline} and so on [in
their adoption]{.underline}. The move towards practical adoption could
start with multistakeholder discussions, workshops, conferences, and
research between technologically advanced countries and technologically
progressing countries with the aim [to develop an agreeable framework on
principles of AI governance.]{.underline}

### 2AC NATO Leadership 🡪 Democracy 

#### incorporation in multinational frameworks like NATO are key to ensure democratic values

Along with being an unnecessary tragedy in every conceivable dimension,
[the war in Ukraine is a historic critical juncture. Countries aligned
against Russia and other actors seeking to degrade international
norms,]{.underline} [should work togethe]{.underline}r immediately to
plan for three things. The first step is [to commit to understanding the
new threat and its boundaries.]{.underline} The European Union, [NATO,
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [and other nations have the
opportunity to provide global leadership in this space as democracies
across the world seek to understand the threats they face.]{.underline}
A second step is to develop [the framework for]{.underline} a new
generation of [strategic cooperation,]{.underline} perhaps in an
expanded European Union or NATO. This [could be as simple as discussing
defense budgets or as robust as having a planning session for joint
exercises.]{.underline} A third, longer-term step to solidify these
gains and to strengthen enduring ties is to [develop enhanced industrial
cooperation with partners and allies]{.underline}, especially in Europe.
[Sweden and Finland are reportedly considering whether to join NATO.
Germany reacted to the invasion with a quick and decisive rethink about
its defense spending]{.underline}, rearmament, and contributions to
NATO. [These represent significant opportunities to strengthen
cooperative industrial ties.]{.underline} Lessons from examples of other
successful [multinational cooperation frameworks can be used
to]{.underline} consider what mix of approaches would best [consolidate
this momentous shift.]{.underline} [Options include identifying a suite
of multinational projects to counter urgent threats,]{.underline}
[expanding the role of existing multilateral industrial cooperation
institutions]{.underline}, or expanding the National Technology
Industrial Base (an arrangement in which United States works with some
of its closest industrial partners, namely Canada, the United Kingdom
and Australia). A review of what commercial technologies Germany excels
at that could be added to U.S. and allied weapon systems could offer
quick hits both in terms of excellent capabilities and a clear focus for
German defense investment. [Defense industrial and technological
cooperation grounded in common values is not just an alternative model
to coercive spheres of influence but is also critical to translating
solidarity in sentiment to capabilities]{.underline} and the potential
for action. [These actions would signal to Russia]{.underline} (and by
inference to other potential adversaries) [that the West can stand up to
its threats, and that it should think twice]{.underline}, or three
times, [before pressing its territorial claims. It could also signal to
other potential adversaries that allied nations will work together to
protect themselves]{.underline} and hopefully [to ensure peace and
prosperity]{.underline}. They are watching.

Responsible AI Governance in Military Affairs" The Oxford Handbook of AI
Governance DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780197579329.013.69

[NATO's increasing interest in EDTs introduces the need to consider how
governance priorities can help reinforce the Alliance's
influence]{.underline}. The STS and military innovation literature
provide the theoretical foundations for [NATO's stewardship of
AI]{.underline} as they [place attention on "the role that institutions
play in shaping technological trajectories.]{.underline}"45 [As AI
development continues, the actions that NATO and its members take will
have important implications]{.underline} for their capacity to adopt,
respond to, and shape their future operating environment. [Particularly
for democracies, this confers to military stakeholders a dual
responsibility to prevent and manage risks, as well as to proactively
shape their approach to tech]{.underline}nological [development anchored
in democratic values and security.]{.underline} **[As a multinational
alliance with an incentive to drive cooperation and alignment, NATO is
situated to define and operationalize norms]{.underline}**, [as well as
promote standards that help shape the contours of future military
effectiveness and technological competition.¶]{.underline} In a RRI
framework, not only is this an institutional role, but it also becomes
an institutional responsibility. To apply this responsibility to NATO's
stewardship of AI, the institutional interplay between technology,
structure, and concepts is a form of socio-technical system with
important implications for AI governance because they link the ways that
an institution uses its power to adopt and shape AI trajectory to its
respective ends.¶ Already, [several mechanisms are built into military
bureaucracies to ensure that technology is adopted in alignment with
responsible engineering practices]{.underline} and responsible state
behavior.46 [The Alliance is organized to harmonize between Allies so
that their contributions enhance military effectiveness and political
cohesion]{.underline} [between like-minded democracies]{.underline}. We
argue that [these effectiveness-centric mechanisms]{.underline} likewise
[empower NATO to exert its influence in technology
governance.]{.underline} More specifically, [this entails the Alliance
helping steward technological development for a more predictable
strategic environment and enhanced democratic clout around the
exploitation of technology reinforcing rule of law]{.underline}. For
NATO, we focus on strategic and policy planning, as well as standards
and certification because they reflect the Alliance's particular
strengths and interests in S&T. These practices are relevant to
governance insofar as they exemplify an institution's power to shape the
trajectory of technological development---but this selection is by no
means exhaustive.47¶ Instead, our aim is to explore how these mechanisms
are operationalized at the Alliance level. In this vein, Table 69.1
dissects the role that its various bodies play in managing technology,
promulgating and operationalizing standards, and leading change through
policy. The role of NATO in this equation is largely shaped by its
members' own approaches to technology, and member-state-driven processes
are complemented by "policy entrepreneurs" and technical experts in the
International Staff and related bodies.48 Table 69.1 does not list the
ways that AI affects the various functions of NATO, but rather
spotlights the entities that together operationalize AI governance
through cumulative processes on policy and standardization.¶ Strategic
and policy planning¶ NATO structures around strategic and policy
planning both set Allied ambitions and priorities and have the
competency to implement them through its many consultative bodies,
coordination formats, and albeit to a lesser extent, technology
foresight capacities. NATO has facilitative power among Allies, both for
defense planning and for the conduct of operations. A cornerstone in
modern architecture of international security is coalition warfare---or,
more broadly, joint operations. Working with military partners has
become a critical feature of modern security policy, where there is more
power in enhancing numbers, but also in having allies that lend
political and practical legitimacy to deterrence and operations.49 NATO
is vital to that effort for many reasons, but also because NATO's
facilitative power is significant to promote coordination and
cooperation. Simply put, partners and allies are a necessary feature of
modern military behavior, and strategic and policy planning are
necessary functions to encourage and underpin cohesion in alliance
settings. This is important for AI governance because the nature of AI
poses new strategic challenges and will require multilateral approaches
and some degree of cohesion to effectively incorporate RRI frameworks in
policy planning. As such, the necessity of working with security
partners extends to the AI-policy frontier.¶ A number of NATO entities
carry out strategic and policy planning, recognizing the importance of
policy alignment to sustain political strength and military
effectiveness. As relates to S&T, allies' representations to NATO,
defense ministries, and policy entrepreneurs from the relevant entities
summarized in Table 69.1 support and negotiate how the Alliance
approaches EDTs. NATO's strategic documentation and forward-looking
policy analysis incorporates hints of technological determinism,
including noting how technological change inevitably shapes the future
strategic and operating environment. Further, the connections between
technology and competitive advantage over adversaries and competitors
are embodied in the Alliance's desire to maintain its "technological
edge" as the "foundation upon which NATO's ability to deter and defend
against potential threats ultimately rests."50 This places technology
squarely within NATO's core purpose of deterrence and defense---and
while this signals NATO's express commitment to technology through these
channels, this reliance on technology also obscures whether NATO's
governance capacity will be adaptive, anticipatory, or participatory.
This position of technological determinism may result in more
limitations for AI governance.¶ Standards and certification¶ [To
maintain its relevanc]{.underline}e in a security architecture
increasingly concerned with the way that technology shifts power
dynamics and scales threats to international security, [NATO has an
incentive to foster cooperation, promote standards of practice, and
incentivize Allied AI harmonization. It is strategically salient to
facilitate a dialogue and engagement among Allies on AI,]{.underline}
but it is practically important to use NATO's position to facilitate
Allied cooperation regarding standards to project the Alliance's ability
to interoperate in future operations. [NATO standards aim to enhance
interoperability among partners and successful implementation of
strategy.]{.underline}¶ More specifically, [standards and certification
are used to establish and implement requirements aligned with safe
development and responsible use of technology]{.underline}. In addition
to purely technical standards, NATO has operational standards that
specify "conceptual, organizational or methodological requirements to
enable materiel, installations, organizations or forces to fulfil their
functions or missions."51 In line with the definitions from STS and
military innovation scholarship, standards can thus be seen as a
mechanism to translate responsibility-derived state and organizational
AI policy into actionable functions. In fact, NATO has set certain
standards for the Allies and these standards subsequently become the
norm.¶ Within NATO, it is the NATO Standardization Office (NSO) that
coordinates thousands of experts to align technological development with
military requirements that can help enhance effectiveness,
interoperability, and cohesion.52 While the NSO is primarily responsible
for setting standards, other NATO entities---including in the NATO
Science and Technology Organization (STO)---play important roles in
implementing them and coordinating between national approaches.53
Certification frameworks and the promulgation of best practices can
similarly help incentivize the transposition of RRI into military
organizations, even if standardization is by no means a purely military
governance tool.

### NATO Key to Democratic Development

#### NATO is key to establishing ethical foundations for AI 

**Merwe 2021** - Fellow at the Defense Tech Initiativ

Joanna van der Merwe February 17, 2021 "NATO Leadership on Ethical AI is
Key to Future Interoperability"
https://cepa.org/nato-leadership-on-ethical-ai-is-key-to-future-interoperability/

[Establishing NATO ethical AI principles is the first step toward both
technical and political alignment.¶]{.underline} In October 2020, Deputy
Secretary General of NATO Mircea Geoană highlighted the benefits of
establishing a "transatlantic community cooperating on Artificial
Intelligence (AI)." The Deputy Head of NATO's Innovation Unit followed
with a commitment to its responsible use. [The US]{.underline}
Department of Defense ([DoD]{.underline}) adopted Ethical Principles for
AI in 2020 and [has committed to bringing together NATO member and
partners to operationalize these principles]{.underline}. [**Despite
these statements and developments, more work is required** to tackle
the]{.underline} very real [challenge that ethical AI will pose to
future interoperability within NATO.¶]{.underline} [Without a NATO-led
initiative focused on aligning these ethical principles across the
Alliance, the interoperability risk of nations fielding AI-based systems
that hinder joint operations is high]{.underline}. [As the foremost
security framework for Europe and North America]{.underline}, as well as
the leading defense alliance for promoting and protecting democratic
values, **[NATO is able to facilitate alignment on this
issue.]{.underline}** As part of a broader strategy on emerging and
disruptive technologies, NATO must prioritize ethical AI if it wishes to
promote the shared values upon which it was founded, play a key role in
facilitating innovation across the Atlantic, and ultimately retain the
ability of its members to undertake joint operations.¶ [Establishing
NATO ethical AI principles is the first step toward both technical and
political alignment,]{.underline} in turn [enhancing and fostering
interoperability, which is the foundation for NATO to respond to
emerging threats as an Alliance]{.underline}, in a flexible and timely
manner.¶ [A key challenge for NATO is raising awareness that the answers
to ethical questions can no longer be left to later stages of the
development and procurement cycle]{.underline}. Decisions made at the
political and legal level will have a significant impact on the
engineering practices used to develop AI, as well as the technical
characteristics of the AI-based systems. The answers to questions such
as respecting human dignity, human control, and accountability will be
the foundation upon which many technical elements are programed. Systems
developers need to make a number of calls throughout the development
cycle informed by the answers to key questions, including:¶ how to label
data¶ what data to use, and¶ what is an acceptable outcome?¶ These
answers will also impact how AI systems are evaluated and ultimately
deployed.¶ [If individual nations]{.underline} or groups [are left to
develop their own ethical principles without wider]{.underline}
[alignment to NATO]{.underline}, [the result will be a number of
AI-based systems with varying technical specification]{.underline}s
based on the legal and policy decisions made by individual governments
when answering the key questions. [As has been demonstrated in areas
such as facial recognition]{.underline} and policing algorithms, [the
assumptions made by those developing the tools]{.underline} and
answering the key questions [have a significant impact on
the]{.underline} real-world [function]{.underline}ing [of the
tool]{.underline} and societal acceptance of its ethics. **[The risk of
tools failing to gain acceptance depends on the legal and ethical
decisions made by governments.]{.underline}** **[For the
military,]{.underline}** this may mean one state using an AI-based
system that is seen as unacceptable by another, and in a joint operation
one state fielding a system that cannot be used by another. Or worse
yet, **[this could render a joint operation impossible.]{.underline}**
[Without the ability to interoperate across NATO, the inability to
effectively and efficiently respond to future threats would undermine
the Alliance]{.underline}.¶ [The]{.underline} role of the [private
sector]{.underline} is another aspect of ethical AI development that
[has proved a challenge to governments and the transatlantic
relationship.]{.underline} Within states, governments have struggled to
adequately regulate Big Tech firms, which has led to these companies
encroaching on government responsibilities to protect and uphold the
public interest. This encroachment permeates all aspects of government,
including defense and security. As Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen
Hicks discussed during her confirmation hearings, the lack of
competition is also a challenge to innovation in the private defense
industry. [This, along with a lack of regulation, feeds into the power
imbalance between the sectors]{.underline}. Consequently, [private
sector companies building the AI and AI systems that are or will be
deployed on the battlefield are deciding the ethics policies for
themselves.¶]{.underline} [The transatlantic partnership must focus on
coordinating these core principles]{.underline} and systematic
governance [to ensure AI systems development aligns with the rule of law
and democracy]{.underline}. In particular, this must ensure answering
questions about human dignity, human control, and accountability. [NATO
is the ideal defense and security forum for this alignment]{.underline}.
[Given the US lead on adopting ethical principles for the entire DoD and
the EU's drive to assert checks and balances]{.underline} for
private-sector tech companies, **[NATO remains the organization that can
bring these two together and establishes the ethical bottom
line.]{.underline}** These will then ensure the diverging legal and
ethical stances towards Big Tech do not lead to an interoperability
barrier in the future. If developments surrounding the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the challenges it brought for
U.S.-based, data-driven companies are any indication, [a strong
transatlantic led initiative is needed in order to ensure the same
challenges do not hinder NATO.]{.underline}¶ [The solution to the
challenge that ethical AI poses for the future of interoperability
within NATO is for the Alliance to establish shared transatlantic
ethical principles, informed by the US DoD]{.underline}, the EU, and
others. [Establishing these principles]{.underline} will not only
strengthen transatlantic political relations; more technically, it [will
allow for the establishment of standardization agreements and inform
training and education initiatives of the Alliance in the
future.]{.underline}

[The United States has long benefited from its network of allies and
partners that contribute forces, specialized capabilities, and
legitimacy to U.S. leadership in the world]{.underline}. [In recent
years, however, this network has come under strain]{.underline}.
Disputes over burden sharing and mutual recriminations have raised
questions about the cohesion and durability of existing alliance
structures. Recent U.S. policy shifts and withdrawal from certain
international agreements have deepened fears that the United States no
longer sees its allies and partners as central to U.S. strategic
objectives and national security.

[America's alliances are weakening at a time of growing competition
between democratic nations and authoritarian regimes]{.underline}.
[Authoritarian regimes are surviving longer and becoming more adept at
using AI-enabled surveillance and censorship technologies to export
their values abroad.5]{.underline} **[China and Russia present a
significant challenge to liberal democratic societies]{.underline}**.6
**[A world in which China and Russia deploy AI to widen the net of
information controls is a world of diminished rights and protections for
the individual, fewer safeguards for privacy and the rule of law, more
data exploitation, and limited opportunities for judicial redress or
public dissent]{.underline}**.7

**[Despite the importance of alliances in promoting democratic values
and protecting against a mounting authoritarian challenge, the United
States lacks a strategic approach for cooperating with allies and other
like-minded partners on AI]{.underline}**.

**[The next decade will be a decisive time for the US to shape its
future role in the world]{.underline}**. [Democracies are being tested
and toyed with by malign powers,]{.underline} as seen in the form of
Russian interference in the 2016 US Presidential elections and
subsequent disinformation campaigns by other nations. [Great power
politics and the national security implications of]{.underline} emerging
technologies, such as [AI, are breaking up supply chains and further
fragmenting the internet. We're witnessing shocks to the liberal
economic order and global governance as a result of several economic
crises and the aftermath of the biggest public health crisis in a
century]{.underline}. [Societies across the world will be looking to
develop and implement new technology to deal with crises and recover
from economic losses faster.]{.underline} The rise of revisionist powers
and the transformative potential of emerging technologies means that the
US and its European allies need to prioritize investing in capabilities
and its relationships to ensure that emerging technologies align with
liberal, democratic values. [While the US currently maintains a slight
edge in research and development of AI capabilities, that advantage is
eroding as a result of a shortage of AI talent, lack of engagement
between the federal government, academia, and the private sector, and
overall gaps in federal government funding.]{.underline} [US innovation
has its roots in an open and multicultural society. American leadership
in innovation is the result of decades of attracting, training, and
recruiting the brightest minds in the world]{.underline}. While
recognizing that there are some national security risks, efforts to cut
off the flow of students will be detrimental to long-term US innovative
capabilities. [The European Union while maintaining its role as a leader
in AI ethical guidelines, also faces challenges stemming from a lack of
talent as well as insufficient funding and uncoordinated AI expertise
and application across the Member States]{.underline}. Moreover, the EU
suffers from other institutional challenges that are most glaringly
demonstrated by the UK's vote to leave the EU in 2016---which
unbeknownst at the time dealt a major blow to the EU's AI ecosystem.
[The US and EU need to enhance cooperation in the development and
application of AI]{.underline} in healthcare, environmental science, and
defense. [When the US and EU work together on global challenges such as
healthcare and environment science, the rest of the world benefits. And
there are other key geopolitical challenges that the US and EU face that
can only be balanced together]{.underline}. We are delighted to share
with you this analysis of the AI landscape between the US and EU,
written and researched by our students working with the Cyber Project
and China Cyber Policy Initiative, Christie Lawrence and Sean Cordey. We
feel this report provides a strong evidence base for further
collaboration, and puts forth thoughtful recommendations. [**The
importance of the transatlantic relationship cannot be understated.**
The world needs strong leadership in these uncertain times and the US
and EU bring unique strengths to the table that collaboratively can
strengthen the other's advantage in the face of unprecedented
technological and geopolitical challenges. The US and the EU need to
work together.]{.underline}

[The United States has a vested interest in setting the rules of the
road for artificial intelligence.]{.underline} **[Western countries have
already taken the lead in developing principles governing the
application of artificial intelligence.]{.underline}** [China has
produced its own set of principles and engages actively in international
bodies,]{.underline} such as the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), [to establish
standards for mobile network technologies and the future governance of
AI]{.underline}.

[By assuming leadership in AI, the United States and its allies face
risks and opportunities]{.underline}. The [risks are
twofold]{.underline}. On the [one]{.underline} hand, [standard setting
could become a casualty of geopolitical competition as leading countries
precipitate a race to the bottom]{.underline}. **[On the other hand,
China already asserts its principles and standards through a variety of
multilateral fora]{.underline}**. [The opportunity is that the United
States and its allies can act now to set global standards for AI
reflecting and supporting human rights and liberal democratic
values,]{.underline} while addressing critical questions surrounding the
rollout of 5G, facial recognition for surveillance, automated cyber
exploitation and defense, and autonomous weapons systems. A Japanese
official responding to the CSET survey noted that the United States and
its allies should adopt a citizen-centric AI strategy. Such
citizen-centric strategies would seek to develop and deploy AI for the
benefit of democratic societies, including strengthened data privacy
standards and respect for civil liberties; economic empowerment of
citizens within rules-based market economies; greater access to
education, precision medicine, energy efficiency, and more inclusive
social service provision.

**[The United States should lead a multilateral effort with allies and
partners to set international rules of conduct for AI]{.underline}**.
[This]{.underline} effort [should build on and extend]{.underline} the
OECD Principles on AI and the International Organization for
Standardization working group [initiatives on standards for data and AI
safety and security. The United States and its allies could establish a
standing platform to coordinate policies on standard-setting in
multilateral fora]{.underline}. **[This is likely an area for productive
dialogue, as partners are eager to coordinate policies and share best
practices around norms and standards.]{.underline}** In fact, **[all
surveyed officials were extremely or very interested in this avenue for
international collaboration]{.underline}**.

[Longer term, the United States and its allies should explore the
conditions for a common AI market, including standards for testing,
verification, and validation of AI technologies, as well as common
practices for certifying companies that support liberal democratic
values and privacy]{.underline}.87 **[This common market would create
incentives for other countries to abide by these principles in the
development and deployment of safe and reliable AI]{.underline}**. As
one EU representative observed, **[if the West could offer a viable way
of doing AI that respects privacy and fundamental rights, developing
(and democratic) countries would be more inclined to follow the Western
model]{.underline}**.

Relations

Ulrike Esther Franke January 2021 "Artificial Divide: How Europe And
America Could Clash Over Ai" European Council on Foreign Relations
https://ecfr.eu/publication/artificial-divide-how-europe-and-america-could-clash-over-ai/

A glance at the history of artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline})
shows that the field [periodically goes through phases of development
racing ahead and slowing down]{.underline} -- [often dubbed "AI springs"
and "AI winters]{.underline}". **[The world is currently several years
into an AI spring, dominated by important advances in machinelearning
technologies.]{.underline}** In Europe, policymakers' efforts to grapple
with the rapid pace of technological development have gone through
several phases over the last five to ten years. [The first phase was
marked by uncertainty among policymakers over what to make of the rapid
and seemingly groundbreaking developments in AI]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} phase [lasted until]{.underline} around
[2018]{.underline} -- [though, in some European states, and on some
issues, uncertainty remains]{.underline}. [The second phase consisted of
efforts to frame and AI challenges politically, and to address them, on
a domestic level: between 2018 and 2020]{.underline}, no fewer than [21
EU member states published national AI strategies designed to delineate
their views and aims, and, in some cases, to outline investment
plans]{.underline}.

**[The next phase could be a period of international]{.underline}**, and
specifically [**transatlantic, cooperation on AI**. After several years
of European states working at full capacity to understand how to support
domestic AI research, including by assembling expert teams to deliberate
new laws and regulations]{.underline}, **[there is growing interest
among policymakers and experts in looking beyond Europe.]{.underline}**
[On the EU level, AI policy and governance have already received
significant attention,]{.underline} with the European Commission playing
an important role in incentivising member states to develop AI
strategies, such as by starting to tackle issues around how to make sure
AI is "ethical" and "trustworthy". But **[recent months have seen a rise
in the number of calls for international cooperation on AI driven by
liberal democracies across the world]{.underline}**. [Western countries
and their allies have set up new forums for cooperation on how to take
AI forward, and are activating existing forums. More such organisations
and platforms for cooperation are planned.]{.underline}

[Calls for cooperation between the **U**nited **S**tates and Europe have
become particularly regular and resonant]{.underline}: following last
year's US presidential election, it was reported that the European
Commission planned to propose [a "**T**ransatlantic **T**rade and
Technology **C**ouncil]{.underline}", [which would set joint standards
on new technologies]{.underline}. [And, in September 2020, the US set up
a group of like-minded countries "to provide values-based global
leadership in defense for policies and approaches in adopting AI", which
included seven European states, in addition to countries such as
Australia, Canada, and South Korea. In June 2020, the Global Partnership
on Artificial Intelligence was founded to consider the responsible
development of AI; it counts among its members the US, four European

[This paper examines the reasons]{.underline} **[European
states]{.underline}** may **[want to work with the US on AI,
and]{.underline}** [why the US may want to reach out to Europe on the
issue]{.underline}. It also identifies the points of disagreement that
may stop the allies from fully fleshing out transatlantic AI
cooperation. The paper shows that, [while both sides are interested in
working together, their rationales for doing so differ]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [economic and political factors may stand in the way of
cooperation, even though such cooperation could have a positive impact
on the way AI develops.]{.underline} The paper also argues that
**[transatlantic cooperation in the area of military AI could be a good
first step]{.underline}** -- **[here, Europe and the US should build on
existing collaboration within NATO.]{.underline}** The paper concludes
with a brief discussion of the different forums that have been created
or proposed for transatlantic and broader Western cooperation on AI.

A prolonged [global democratic recession has]{.underline}, in recent
years, [morphed into something even more troubling: the "third reverse
wave" of democratic breakdowns]{.underline} that the political scientist
Samuel Huntington warned could follow the remarkable burst of "third
wave" democratic progress in the 1980s and the 1990s. [Every year for
the past 15 years]{.underline}, according to Freedom House,
[significantly more countries have seen declines in political rights and
civil liberties than have seen gains]{.underline}. [But since 2015, that
already ominous trend has turned sharply worse: 2015--19 was the first
five-year period since the beginning of the third wave in 1974 when more
countries abandoned democracy---twelve---than transitioned to
it---seven]{.underline}.

And [the trend continues]{.underline}. [Illiberal populist leaders are
degrading democracy]{.underline} in countries including Brazil, India,
Mexico, and Poland, and creeping authoritarianism has already moved
Hungary, the Philippines, Turkey, and Venezuela out of the category of
democracies altogether. In Georgia, the dominance of the Georgian Dream
Party has led to the steady decline of electoral processes and a
breakdown in the rule of law. In Myanmar, the military overthrew the
elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, ending an experiment in partial
democracy. In El Salvador, president Nayib Bukele staged an executive
coup by removing the attorney general and Supreme Court justices who
were obstacles to his consolidation of power. In Peru, democracy hangs
from a thread as the right-wing autocrat Keiko Fujimori advances vague
claims of election fraud in a bid to overturn her narrow electoral
defeat to left-wing opponent Pedro Castillo.

What is especially striking about this last case is that [Fujimori's
gambit bears a grim resemblance to the lie perpetuated by]{.underline}
former U.S. President Donald [Trump and his followers]{.underline} about
the 2020 presidential election. [This is no coincidence.]{.underline} As
the journalist and historian Anne Applebaum has observed, [fictitious
claims of fraud and "stop the steal" tactics are becoming a common means
by which autocratic populists try to obstruct democracy]{.underline}.
[Such tactics have long been a source of instability in countries
struggling to develop democracy]{.underline}. **[But the fact that the
most recent iteration of the antidemocrat's playbook draws heavily on
precedents in the world's most important and powerful democracy marks
the start of a dangerous new era]{.underline}**.

Today, [the United States confronts a growing antidemocratic
movement]{.underline}, [not just from the ranks of fringe extremists but
also from a substantial group of officeholders---a movement that is
challenging the very foundations of electoral democracy]{.underline}.
[Should this effort succeed, the United States could become the first
ever advanced industrial democracy to fail---that is, to no longer meet
the minimum conditions for free and fair elections as political
scientists and other scholars of democracy define them]{.underline}.

**[The failure of American democracy would be catastrophic not only for
the United States; it would also have profound global consequences at a
time when freedom and democracy are already under siege.]{.underline}**
As Huntington noted, **[the diffusion of democratic movements and ideas
from one country to another has helped drive positive democratic
change]{.underline}**. [Antidemocratic norms and practices can spread in
a similar fashion---especially when they emanate from powerful
countries.]{.underline} [That is why the acceleration of a democratic
recession into a democratic depression happened largely on Trump's
watch]{.underline}. **[And it is why no development would more gravely
damage the global democratic cause than the democratic backsliding of
its most important champion]{.underline}**.

THE DEMOCRATIC TRIAD

A [democratic]{.underline} system of [government stands on three
legs]{.underline}. The [first]{.underline} leg [is popular
sovereignty]{.underline}---[rule by the people]{.underline}. Democracy
demands that people are able to choose and replace their leaders in
regular, free, and fair elections; that all adult citizens are able to
vote free from intimidation and obstruction; and that candidates and
parties are free to compete and campaign. Crucially, elections must be
administered impartially, so that valid ballots are counted accurately
and power is granted to those who win.

[Liberty is]{.underline} the [second]{.underline} leg of liberal
democracy. [A fully democratic system provides strong protections
for]{.underline} **[freedom of]{.underline}** speech, the press,
**[association]{.underline}**, and assembly. [It ensures that these
rights are **equally protected** for all social groups]{.underline}.
[And it promotes a culture of mutual tolerance and respect for the
rights of political opponents]{.underline}.

The [third]{.underline} leg---[the rule of law]{.underline}---defends
and strengthens the other two. It [ensures]{.underline} that
**[democratic procedures are impartially enforced]{.underline}** by an
independent judiciary and other regulatory bodies that check the abuse
of power. In most advanced democracies, excluding the United States,
these instruments of accountability include national bodies to
administer elections and to monitor corruption.

Trump was the first U.S. president to demonstrate contempt for all three
legs of the triad of liberal democracy. He attacked the media as "fake
news" and "absolute scum" and called for his election opponent to be
"locked up." He invited his followers to commit acts of violence against
protesting opponents. Upon his defeat, he insisted that the election
results were fraudulent and had to be overturned. Throughout his
presidency, he waged war on an independent judiciary, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, his own attorney general, the Office of Government
Ethics, the civil service, and a host of other actors who refused to
bend to his political will or sought to enforce the rule of law.

**[The United States' outsize importance will influence struggling
democracies and embattled autocracies alike]{.underline}**.

Many scholars of democracy perceived an unprecedented threat to U.S.
democracy when Trump entered office in 2017 and feared grave assaults on
the second and third legs of the democratic triad, in particular. This
assessment was partially correct. Not since President Richard Nixon and
[rarely in U.S. history has there been such a determined effort to
misuse and subvert administrative and rule-of-law institutions for
nakedly political ends]{.underline}---[but these attempts achieved only
limited effect. The bulk of the press and the judiciary remained
independent]{.underline}. The FBI avoided political capture. Outside the
Republican Party and Trump's own administration, freedom of speech
thrived. From 2017 [through 2020, liberty and the rule of law more or
less held.]{.underline}

[In three respects, however, most scholars misjudged the nature of the
peril---and underestimated its gravity]{.underline}. First, [many
assumed that Trump himself constituted the biggest threat to U.S.
democracy and that his defeat would lance the poisonous boil on the body
politic. Second, with notable exceptions]{.underline}, including the
Yale historian Timothy Snyder and the Carnegie Endowment scholar Rachel
Kleinfeld, [many underestimated the potential for violence]{.underline}
on the part of Trump's true-believing followers. [And third, most
underestimated the extent to which Trump would remake the Republican
Party as an institution not only slavishly loyal to him but also hostile
to democracy]{.underline}.

[Fortunately]{.underline}, leading up to the 2020 election, democracy
scholars and **[civic organizations]{.underline}** [correctly
anticipated the threats to electoral integrity posed by zealous Trump
partisans, as well as the staggering logistical challenges presented by
the pandemic]{.underline}. [As a result, they launched one of the most
energetic civic campaigns in U.S. history to register an unprecedented
number of voters, to give them safe and early access to the ballot, to
ensure that local electoral administrations had the resources necessary
to administer the vote, and to prepare to combat any potential efforts
to overturn the legitimate results of the presidential
election.]{.underline} The election was not a nightmare scenario, as
some had feared. In fact, it proved to be one of the best-administered
elections in U.S. history, leading election experts Nathaniel Persily
and Charles Stewart III to call it a "miracle."

IT COULD STILL HAPPEN HERE

Yet what followed was, in the words of Persily and Stewart, a "tragedy,"
with "lies about vote fraud and the performance of the system
\[cementing\] a perception among tens of millions of Americans that the
election was 'rigged.'" Such "manufactured distrust" has extended past
the January 6 insurrection in Washington. Although President Joe Biden's
inauguration has deescalated imminent threats to civil liberties and the
rule of law, the core element of electoral democracy---free and fair
elections---is now under relentless partisan assault. Republican state
legislatures are accelerating efforts to make it more difficult for
African Americans, Latinos, and other Democratic-leaning constituencies
to vote by passing laws that make it more difficult to vote by mail and
to vote early, and that make it easier to purge voters from voting
rolls. These changes are driven not by documented evidence of
malfeasance associated with these practices but by deliberately false
narratives about election fraud.

Now, the greatest threat to American democracy is posed by legislative
initiatives seeking to subvert the independence of electoral
administration, including the counting and certification of the vote. As
the election law expert Richard Hasen has observed, "At stake is
something I never expected to worry about in the United States: the
integrity of the vote count." A recent law passed in Georgia, for
example, removes the secretary of state (currently Brad Raffensperger,
who refused to manufacture the 11,780 votes Trump needed to win the
state) as chair of the state Election Board and gives the state
legislature---a highly partisan institution---the ability to name the
new chair. Representatives in Michigan have politicized the Board of
State Canvassers, which certifies election results, by replacing a
Republican who voted to certify Biden's election victory with a movement
conservative. In Michigan and in Nevada, Trump loyalists are seeking to
consolidate control over election supervision by running candidates for
secretary of state---giving them the authority to preside over election
administration and the tools to try to block Democratic votes. And at
the federal level, Republicans could take back control of the House of
Representatives (helped by their unilateral ability to redraw 187
congressional districts following the most recent census) and use their
majority to manipulate the 2024 presidential results in their
favor---especially if the 2024 election resembles 2020, when Democrats
won a decisive popular vote victory but relied on narrow margins in a
handful of states for an Electoral College majority.

Once a political system loses bipartisan consensus respecting the rules
of the democratic game, it can be a short slide to autocracy. The world
has watched this happen in Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela. It is not
inconceivable that it could happen in the United States.

THE GATHERING STORM

To warn of the failure of American democracy is not hyperbole or simply
a slogan meant to motivate action. Political scientists may differ on
the minimum conditions for democracy, but they agree on this: a country
cannot be considered a democracy if it does not broadly ensure the
neutral and fair administration of elections. If the outcome of a major
national election in the United States were to be determined by
fraudulent exclusion or the manipulation of votes, the country would
cease to be a democracy, no matter how much freedom of expression might
survive (for a time).

More than 100 prominent democracy scholars recently warned in a
collective statement that Republican assaults on electoral integrity
could bring about the demise of U.S. democracy. They appealed to
Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and to adopt other
measures to "ensure the sanctity and independence of election
administration." But with broad national legislation to ban partisan
gerrymandering and strengthen voting standards unlikely in the near
term, it will also be up to civil society to defend American democracy.

[That defense is made more urgent by the gathering storm of democratic
backsliding around the world]{.underline}. [The United States' outsize
importance as a source of political diffusion, for good or ill, makes it
an example that will influence struggling democracies and embattled
autocracies alike]{.underline}. Both in backsliding democracies such as
the Philippines and Poland and in deepening autocracies such as Turkey
and Venezuela, Trump's mantra of "fake news" emboldened strongman
leaders in their assaults on the media. If the United States winds up
disfiguring its democracy by politicizing electoral administration and
suppressing minority votes, autocrats will gleefully seize upon the
American precedent as justification for their methods of blocking
democratic change. And in declining democracies, politically vulnerable
incumbents will embrace similar methods of violating electoral integrity
in order to hang on to power.

In short, **[what happens to democracy in the United States is likely to
determine the fate of democracy around the world: whether this third
wave of democratic reversals is turned back or gains horrific new
momentum]{.underline}**.

### Impact -- Democracy

#### Democracy solves a laundry list of impacts\-\--[economic growth]{.underline}, [public goods]{.underline}, [alliances]{.underline}, and [war]{.underline}\-\--the [US is key]{.underline}.

**Lee 2018** - an assistant professor at the U.S. Air War College and a
Security Fellow with Truman National Security Project

Carrie Lee September 10th; "Why Democracy Promotion is in the Strategic
Interest of the United States";
https://medium.com/truman-doctrine-blog/why-democracy-promotion-is-in-the-strategic-interest-of-the-united-states-ae959c111b2f;

However, [reducing the United States' emphasis on a values-driven
foreign policy is wrong, and contrary to the strategic interests of the
United States]{.underline}. **[Democracy promotion]{.underline}** [in
particular serves a **key role in safeguarding U.S.
interests**]{.underline} [and promoting global, long-term growth in ways
fundamentally compatible with U.S. strategic interests.]{.underline}
After all, **[democracies protect private property]{.underline}** [in
important ways, **invest in public goods**]{.underline}, [are more
politically stable, make for **more dependable allies**]{.underline},
[and empirically **do not go to war with one another**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, a world full of democratic governments is safer, more
prosperous, and more stable --- all states of being that the United
States has an interest in promoting.

[Democracy guarantees that the public has a stake in its own
institutions and government, which leads to **investor confidence and
growth**. Since elected politicians are accountable to property owners
and are held in check by an independent judiciary, democracies tend to
have better mechanisms for **protecting private property**]{.underline}
[than their autocratic counterparts. This makes democracies a
**particularly attractive type of country for investors** --- both
public and private --- because checks and balances make it difficult for
the state to nationalize industries]{.underline}. Further, [private
property rights protected by the legal system **encourage
entrepreneurship and small business development**]{.underline}, [both of
which are **key to a growing and modernizing economy**]{.underline}. As
a result, [democracies tend to be wealthier and more economically stable
than their autocratic counterparts.]{.underline} This is fundamentally
in the interest of the United States in that both private and public
investors have an interest in seeing returns on their investments,
[thereby potentially making **countries less willing to go to war if
that would require severing economic ties**]{.underline}. Democratic
institutions ensure that citizens with both economic and political power
are heard.

[Democracies also **invest in public goods at much higher rates than
autocratic governments**]{.underline}. [Because politicians must cater
to the median voter, they **approve policies that invest in public
education and healthcare**]{.underline}, [both of which promote
long-term growth and development]{.underline}. Public education invests
in a country's human capital, setting the stage for long-term
innovation, adaptability, and advancement. [Public healthcare,
meanwhile, has been shown to **increase overall societal productivity**
and well-being as people take fewer sick days, citizens are able to
afford their healthcare without going bankrupt, and ultimately, the
overall **costs of healthcare are driven down** as citizens become
healthier]{.underline}. Productive, innovative societies are also better
for the United States --- [innovation around the world improves global
quality of life, results in more educational and vocational
opportunities for Americans]{.underline} (both because other
universities and jobs become more attractive to Americans who want to go
abroad and because potential immigrants are more likely to want to stay
in their own country, opening up opportunities for U.S. citizens at
home), [and may reduce friction between countries over resources and
labor]{.underline}.

[Democracies are also generally more politically stable because regular
election cycles ensure an established process for the habitual and
peaceful removal of leaders from power.]{.underline} [Elections ensure
the non-violent transition of power and reduce the need for mass
protest, rioting, and revolution --- which **makes countries more
politically stable**]{.underline}. Further, when citizens are granted
rights and protections from government abuse, enforced by an independent
judiciary, they have fewer grievances against the government and are
thus less able to mobilize large numbers of people to violently
overthrow the regime. [Revolution, while not always violent, often leads
to political instability, challenges to growth, **increased incentives
for diversionary war and conflict**, and oftentimes civil
war]{.underline}. The externalities of civil war and international
conflict then put pressure on the United States to intervene, protect
human rights, and otherwise expend resources on other countries' issues.
[Further, civil wars are highly destructive to institutions, human
capital, and resources, and can have significant security spillover
effects, increasing global risk of political instability and **violent
extremism**]{.underline}.

[This political stability, in addition to institutional checks and
balances, makes **democracies better international partners and allies
in the long-term**]{.underline}. Treaties ratified by multiple branches
of government are more durable than executive agreements signed by a
single leader who may be replaced within a short period of time. [While
democracies may be more reluctant to commit to alliances and formal
security pacts, once a party to them, they are more dependable than
other states with concentrated power at the executive
level]{.underline}. **[These kind of durable commitments are of interest
to the United States as it seeks to preserve the liberal world
order]{.underline}**; [it is far more effective to ally with partners
whose institutions make withdrawal from the alliance
costly]{.underline}.

Finally, [it has been empirically observed that **democracies do not go
to war with one another**]{.underline}. While there is a robust debate
around the exact nature of the so-called "democratic peace," it [appears
that there are qualities particular to democracies that make war between
them particularly unlikely: a **dovish public constrains leaders'
ability to wage war**]{.underline}, [competitive elections and a free
press make it **easier to credibly communicate resolve to potential
adversaries**]{.underline}, [consolidated democracies tend to be **more
wealthy and economically interdependent**]{.underline}, [like-minded
people are more hesitant to wage war against one another, and so
on]{.underline}. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, however, a [world
of democracies is inherently safer, more prosperous, and less likely to
initiate a war against the United States --- a key factor in protecting
American security and interests]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--Democratic Peace Theory True

#### The most exhaustive quantitative study finds DPT to be true. 

**Imai \'21** - Professor of Government and of Statistics at Harvard
University \[Kosuke and James Lo, \"Robustness of Empirical Evidence for
the Democratic Peace: A Nonparametric Sensitivity Analysis,\"
International Organization, Vol 75, Issue 3\]

How [should we resolve this empirical debate regarding the democratic
peace?]{.underline}Footnote9 Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized
experiments, we can never completely rule out the possible existence of
confounding biases that arise from omitted variables. While scholars in
this literature have exclusively relied on parametric regression models,
this approach requires strong assumptions, namely that the model
accurately characterizes the true data-generating process (correct set
of variables, right functional form, valid distributional assumption,
etc.). Given that these assumptions may not be verifiable from observed
data, it is no surprise that various scholars advocate different
regression models with diverging sets of variables, resulting in
contradictory findings. The difficulty of adjudicating between these
alternative modeling approaches has led to the ongoing controversy in
the empirical democratic peace literature.

[We propose an alternative approach based on nonparametric sensitivity
analysis]{.underline} to formally assess the robustness of the empirical
evidence.Footnote10 Specifically, [we quantify the strength of
confounding relationships that could explain away the observed
association between democracy and peace]{.underline}. That is, [we
compute the precise level of **unobserved confounding needed** to render
the observed association between **democracy and conflict
spurious**]{.underline}. The idea is that although not all correlations
imply causation, a very strong correlation suggests it. [Unlike the
parametric regression modeling approach prevalent in the literature, the
proposed nonparametric sensitivity approach directly addresses the
existence of unobserved confounders]{.underline} [without assuming a
particular regression model]{.underline}.Footnote11 Although one can
never know with certainty from observational data whether democracy
causes peace, this [nonparametric sensitivity analysis can formally
assess the robustness of empirical evidence for the democratic
peace]{.underline}.

Our analysis applies the nonparametric sensitivity analysis method
originally developed by Cornfield and colleagues, who were concerned
with the robustness of the positive association between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer in the potential presence of unobserved
confounders.Footnote12 The study of the causal relationship between
smoking and lung cancer closely parallels the dispute on the democratic
peace. In both cases, randomized experiments cannot be conducted for
ethical and logistical reasons, and critics contend that the observed
association suffers from confounding biases. While no definitive
conclusion can be drawn from observational data, Cornfield and
colleagues argue that no existing confounder can explain the strong
association between smoking and cancer and therefore this relationship
is likely to be causal. Their conclusion is worth quoting here:

Cigarette smokers have a ninefold greater risk of developing lung cancer
than nonsmokers, while over-two-pack-a-day smokers have at least a
60-fold greater risk. Any characteristic proposed as a measure of the
postulated cause common to both smoking status and lung-cancer risk must
therefore be at least nine-fold more prevalent among cigarette smokers
than among nonsmokers and at least 60-fold more prevalent among
two-pack-a-day smokers. No such characteristic has yet been produced
despite diligent search.Footnote13

[Our application of nonparametric sensitivity analysis to the democratic
peace yields striking results.]{.underline} Depending on the definition
of democracy, [we find that a confounder must be at least forty-seven
times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other types of
dyads]{.underline}. Thus, [any potential confounder that could explain
the democratic peace would have to be at least five times as prevalent
as a similar confounder for smoking and lung cancer.]{.underline} In
other words, according to our analysis, [the positive association
between democracy and peace is **much more robust** than that between
smoking and lung cancer]{.underline}.

#### Democratic peace is true

**Hegre et al 2019** - Professor Department of Peace and Conflict
Research Uppsala University

Havard Hegre Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol 64, Issue 1, 2020.
\"Civil Society and the Democratic Peace\"
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002719850620

We theorize that three distinct structures of democratic constraint
explain why [more democratic dyads do not engage in military conflict
with each other.]{.underline} We build on earlier theories that focused
on electoral and horizontal accountability. We add a new dimension---the
[social accountability provided by an **active civil
society**]{.underline}. [Using several new measures]{.underline} from
the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data set, [we stringently test these
explanations.]{.underline} **[We find social accountability to be the
strongest and most consistent predictor of nonbelligerence in
dyads,]{.underline}** that horizontal accountability is still important,
but that the independent role of electoral accountability has been
somewhat overstated. However, we do find that social and electoral
accountability work strongly together, to make for an even greater
effect. **[The finding is robust to a range of specifications and in the
face of controls for contending theories that challenge the democratic
peace]{.underline}** (e.g., the capitalist and territorial peace
theories).

The [democratic peace has proved to be one of the most]{.underline}
influential and **[durable findings]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the
history of international relations, if not [political science as a
whole]{.underline}. As with all influential findings, [alternatives have
been posed, for example, the "capitalist peace"]{.underline} (Gartzke
2007; Mousseau 2000, 2009, 2013), the "territorial peace" (Gibler 2012),
[or "political similarity]{.underline}" (Bennett 2006; Raknerud and
Hegre 1997; Peceny, Beer, and Sanchez-Terry 2002; Werner 2000). Beyond
such empirical challenges, [the finding has also been criticized for not
providing a fully convincing causal logic that explains the empirical
finding]{.underline} (Rosato 2003). [This puzzle of what makes
democracies less likely to engage in conflict with other democracies
still remains subject to a lively and inconclusive debate]{.underline}
(Hegre 2014). [Our purpose here is to use the new Varieties of
Democracy]{.underline} (V-Dem) [data, with its ability to more precisely
disaggregate the components of democracy, to reconsider its **causal
logic in a more precise fashion** and with a fresh
perspective]{.underline}.

We advance the debate by arguing that [different forms of constraint on
power holders help to explain why democratic dyads are less likely to
engage in conflict.]{.underline} To date, the greatest attention has
been focused on what we term electoral and horizontal accountability.
Electoral accountability (sometimes referred to as vertical
accountability) functions because elected politicians try to avoid
alienating voters in anticipation of the next round of elections.
Horizontal accountability operates through the ability of other branches
of government and state institutions to check the power of the
executive. We build on previous work that showed that greater electoral
participation (Reiter and Tillman 2002; Clark and Nordstrom 2005; Bueno
de Mesquita et al. 1999) and greater horizontal constraints on the
executive (Reiter and Tillman 2002; Clark and Nordstrom 2005; Choi 2010)
work to reduce conflict. An important part of [our contribution is to
add a new dimension---social accountability]{.underline}. [It is
provided by organized actors in civil society that have the ability to
inflict audience costs on the executive in-between elections and to
mobilize in support of opponents during elections]{.underline}.

[We also highlight a new measurement tool for capturing democracy as an
aggregate and in its component parts in new and potentially fruitful
ways.]{.underline} Whereas [the vast majority of studies have relied on
Polity to capture the degree of democracy among states, we use the V-Dem
data, which have both better concept-measurement consistency and also
allow us, because of the ability to disaggregate components of
democracy, to directly test the different forms of constraint we
discussed above]{.underline}. **[Our sample includes observations from
173 countries across the globe from 1900 to 2010.]{.underline}** [We
test]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} these [three different forms of
accountability]{.underline}---(1) horizontal, (2) electoral, and (3)
social---[restrain democracies from fighting with each
other]{.underline}. When pitting the three mechanisms of accountability
directly against each other, we find the weakest support for the form
that has received the greatest attention in the literature---electoral.
However, its effect becomes salient when it is combined with social
accountability between elections. The [democratic peace
effect]{.underline} thus [seems]{.underline} less [a product
of]{.underline} simple electoral constraint than on [the ability of
**civil society**]{.underline}, as well as other state actors, [to
constrain the incumbent]{.underline}. To our knowledge, **[this is the
first time that anyone has tested the impact of civil society engagement
on conflict behavior]{.underline}**. In an Online Supplementary File
(henceforth SF),1 we demonstrate that **[our main findings are robust in
the face of contending theories and alternate specifications of our
tests]{.underline}**.

Keeping Battlefield Edge, Leaders Say"
https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3058028/digital-transformation-ai-important-in-keeping-battlefield-edge-leaders-say/

John B. Sherman, DOD\'s chief information officer, held a fireside chat
June 8 with Craig Martell, DOD\'s chief digital and artificial
intelligence officer, at the DOD Digital and AI Symposium.   ¶ Sherman
congratulated Martell on his appointment to this new leadership
position. He brings a valuable industry perspective to the team, Sherman
said, noting that Martell has only been on the job for three days and is
hitting the ground running.  ¶ The chief of digital and artificial
intelligence, which uses the acronym CDAO, reached Full Operating
Capability June 1 and is charged with leading and overseeing DOD\'s
strategy development and policy formulation for data, analytics and AI;
breaking down barriers to data and AI adoption within appropriate DOD
institutional processes; and creating enabling digital infrastructure
and services that support Components\' development and deployment of
data, analytics, AI and digital-enabled solutions. ¶ Sherman noted that
the CDAO has his hands full of real-world operational requirements,
including such diverse things as the war in Ukraine, business analytics,
counter unmanned aerial systems and data governance. ¶ Martell said he
will focus not only on the fight today but also future fights five or 10
years later.  ¶ \"[We need to find the g]{.underline}aps, the right
places [where we can leverage value, and then that value is going to
drive a virtuous cycle of change,]{.underline}\" Martell said. \"A lot
of folks think that DOD should be more like industry. Some of that is
true. But \[there are\] a lot of things about the DOD that can\'t be
more like industry. ... W[e need to find out how to keep the DOD but
also make it more efficient and work better.\"]{.underline} ¶
[Sherman]{.underline} mentioned that his [and Martell\'s work involves a
lot of coordination and communications with the military services, the
Defense Information Systems Agency and combatant commanders regarding
everything they do, such as the Artificial Intelligence and Data
Accelerator and digital services]{.underline}. They are the ultimate
customers. ¶ [The team]{.underline}, Sherman continued, [constantly
thinks about what sort of AI and machine learning capabilities would
help them get ahead of specific problem sets, which will vary from
combatant command to combatant command. ]{.underline} ¶ For instance,

said. ¶ Sherman also mentioned cybersecurity as it relates to securing
data and algorithms.  ¶ \"We talk a lot about zero trust,\" he said.

control. ]{.underline} ¶ Spotlight: Engineering in the DOD¶ Martell said
[leveraging the relationship with industry is important. \"It doesn\'t
make any sense for us to build things that we shouldn\'t be building

mentioned that [startups and innovative small industries should be
sought out by DOD for their creative solutions. ]{.underline} ¶ Sherman
said he agreed and added that [DOD needs to work with small and medium
industries to help them bolster their cybersecurity

Also, they both mentioned [upskilling in DOD]{.underline}, which [means
getting meaningful work in the department so that when these
professionals return to industry, they will have new and marketable
skills that are desirable and cutting edge. ]{.underline} ¶ Martell
noted that he took a pay cut coming into his current position. While the
government usually cannot pay as much as the private sector, he said the
intangible benefit that attracts him and others, is DOD\'s mission and

### 2AC -- Solvency -- NATO Key 

#### Alliances key to AI versus Russia and China\-\--the US can't do it alone

Security and Emerging Technology

Deliver a Democratic Way of AI\" Center for Security and Emerging
Technology https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/agile-alliances/

America's broad network of allies and partners is a source of enduring
strength. [In an era of economic and technological competition with
China and Russia, the **U**nited **S**tates benefits from allies that
share its values and produce troves of strategic resources, including
computer and data science experts; private sectors that are innovative,
dominant and trend-setting; data on which to train AI algorithms;
advanced microprocessors and data storage units; governmental research
and development (R&D) investments; diplomatic support for initiatives in
AI safety and governance; and the clout needed to export norms and best
practices to the rest of the world]{.underline}.

[Alliances matter in the AI context because they provide a framework for
cooperation, data sharing, dissemination of best practices, joint
planning, and procurement. The market adequately incentivizes some forms
of cooperation, such as data labelling and exchanges. But alliances can
help formalize and expand these relationships, correct for market
failures in such areas as AI safety and security, coordinate development
of use cases and risk assessments, enhance the legitimacy of
international action, and validate the deployment of safe and reliable
AI.]{.underline}

**[America's alliances and security partnerships will shape the future
trajectory of AI, even as AI reshapes the capabilities and operating
environments for U.S. allies and partners.]{.underline}** [By investing
in **privacy**-preserving machine learning and other **techniques** for
improving the interpretability of AI systems, the United States and its
allies can promote the development of AI consistent with liberal
democratic values.]{.underline} Far-sighted investments could yield
large dividends. **[AI has a wide array of applications that can benefit
democracies, from improving data protection and privacy, to promoting
transparency and accountability in government.]{.underline}**

**[Advances in AI will also enable new military
capabilities]{.underline}**. [Nations around the world use AI to enhance
intelligence collection and analysis, streamline decision-making, lower
operating costs, and improve military logistics through predictive
maintenance]{.underline}. [As China, Russia, and other authoritarian
powers integrate AI with military capabilities, U.S. allies and partners
will face a more complex operating environment.]{.underline} **[Advances
in software and digital systems could render it more difficult to assess
the balance of power in key domains]{.underline}**. [As the operational
tempo of war accelerates, leaders might be tempted to **integrate AI**
and machine learning **into early warning and command and control
systems**, creating new risks and uncertainties for strategic
stability]{.underline}.8 **[Competitors may rush to deploy AI-enabled
capabilities without adequate testing, evaluation, verification, and
validation]{.underline}**. [Compounding the risks, adversaries will seek
to exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems and may even use AI to execute
novel cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns aimed at undermining
democratic institutions and sowing discord among the
public]{.underline}.9

[In meeting]{.underline} these [challenges and seizing]{.underline} the
[opportunities]{.underline} that AI presents, the United States and its
allies [face tough trade-offs]{.underline}. [Three, in particular,
necessitate close coordination and prudent mitigation
strategies]{.underline}.

[First, the **U**nited **S**tates and its allies face a trade-off
between capability and dependency]{.underline}.10 [Showcasing a
democratic way of AI will require the United States and its allies to
pool resources, coordinate policies, and share best practices and
information]{.underline}. [Leveraging the capabilities of its allies and
partners will amplify U.S. power and influence, but will also create
inefficiencies and require compromise]{.underline}. While the United
States can manage these challenges, [it cannot eliminate them
entirely---nor should it]{.underline}. **[As long as AI-related supply
chains are global and AI talent both mobile and globally distributed,
innovation in AI requires international collaboration.]{.underline}**11
[To excel in this new context, America will need to embrace its role as
a "systems integrator" among like-minded allies and
partners.]{.underline}12 [Embedding cooperation in dense, decentralized
networks plays to the United States' strengths as a democratic power
that favors market approaches to technological cooperation.]{.underline}
By combining top-down vision with dynamic, bottom-up innovation and
entrepreneurship, the United States and its allies can foster a
competitive ecosystem that enables the best ideas to flourish.

These benefits should not obscure the risks. [International networks can
facilitate cooperation by creating focal points and enhancing the
transparency and availability of information]{.underline}.13 As scholars
have shown, [however, networks of interdependence can also become the
sites of competitive power plays, such as the]{.underline} Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ([SWIFT) financial
messaging system]{.underline}.14 The United States has used SWIFT to
counter terrorism, monitor illicit financial activity, and bolster the
sanctions regime against Iran.15 At the same time, **[China is exploring
alternatives to this U.S.-dominated cross-border payments
system]{.underline}**.16 **[Emerging competitive dynamics suggest the
need for a strategic approach toward the development of AI, especially
in semiconductors]{.underline}**.

[To manage the risks, the **U**nited **S**tates and its allies should
pursue a range of mitigation strategies, including securing and
enhancing their defense innovation bases and domestic economic
competitiveness, diversifying partnerships in AI, investing diplomatic
capacity in norms and standards for AI technologies and mobile
telecommunications consistent with democratic values, and promoting
flexible institutional configurations for partnership in
AI.]{.underline}17

[Second]{.underline}, the United States and its allies face [a trade-off
between competition and cooperation. All nations compete for relative
military and economic advantage. In the age of AI, nations will also
compete over whose vision of the future attracts the broadest
support.]{.underline} [Cooperation among democracies is necessary to
guard against authoritarian uses of AI, but there are other imperatives
for cooperative action]{.underline}. For example, [democratic nations
must cooperate with strategic competitors to ensure global economic
stability and prevent misperceptions and miscalculations from spiraling
into hostility; this could be achieved through arms control or
international action to create norms and standards for emerging
technologies]{.underline}.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the United States competes with China
and Russia in AI and collaborates with allies and partners. While
accurate, it is equally true that the United States competes with its
allies and partners for top talent and resources in AI and must find
ways to cooperate with China and Russia on AI safety and security,
strategic stability, and crisis management to forestall the risks of
accidents and miscalculations.18 When asked about obstacles to
collaboration with the United States, for example, multiple officials
from allied countries highlighted industrial competition as an
impediment.

Cooperative dynamics are typically in pursuit of shared, global
interests, while competitive dynamics tend to follow from a national
calculation of AI's impact on relative power and wealth. [Researchers
and scientists cooperate across national boundaries, but political
leaders face difficult trade-offs between national interests and the
international networks that foster open-source collaboration in
AI]{.underline}.

Navigating these dynamics will require the United States and its allies
to pursue a two-pronged strategy: expand areas for cooperation and
competition that generate mutual benefits, while shrinking the space for
competition that generates harmful effects or a race to the bottom. For
example, [the United States should manage competition within a
rules-based framework that ensures a level playing field, protects
intellectual property, and disincentivizes hidden government
subsidies]{.underline}. At the same time, it should work with countries
to discourage unfair competition that tilts the playing field in favor
of state-backed enterprises, destabilizes financial markets, and
triggers unforeseen disruptions to global supply chains.

[The third trade-off is between safety and speed]{.underline}.19 [This
trade-off arises from the complex dynamics between the United States and
its allies on the one hand, and strategic competitors such as China and
Russia on the other. Artificial intelligence presents a range of
opportunities and risks for the United States and its
allies]{.underline}. [AI systems are brittle and can fail accidently or
behave unpredictably in real-world settings]{.underline}.20 [American,
European, Chinese, and Russian leaders increasingly view AI as a core
element of national power]{.underline}. **[In an effort to gain
comparative advantage,]{.underline}** **[countries could rush to deploy
untested]{.underline}** or **[unsafe AI systems]{.underline}**. **[It is
in the interest of U.S. national security to pursue confidence-building
measures in AI safety]{.underline}**. [It is also a core interest of
U.S. allies**: a majority of officials noted standards to ensure
reliable and responsible AI development as a national AI priority and
avenue for productive multilateral collaboration**]{.underline}. **[By
leading an international effort on safe and reliable AI, the United
States and its allies can reduce threats to global security and promote
strategic stability]{.underline}**.

### 2AC -- Solvency -- NATO Key 

#### NATO is key -- it has a framework in place for accelerating development and integration into real-time military applications 

**Parrikar 2022** - Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses

usage of AI now"
https://www.eurasiareview.com/30052022-natos-ai-push-and-military-implications-analysis/

In future, [AI will act as an enabler to out-adapt competitors and
adversaries. The current]{.underline} AI [strategy]{.underline} of NATO
[needs to address the vulnerabilities in AI systems and related measures
for effectively using autonomous weapon systems and military governance
of AI]{.underline}. [The NATO accelerator has been devised to address,
prioritise, and promote interoperability in transatlantic cooperation to
drive the strategic innovation process]{.underline}. [The key
drivers]{.underline} for Innovation in AI and other EDTs [will be the
establishment of the NATO-Civil-Military Technology capability that will
include various actors from the military, civil, state and private
sectors as a part of the EDT innovation ecosystem]{.underline}. Another
critical factor is the broadening of the NATO--EU cooperation through a
joint taskforce on defence innovation and EDTs to regularise and provide
strategic capabilities on ethical and adoption challenges of EDTs like
AI and ML. Furthermore, [NATO needs to protect the use of AI from
manipulation and disruption and align it with its stated principle of
"Responsible use of AI".]{.underline} [NATO needs to]{.underline} work
on AI adoption challenges centred on innovation and arms control. It can
look towards bringing in guiding principles on use of AI-driven lethal
autonomous weapon systems. [It is expected that in the next 2--3 years,
AI's use will be confined to the field of military logistics,
reconnaissance, mission planning and support, predictive maintenance of
a military facility, data fusion and analysis, cyber defence and
optimisation of processes]{.underline}. In the long run, [NATO could
employ AI for more complex military applications as it generates greater
political support for offensive AI military projects.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Solvency -- AT EU Say No

#### European allies would say yes -- see collaboration on AI as an essential component of future development

**Franke 2021** -- policy fellow at European Council on Foreign
Relations

America Could Clash Over Ai" European Council on Foreign Relations
https://ecfr.eu/publication/artificial-divide-how-europe-and-america-could-clash-over-ai/

The next phase could be a period of international, and specifically
transatlantic, cooperation on AI. After several years of European states
working at full capacity to understand how to support domestic AI
research, including by assembling expert teams to deliberate new laws
and regulations, there is growing interest among policymakers and
experts in looking beyond Europe. [On the EU level, AI policy and
governance have already received significant attention, with the
European Commission playing an important role in incentivising member
states to develop AI strategies]{.underline}, such as by starting to
tackle issues around how to make sure AI is "ethical" and "trustworthy".
But [recent months have seen a rise in the number of calls for
international cooperation on AI]{.underline} driven by liberal
democracies across the world. [Western countries and their allies have
set up new forums for cooperation on how to take AI forward, and are
activating existing forums. More such organisations and platforms for
cooperation are planned.¶ Calls for cooperation between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates an[d Europe have become
particularly]{.underline} regular and [resonant]{.underline}: [following
last year's]{.underline} US presidential [election]{.underline}, it was
reported that [the European Commission planned to propose a
"Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council", which would set joint
standards on new technologies.]{.underline} And, in September 2020, the
US set up a group of like-minded countries "to provide values-based
global leadership in defense for policies and approaches in adopting
AI", which included seven European states, in addition to countries such
as Australia, Canada, and South Korea. [In June 2020, the Global
Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was founded to consider the
responsible development of AI; it counts among its members the US, four
European states, and the European Union.]{.underline}¶ This paper
examines the reasons [European states]{.underline} may [want to work
with the US on AI]{.underline}, and why the US may want to reach out to
Europe on the issue. It also identifies the points of disagreement that
may stop the allies from fully fleshing out transatlantic AI
cooperation. The paper shows that, while both sides are interested in
working together, their rationales for doing so differ. Furthermore,
economic and political factors may stand in the way of cooperation, even
though such cooperation could have a positive impact on the way AI
develops. The paper also argues that [transatlantic cooperation in the
area of military AI could be a good first step]{.underline} -- here,
[Europe and the US should build on existing collaboration within
NATO.]{.underline} The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the
different forums that have been created or proposed for transatlantic
and broader Western cooperation on AI.¶ Experts initially thought of AI
as a 'dual-use technology', meaning that it can be used in both civilian
and military contexts. As AI has advanced, with new uses for it emerging
all the time, it has now become more common to speak of AI as an
"enabler" or a "general-purpose technology" -- as¶ electricity is, for
example. AI can improve or enable various capabilities in almost all
realms imaginable, from medicine and healthcare to basic research; from
logistics and transport to journalism . With this change in
understanding has come a realisation on both sides of the Atlantic that
AI is likely to have immeasurable consequences for economic development,
and will have an impact on social and democratic life, labour markets,
industrial development, and more. This also means that¶ policymakers and
analysts are increasingly asking questions about how AI could affect the
global balance of power.¶ [There are two main rationales
for]{.underline} current efforts at [transatlantic cooperation on
A]{.underline}I. Firstly, among experts and policymakers, [there are
concerns that AI may be developed]{.underline} and used [in ways that
are contrary to liberal democratic values and ethics]{.underline}.
Secondly, some [policymakers fear that AI may give their geopolitical
competitors a significant advantage]{.underline}. While the former is
the primary reason why many European states want to work with other
democratic countries, the latter has played an important role in
motivating the US to seek cooperation with Europe and other allies. This
was the case even under Donald Trump, who was not known for his
appreciation of alliances in general, and Europeans in particular.

#### Even if the EU member states are skeptical, using NATO as a channel for coordination ensures cooperation 

**Franke 2021** -- policy fellow at European Council on Foreign
Relations

Ulrike Esther Franke January 2021 "Artificial Divide: How Europe And
America Could Clash Over Ai" European Council on Foreign Relations

[Europe and the US will need to choose the appropriate forum for AI
cooperation]{.underline} based on its area of focus. **[Transatlantic
cooperation on military AI might be best located within
NATO]{.underline}**. [Members of the alliance have a]{.underline} long
[history of working together]{.underline}, and **[NATO already has
dedicated units whose task is to ensure that all allies can cooperate
and transform together]{.underline}**. [Given that military
interoperability is vital]{.underline} to its functioning, **[NATO has
no alternative but to address this issue,]{.underline}** independent of
other forums' work. [It would be advisable for NATO]{.underline}, and
possibly the EU and its member states, [to join the newly established,
US-led AI partnership for defence. The current situation]{.underline} --
in which the partnership includes only a few European countries and some
of the United States' other like-minded partners -- [is not constructive
from a European viewpoint:]{.underline} [Europeans should strive for
Europe-wide harmonisation, not the creation of further
differences.]{.underline} [For cooperation on]{.underline} other areas
of [AI]{.underline}, such as sharing data or supporting research, other
forums, including ad hoc alliances aimed at specific outcomes, may be
the way forward. From a European standpoint, however, [it would be
advisable to try to include the EU as much as possible, so that European
positions are not watered down or member states divided among
themselves.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT Unethical AI -- "Killer Robots"

#### applications of AI in logistics and sustainability is distinct from militarized autonomous weapons 

**Konaev and Chahal 2021** -- research fellow and research analys with
the Center for Security and Emerging Technology

Margarita Konaev Husanjot Chahal April 2021 "The Path of Least
Resistance: Multinational Collaboration on AI for Military Logistics and
Sustainment" CSET Issue Brief

While we discuss how the United States and its allies can work together
on AI for military logistics and sustainment in both combat and
noncombat settings, [there is no doubt that the environment in question
matters a great deal]{.underline}. From data to computational power to
available talent, as well as considerations like privacy, safety, and
security, [implementing AI for military logistics and sustainment
functions performed in controlled environments similar to commercial
settings is a different endeavor from deploying AI- enabled logistics
and sustainment functions in contested and hostile
environments]{.underline}. We take these differences into account where
relevant, and acknowledge that even under the best of circumstances,
there are still significant challenges for both the adoption of AI
applications and multinational collaboration in this area.

Technologically attainable

While not without its challenges, [military logistics and sustainment
tasks]{.underline}, especially those performed in noncombat settings,
[present a technologically attainable area for multinational
collaboration in AI.]{.underline}

[Although much of the innovation in AI is occurring in the commercial
sector, adopting and adapting commercial AI applications for military
purposes is often impossible. Current AI]{.underline} technologies,
[and]{.underline} especially [ML-based systems, tend to perform well in
stable environments but struggle with uncertain and novel
situations]{.underline}, [and remain particularly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks.]{.underline}

[These vulnerabilities present an unacceptable level of risk in high-
stakes military settings]{.underline}, [where the environment is
uncertain]{.underline} and adversarial by definition. [The consequences
of mistakes]{.underline} and even system failure, however, [are less
severe when it comes to some military logistics and sustainment
tasks]{.underline} which are administered and managed [in noncombat
settings]{.underline}, and constitute what some have called enterprise
AI applications.

[Advances in AI for logistics in commercial aviation, maritime shipping,
and transportation sectors are]{.underline} therefore [more applicable
to certain military logistics]{.underline} and sustainment
[tasks]{.underline} [performed in noncombat settings than for
specialized military equipment]{.underline} like autonomous ground
combat vehicles or armed drones. In particular, [there may be
opportunities to adopt and adapt commercial applications for the
intelligent automation of tasks]{.underline} such as scheduling
equipment maintenance and repairs, updating and issuing licenses, supply
tracking and forecasting, and other processes that control the flow of
logistics throughout the military organization.34 To reiterate, **[these
are much more than cost cutting and efficiency increasing measures;
improvements in these areas enable military readiness and effectiveness
in combat]{.underline}**.35

In addition to these opportunities to leverage AI-enabled technologies
and tools available in the commercial sector in support of military
logistics, [there are]{.underline} also [fewer barriers to in- house
innovation within defense organizations]{.underline}. [Many]{.underline}
of the [AI applications relevant to logistics]{.underline} and
sustainment [can be developed and used in relatively well-controlled and
benign environments in settings akin to commercial civilian
enterprises]{.underline}. [Under such conditions, resources]{.underline}
like data and infrastructure, including storage, ETL pipelines,
communication bandwidth, and compute [can be made available to train ML
models for various AI applications]{.underline}.36 Notably, the 2016
Defense Science Board Summer Study on Autonomy raised a similar point
regarding logistics planning and execution as "a particularly good
candidate for testing and experimentation (T&E) \... because the
[behavior of logistic software can be evaluated against crisply known
metrics]{.underline}."37

### 2AC -- AT Unethical AI -- Plan 🡪 Cooperative Framework 

#### Cooperating on logistics is key to establish a framework for future implementation

military adoption of AI"
https://www.capgemini.com/no-no/2022/01/natos-outlook-on-a-responsible-military-adoption-of-ai/

Or as Ulrike Franke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, stated: ["It's better for the alliance to focus on
the basics, like increased data sharing to develop and train military AI
and cooperating on using artificial intelligence in
logistics]{.underline}. (..) [If NATO countries were to cooperate on
that]{.underline}, **[that could create good procedures and set
precedents."]{.underline}**\[2\] [Training]{.underline}, at all levels
of command, [is certainly a key factor to cooperatively synchronize the
development of maturity in both AI algorithms and
operators]{.underline}, thus [gradually building increased capacity and
professionalism.]{.underline}¶ NATO stresses the importance of an
ethical approach and points out that "[Allies and NATO must strive to
protect the use of AI from]{.underline} such [interference,
manipulation, or sabotage]{.underline}, in line with the Reliability
Principle of Responsible Use, also leveraging AI-enabled Cyber Defence
applications.". Furthermore, [they point out the need to develop
adequate security certification requirements for AI due to the fact that
AI can impact critical infrastructure, capabilities and civil
preparedness creating potential vulnerabilities]{.underline}, such as
cyberspace, that could be exploited by certain state and non-state
actors.¶ [The principles mentioned]{.underline} in the NATO strategy
[allow for modernization and use of AI without stifling
innovation]{.underline}, on the contrary even: [they might significantly
boost the development of areas in artificial intelligence that have not
been in focus until now. The AI strategy can point the direction how AI
play a decisive role in how NATO's partners cooperate, analyze and
provide vital decision-making information faster and more comprehendible
relevant to a wide range of potential challenges and threat
situations.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT Unethical AI -- EU Involvement Checks 

#### Collaboration with the EU ensures ethical use and application 

**Franke 2021** -- policy fellow at European Council on Foreign
Relations

Ulrike Esther Franke January 2021 "Artificial Divide: How Europe And
America Could Clash Over Ai" European Council on Foreign Relations

Finally, [there may be cases in which an AI-enabled system may be
ethically unobjectionable]{.underline} and trustworthy, and the context
of its use generally acceptable, but the specific goals for which the
system is used are problematic. For example, AI-enabled surveillance
might not be problematic per se; and it should be possible to design the
underlying technology in a way that does not discriminate. But the
specific use of an AI-enabled surveillance system to systematically
oppress and exclude members of a minority group would be unethical.
Equally, it is ethically problematic to take advantage of AI- enabled
capabilities to analyse human behaviour, moods, and beliefs with the aim
of influencing people's behaviour and thoughts -- such as during an
election, for example. This is true even though the technology itself
may have beneficial uses in other settings. In such contexts, many
experts have raised concerns over increasingly powerful "deep fake"
technologies -- AI-enabled ways to create what look like genuine videos
of people.¶ A growing number of AI developers are realising that their
work could potentially be misused. In early 2019, California-based
research lab OpenAI made the news when it announced it had developed a
text-generating model able to write whole essays by itself -- but that
it would not share the dataset it used for training the algorithm or all
of the code it runs on. This was unusual, as most AI research -- even
that by commercial actors -- tends to be carried out openly. The
organisation argued that it was worried about the misuse of the tool for
disinformation. That said, OpenAI later released the full model, stating
that it had seen "no strong evidence of misuse".¶ [Throughout the
Western world and beyond, concerns have been raised about these
dangers]{.underline}. [Various firms and organisations]{.underline},
such as Google, [have published charters and principles for ethical
AI]{.underline}. [The ethics of AI has become an area of intense
academic research]{.underline}, with new institutions founded to study
the topic, and calls for AI ethics to be recognised as an academic field
comparable to medical ethics.¶ **[No actor]{.underline}**, however,
**[has so publicly put itself at the forefront of this issue as the EU
has]{.underline}**. [The EU defined the ethical implications of AI as a
primary area of interest]{.underline} and work comparatively [early
on.]{.underline} The European Commission created a "High-Level Expert
Group on AI", which in April 2019 released its Ethics Guidelines for
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, followed by its Policy and
Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.
[Ethical AI is not just a concern for EU institutions]{.underline}:
**[every national AI strategy published by member states touches on the
topic,]{.underline}** and **[several]{.underline}** countries, such as
Denmark and Lithuania, **[identify ethical rules as their first
priority.]{.underline}**

### 1NC -- No Solvency -- EU Say No 

#### EU says no -- 4 reasons -- distrust of the US, desires for digital autonomy, lack of threat perception, and Brexit all short-circuit transatlantic cooperation

**Franke 2021** -- policy fellow at European Council on Foreign
Relations

Ulrike Esther Franke January 2021 "Artificial Divide: How Europe And
America Could Clash Over Ai" European Council on Foreign Relations

Obstacles to cooperation

[Both sides]{.underline} of the Atlantic [are]{.underline} already
[motivated to cooperate]{.underline} with each other [on
AI]{.underline}. But, [despite these shared interests, transatlantic
cooperation on AI may not be straightforwar]{.underline}d. [Four
trends]{.underline}, in particular, could [pose problems]{.underline}:
[transatlantic estrangement; European digital autonomy efforts;
differing views on China; and]{.underline}, potentially,
[Brexit]{.underline}.

Transatlantic estrangement

[The transatlantic alliance has had a bad four years]{.underline}. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration's criticism of the United Nations and
the World Trade Organization, the president's [threats to leave NATO,
and]{.underline} his active [criticism of the EU]{.underline} all made
Europeans wonder whether they had lost their most important partner.
Moreover, [in light of the conflict over 5G]{.underline}, in the minds
of many Europeans, [tech]{.underline}nology in particular [has become an
area that creates conflict in the transatlantic relationship rather than
fostering cooperation.]{.underline}

Although transatlantic relations are likely to improve under Biden[,
substantial damage has been done, and it will take some time to mend
these ties]{.underline}. But, **[even if relations
improve]{.underline}**, [it is]{.underline} becoming increasingly
[obvious that US has a diminishing interest in Europe as a
geopolitically]{.underline} [important part of the world.]{.underline}
This trend was already visible under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.
It is, therefore, unsurprising that, on technology cooperation, both
sides emphasise the importance of working with other actors as well as
each other. The US National Security Commission on AI, for example,
recommends that the US Departments of State and Defense "should
negotiate formal AI cooperation agreements with Australia, India, Japan,
New Zealand, South Korea, and Vietnam". Its March 2020 report emphasises
on several occasions the importance of the Five Eyes intelligence
alliance. Meanwhile, Europeans are pursuing the idea of an alliance for
multilateralism. And, on technology and AI more specifically, they have
also begun to reach out to other democratic allies.

European digital autonomy

[The most important aspect of transatlantic estrangement]{.underline},
however, [is not the loss of trust between the US and
Europe]{.underline} -- which they will eventually reverse. Rather,
during the four years of the Trump administration, and partly in
response to isolationist tendencies in the US, [Europeans have become
much more comfortable talking about European strategic autonomy or
sovereignty]{.underline}. Without encouraging the narrative that these
efforts are directed against the US, or were primarily an answer to
Trump, Europeans aim to empower Europe as an actor in its own right. [In
the tech]{.underline}nological [realm]{.underline}, [this led to the
idea of European digital sovereignty]{.underline}, the aim of which is
to build up European technological capabilities. [Although]{.underline}
European digital sovereignty is [not]{.underline} specifically [targeted
at the US]{.underline}, [it has led,]{.underline} among other things,
[to]{.underline} efforts such as the possible [regulation of American
technology companies and concerns over American firms acquiring European
start-ups.]{.underline} European campaigners and some policymakers
believe US tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon are
forces to protect against. European thinking on technology partly
developed in opposition to the US and US companies. Thus, [European
efforts to build up digital sovereignty may impede transatlantic
cooperation.]{.underline}

[The EU's effort to strengthen ethical AI, and to make 'trustworthy AI'
a unique selling point for Europe, might also end up creating problems
for transatlantic cooperation]{.underline}. Many EU policymakers believe
that the EU's insistence on ethical AI will eventually become a location
advantage for Europe (much like data privacy): as more people become
concerned about unethical AI and data security, they will prefer to use
or buy AI 'made in Europe' rather than elsewhere. In this respect, two
European aims are at odds with each other: on the one hand, Europeans
want to ensure that AI is developed and used in an ethical way.
Partnering with a powerful player such as the US on this matter should
be an obvious way to help them achieve this goal. However, [if the EU
considers ethical AI not just a goal for humanity but a development that
may also create commercial advantages for Europe]{.underline}, **[then
transatlantic cooperation]{.underline}** on this issue **[is
counterproductive]{.underline}**, as it would undermine Europe's
uniqueness.

Finally, many [Europeans have expressed scepticism about the extent to
which Europe and the US are indeed aligned on ethical AI
principles]{.underline}. For example, the Danish national AI strategy
argues for a common ethical and human-centred basis for AI. It describes
ethical AI as a particularly European approach: "Europe and Denmark
should not copy the US or China. Both countries are investing heavily in
artificial intelligence, but with little regard for responsibility,
ethical principles and privacy." Many Europeans feel that the US "has no
idea how to regulate" cyberspace and continues to show little enthusiasm
for doing so. The EU, however, likes to think of itself as a trailblazer
when it comes to digital rights, such as the 2014 "right to be
forgotten" or the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation.

Differing views on China

As noted, [only a few European states look at AI through a geopolitical
lens]{.underline}, and EU efforts on this matter focus primarily on
strengthening the EU as a global player. [This means that the American
interest in using transatlantic cooperation as a means to curb Chinese
power is likely to have only limited traction]{.underline} in Europe.
And [US companies, rather than Chinese ones, currently remain the
primary 'other' for Europe]{.underline} to measure itself against.
[European regulation efforts still concentrate on US companies rather
than Chinese firms]{.underline}. In light of recent changes in language
on China in both NATO and the EU, which describe the country as a
"strategic competitor" and "systemic rival", European and American views
of China may converge eventually. But, at the moment, [Europeans do not
feel the same urgency as the US when it comes to pushing back against
China]{.underline}. Unfortunately for those in the US who favour greater
transatlantic cooperation, the European nation that most often thinks in
geopolitical terms, France, is among those most sceptical of the US.

Brexit

Finally, [the United Kingdom's exit from the EU may further complicate
transatlantic cooperation on AI. Even if the EU and the UK were to
decide to work]{.underline} as [closely]{.underline} as possible, [the
EU would no longer be able to speak as much of Europe as
previously.]{.underline} Any [transatlantic cooperation on AI
will,]{.underline} therefore, [require coordination between
three]{.underline}, rather than two, [actors]{.underline}. [Given the
UK's]{.underline} strong technology and [AI credentials]{.underline} (AI
leader DeepMind is based in London, although it is now owned by Google's
parent company, Alphabet), [the country is likely to want to play an
important role in any future negotiations]{.underline} on AI standards
and use.

America Could Clash Over Ai" European Council on Foreign Relations

[European policymakers have been less vocal about the geopolitical
consequences of AI]{.underline}. So far, the debate in Europe has
primarily revolved around AI's economic and social effects. Of the 21
strategies on AI either published or drafted by EU member states, very
few touch on the geopolitical implications of AI. [The notable
exception]{.underline} to this is France, whose national AI strategy was
clearly drafted with a geopolitical mindset. It [warns that France and
Europe need to "avoid becoming just 'digital colonies' of the Chinese
and American giants**". The strategy's inclusion of "American giants" is
telling**]{.underline} and important. It shows that, [from a European
point of view, the US is the primary 'other' that Europe measures itself
against on technology]{.underline} -- at least for now. This is [despite
the fact that]{.underline}, in recent years, [Chinese acquisitions of
European high-tech firms have caused significant concern.]{.underline}

[A]{.underline}nother potential [barrier to collaboration]{.underline},
particularly [with Europe]{.underline}an allies, [is the growing
momentum around the idea of European digital sovereignty
and]{.underline} increasing [concerns about]{.underline} continued
[dependence on U.S. tech]{.underline}nology companies.17 Part of the
push for greater European technology [independence stems from
Europe]{.underline} being "[caught in the crossfire]{.underline}" on a
variety of technology issues, including 5G and internet regulation
[amid]{.underline} the intensifying strategic [competition between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China.]{.underline}
European nations like France and Germany, among others, are becoming
more assertive when it comes to control over their data.18 The experts
behind [France's AI strategy]{.underline}, for instance,
[have]{.underline} advocated for a data policy that is
"[structured]{.underline} around the [goals of sovereignty]{.underline}
and strategic autonomy" [as a prerequisite for the development of
AI]{.underline} in France and in Europe, [in an effort to "avoid
becoming]{.underline} just '[digital colonies' of]{.underline} the
Chinese and [American g]{.underline}iants."19 Moreover, as Ulrike Franke
explains, [the EU has taken a stronger stance on protecting individuals'
digital rights through regulations]{.underline} such as the 2014 "right
to be forgotten" and the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation.20
**[Differing views on China, a push toward additional regulations of
U.S. technology companies, different approaches toward data privacy, and
commercial competition can all hinder transatlantic cooperation on
AI.]{.underline}**

Sitting atop resounding commercial success in the domestic as well as
the global marketplace, the CEOs of four U.S. digital behemoths appeared
last week before the House of Representatives to respond to public and
congressional concerns about market domination.¶ The size and success of
these champions, under fire for lack of transparency and anticompetitive
practices, have triggered similar, more exaggerated concerns in Europe,
which are playing out in a frenzy of proposed rulemaking at both the
Commission and member-state level. [As Congress probes the market
behavior of U.S. digital companies, it is important]{.underline} for
U.S. legislators [to consider parallel rising pressure for
digital]{.underline} and industrial [protectionism in
Europe]{.underline}, particularly in Germany and France. [This flurry of
regulatory activity endangers transatlantic data
transfers]{.underline}---**[the lifeblood of many innovative U.S.
firms]{.underline}**---[and will hurt U.S. business success globally
while simultaneously distracting both Europe and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from the]{.underline} broader [threat posed by
China]{.underline}'s authoritarian state capitalist system.¶ Many
[Europeans are]{.underline} deeply [worried about the continent's
ability to compete long term in the global digital economy]{.underline},
given its challenges in developing competitors to the U.S. and Chinese
tech giants. Yet European economies have tremendous strengths---highly
educated workforces, depth in engineering, advanced technologies, and a
leadership role in a host of industries that are rapidly digitizing,
such as agriculture, infrastructure, transportation, logistics,
manufacturing, and knowledge-intensive services, for example, financial,
business, environmental, and engineering services. Constructing new
European regulations for the digital era should be guided first by the
do no harm warning.¶ [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Europe share an interest in piloting, investing in, and leveraging
disruptive technologies like]{.underline} artificial intelligence
([AI]{.underline}), blockchain, and the Internet of Things in these key
industries, and liberalizing market access for services in emerging
markets. The United States and Europe can also work together to ensure
firms and workers in more underserved and remote regions are able to
apply technologies, access educational and training opportunities, and
increase productivity. **[But improved transatlantic cooperation in
supporting innovation]{.underline}**, productivity, consumer welfare,
and sustainable job creation in a flourishing transatlantic digital
economy, under an open and free internet architecture, **[seems all the
more remote in light of where European regulators say they are
headed.¶]{.underline}** The Commission released a series of documents
earlier this year outlining Europe's regulatory future, including a
White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, a Communication on European
Strategy for Data, and a framing paper related to Shaping Europe's
Digital Future. These documents and many more speak to [the European
desire to achieve]{.underline} "digital autonomy" and "[tech
sovereignty]{.underline}" [through an array of regulatory and tax
changes]{.underline} aimed at nurturing indigenous tech firms,
developing independent European data pools, and tamping down on large,
innovative foreign firms offering attractive digital services to
European consumers.¶ Artificial Intelligence¶ Following the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) model of being the first mover with
comprehensive regulation, the Commission is taking aggressive aim at
being the preeminent "global standards setter" in AI. **[The
E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion's **[heavy-handed
preliminary proposal for AI regulation diverges sharply from the U.S.
approach.]{.underline}** In its white paper on AI, [the]{.underline}
Commission has [proposed]{.underline} ex ante conformity [assessments to
control access to the EU market for AI applications originating outside
of the EU. That would]{.underline} likely [require a new framework with
criteria, benchmarks, and standards that European authorities will use
to determine if an AI product is "trustworthy, secure and in respect of
European values and rules" before it is allowed entry into the European
market]{.underline}. This approach could include a pre-market review by
EU authorities of algorithms, training data, documentation on
programming, and how the system was built, as well as accuracy tests and
other requirements. ¶ [Also under consideration are data quality and
traceability requirements that would require non-EU firms to train AI
applications]{.underline} on GDPR compliant data, [an extraterritorial
regulation that seemingly would burden U.S. firms with requirements to
completely retrain many proprietary algorithms developed in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates with new data sets as a
condition of market access in the European Union.¶ Unlike its inaction
in the area of federal privacy regulation, which has allowed Europe to
set a de facto global standard, the United States has led an
international, cooperative effort through the G7 to reach common
standards in the challenging area of AI research and development. A
coordinated interagency team in the United States focused on AI
regulation and emerging issues makes transatlantic collaboration is this
new regulatory space a possibility.¶ New Activist Competition Measures¶
In a February 4, 2020, letter to Commission Executive Vice-President
Vestager calling for more activist competition policy, France, Germany,
Poland, and Italy describe their two overarching goals: (1) moderating
competition emanating from "state-backed and subsidized" foreign
competitors (e.g., China); and (2) controlling "emergence of large
players in the digital economy relying on the accumulation of data and
unparalleled network effects resulting in . . . excessive market power."
(e.g., large U.S. and Chinese tech companies.) The four European
governments advocate for policies to tackle the "digital platforms with
paramount importance for competition," saying that these firms should be
subject to "specific scrutiny" in Europe and an enhanced regulatory
framework.¶ [In different EU jurisdictions, competition authorities are
increasingly weaving the precautionary principle into regulation of
tech]{.underline}nology [markets with the idea that new]{.underline} ex
ante [rules should be imposed ahead of any actual
anticompetitive]{.underline} behavioral [violation]{.underline}.
Legislation pending in the German Bundestag is in this vein. For its
part, the French government has put forward a legislative proposal to
regulate "systemic platforms." Under the French plan, competition
regulators would be authorized to surveil and block planned acquisitions
of European tech startups of almost any size.

Finally, on the technical front, [there are numerous challenges to
ensuring]{.underline} that hardware and digital [systems are
interoperable and secure]{.underline}. [Creating and maintaining common
or interoperable information systems]{.underline} and databases [is a
**massive undertaking**]{.underline} considering that [in each country,
the data resides in repositories lacking standardized formatting or
maintained by contractors that keep such information
proprietary]{.underline}, especially for data on sensors and weapon
systems. [Shared information systems and databases are]{.underline} also
particularly [vulnerable to disruption, manipulation, and data
theft]{.underline} in part [because of discrepancies in countries'
network security protocols and capabilities]{.underline}.26 These
problems are hard to resolve in their own right. But the aforementioned
