#### NATO-US security cooperation is a militarized project of racial capitalism. Despite its intentions, the aff merely expands Western imperialism.

**Campbell 19** (Horace, Professor of African American Studies and
Political Science @ Syracuse University, "Global NATO: A 70-Year
Alliance of Oppressors in Crisis", Counter Punch, April 9)

The celebration of [NATO's 70 years of existence provides another
opportunity to unearth the real history of the ideas, practices and
destruction wrought by this military alliance.]{.underline} Even with
[the clear exposure of the cooperation between NATO, the CIA and the
British MI6 to spread terror and psychological warfare in
Europe]{.underline} immediately after the formation of this military
alliance, [the mainstream media, academics and policy makers remain
silent on activities of the 'stay behind armies' and 'false flag'
operations that distorted]{.underline} the real causes of
[insecurity]{.underline} in the world after 1945[.]{.underline} The
evidence of the manipulations of the peoples of the world to ensure the
continued survival of NATO has been well documented in the fraudulent
interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the present multiple
wars against the peoples of Iran.

Vijay Prashad had identified [NATO as the prime defender of the Atlantic
project.]{.underline} This Atlantic project, he noted was, ["a fairly
straightforward campaign by the propertied classes to maintain or
restore their position of dominance."]{.underline} This Atlantic Project
was [anchored in the military alliance called NATO with its principal
work]{.underline}, that of [reversing the South Project; the struggles
for]{.underline} peace bread and [justice by the]{.underline} poorer
[citizens]{.underline} of the planet, especially those [who]{.underline}
had [emerged on the world stage after the decolonization of Africa,
Asia, and the Caribbean.]{.underline}

[The ostensive reason for the founding of NATO was to 'thwart' Soviet
aggression, but in practice the organization was a prop for western
capital]{.underline} and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became [the
core prop for Wall Street.]{.underline} In this year, there will be many
commentaries on the fact that [the existence of NATO reflects a Cold War
relic]{.underline}, that [NATO is obsolete and lost its mandate, but
very few will link the expansion of NATO to the military management of
the international system.]{.underline} Prior to 1991, the planners of
NATO could justify the existence of NATO on ideological and political
grounds, but [with the threat of a multi polar world and the diminution
of the dollar, NATO expanded to the point where this author joined with
others in labelling this organization Global NATO to reflect its current
imperial mandate. The Global thrust of NATO now comprises 29 members
from Europe and North America along with 41 'partners' that]{.underline}
had [started off under]{.underline} the banner of the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council ([NACC]{.underline}) in 1991. Since that time, NATO
has launched a lengthy war without end in Afghanistan, colluded in the
destruction of Iraq and conspired with militarists to forge 'Partnership
for Peace' (with most members of the former Warsaw Pact states). The
core 29 members are now enmeshed with treaties and undertakings from
states involved in the Mediterranean Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. [There are
also the 'partners' from across the globe: Afghanistan, Australia,
Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and
Pakistan. This enlargement served the military purposes of encircling
China and Russia who military planners in the West
targeted.]{.underline}

There is no shortage of literature on NATO and its milestones, but [very
few have documented the real crimes of this global network of
anticommunist operatives who precipitated real terror and psychological
warfare against the citizens of Europe and North America while
supporting mass atrocities from Algeria to Indonesia, and South
Africa.]{.underline} Books such as that of NATO's Secret Armies:
Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by Danielle Ganser and
The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World
War, by Stephen Kinzer used rigorous research techniques to uncover the
dark history of NATO. [These]{.underline} two books [can be
distinguished from the bland international relations texts that
discusses NATO inside the old calculations of 'strategy,' 'concert of
democracies', 'security cooperation' and the balance of power,' and
spheres of influence.]{.underline} Most recently, this IR rendering of
the history of NATO has been served up in a document entitled, NATO at
Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard University with one
of the coauthors being a former US ambassador to NATO. This document
spelt out ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a testimony before Congress,
Nicolas Burns boiled down the challenge of NATO to one objective; that
[the current role of NATO must be to contain Russia and
China.]{.underline}\[2\] On the day before the actual 70^th^
anniversary, on April 3, the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
delivered an address to a joint session of the US Congress advocating an
expansion of the alliance while promoting a military buildup against
Russia. \[3\] European [progressives will have to reflect deeply on
whether the current sanctions regime and the special propose vehicle
called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), is
ushering in another round of inter imperialist rivalry reminiscent of
the currency wars of 1929-1939.]{.underline} Then, [the shifting
alliances yielded confusion among working peoples who]{.underline}
ultimately [went to fight against each other]{.underline} in Europe,
[spreading barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is terminally unsustainable and causes extinction.

**FOSTER 19** -- Professor of Sociology @ the University of Oregon,
Ph.D. in Political Science @ York University, editor of the Monthly
Review, former critical Essay Editor/Archives Editor, Organization &
Environment, editor and author of numerous books and articles about
economics, environment, and capitalism \[John, "Capitalism Has
Failed---What Next?" 2/1/2019,
<https://monthlyreview.org/2019/02/01/capitalism-has-failed-what-next/>,
DKP\]

Less than two decades into the twenty-first century, it is evident that
**[capitalism has failed]{.underline}** as a social system. The world is
mired in [economic stagnation, financialization, and the most extreme
inequality in human history,]{.underline} accompanied by [mass
unemployment and underemployment, precariousness, poverty,
hunger,]{.underline} wasted output and lives, [and]{.underline} what at
this point can only be called [a planetary ecological **"death
spiral."**]{.underline}1 [The digital revolution]{.underline}, the
greatest technological advance of our time, [has rapidly mutated
from]{.underline} a promise of [free communication]{.underline} and
liberated production [into new means of surveillance, control, and
displacement]{.underline} of the working population. The
[institutions]{.underline} of liberal democracy [**are at the point of
collapse**,]{.underline} [while fascism]{.underline}, the rear guard of
the capitalist system[, is again on the march, along with patriarchy,
racism, imperialism, and war.]{.underline} To say that capitalism is a
failed system is not, of course, to suggest that its breakdown and
disintegration is imminent.2 It does, however, mean that it has passed
from being a historically necessary and creative system at its inception
to being a historically unnecessary and destructive one in the present
century. Today, more than ever, [the world is faced with the epochal
choice between "the revolutionary reconstitution of society]{.underline}
at large [and the common ruin of the contending classes."]{.underline}3
[Indications of this failure]{.underline} of capitalism [are everywhere.
Stagnation]{.underline} of investment [punctuated by
bubbles]{.underline} of financial expansion, [which]{.underline} then
[inevitably burst, now characterizes the]{.underline} so-called [free
market]{.underline}.4 [Soaring inequality]{.underline} in income and
wealth [has its counterpart in]{.underline} the [declining material
circumstances]{.underline} of a majority of the population. [Real
wages]{.underline} for most workers in the United States [have barely
budged in forty years]{.underline} despite steadily rising
productivity.5 [Work intensity has increased, while]{.underline} work
and [safety protections]{.underline} on the job [have been]{.underline}
systematically [jettisoned. Unemployment data has become]{.underline}
more and more [meaningless due to]{.underline} a new [institutionalized
underemployment in the form of contract labor]{.underline} in the gig
economy.6 [Unions have been reduced to mere shadows]{.underline} of
their former glory [as capitalism has asserted totalitarian control over
workplaces.]{.underline} With the demise of Soviet-type societies,
[social democracy in Europe has perished]{.underline} in the new
atmosphere of "liberated capitalism."7 [The capture of the surplus value
produced by overexploited populations]{.underline} in the poorest
regions of the world, [via the global labor arbitrage]{.underline}
instituted [by multinational corporations, is leading to]{.underline} an
[unprecedented amassing of financial wealth at the center]{.underline}
of the world economy [and]{.underline} relative [poverty in the
periphery.]{.underline}8 Around \$21 trillion of offshore funds are
currently lodged in tax havens on islands mostly in the Caribbean,
constituting "the fortified refuge of Big Finance."9 Technologically
driven monopolies resulting from the global-communications revolution,
together with the rise to dominance of Wall Street-based financial
capital geared to speculative asset creation, have further contributed
to the riches of today's "1 percent." Forty-two billionaires now enjoy
as much wealth as half the world's population, while [the three
richest]{.underline} men in the United States---Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates,
and Warren Buffett---[have more wealth than half the U.S.
population]{.underline}.10 In [every region of the world, inequality has
increased sharply]{.underline} in recent decades.11 [The
gap]{.underline} in per capita income and wealth [between the richest
and poorest nations]{.underline}, which has been the dominant trend for
centuries, [is rapidly widening]{.underline} once again.12 More than 60
percent of the world's employed population, some **[two billion
people]{.underline}**, [now work in the impoverished informal sector,
forming a massive global proletariat.]{.underline} The global reserve
army of labor is some 70 percent larger than the active labor army of
formally employed workers.13 [Adequate **health care**, **housing**,
**education**, and **clean water** and **air** are increasingly out of
reach]{.underline} for large sections of the population, [even in
wealthy countries]{.underline} in North America and Europe, [while
transportation is becoming more difficult]{.underline} in the United
States and many other countries [due to irrationally high levels of
dependency on the automobile]{.underline} and disinvestment in public
transportation. [Urban structures are more]{.underline} and more
[characterized by **gentrification** and **segregation**]{.underline},
with cities becoming the playthings of the well-to-do while marginalized
populations are shunted aside. [About half a million]{.underline}
people, most of them children, [are homeless on any given night in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.14 New York City is
experiencing a major rat infestation, attributed to warming
temperatures, mirroring trends around the world.15 In the United States
and other high-income countries, life expectancy is in decline, with a
remarkable resurgence of Victorian illnesses related to poverty and
exploitation. In Britain, gout, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and even
scurvy are now resurgent, along with tuberculosis. With inadequate
enforcement of work health and safety regulations, black lung disease
has returned with a vengeance in U.S. coal country.16 [Overuse of
antibiotics]{.underline}, particularly [by capitalist agribusiness, is
leading to]{.underline} an **[antibiotic-resistance
crisis]{.underline}**, with the dangerous growth of
[superbugs]{.underline} generating [increasing]{.underline} numbers of
[deaths]{.underline}, which by mid--century could surpass annual cancer
deaths, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a "global
health emergency."17 These dire conditions, arising from the workings of
the system, are consistent with what Frederick Engels, in the Condition
of the Working Class in England, called "social murder."18 At the
instigation of giant corporations, philanthrocapitalist foundations, and
neoliberal governments, [public education has been restructured around
corporate-designed]{.underline} testing based on the implementation of
[robotic common-core]{.underline} standards. This is [generating massive
databases on the student population]{.underline}, much of which are [now
being]{.underline} surreptitiously [marketed and sold.]{.underline}19
The corporatization and privatization of education is feeding the
progressive subordination of children's needs to the cash nexus of the
commodity market. We are thus seeing a dramatic return of Thomas
Gradgrind's and Mr. M'Choakumchild's crass utilitarian philosophy
dramatized in Charles Dickens's Hard Times: "Facts are alone wanted in
life" and "You are never to fancy."20 [Having been reduced to
**intellectual dungeons**]{.underline}, [many of the
poorest]{.underline}, most [racially segregated schools]{.underline} in
the United States [are mere **pipelines for prisons or the
military.**]{.underline}21 [More than two million people in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are behind bars]{.underline},
a higher rate of incarceration than any other country in the world,
**[constituting a new Jim Crow.]{.underline}** The total population in
prison is nearly equal to the number of people in Houston, Texas, the
fourth largest U.S. city. [African Americans and Latinos make up 56
percent]{.underline} of those [incarcerated]{.underline}, while
constituting only about 32 percent of the U.S. population. Nearly 50
percent of American adults, and a much higher percentage among African
Americans and Native Americans, have an immediate family member who has
spent or is currently spending time behind bars. Both [black men and
Native American men]{.underline} in the United States [are]{.underline}
nearly [three times,]{.underline} Hispanic men nearly two times, [more
likely to die of police shootings]{.underline} than white men.22 [Racial
divides are now widening across the entire planet. Violence against
women and]{.underline} the [expropriation of their unpaid
labor]{.underline}, as well as the higher level of exploitation of their
paid labor, [are integral to the way in which power is organized in
capitalist society]{.underline}---and how it seeks to divide rather than
unify the population. [More than a third of women]{.underline} worldwide
[have experienced physical/sexual violence. Women's bodies]{.underline},
in particular, [are objectified, reified, and commodified as part of the
normal workings of monopoly-capitalist marketing.]{.underline}23 [The
mass media-propaganda system]{.underline}, part of the larger corporate
matrix, [is now merging into]{.underline} a [social
media]{.underline}-based propaganda system [that is]{.underline} more
porous and seemingly anarchic, but [more universal and more than ever
favoring money and power. Utilizing modern marketing and
surveillance]{.underline} techniques, which now dominate all digital
interactions, [vested interests are able to tailor their
messages]{.underline}, largely unchecked, [to individuals
and]{.underline} their social [networks, creating]{.underline} concerns
about ["fake news"]{.underline} on all sides.24 Numerous [business
entities promising tech]{.underline}nological [manipulation of
voters]{.underline} in countries [across the world have now
surfaced]{.underline}, auctioning off their services to the highest
bidders.25 [The elimination of net neutrality]{.underline} in the United
States [means further concentration, centralization, and
control]{.underline} over the entire Internet by monopolistic service
providers. [Elections are increasingly prey to unregulated "dark
money"]{.underline} emanating [from the]{.underline} coffers of
corporations and the [billionaire class.]{.underline} Although
presenting itself as the world's leading democracy, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, as Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy
stated in Monopoly Capital in 1966, "is democratic in form and
plutocratic in content."26 In the Trump administration, following a
long-established tradition, 72 percent of those appointed to the cabinet
have come from the higher corporate echelons, while others have been
drawn from the military.[27 War, engineered by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and other major powers at the apex of the system,
has become perpetual in strategic oil regions such as the Middle East,
and threatens to escalate into a global **thermonuclear
exchange**.]{.underline} During the Obama administration, the United
States was engaged in wars/bombings in seven different
countries---Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and
Pakistan.28 Torture and assassinations have been reinstituted by
Washington as acceptable instruments of war against those now
innumerable individuals, group networks, and whole societies that are
branded as terrorist. A new Cold War and nuclear arms race is in the
making between the United States and Russia, while Washington is seeking
to place road blocks to the continued rise of China. [The Trump
administration has created a new space force as a separate branch of the
military in an attempt to ensure U.S. dominance in the militarization of
space. Sounding the alarm on the increasing dangers of a nuclear war and
of climate destabilization, the distinguished Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists moved its doomsday clock in 2018 to two minutes to midnight,
the closest since 1953]{.underline}, when it marked the advent of
thermonuclear weapons.29 Increasingly severe economic sanctions are
being imposed by the United States on countries like Venezuela and
Nicaragua, despite their democratic elections---or because of them.
[**Trade and currency wars** are **being** actively
**promoted**]{.underline} by core states, while racist barriers against
immigration continue to be erected in Europe and the United States as
some 60 million refugees and internally displaced peoples flee
devastated environments. Migrant populations worldwide have risen to 250
million, with those residing in high-income countries constituting more
than 14 percent of the populations of those countries, up from less than
10 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, ruling circles and wealthy countries seek
to wall off islands of power and privilege from the mass of humanity,
who are to be left to their fate.30 More than three-quarters of a
billion people, [over 10 percent of the world]{.underline} population,
[are]{.underline} chronically [malnourished]{.underline}.31 [Food stress
in the United States keeps climbing, leading to the rapid growth of
cheap dollar stores selling poor quality and toxic food. Around forty
million Americans, representing one out of eight households, including
nearly thirteen million children, are food insecure.32 Subsistence
farmers are being pushed off their lands by agribusiness, private
capital, and sovereign wealth funds in a global depeasantization process
that constitutes the greatest movement of people in
history.33]{.underline} Urban overcrowding and poverty across much of
the globe is so severe that one can now reasonably refer to a "planet of
slums."34 Meanwhile, the world housing market is estimated to be worth
up to \$163 trillion (as compared to the value of gold mined over all
recorded history, estimated at \$7.5 trillion).35 The Anthropocene
epoch, first ushered in by the Great Acceleration of the world economy
immediately after the Second World War, has generated enormous rifts in
planetary boundaries, extending from **[climate change]{.underline}** to
**[ocean acidification]{.underline}**, to the sixth extinction, to
[disruption of]{.underline} the [global nitrogen and
phosphorus]{.underline} cycles, to the [loss of freshwater]{.underline},
to the [disappearance of forests]{.underline}, to [widespread
toxic-chemical and radioactive pollution]{.underline}.36 It is now
estimated that [**60 percent of** the world's **wildlife**]{.underline}
[vertebrate population]{.underline} (including mammals, reptiles,
amphibians, birds, and fish) **[have been wiped out]{.underline}** since
1970, [while]{.underline} the worldwide [abundance of invertebrates has
declined by 45 percent]{.underline} in recent decades.37 What
climatologist James Hansen calls the ["species exterminations" resulting
from accelerating climate change]{.underline} and rapidly shifting
climate zones [are only compounding this general process of biodiversity
loss.]{.underline} Biologists expect that [half of all species will be
facing extinction by the end of the century.]{.underline}38 [If present
climate-change trends continue]{.underline}, the "global carbon budget"
associated with a [2°C]{.underline} increase in average global
temperature [will be broken in sixteen years]{.underline} (while a 1.5°C
increase in global average temperature---staying beneath which is the
key to long-term stabilization of the climate---will be reached in a
decade). Earth System scientists warn that [the world is now perilously
close to a **Hothouse Earth**]{.underline}, in which **[catastrophic
climate change will be locked in and irreversible]{.underline}**.39
[The]{.underline} ecological, social, and economic [costs to humanity of
continuing]{.underline} to increase carbon [emissions]{.underline} by
2.0 percent a year as in recent decades (rising in 2018 by 2.7
percent---3.4 percent in the United States), and failing to meet the
minimal 3.0 percent annual reductions in emissions currently needed to
avoid a catastrophic destabilization of the earth's energy balance, [are
simply incalculable.]{.underline}40 Nevertheless, [major energy
corporations continue to lie about climate change]{.underline},
promoting and **[bankrolling climate denialism]{.underline}**---while
admitting the truth in their internal documents. These [corporations are
working to accelerate the extraction and production of fossil
fuels]{.underline}, including the dirtiest, most greenhouse
gas-generating varieties, reaping enormous profits in the process. [The
melting of the Arctic]{.underline} ice from global warming [is seen by
capital as a new El Dorado, opening up massive]{.underline} additional
oil and gas [reserves to be exploited]{.underline} without regard to the
consequences for the earth's climate. In response to scientific reports
on climate change, [Exxon]{.underline} Mobil declared that it [intends
to extract and sell all]{.underline} of the fossil-fuel [reserves at its
disposal.]{.underline}41 Energy corporations continue to intervene in
climate negotiations to ensure that any agreements to limit carbon
emissions are defanged. Capitalist countries across the board are
putting the accumulation of wealth for a few above combatting climate
destabilization, threatening the very future of humanity. [Capitalism
is]{.underline} best understood as [a]{.underline} competitive
class-based [mode of production and exchange geared to the accumulation
of capital through the exploitation of workers]{.underline}' labor power
and the private appropriation of surplus value (value generated beyond
the costs of the workers' own reproduction). The mode of economic
accounting intrinsic to capitalism designates as a value-generating good
or service anything that passes through the market and therefore
produces income. It follows that the greater part of the social and
environmental costs of production outside the market are excluded in
this form of valuation and are treated as mere negative "externalities,"
unrelated to the capitalist economy itself---whether in terms of the
shortening and degradation of human life or the destruction of the
natural environment. As environmental economist K. William Kapp stated,
"capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs."42 [We have
now reached a point]{.underline} in the twenty-first century [in which
the externalities of this irrational system, such as]{.underline} the
costs of [war]{.underline}, the [depletion of]{.underline} natural
[resources,]{.underline} the waste of human lives, [and the]{.underline}
disruption of the planetary [environment, now far exceed any future
economic benefits]{.underline} that capitalism offers to society as a
whole. [The accumulation of capital]{.underline} and the amassing of
wealth [are increasingly occurring at the expense of an irrevocable rift
in the social and environmental conditions governing human life on
earth.]{.underline}43

#### The alternative is to [reject the plan]{.underline} in favor of commitment to [organizing]{.underline} anti-capitalist [international revolution]{.underline}.

**Tavan \'21** \[Luca; 3/7/21; writer for Red Flag; \"Worldwide
revolution is possible and necessary,\"
<https://redflag.org.au/article/worldwide-revolution-possible-and-necessary/>\]

From the moment [Marx and Engels urged **workers of the world** to
**unite** at the climax of the Communist Manifesto, the
goal]{.underline} of **[international revolution]{.underline}** has been
at the core of Marxist politics.

[International revolution isn't just a romantic dream, but an **urgent
necessity**. It's the **only means** by which **capitalism** can be
**permanently uprooted** and **replaced** with socialism. This is
because capitalism, unlike previous class societies, is a **globally
integrated** system]{.underline}. "For the first time in history", wrote
British Marxist Colin Barker of this phenomenon, "capitalism has created
a genuinely world society, where all our lives are entwined together in
a common history and a common fate".

[Capitalism has linked every nation in a **global chain of
production**]{.underline}. Take your mobile phone for example. It was
likely assembled in China, using computer chips manufactured in Taiwan,
powered by coal exported from Australia and produced with minerals mined
in the Democratic Republic of Congo according to specifications
developed in Europe or the United States. [No single country produces
all the things necessary to satisfy its population's needs, unlike the
various forms of society that came before capitalism]{.underline}, which
were mostly self-sufficient and organised around small local economies.

[Capitalism was established as a **world system** through immense
**robbery** and **violence**---from the international **slave
trade**]{.underline}, which fuelled the Industrial Revolution,
[to]{.underline} the [murderous **colonisation**]{.underline} of what is
now Australia. [That same violence is today used by **states** to
**defend** their **imperialist interests**, and discipline any
movements]{.underline} that get in their way. Movements that aspire to
national independence or that back left-wing reformist governments have
been demolished with the aid of the great capitalist powers countless
times in the past century, from the overthrow of the Allende government
in Chile in 1973 to the 2019 Bolivian coup.

Revolutionary movements that attempt to overturn the entire capitalist
system face a much more severe response. This was confirmed by the
defeat of the Russian Revolution. In 1917 workers, radicalised by years
of war and economic crisis, overthrew the tsarist regime and eventually
took power into their own hands. In response, the capitalist powers of
the world united to crush the workers' state, in alliance with
reactionaries who wanted to restore the tsarist regime. [Unless
revolutions can spread internationally and challenge the imperialist
powers that have an interest in destroying them, they will be
crushed.]{.underline}

A heroic effort by Russian workers and peasants fought off 16 foreign
invading armies, but at a great cost. The working class was decimated,
the factories were depopulated, and the radical working-class democracy
that had been built withered. The [isolation and poverty imposed on
Russia made building socialism an impossibility, and a new Stalinist
regime emerged]{.underline} that reversed most of the gains of the
revolution.

[Because Russian revolutionary socialists]{.underline} who pinned their
hopes on spreading revolution across the globe [were ultimately
defeated, their example is used by defenders of capitalism as a
**cautionary tale**]{.underline} today: [that a **worldwide revolution**
against the system is an **impossible dream**]{.underline}.

[But capitalism's **global nature** means that **revolts tend to
spread** across **national borders**. Workers today **share**
increasingly **similar experiences**: conditions of **work**, forms of
**consumption**, **lifestyles** and political **cultures**. And the
**global integration** of production serves to **transmit struggle**
from one country to another]{.underline}. In 1974, for instance,
[resistance to the brutal military dictatorship in Chile spread to East
Kilbride, Scotland, of all places]{.underline}. Workers at the Rolls
Royce factory there learned that the engines they were repairing were
being used by the Chilean air force to drop bombs on workers resisting
the coup. They downed tools and refused to work on the engines, keeping
them out of the hands of the military junta for four years.

[While nationalism still has a powerful hold]{.underline} on the
consciousness of many, [it's increasingly clear that the real **line of
polarisation** across the **globe** is between the **minority ruling
class** and the **majority working class**. And when **revolts** break
out in one part of the world, people can **identify with the causes and
motivations** of their struggles, and **draw comparisons** with their
own situation]{.underline}. "Languages remain different," observed UK
Marxist Chris Harman in 1992, "but [what they say is increasingly the
same]{.underline}". Harman's words ring true in every wave of political
radicalisation.

[1968 is remembered as a year of **global revolt**, when **millions** of
**workers**, **students** and **oppressed** people drew inspiration from
each other's movements. Activists in the **US**]{.underline} were
[radicalised by the heroic resistance of the **Vietnamese**
people]{.underline} to American imperialism. [**Irish** civil rights
activists emulated the militant politics of the Black
Panthers]{.underline}. When [students and workers united to launch a
massive general strike in **France**]{.underline} in May, [it taught
student radicals in **Australia** that they needed to link
up]{.underline} with the power of the organised working class in order
to win.

[The movements of 1968 **united people** across superficially very
**different societies**]{.underline}. For decades, Cold War common sense
had dictated that the greatest divide on the planet was between Western
liberal capitalism and Stalinist "Communism". But [in 1968, both sides
of the iron curtain **exploded in revolt**. The **triggers** for the
struggles may have been **different**, but they were all **responses**
to **similar** issues: **inequality**, **exploitation** and **war**,
imposed by monstrous **bureaucratic states**]{.underline}.

[In 2011, a]{.underline} poor [Tunisian street vendor set himself
alight]{.underline} to protest against police harassment. [Within days,
his act had inspired anti-government protests across the
country]{.underline}. Within weeks, the [protests escalated into a
**regional revolt** that challenged regimes across the **Arab world**.
One small act **tapped into resentment** against **inequality**,
**unemployment** and **state violence** that engulfed an entire region.
The **radical wave** spread even further: at a massive
demonstration]{.underline} against an anti-union bill [in the US city of
Madison, Wisconsin]{.underline}, a man held up a poster with a picture
of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak beside Republican Governor Scott
Walker. The caption read: "One dictator down. One to go". [The Arab
revolutions went on to **inspire** the **Occupy** movement, which spread
to more than 80 countries]{.underline}.

[Today, more than ever, **insurgent social movements** and working-class
**uprisings** are **spurring action** in other parts of the
world]{.underline}---from Hong Kong to Chile, from Lebanon to France.
One placard at a memorial for protesters murdered while resisting the
military coup in Myanmar took up Marx's incitement: "Workers of the
world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains".

[While the Russian Revolution is cynically held up by capitalist
ideologists]{.underline} as the ultimate argument against international
revolution, [it actually **proves the opposite**. It shows that the goal
is not only **necessary**, but also that it's **possible**. The news of
**workers seizing power** in Russia]{.underline}, overthrowing their
capitalist government [and declaring]{.underline} their [withdrawal from
WWI, created shock waves across the planet. Workers in **Germany** rose
in revolt a year later]{.underline}, ending the war for good and
building soviets, a form of radical working-class democracy inspired by
the Russian example. [This was followed by **uprisings** in **France**,
**Italy** and **Hungary**]{.underline}.

[The **revolutionary wave** spread further.]{.underline} A [classified
British government report]{.underline} from 1919 [noted a "very
**widespread feeling** among workers that thrones have become
anachronisms, and that the Soviet may be the **best form** of Government
for a democracy".]{.underline}

The rising tide of radicalism had an impact in Australia too.
Meatworkers in the Queensland city of Townsville donned red jumpers,
stormed the local police station to free jailed unionists, and placed
the city under workers' control. The editor of the conservative
Townsville Daily Bulletin lamented: "Townsville for the last year or so
has been developing Bolshevism \... the mob management of affairs in
this city, differs very little, from the Petrograd and Moscow brand".

[The Russian Bolsheviks]{.underline}, the revolutionary working-class
party that led the revolution to victory in 1917, [didn't just passively
wait for revolutions elsewhere. They **actively organised to spread the
revolt**]{.underline}. In 1919, [they established the **Communist
International**, an organisation for **debate**, **discussion** and
**coordination** between different revolutionary workers'
parties.]{.underline} Revolutionaries in Russia, Italy, France, Germany,
the US, Australia and elsewhere attempted [to clarify and develop a
strategy for **overthrowing capitalism**]{.underline} everywhere. In
none of these countries was there a party like the Bolsheviks, steeled
in years of organising working-class struggle to overthrow the state,
and capable of leading a revolution. But [for a number of years,
**workers came close** to overthrowing capitalism]{.underline} in
several countries.

[In periods of stability, when social conservatism dominates,
international revolution can **seem like a pipe dream**. Defenders of
the status quo **actively work** to **reinforce this illusion**. But
**history** proves that the **crises** that the **system generates** are
**international**, and that they will inevitably **provoke international
resistance**]{.underline}.

[Capitalism is a global system. It requires a global movement to tear it
up, root and branch. But it also makes global revolution more possible,
and more likely. The most important thing that socialists can do,
whether you live in Hong Kong or France, Myanmar or Australia, is to get
stuck into organising for it today.]{.underline}

### NATO -- Generic -- Link

#### NATO serves an integral part of the war machine's command structure, expanding neoliberal violence across the globe.

Political Science @ Syracuse University, "Global NATO: A 70-Year
Alliance of Oppressors in Crisis", Counter Punch, April 9)

[The continued struggles for]{.underline} bread, peace and [justice
ensure that it is only the authoritarian leaders from the Global
South]{.underline} who [are compromised on the real meaning
of]{.underline} the existence of [NATO. In the present era, there is a
new capitalist competition while]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty
Organization [(NATO) serves as an integral part of the Pentagon's world
command structure.]{.underline} Recent experiences have demonstrated in
[Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that the moguls of Wall Street are willing
to wage as many wars, to destroy as many countries and to kill as many
people as necessary to achieve the dominance of US
capitalism.]{.underline} The destruction of [Libya was a classic example
of the convergence of finance as warfare]{.underline}, the weaponization
of information and incessant bombing to destroy a society. Where at the
start of NATO the war scare was the propaganda method, In the current
digital age, [brain hacking and the engineering of smart phones have
placed the giant technology firms of Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
Facebook at the forefront of the new weapons platform of NATO and Wall
Street.]{.underline} This analysis is in three parts spelling out the
rationale for the call for all progressive forces to join together to
concentrate their energies in the dismantling of NATO.

NATO at Birth: Stay behind armies, directed terrorist organizations and
psychological warfare against Europeans.

In the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall there were major press
reports on the role of NATO's stay behind armies that had been operating
inside Western Europe since 1949. Ten years earlier, when the kidnapping
and killing of the former Italian Prime Minister, Aldo Moro rocked
western Europe, it emerged that his demise had been authored
byclandestine paramilitary network code-named "Operation Gladio" that
was a false flag operation of NATO. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had
meticulously documented how [NATO funded and]{.underline} often even
[directed terrorist organizations throughout Europe in what was termed a
"strategy of tension" with the aim of preventing a rise of the left in
Western European politics. NATO's "secret armies" engaged in subversive
and criminal activities]{.underline} in several countries.

In the specific case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the unforgivable
crime of contemplating a government that included Italians who belonged
to the Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the Cold war, the
CIA and MI6 had worked closely with former fascists to oppose citizens
and organizations in Western Europe that were anti-capitalists. [Under
the leadership of US planners]{.underline} such as Allen Dulles, William
Colby, Frank Wisner and later James Angleton, these [operatives weaned
and nursed a network of agents and secret arms dumps across Europe, a
network that would remain secret but active throughout the Cold
War.]{.underline} \[4\] Ganser elaborated on the extensive operations of
Operation Gladio all across Europe with [the explicit aim of subverting
the democratic wishes of European citizens who were opposed to
oppression.]{.underline} It is worth quoting at length the role of the
secret armies.

["NATO's "secret armies" engaged in subversive and criminal activities
in several countries. In Turkey]{.underline} in 1960, the stay behind
army, working with the army, staged a coup d'état and killed Prime
Minister Adnan Menderes; in [Algeria]{.underline} in 1961, the French
stay-behind army staged a coup with the CIA against the French
government of Algiers, which ultimately failed; in 1967, the Greek
stay-behind army staged a coup and imposed a military dictatorship; in
1971 in Turkey, after a military coup, the stay-behind army engaged in
"domestic terror" and killed hundreds; in 1977 in [Spain]{.underline},
the stay behind army carried out a massacre in Madrid; in 1980 in
[Turkey]{.underline}, the head of the stay behind army staged a coup and
took power; in 1985 in [Belgium]{.underline}, the stay behind attacked
and shot shoppers randomly in supermarkets, killing 28; in
[Switzerland]{.underline} in 1990, the former head of the Swiss stay
behind wrote the US Defense Department he would reveal "the whole
truth," and was found the next day stabbed to death with his own
bayonet; and in 1995, [England]{.underline} revealed that the MI6 and
SAS helped set up stay behind armies across Western Europe."\[5\]

[The mainstream media and University commentaries have not been able to
confront this history in so far as the manipulation and deception that
gave rise to the birth of NATO is still at work against the citizens of
Europe and the United States.]{.underline}

#### NATO-US Cooperation is grounded in colonialism and imperialism for Western Economic gain. Reject the aff's intensification of violence on the periphery.

**Campbell 19** (Horace, Professor of African American Studies and
Political Science @ Syracuse University, "Global NATO: A 70-Year
Alliance of Oppressors in Crisis", Counter Punch, April 9)

In the celebratory events to memorialize the founding of NATO in 1949,
it is usually forgotten that when the North American Treaty was signed
in April 1949 [most of the founding members were colonial overlords.
Colonialism and imperialism took a new form under the leadership of US
capitalists defending the dollar and Wall Street.]{.underline} At that
historical moment in 1949, [the justification for starting this
organization was that it constituted a system of collective defense
whereby its member states agreed to mutual defense in response to an
attack by any external party.]{.underline} The external party in
question at that time was the USSR; [insofar as NATO had been formed as
an alliance ostensibly to defend Western Europe against 'communist
expansion'.]{.underline} In the Treaty's renowned Article 5, the new
Allies agreed "an armed attack against one or more of them... shall be
considered an attack against them all."

[The US military and industrial leaders studied the terror and
propaganda tactics of the Nazis in order to learn the lessons of how to
develop an efficient military machine.]{.underline} James Whitman in the
book, Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi
Race Law, outlined what [the fascists had learnt from the eugenics
movement in the United States.]{.underline} \[10\] Although many
anti-fascist scientists from Germany had found a place in the US
academy, [the top planners of the Cold War linked the US primacy to the
global history of racism to the efficient, bureaucratic and
professionalism of conservative Germany.]{.underline}

[One of the unspoken aspects of the first years of NATO was the question
of containing the possible revolutionary impulses of the]{.underline}
German [working peoples.]{.underline} To forestall such a possibility,
[the thinkers and planners of NATO collaborated with the former fascists
to learn their skills.]{.underline} The details of this alliance have
been spelt out in the book on the CIA by David Talbot in the book, The
Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's
Secret Government. The merging of fascist ideas with the ideas of Jim
Crow in the United States were refined in the secret operation called,
Operation Paperclip. Anne Jacobsen, Operation Paperclip: The Secret
Intelligence Program to Bring Nazi Scientists to America, \[11\]
elaborated in great detail the secret program of the Joint Intelligence
Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely carried out by Special Agents of Army
Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), in which more than 1,600 German
scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and
his V-2 rocket team, were taken from Germany to America for U.S.
government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959. Many were former
members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party. These elements
were the foundation of a military program that has brought us the
weaponization of space.

[The creators of NATO simultaneously mobilized the colonial and fascist
elements in Belgium, Spain, Italy and France.]{.underline} Of the twelve
founding members, [six were outright colonial powers]{.underline} and at
that moment, countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain
and Portugal [looked to the USA to support their plunder of colonial
societies.]{.underline} In the specific case of France, in order to
assist French colonialism, Algeria was named as a territory of NATO.
Sixty years later when the President of France, Macron, apologized for
the crimes of killing more than one million Algerians, there is no
reflection inside western academic institutions on this role of NATO in
Africa. Currently, the French have been the most aggressive in promoting
the fiction that the defense radius of Europe stretches 4000 kilometers
out from Brussels, up to the arctic, well across the Russian frontier
and down into central Africa.

It is not widely known that, initially, the Portuguese fascists were
some of the principal beneficiaries of the membership of NATO, with
major deployment of nuclear weapons in the Azores as reward for the NATO
support for colonialism in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and other
Portuguese outposts of colonial domination. Prior to the formation of
NATO in 1949, the 1947 document of the State Department on Cooperative
Development of Africa had stipulated that colonialism would assist the
recovery of European capitalism. \[12\]The State Department had been
explicit in outlining how cheap foodstuffs and raw materials from Africa
would assist Europe's recovery and create the basis for unity and
economic regeneration.

[The USA set about creating a number of international institutions to
guarantee the survival of Europe and of capitalism, the IMF,
IBRD]{.underline} (World Bank), the [NATO, GATT, to guarantee the
strength of the USA in international trade and finance.]{.underline}

### Artificial Intelligence -- Link

#### Capitalism provides the incentive for AI development.

Dyer-Witheford," *Los Angelos Review of Books*, 3-11-20,
<https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-rise-of-ai-capitalism-an-interview-with-nick-dyer-witheford/>,
Accessed 3-27-21)

BRIAN JUSTIE: Inhuman Power bills itself as both "a Marxist critique of
AI" and "an AI-informed critique of Marxism." What makes the current
moment so ripe for a dual framework of this nature? NICK DYER-WITHEFORD:
[The moment is ripe because of the surging corporate interest in and
applications of machine learning and other new branches of AI
research]{.underline}. [Major info-tech companies have come to see the
cognitive and biological limits of the human as a barrier to
accumulation, and glimpse the possibilities of smashing through that
obstacle with machine learning, advanced robotics, and other "fourth
industrial revolution" technologies]{.underline}. AI today is still in a
rudimentary phase, limited to narrow, domain-specific applications, very
far from the human-equivalent or human-exceeding general AI that remains
the stuff of sci-fi imaginaries, although it is also the target of some
serious research programs. Nevertheless, in this restricted form [AI
permeates everyday life, in the Global Northwest, in China, and to some
degree globally]{.underline}: its [algorithms organize social media
feeds, financial activities, virtual games, workplace monitoring,
welfare systems, and police surveillance. We are now in]{.underline}
what I and my co-authors, Atle Mikkola Kjøsen and James Steinhoff, term
"**[actually-existing AI capitalism."]{.underline}** Its technologies
will likely continue to encroach on what we have thought of as
exclusively human capacities, and be applied across a steadily
broadening spectrum of activities. As James Steinhoff speculates, [AI
may]{.underline} well [become]{.underline} what Marx termed [a "general
condition of production," a prerequisite infrastructure for commercial
activity]{.underline}, as steam engines and railways were in the 19th
century, and electricity and mass transportation for the 20th. [This
process is unfolding]{.underline} almost entirely [under the direction
of **giant oligopolistic corporations**]{.underline} --- Go[ogle,
Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu]{.underline}
--- with help thrown in by governments eager for AI's national security
state applications. Marx would have understood this very well. So we
need a Marxist critique of AI, as what is probably [the prime
contemporary example of profit-driven and revolt-suppressing
appropriation and direction of techno-scientific knowledge]{.underline}.
But this process is also throwing into doubt the humanist assumptions
built into Marx's concept of labor: so we also need to critique Marxism
from the viewpoint of AI. Marx's latent humanism is one of the main
targets you and your co-authors take aim at in the latter half of the
book. Can you elaborate a bit more on this? For [Marx]{.underline}, the
pinnacle of capitalist machinery was of course the steam-driven factory
of his age, a techno-apparatus that still employed and exploited workers
on a mass basis. So he [could continue to think of the machine as a
supplement to and by-product of human effort --- "dead labor" that
derives from, and has to be animated by, "living labor]{.underline}." He
had one or two prophetic flashes about the marginalization of workers
that extreme automation might ultimately enable, moments in his work
that remain controversial within the Marxist tradition. [But Marx never
encountered even an early mechanical computer, let alone an AI. What AI
research puts on the event horizon now, however, is the possibility that
the machinic "supplement" to labor becomes the main game: that **the
border Marx conceived** between what is living and what is dead
collapses.]{.underline} The fraught distinction between the "living" and
the "dead," between the human and the inhuman, looms large in this book.
But [this prospect of destabilization might be read as the bellwether of
dystopian peril or as the realization of a certain utopian promise. To
that end, why do you think a growing coterie of Silicon Valley
power-players have lately coalesced around the nebulous idea of "humane
technology"? Humanism, as others have pointed out, is once again en
vogue!]{.underline} The impulse to create digital technologies that
support human flourishing has always been important; for example, it is
present at the origin of the internet, in hackers' jail-break of the
network of networks from Pentagon control. And this sort of emancipatory
hope reappears perennially. But the inhuman power that thwarts it is the
market[. That was what Marx was referring to when he wrote the line from
which our book takes its title: "\[I\]n the end, an inhuman power rules
over everything."]{.underline} What we are pointing to is the way
capital directs and designs technologies as an extension of market
power, as instruments not of human development but of profit
accumulation. [With the arrival of AI, these instruments now seem to
take on a life of their own, **rendering capital increasingly autonomous
from the human.**]{.underline} In the 1990s, the days of the early
popularization of the internet, when I started writing about digital
technologies, and before the business world had worked out how to
assimilate them, there was a cultural and political effervescent
excitement about the potential of creative commons, open source
software, and decentralized collaborative global communication:
"dot.com" ambitions and "dot.communist" aspirations expanded side by
side. But [by the mid-2000s, in the wake of the dot.com crash, capital
really got down to incorporating digital tech, developing the model of
what Nick Srnicek calls "platform capitalism," based on big data
collection, precision-targeted advertising, and monetization of
user-generated content --- all managed by algorithmic processes that are
now being intensified by machine learning --- in effect, narrow forms of
AI.]{.underline} What do we have now[? A system to accelerate the
advertising and sale of commodities, which combines mass surveillance
with the targeted dissemination of attention-grabbing content,
regardless of the toxic social and ecological consequences, run by giant
corporations, with collateral damage-control handed off to legions of
precarious, low-paid, and traumatized click-workers]{.underline}. And
[it is the oligopolists]{.underline} who constructed this apparatus ---
Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and their counterparts in China,
Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent --- [that are]{.underline}, with subsidization
from their respective national security states, [directing the
development of machine learning and other AI technologies, while
proceeding to bake their commercial priorities, and those of their
military and paramilitary partners, **into its very
design**]{.underline}. Today, revived hopes for emancipatory
digitization are mostly futile, unless we are also willing to think
about dismantling and expropriating the current AI-industrial complex:
so the expression of such hopes by Silicon Valley "power players" deeply
embedded in that complex is, at best, disingenuous ... I want to home in
on this invocation of the "current AI-industrial complex," or what you
previously alluded to as "actually-existing AI-capitalism," a key
concept in the book. [The implication seems to be that this burgeoning
strand of AI-capitalism must necessarily be understood as something
different from its predecessors by a matter of kind, and not just a
matter of degree]{.underline}. This brings to mind Shoshana Zuboff's
recent tome The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. Some critics of her book
have argued, I think rightfully, that surveillance and capitalism are
old friends, and so the grand assertion of a new paradigm is overblown
and perhaps even obfuscatory. [Does capitalism bearing the "AI-" prefix
constitute a new paradigm?]{.underline} I will answer at two levels. The
first is simple: [there's a wide acceptance of the idea that while
capitalism has a persistent logic --- the commodification of everything
--- it also periodically changes the way that logic is worked through,
in terms of the orchestration of dominant technologies, work
organization, consumption practices, and so on]{.underline}. So, for
example, mid-20th-century Fordism, organized around the assembly line,
mass work, and mass consumption, had by the millennium had morphed into
a post-Fordism of digital technology, so-called flexibilized labor and
niche marketing. In Inhuman Power, we suggest that [AI could be an
important element in another of these metamorphoses, or, as David Harvey
puts it "sea changes," in how capital operates]{.underline}. So here our
proposition is an extension and extrapolation from other periodizations
of capital. However --- second level --- in postulating an
"[AI-capitalism]{.underline}," we are [suggesting a transformation that
may pose some very deep problems, possibly for capital itself, and if
not, certainly for its human subjects]{.underline}, and also, as a small
piece of collateral damage, for Marxist theory. This of course has to do
with the status of labor in an era of machine intelligence. [A few years
ago there was widespread alarm about a "robopocalypse,"]{.underline} an
abrupt, induced crisis of technological unemployment. These fears of a
sudden onset "end of work" are today contradicted, at least in North
America, by the post-Recession return to reasonably robust employment
levels --- however dubious the wages and conditions of that employment.
But [longer term, there are real prospects that AI adoption will in more
gradual, oblique ways attenuate and hollow out the wage labor
relation.]{.underline} We see it as a slow tsunami[. Waves of sectoral
technological unemployment, ratcheting in sync with business cycles and
financial crises, will be a part of this, as will various intermediate
phases of job replacement, in which truck drivers ride shotgun on
convoys of automated vehicles, or diminishing call center staff fill the
gaps in banks of algorithmic answering services.]{.underline} But this
is not the whole story. As Jason Smith says, under capitalism people
must sell their labor power to avoid total immiseration, so even as
automation advances they seek employment and find exploitation, or
self-employment and self-exploitation, in increasingly baroque forms of
service work. But [labor in AI-capitalism will likely be recurrently
contingent, deskilled and disposable]{.underline}, controlled by
programs opaque and, at a certain level, incomprehensible even by their
developers; [its human elements will be **increasingly peripheral** to
both production and profit]{.underline}. [The issue is perhaps not so
much joblessness as powerlessness; a labor force without force, as
capital gradually autonomizes itself from the human]{.underline}. In
that sense, [AI-capitalism might be a period not so much like Fordism or
post-Fordism, but more like the **process of primitive accumulation** in
which capital drove populations off the land into factory
work]{.underline} --- except in reverse. It would be the beginning of a
period of futuristic accumulation, in which [capital, rather than
accumulating its proletarian workforce, gradually, over centuries,
marginalizes and then discards it.]{.underline}

### Bio-Technology -- Link

#### Bio-Tech fails under capitalism's technocapitalist optimism. Obsession with profitability makes critical research ineffective.

**Schmachtenberger 21** (Daniel, Founding member of The Consilience
Project aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue, "The Case
Against Naive Technocapitalist Optimism", The Consilience Project,
August 1,
<https://consilienceproject.org/the-case-against-naive-technocapitalist-optimism/>)

**[Technocapitalism exists as a highly competitive marketplace of
intangibles.]{.underline}**

**[These]{.underline}** intangibles **[include intellectual property
such as software products, or access to proprietary
"platforms"]{.underline}** like Amazon Marketplace or app stores.
Technocapitalist products may be defined typically as "disruptive
innovations," in the words of Clayton Christensen: they are ideas that
begin as inferior alternatives to existing offerings, and enter play
either at the foot of the market or in a new market altogether. The
underlying technology is significant because it can provide
cost-effective, novel competition to ideas that are already in
production.\[26\] **[Research-intensive industries, such as computing
and biotechnology, are at the forefront of these efforts. With public
funding for scientific research on a steady decline since the latter
half of the 20th century, private funding is increasingly
needed]{.underline}** for viability.\[27\] In this environment,
**[research must consistently prove its value to funders in order to
persist.]{.underline}** A well-known example of this, extrapolated from
data gathered in the 1990s, is that **[over 75% of all medical research
is privately funded.]{.underline}** As a result, **[rare disease
research relies disproportionately on private
funding.\[]{.underline}**28\] This effect is mirrored in other fields,
and has increased in proportion: between 2012 and 2016,
**[academic-industry collaborations more than doubled
globally.\[]{.underline}**29\] **[The pharmaceutical industry is
notoriously fickle about what constitutes marketability]{.underline}**
and is therefore **[likely to pass over areas of research that are not
clearly profitable.]{.underline}**\[30\]

Private funding can offer flexibility by bypassing public bureaucracy,
and technocapitalist campaigns often emerge as efforts to reduce red
tape.\[31\] For example, when the Gates Foundation began funding
research into experimental pandemic response efforts, their proposed
solution until approximately 2015 was for a NATO-like organization to
handle public health policy, and they worked extensively with the WHO
and the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private enterprise. However, the
WHO's sluggish Ebola response between 2014 and 2016 prompted the Gates
Foundation in 2017 to provide backing for CEPI, a vaccine research
accelerator, and in 2020, the Gates Foundation's COVID response efforts
largely bypassed intergovernmental organizations, instead utilizing
direct, private funding to pivot existing research initiatives into
COVID testing trials. These redirections of private research provided
data that outstripped the WHO by a critical few months before the FDA
halted the program due to regulatory approval issues.\[32\]

A cause for concern, however, is that **[private funding has private
goals]{.underline}**, and that this may impact trustworthiness of
private research. **[Objective empiricism is questionable
when]{.underline}** it is **[connected to corporate
objectives]{.underline}**, and this has the potential to reduce public
trust in the research process. **[Privately funded studies are
demonstratively more likely to reach conclusions that favor sponsors'
interests.]{.underline}** One analysis of medical industry funding found
that privately-funded research is four times more likely to provide a
favorable assessment of a drug than publicly-funded research.\[33\] It
also appears that the public is, generally speaking, in on the plot. A
meta-analysis of pharmaceutical trials suggests that trials with
disclosed financial ties to industry are perceived as "less interesting,
important, relevant, valid, and believable" than those without financial
disclosures. Though a consistent quantitative effect is difficult to
document due a limited sample size, a significant portion of patients
and clinicians may feel that **[disclosed financial ties reduce research
quality, and can discourage patients from
participating.]{.underline}**\[34\]

Notably, corporations themselves are also experiencing a reduction in
internal science funding. The proportion of corporate funding allocated
toward the research side of industrial R&D dropped from 28% in 1985 to
20% in 2015. The same review of scientific publications found that
**[the rate of papers being published by corporations dropped
significantly]{.underline}** between 1980 and 2010, indicating that
**[it is most cost-effective for companies to rely on existing data as
opposed to producing new data.]{.underline}**\[35\] This is because
**[market pressures favor applied research in the interest of
greenlighting products, not higher-risk investments in foundational
science that are likely to pay off at a later date.]{.underline}** In
the interest of budget conservation, research may be dropped. **[Patents
increase the value of innovations, and in turn stimulate continued R&D
in the interest of "inventing around"]{.underline}** (i.e. around
existing innovations). As a result, **[there is a disproportionate focus
on development rather than research as the most profitable approach for
a corporation.]{.underline}**\[36\]

The balance of public relations and institutional respectability is
delicate.

If both the public and traditional private sectors are experiencing
funding squeezes, **[the technocapitalist investment sector should be a
great source of support for the technological and scientific
communities]{.underline}**. However, **[the technocapitalist "disruptor"
efforts are subject to the same issues choking industry funding: they
favor low-risk research with high payoffs.]{.underline}** Research that
requires a fifteen-year timeline to produce tangible effects is passed
over in favor of disruptive options. **[These initiatives can have
limited shelf lives due to regulatory issues or poor adoption
rates.]{.underline}**\[37\]

What's the price of a human life? [How do markets reward long-term
research and prevention -- if a payoff for investors may never
come?]{.underline} "Obviously this crisis comes at great human cost",
Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures in New York,
says with regard to [the coronavirus pandemic.]{.underline} "At the same
time, this [is an opportunity for us]{.underline}. It's an opportunity
[to see the limits of capitalism."]{.underline} In conversation with
Isabell Welpe, Chair for Strategy and Organization at Technische
Universität München, Wenger made the case that [humanity urgently needs
to "leave the industrial age behind]{.underline} and create what I call
the knowledge age." In his vision, [much of human attention would be
directed toward existential problems like climate change, preventing the
next pandemic or detecting asteroids that are on a collision course with
Earth.]{.underline} The discussion -- part of the DLD Sync series --
spanned across a vast range of topics, from crisis management and
consumer power to economic freedom, democracy, social safety and how to
finance a potential Universal Basic Income. Excerpts follow below, along
with a video recording of the complete session. Points of Failure Since
the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, Western-style market
capitalism has been the dominant economic model in much of the world.
But the success has also exposed capitalism's weaknesses, Wenger argues.
"Over time, the problems that remain are by definition problems that
it's not good at solving." In the view of the German-born investor,
[many of the world's largest issues today require a different approach
because capitalism relies on prices and markets to function
properly]{.underline}. "And [there are things for which there can't be
markets]{.underline}", Wenger says. "[Exhibit 1 is the pandemic.
**There's no price for pandemic preparedness**."]{.underline} Even the
trillions of dollars in losses that the pandemic will likely bring to
the global economy won't suffice as a permanent incentive for
preparedness, Wenger believes. "[What is the 'demand mechanism' by which
you establish that you should be stockpiling ventilators or fund
fundamental research into new ways of creating vaccines?]{.underline}",
he asked. "[It's crucially important]{.underline}, I believe, [that we
figure out how we free up more human attention onto non-market related
activities]{.underline}." Striking A Balance A baker who sells dry bread
will likely go out of business soon because customers stay away --
illustrating that "[whenever you can measure the quality of something,
markets work quite well]{.underline}", Isabell Welpe pointed out. "[But
it's very difficult to judge the quality of ideas or the services that a
hospital provides." If a hospital does a good job in disease
prevention]{.underline}, for example, "[you won't see it]{.underline}".
Universities face a similar conundrum, Welpe said. To prove their merits
in a market-based environment, "universities have started to produce
quantity instead of quality -- because it is of great use to us
politically but it's not of good use for the society that funds us",
Welpe said. "It's hard to judge, if not impossible, the quality of
groundbreaking research. It's also hard to judge the quality of good
journalism." Therefore, she concluded, "for some institutions I don't
think capitalism, or the market system, are a very good idea." In the
Loop Most people work to earn a living, spending money that keeps the
economy going, Albert Wenger observed. "In my book, World After Capital,
I call this the 'job loop'", he said. "[Lots of human attention is
caught up in making stuff, getting paid for that and then immediately
turning around and consuming]{.underline}." You might expect a venture
capitalist to be quite happy with this system, but Wenger sees enormous
downsides. For one, [it leads to overconsumption, encouraging people to
buy "ever more stuff that they don't really need" -- depleting resources
and fuelling climate change through globalized supply
chain]{.underline}s. In addition, Wenger argues, [people are forced to
spend time and attention on tasks that bring neither them nor society
forward.]{.underline} "[There are all these large-scale threats" like
pandemics, climate change or asteroids that could collide with Earth,
but they're largely overlooked by societies focused on economic growth
and consumption]{.underline}, Wenger believes. "[The amount of
attention, collectively, that we're allocating to these \[threats\] is
completely out of whack with their relative importance]{.underline}", he
said. "[For human attention, we really should try to get away from
market-based approaches.]{.underline}"

### Cybersecurity -- Link

#### Cyberwar is merely a manifestation of capitalism -- automating war against the working class. Refuse the aff's project as a continuation of the neoliberal war machine. It's try or die for the alternative's movements to abolish the order altogether.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko 19** (Nick, associate professor @
University of Western Ontario in Faculty of Information and Media
Studies, Svitlana, assistant professor of communication @ Simon Fraser
University, "What is to be done?", Chapter 3, Cyberwar and Revolution:
Digital Subterfuge in Global Capitalism)

The argument of this book is that [cyberwar is a manifestation of the
competitive nature of capitalism, which, beneath the surface of
globalization, fosters a war of all against all, conducted in the
accelerated, automated, and abstracted forms]{.underline} on which this
entire mode of production now depends. It follows from this that [the
prospects for reducing the dangers of cyberwar, and of the other types
of war of which it is now part, depend strongly on movements and
struggles to constrain and, ultimately, abolish this internally
antagonistic order. A recognition of the extreme difficulty of this
project]{.underline} is inherent in the point on which we opened this
chapter, namely, Noys's observation that the [military high-technology
"endocolonization" of society has been a factor in decomposing the
traditional industrial working-class movements that were historically
the main agencies of socialist and communist projects.]{.underline}
However, there is also a possible reversal of this logic, if [averting
war, including cyberwar, becomes entwined with other issues, such as
struggles for social equality and ecological sustainability, a focal
point for recomposition of movements looking beyond capital, drawing on
new and diverse constituencies.]{.underline} We have indicated some of
the issues that we think might be drawn together around resistance to
the rise of cyberwar: [antisurveillance sentiment, rejection of the
secrecy of the security state and its new digital complexes, concern
over the corruption of the general intellect by mis- and disinformation,
objection to corporate and military criminality, and, of course,
revulsion at the exterminatory horrors of war, from the terror of dirty
wars to global thermonuclear catastrophe.]{.underline}

In his reflections on Marxist theories of war and revolution, Balibar
(2002) remarks on the coexistence within this body of thought of two
contradictory elements, one stressing the idea of "revolutionary war,"
the other of "revolutionary peace." [The first stresses "armed struggle
against capital," the second "the refusal of capitalist wars"---"in many
respects this class war is therefore also a non-war, or an
anti-war"]{.underline} (11). If, in the title to this chapter, we
invoked Lenin's What Is to Be Done?, it is partly to remember that,
[though Lenin is today primarily thought of as a theorist of
revolutionary war, perhaps the major decision of Leninism was one for
peace]{.underline} (even if his later adoption of Trotsky's formula of
"no war, no peace" resonates with today's state of cyberwar). [The
outbreak of World War I precipitated a schism in the international
socialist movement. Leading European socialist democratic parties all
too rapidly discarded their longheld view that war exemplified the
irrationality of competitive capitalism, forgot their commitments to
peace and worldwide worker solidarity, rallied behind their governments,
and joined the march to mass slaughter.]{.underline} Only the faction of
what is sometimes known as the Zimmerwald Left (Nation 1989), led by
Lenin, continued to speak out for internationalism. [It was thus not
just revolt against exploitation but rejection of the holocaust of World
War I, a program of "bread and peace," that gave communism a moral claim
to universality.]{.underline} Terrifying contemporary parallels to the
pre1914 years today demand an updated strategy for "bread and peace,"
[with "bread" understood as a securing of ecological conditions for
species life and "peace" as elimination of systemic social
violence.]{.underline}

One of the slogans of the Zimmerwald Left was "Krieg dem Krieg," "war on
war," and it is tempting to take this up, in a very literal sense, and
propose a "cyberwar on cyberwar." As we have seen, [there is a hacking
front to both the struggles against digital militarism and contemporary
anticapitalist movements.]{.underline} They have exposed the workings of
the cyberwar complex and brought it to light. Their main figures are
defectors from that complex. [More broadly, over recent decades, many
critical theorists have argued for forms of "cyborg" dissent and for
deployment of the arms available to "immaterial labor," whether in the
networked mobilization of protest or in more direct digital disruptions
of war making. Cyberwar on cyberwar is both a metaphorical and practical
possibility]{.underline}, and we have seen situations when "Krieg dem
Krieg," in the most concrete sense, is the only effective response to
murderous attack.

possibility, Routledge, 2021, DKP\]

[Alternative education]{.underline} raises questions about whether
another world is possible. Alternatives [ask educators and students to
question the governance, regulation and resourcing of hegemonic,
institutionalized forms of education]{.underline}, alongside their
curricula, [through prefigurative practices.]{.underline} The idea of an
alternative [questions the legitimacy of formalized spaces]{.underline},
often standing [against both their forms and content,]{.underline} and
as a result defining an educational undercommons (Harney & Moten, 2013).
Such an undercommons is a space for solidarity and resistance, from
where resources and relations can be drawn. It might exist inside formal
education, as a sector of the economy or in its institutional forms. An
undercommons forms an underground [that enables subversion and new forms
of organization,]{.underline} and [which problematizes]{.underline}
dominant narratives about education (for entrepreneurship[, growth,
sustainable development and so on).]{.underline}

In this being inside-and-against the school or the university,
alternative education takes the perspective of voices that are
marginalized because they are racialized, gendered or rendered
economically valueless or indebted, in order to re-imagine and
re-produce new forms of educational life or sociability. The idea of an
alternative also emerges beyond formalized spaces, in autonomous
communities that exist beyond the school or university as it is
repurposed as a factory (Cleaver, 2002; University of Utopia, The,
n.d.).

This idea of alternatives being in, against and beyond recognizes that
hegemonic [educational institutions]{.underline} have been subsumed
within the circuits of capital. This means that the governance and forms
of such institutions, and the work of academics, professional service
staff and students, [have been reengineered by capital]{.underline} on a
global terrain. Moreover, [the labor]{.underline} that takes place
[inside these institutions is repurposed and re-produced in its relation
to money capital, productive capital and commodity capital, in order to
generate surplus value, surpluses, profits and so on. The domination of
capitalist social relations over academic labor is driven by the
abstracted power of money and the generation of surplus value. This
opens up the possibility for alternative forms of
education]{.underline}, both inside formal spaces and beyond the
boundary of the formal, [to become new sites of struggle in response to
the on-going crisis of sociability. **This crisis is signalled by the
co-option of socially useful knowledge**]{.underline}, or the general
intellect, [so that it can be valorized]{.underline} (Hall, 2018; Virno,
2004[). Educational relationships have been productively intensified in
order to facilitate the expansion of capital, rather than for the
solution of global, socio-economic and socio-environmental
crises.]{.underline} Inside the school or the university, educational
innovations are fetishized as emancipatory, whereas in working against
and beyond these spaces, [scholars in alternative educational spaces are
working to abolish the relations of production that drive societies to
ignore concrete emergencies]{.underline} (Hall & Smyth, 2016).

From inside-and-against the hegemonic institution, alternatives
articulate the limits of formal education, including its problematic
nature as a public or private good (Marginson, 2012). Here, the idea of
the school or university as a form of enclosure of knowledge and
practice is refused through public intellectualism or educational
activity that is conducted in public. Such activities widen debates over
ideas and fields of study beyond the academy to the public, in that they
refuse both the colonization of disciplinary spaces by academics and the
delegitimation of certain voices. This public activity contains the germ
of militancy (Neary, 2012; Thorburn, 2012) because it aims to do
counter-hegemony and be counter-hegemonic. As a form of workers'
enquiry, **[militancy in research or pedagogic practice points toward
projects that produce knowledge useful for activist ends.]{.underline}**
This may take the form of open education or scholarship **[that refuses
neoliberal recuperation]{.underline}** (Eve, 2014) for the production of
marketized outcomes like performance data, or new spaces for the
generation of surpluses or profits. Such refusals question the societal
value of business-as-usual models for public, higher education (Open
Library of Humanities, 2020).

However, experiments that are against hegemonic practices also offer the
potential for radical experiment, alongside the re-imagining of
education as a distributed, co-operative, democratic activity. Such
experiments question education's relationship to society. [Prefigurative
responses]{.underline} then [emerge in the pedagogic practices of social
movements rooted in pedagogy]{.underline} (Caldart & the Movement of
Landless Workers, 2011), and through forms of resistance inside the
university grounded in community and environmental justice (Pearce,
2012), resistance to gender-based violence, and trades union educational
activity (Scandrett, 2014). [This work situates the experience of the
educator and student against that which emerges from within social
movements, in order to address the possibilities for alternative forms
of knowing and being.]{.underline} Here [traditions of critical pedagogy
are central to the ways in which critical knowing]{.underline} and being
emerge to [challenge the dominant framing of learning, teaching and
scholarship as separate from society and everyday life]{.underline}
(Amsler, 2015; Motta and Cole, 2016).

Work that emerges beyond formal educational contexts is situated in
practical, alternative initiatives that point toward alternative,
societal re-imaginings of education. Such re-imaginings are forms of
autoethnography, framed by the idea of the student or educator as a
co-operative activist, and as such operating collectively through
organic intellectualism (People's Political Economy, 2013; Social
Science Centre, The, 2016). Such alternatives offer a means of using
critical sociology and critical pedagogy to analyse concrete moments of
crisis of specific communities, such as the politics of austerity and
climate justice (Buxton & Hayes, 2015; Lockyer & Veteto, 2013).

In particular, [these alternatives are infused by]{.underline}
comparative analyses with the [pedagogic practices of indigenous
communities and people of colour]{.underline} (Motta, 2016; Zibechi,
2012), [for whom]{.underline} the [crisis]{.underline} of sociability
[imposed by capitalism is on-going,]{.underline} historical and
[material.]{.underline} Such practices are affirmative in attempting to
generate new cultural definitions and recognitions (Connell, 1987), as
acts of becoming (Braidotti, 2011). Here, [the white, male,
heteronormative educational institution is the adversary of and
antithetical to an ongoing process of becoming. In its deployment of
organizational forms,]{.underline} technologies and institutional
spaces, pedagogic practices and assessment regimes[, it seeks to
maintain the domination of the market.]{.underline} As such, in order
[to move beyond the market]{.underline} as the sole arbiter of crises,
[it becomes important to nurture alternative educational
spaces]{.underline} that are affirmative of intersectional lines of
flight [away from our hegemonic anchoring points]{.underline}
(Braidotti, 2011; Yuval-Davis, 2006). A key issue is whether those
voices which catalysed or contributed to crisis, are the same voices who
should dominate our responses.

Such affirmative lines of flight develop analyses that specifically
relate cooperative, inclusive educational practices of creating and
legitimizing communities, and challenge the on-going colonization of
knowing and being. [They offer ways to refuse the dominant power
relations of knowledge production inside contemporary
capitalism,]{.underline} and instead speak of decolonization by
feminized and racialized subjects on the margins. This enables those
projects to establish unique analyses of educational possibility from
within new, emancipatory horizons. These analyses recognize the desire
for progressive and democratic forms of education: first, in terms of
its governance and politics, and the social relations that circulate
inside educational spaces; and second, in terms of enacting radical
pedagogies grounded in the abolition of power relations in the
classroom.

Here a re-politicization of autonomy becomes central to a movement away
from the internalization of capitalism's value-set, which is rooted in
productivity/intensity and where any alternative mode of life is seen as
sinful. Tactical and affective autonomy reduces the acceptance of
hierarchical discipline, and increases demands for the quality and
content of work that is both necessary/in the sphere of heteronomy and
free/in the sphere of autonomy (Gorz, 1982). [What alternative education
offers is less a masculine, engineered, corporate life driven by
technique, and instead one rooted in humane values where individuals
rather than capital are sovereign. Anything otherwise
makes capital/]{.underline}exploitation/appropriation [central to a
productive life]{.underline}, and diminishes the space for a useful
life.

Marx (1894/1991) describes the sphere of freedom or autonomy beginning
beyond the sphere of necessity or heteronomy. Freedom consists of being
able to work with as much dignity and efficiency as possible (in the
sphere of necessity) for as brief a time as possible. It is important
that a heteronomous sphere is subordinate to the sphere of autonomy,
with the maximum efficiency and the least expenditure of effort and
resources. The key is to make it possible for individuals to move from
heteronomous, wage-based social labor effected in the general interest
and requiring little time or intense involvement, to autonomous
activities which carry their end in themselves. This resonates with
descriptions and discussions of self-actualization through the
classroom, rooted in acts of teaching that "share in the intellectual
and spiritual growth of our students" (bell hooks, 1994, p. 13).
Moreover, it takes alternative educational spaces as pivots for
reimagining the curriculum for two reasons. First, because by
dismantling the curriculum, we are able to reveal flows of alienation at
the intersections of: self/subject and other/object reflected in it;
gender and race reproduced through it; and the disciplinary separations
demanded by it. Second, we are able to re-describe the curriculum as a
form of social wealth and a process of struggle (Ahmed, 2012; Olufemi,
2017).

From this complex educational ecosystem, [alternatives]{.underline} sit
against the neoliberal enclosure of existing structures and forms, like
the school and university. They [stress: first, democratic activity,
based upon a radical politics; second, militant research
strategies]{.underline}, [which see research as a tool for political
action and for widening the field of struggle against the re-production
of alienating forms of education; third, the re-definition of
scholarship undertaken in public, as a revolutionary
activity.]{.underline} In a politics of community engagement and
cross-disciplinary activity, and in radical education collectives,
[these strategies]{.underline} form cycles of struggle that point toward
possibilities for: detonating the school or university (Amsler & Neary,
2012); [using prefigurative pedagogical practices that enable labor to
become the crisis of capital, so that it might become for itself rather
than being for capitalization or valorization]{.underline} (Holloway,
2002; Occupied California, 2010); and describing what society might
become (School for Designing a Society, The, 2016)

### Prioritize Ethics -- Framework

#### Pedagogy is key -- academic debates matter.

Pedagogy. "Dangerous Pedagogy in the Age of Casino Capitalism and

All over the world, [the forces of neoliberalism are on the march,
dismantling]{.underline} the historically guaranteed social provisions
provided by [the welfare state, defining profit-making and market
freedoms as the essence of democracy while diminishing civil
liberties]{.underline} as part of the alleged \"war\" against terrorism.
Secure [in its dystopian vision that there are no alternatives to a
market society, free-market fundamentalism eliminates issues of
contingency, struggle and social agency by celebrating the inevitability
of economic laws]{.underline} in which the ethical ideal of intervening
in the world gives way to the idea that **[we \"have no choice but to
adapt both our hopes and our abilities to the new global market.\"
Coupled with an ever-expanding culture of fear]{.underline}**, market
freedoms seem securely grounded in a defense of national security and
the institutions of finance capital. Under such circumstances, [a
neoliberal model]{.underline} now [bears down on America]{.underline}n
society, [threatening to turn it into an authoritarian state. The script
is now familiar: there is no such thing as the common good; market
values become the template for shaping all aspects of society; the free,
possessive individual has no obligations to anything other than his or
her self-interest;]{.underline} profit-making is the essence of
democracy; [the government]{.underline}, and particularly the welfare
state, [is the arch-enemy of freedom; **private interests trump public
values**; consumerism is the essence of citizenship; privatization
is]{.underline} the essence of [freedom; law and order is the new
language for **mobilizing shared fears rather than shared
responsibilities**]{.underline}; war is the new organizing principle for
organizing society and the economy; theocracy now becomes the
legitimating code for punishing women, young people, the elderly, and
those groups marginalized by class, race and ethnicity when religious
moralism is needed to shore up the war against all social
order.[\[2\]](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/6954:dangerous-pedagogy-in-the-age-of-casino-capitalism-and-religious-fundamentalism#2)
Given this current crisis, [educators need a new political and
pedagogical language for addressing the changing contexts]{.underline}
and issues facing a world in [which capital draws upon an unprecedented
convergence of resources - financial, cultural, political, economic,
scientific, military and technological - to exercise powerful and
diverse forms of control.]{.underline} If [educators]{.underline} and
others [are to counter]{.underline} global capitalism's increased
ability to separate [the traditional nation-state-based space of
politics]{.underline} from the transnational reach of power, it is
crucial to develop educational approaches that reject a collapse of the
distinction between market liberties and civil liberties, a market
economy and a market society. This suggests [develop]{.underline}ing
[forms of critical pedagogy capable of challenging neoliberalism and
other anti-democratic traditions]{.underline}, such as the emerging
religious fundamentalism in the United States, [while resurrecting a
radical democratic project that provides the basis for imagining a life
beyond **the \"dream world\" of capitalism.**]{.underline} Under such
circumstances, [education becomes more than testing, an obsession
with]{.underline} accountability [schemes]{.underline}, zero-tolerance
policies and a site for simply training students for the workforce. [At
stake here is recognizing the power of education in creating the
formative culture necessary to]{.underline} both [challenge]{.underline}
the various [threats]{.underline} being mobilized against the very idea
of justice and democracy [while]{.underline} also [fighting for those
public spheres and formative cultures]{.underline} that offer
alternative modes of identity, social relations and politics. [The
search for a new politics]{.underline} and a new critical language that
crosses a range of theoretical divides [must reinvigorate the
relationship between democracy, ethics, and political agency by
expanding the meaning of]{.underline} the pedagogical as a [political
practice]{.underline} while at the same time making the political more
pedagogical. In the first instance, it is crucial to recognize that
pedagogy has less to do with the language of technique and methodology
than it does with issues of politics and power. [**Pedagogy is a moral
and political practice** that is always implicated in power]{.underline}
relations and must be [understood as a cultural politics]{.underline}
that offers both a particular version and vision of civic life, the
future, and how we might construct representations of ourselves, others,
and our physical and social environment. As Roger Simon observes: As an
introduction to, preparation for, and legitimation of particular forms
of social life, education always presupposes a vision of the future. In
this respect a curriculum and its supporting pedagogy are a version of
our own dreams for ourselves, our children, and our communities. But
such dreams are never neutral; they are always someone\'s dreams and to
the degree that they are implicated in organizing the future for others
they always have a moral and political dimension. It is in this respect
that any discussion of pedagogy must begin with a discussion of
educational practice as a form of cultural politics, as a particular way
in which a sense of identity, place, worth, and above all value is -
informed by practices which organize knowledge and
meaning.[\[3\]](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/6954:dangerous-pedagogy-in-the-age-of-casino-capitalism-and-religious-fundamentalism#3)
An oppositional cultural politics can take many forms, but given the
current assault by neoliberalism on all aspects of democratic public
life, it seems imperative that educators revitalize the struggles to
create conditions in which learning would be linked to social change in
a wide variety of social sites, and pedagogy would take on the task of
regenerating both a renewed sense of social and political agency and a
critical subversion of dominant power itself. Making the political more
pedagogical rests on the assumption that education takes place a variety
of sites outside of the school. Under such circumstances, agency becomes
the site through which power is not transcended but reworked, replayed
and restaged in productive ways. Central to my argument is the
assumption that politics is not only about power, but also, as Cornelius
Castoriadis points out, \"has to do with political judgements and value
choices,\"[\[4\]](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/6954:dangerous-pedagogy-in-the-age-of-casino-capitalism-and-religious-fundamentalism#4)
indicating that questions of civic education and critical pedagogy
(learning how to become a skilled citizen) are central to the struggle
over political agency and democracy. In this instance, critical pedagogy
emphasizes critical reflexivity, bridging the gap between learning and
everyday life, understanding the connection between power and knowledge,
and extending democratic rights and identities by using the resources of
history. However, among many educators and social theorists, there is a
widespread refusal to recognize that this form of education is not only
the foundation for expanding and enabling political agency, but also
that it takes place across a wide variety of public spheres mediated
through the very force of culture itself. One of the central tasks of
any viable critical pedagogy would be to make visible alternative models
of radical democratic relations in a wide variety of sites. These spaces
can make the pedagogical more political by raising fundamental questions
such as: what is the relationship between social justice and the
distribution of public resources and goods? What are the conditions,
knowledge and skills that are a prerequisite for civic literacy,
political agency and social change? What kinds of identities, desires
and social relations are being produced and legitimated in diverse sites
of teaching and learning? How might the latter prepare or undermine the
ability of students to be self-reflective, exercise judgment, engage in
critical dialogues, and assume some responsibility for addressing the
challenges to democracy at a national and global level? At the very
least, such a project involves understanding and critically engaging
dominant public transcripts and values within a broader set of
historical and institutional contexts. Making the political more
pedagogical in this instance suggests producing modes of knowledge and
social practices in a variety of sites that not only affirm oppositional
thinking, dissent and cultural work, but also offer opportunities to
mobilize instances of collective outrage and collective action. Such
mobilization opposes glaring material inequities and the growing cynical
belief that today\'s culture of investment and finance makes it
impossible to address many of the major social problems facing both the
United States and the larger world. Most importantly, such work points
to the link between civic education, critical pedagogy and modes of
oppositional political agency that are pivotal to creating a politics
that promotes democratic values, relations, autonomy and social change.
Hints of such a politics is already evident in the various approaches
the Occupy movement has taken in reclaiming the discourse of democracy
and in collectively challenging the values and practices of finance
capital. Borrowing a line from Rachel Donadio, the Occupy movement
protesters are raising questions about \"what happens to democracy when
banks become more powerful than political
institutions?\"[\[5\]](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/6954:dangerous-pedagogy-in-the-age-of-casino-capitalism-and-religious-fundamentalism#5)
What kind of education does it take, both in and out of schools, to
recognize the dissolution of democracy and the emergence of an
authoritarian state? In taking up these questions and the challenges
they pose, critical pedagogy proposes that education is a form of
political intervention in the world and is capable of creating the
possibilities for social transformation. [Rather than viewing **teaching
as technical practice**, pedagogy, in the broadest critical sense, is
premised on the assumption that learning is not about processing
received knowledge, but actually **transforming knowledge** as part of a
more expansive struggle for individual rights and social
justice.]{.underline} This implies that any viable notion of pedagogy
and resistance should illustrate how knowledge, values, desire and
social relations are always implicated in relations of power, and how
such an understanding can be used pedagogically and politically by
students to further expand and deepen the imperatives of economic and
political democracy. [The fundamental challenge facing educators within
the current age of neoliberalism, militarism]{.underline} and religious
fundamentalism [is to provide the conditions for students to address how
knowledge is related to the power of both self-definition and social
agency.]{.underline} In part, this means [providing students with the
skills, knowledge and authority they need to inquire and act upon what
it means to live in a **substantive democracy**]{.underline}, to
recognize anti-democratic forms of power, [and to fight]{.underline}
deeply rooted [injustices]{.underline} in a society and world founded on
systemic economic, racial and gendered inequalities.

#### Their argument begins from an ideological bias that brackets out capitalism's exploitation of the periphery -- traditional impact calculus can't take this into account, ethics must come first

Slavoj **[Zizek and]{.underline}** Glyn **[Daly]{.underline}**, Senior
Lecturer in Politics in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at
University College, Northampton, 200**[4]{.underline}**, Conversations
With Zizek, p. 14-16

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of
postmodern protocol and recognize that [**our ethico-political
responsibility is to confront the** constitutive **violence of today's
global capitalism and its** obscene **naturalization**/anonymization
**of the millions who are subjugated** by it throughout the
world]{.underline}. Against the standardized positions of postmodern
culture --- with all its pieties con¬cerning 'multiculturalist'
etiquette --- Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called
'radically incorrect' in the sense that it breaks with these types of
positions and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of
today's social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism.
This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been
bedevilled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards
political mor¬bidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more
recently Laclau and Mouffe, crucial theoretical advances have been made
that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new
context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself
is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, **[the
prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as
a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly
accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence]{.underline}**. In
an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, **[the fear of economism can end up
reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary
capitalism]{.underline}** (i.e. the initial prohibi¬tion conjures up the
very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde
return to economism. Zizek's point is rather that in rejecting economism
[**we should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in
shaping** the **lives** and destinies of humanity **and our very sense
of the possible**]{.underline}. In particular we should not overlook
Marx's central insight that [in order to create a universal global
system **the forces of capitalism** seek to **conceal the**
politico-discursive **violence of its construction**]{.underline}
through a kind of gentrification of that system. What is persistently
denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that
[the gentrification of global liberal **capitalism** is one whose
'universalism' fundamentally **reproduces and depends upon a disavowed
violence that excludes vast sectors of the world's
population.**]{.underline} In this way, [**neo-liberal ideology attempts
to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and
losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgement in
a neutral marketplace. Capitalism** does]{.underline} indeed **[create a
space for a certain diversity]{.underline}**, at least for the central
capitalist regions, [but it **is neither neutral nor ideal and its price
in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant.**]{.underline} That is to
say, [**the human cost in terms of** inherent global **poverty and
degraded 'life**-chances' **cannot be calculated within the existing
economic rationale and, in consequence, social exclusion remains
mystified** and nameless]{.underline} (viz, the patronizing reference to
the 'developing world'. And Zizek's point is that this mystification is
mag¬nified through capitalism's profound capacity to ingest its own
excesses and negativity: to redirect (or misdirect) social antagonisms
and to absorb them within a culture of differ¬ential affirmation.
Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political
boutiquism that is readily sus¬tained by postmodern forms of consumerism
and lifestyle. Against this [**Zizek argues for a new universalism whose
primary ethical directive is to confront the fact that our forms of**
social **existence are founded on exclusion on a global
scale**]{.underline}. While it is perfectly true that universalism can
never become Universal (it will always require a hegemonic-par¬ticular
embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is novel about Zizek's
universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or to
reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a 'glitch' in an
otherwise sound matrix.

[Meanwhile, the nations of the world focus on "**sovereignty**,"
**militarism**, national **independence**, **trade wars**, and
unsustainable **capitalist development**. "Sovereign independence" is
written into the UN charter]{.underline} in multiple ways [and continues

Nuclear weapons are refined and made "combat ready," and countries like
North Korea correctly understand that without the nuclear deterrent,
they would suffer the same destruction as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and
Libya. [For the **imperial system**]{.underline} [led by the U.S. and

fragmentation, hate, fear, and need for "enemies" is so much greater
than our desire for a future for our children or the planet.

IS THE RULING CLASS "INSANE" OR SIMPLY CRIMINAL?

A Google search reveals a number of articles by different authors who
have declared that the ruling class is "insane." Indeed, if bringing the
entire planet to ruin in the service of ones personal greed for wealth
and power is insane, then this label is appropriate, although I prefer
the term "criminal," since [the majority of the **ruling
class**]{.underline} [of the world are simply]{.underline}
**[criminals]{.underline}** [who control the]{.underline} **[mass

In the US, [the majority of both **Democrats**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[Republicans]{.underline}** [in the

this sense, [serving both themselves and the ruling class. Many
**so-called liberals**]{.underline} [in the US are working to remove
Trump]{.underline} as President, [and to "take back our country." But
the truth is they never had "their country." The ruling class has always
had it, and]{.underline} **[human extinction advanced]{.underline}**
perhaps [just as rapidly under]{.underline} Bill [Clinton]{.underline},
George W. [Bush, or]{.underline} Barack [Obama. The mass media, the war
system, and the "sovereign nation" propaganda keep the people of the US
asleep]{.underline} no matter who is president. [Whomever fills that
office can do little because the system itself **defeats rationality**,
recognition of our common]{.underline} [**planetary humanity**, and the
changes **necessary for survival**]{.underline}.

REFUSING TO BECOME WORLD CITIZENS IS A DEATH SENTENCE

[Trump is a symptom and not a cause. People refuse to
actualize]{.underline} what [Karl Marx]{.underline} called our
species-being. [They refuse to become]{.underline} **[world
citizens]{.underline}** [in any real sense of this word. They cling to
their]{.underline} **[sovereign borders]{.underline}** [and **delude
themselves**]{.underline} [that somehow **extinction can be
avoided**]{.underline} [if the peoples of some 193 different,
**militarized** sovereign nations all care about the **environment**,
**recycle**, and "**dispose**" of the trash properly]{.underline}.
Rather than living in what I call a "boundary-less world," [they insist
on their]{.underline} **[puerile boundaries]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**identities**, even as this exacerbates the rush
to]{.underline} **[total climate collapse]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[human extinction]{.underline}**. [To cling to a
tiny, **exclusive identity**]{.underline} [that **divides one from

**survival of the human race**]{.underline}.

MASS MEDIA A MAIN SOURCE FOR IMMATURE IDEOLOGIES

It has often been pointed out that the mass media keep ordinary people
distracted, immature, and unable to think clearly. The mass media are
designed for this purpose. For more sophisticated ordinary people, there
are sources like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington
Post, which frame the immature ideologies in a more erudite manner to
satisfy the egoism of the "educated" middle classes. But the entire
world system is immature and structurally inculcates immaturity into the
peoples of Earth.

MISGUIDED LOYALTIES TO OUTDATED SYSTEMS

[The system of sovereign nation-states is nearly four centuries
old]{.underline}, often said to have begun formally at the Peace of
Westphalia in 1648, developed at a time when people were riding horses
and fighting with swords. [The system of capitalism is just as old,
developed at a time when the Earth seemed to have]{.underline}
**[inexhaustible resources]{.underline}**, [was able to
receive]{.underline} **[unlimited wastes]{.underline}** [from human
industries]{.underline}, and the population of the world was a fraction
of what it is today. [These systems **structurally condition
people**]{.underline} [into **loyalty**]{.underline} [to their puerile
**national identities**]{.underline} [and into a]{.underline}
**[capitalism]{.underline}** [that has no concern for the
**environment**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [**human dignity**, but
only for egoistically pursued]{.underline} [**private profit**.
"Freedom" becomes promoting egoistic self-interest regardless of the
social or **environmental consequences**]{.underline}.

### Fascism -- Impact

#### Neoliberal globalization is at its breaking point and is collapsing into neo-fascism now -- systemic failures and exponentially increasing inequality have pushed the working class to its brink -- failure to theorize a new international paradigm results in fascist take over and ensures global war

20th- and 21st-Century Fascism [Fascism, whether in its classical
20th-century form or possible variants of 21st-century neo-fascism, is a
particular response to capitalist crisis]{.underline}. [Trumpism in the
USA, BREXIT in the UK, Bolsonaro in Brazil, the increasing influence of
neo-fascist and authoritarian parties throughout Europe]{.underline}
([including Poland, Germany, Hungary, Austria, Italy, Holland, Great
Britain, Denmark, France, Belgium, and Greece]{.underline})2 [and around
the world, such as in Israel, Turkey, the Philippines, Brazil, and
India, represent a far-right response to the crisis of global
capitalism]{.underline}. They are symptomatic of the general crisis of
capitalist rule. Organic crises of capitalism involve objective and
subjective dimensions. [The particular conditions in any one nation are
always linked to more general conditions in the global system. In this
case, those general conditions are the rise of a truly integrated global
economy and society and the deep structural and cultural crisis of the
new global capitalism]{.underline}. The structural dimension of
overaccumulation and stagnation discussed above has become aggravated in
conjunction with a crisis of state legitimacy and of capitalist
hegemony. Here we must turn to Gramsci, for whom hegemony refers to a
particular relation of social domination in which subordinate groups
lend their "active consent" to the system of domination. Projects of
hegemony involve not merely rule but political and ideological
leadership based on a set of class alliances. Such hegemony must be
constantly reconstructed, because the possibility of hegemonic or
consensual domination rests on both ideological and material
foundations. Hegemony therefore requires a material base, or the
material conditions, institutions, and concomitant norms that allow for
the social reproduction of a sufficient number of people among
subordinate groups. No would-be ruling class can exercise hegemony
without developing diverse mechanisms of legitimation and securing a
social base --- a combination of consensual integration through material
reward for some, and coercive exclusion of others that the system is
unwilling or unable to coopt. Beyond this, for Gramsci a class or class
fraction achieves hegemony to the extent that it is able to present its
own interests as the general interest, and insofar as "the interests of
the dominant group prevail, but only up to a certain point, i.e.,
stopping short of narrowly corporate economic interests" (Gramsci, 1971,
182, my emphasis). As I have discussed at some length elsewhere (see,
i.a., Robinson, 2004), [emergent transnational elites set about in the
1980s and 1990s to construct a global capitalist historic bloc. A
historic bloc is a social ensemble involving dominant strata and a
social base beyond the ruling group, in which one group exercises
leadership and imposes its project through the consent of those drawn
into the bloc]{.underline}. To be successful in constructing a historic
bloc, the ruling group must be able to present its class project as in
the general interest and gain the active support of those brought into
the bloc through the combination of material reward and ideological
leadership, thus achieving what Gramsci referred to as expansive
hegemony. [It appeared for a time in the 1990s that transnational elites
would be able to establish this historic bloc, as globalization,
neoliberalism and the]{.underline} "TINA" ("[there is no alternative")
syndrome seemed to become "common sense]{.underline}." But efforts to
cement the bloc proved elusive. [The TCC has turned to naked pursuit of
its own corporate interests, unrestrained from national regulatory
control and seemingly impervious to mass pressure from below. It can no
longer even pretend to represent a "general interest," much less assure
the social reproduction of the global working class to secure its
hegemony, as global capitalism becomes ever more predatory]{.underline},
a veritable gangster capitalism. Under these conditions, [coercive
domination and violent exclusion appear to prevail over consensual
incorporation. By the turn of the century counter-hegemonic forces began
to accumulate into a transnational movement against the depredations of
neoliberalism and for global justice, followed by a global revolt in the
wake of the 2008 financial collapse]{.underline}. When a crisis of
political authority or hegemony does not find an organic solution, "it
means that a static equilibrium exists (whose factors may be disparate,
but in which the decisive one is the immaturity of the progressive
forces)," wrote Gramsci. "It means that no group, neither the
conservatives nor the progressives, has the strength for victory, and
that even the conservative group needs a master" (Gramsci, 1971, 221).
In these moments, notes Gramsci, "the crisis creates situations which
are dangerous in the short run since the various strata of the
population are not all capable of orienting themselves equally swiftly,
or of reorganizing with the same rhythm" (ibid., 210). Gramsci's
analysis goes far in identifying the current conjuncture, that of a
sharp political polarization between left/progressive and far-right
responses to the crisis (and indeed the "immaturity of the progressive
forces"); yet he was writing in reference to the rise of fascism in
Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. [What, then, does 21st-century fascism
share with its 20th-century predecessor, and what is distinct? Above
all, fascism in the 20th century involved the fusion of reactionary
political power with national capital]{.underline}. It was, in part, the
inability of German and Italian national capital to out-compete the
national capitals of other European powers in the imperialist conquests
of the turn of the 19th century and following the German defeat in World
War I that led to a fascist response in the 1930s, once the crisis hit
full force. In distinction, [21st-century fascism involves the fusion of
transnational capital with reactionary and repressive political power
--- an expression of the dictatorship of transnational
capital]{.underline}. In addition, the fascist projects that came to
power in the 1930s in Germany, Italy, and Spain, as well as those that
vied unsuccessfully to win power in many European countries (see, i.a.,
Paxon, 2004; Eco, 1995), in the United States, and in some South
American countries, had as a fundamental objective crushing powerful
working-class and socialist movements. But in the United States, Europe,
and elsewhere, the left and the organized working class are now at a
historically weak point. In these cases, [21st-century fascism appears
to be a preemptive strike at working classes and at the spread of mass
resistance through the expansion of a global police state]{.underline}.
[The fourth industrial revolution promises to increase the ranks of
surplus humanity and also impose greater competitive pressures on the
TCC, thus heightening its need to impose more oppressive and
authoritarian forms of labor discipline on the global working
class]{.underline}. Moreover, [a global police state is centrally aimed
at coercive exclusion of surplus humanity. The restructuring of world
capitalism through globalization has greatly expanded the ranks of the
surplus labor population]{.underline}. The processes by which surplus
labor is generated have accelerated under globalization. [Spatial
reorganization has helped transnational capital to break the
territorially bound power of organized labor and impose new
capital--labor relations based on fragmentation, flexibilization, and
the cheapening of labor. Crises provide capital with the opportunity to
accelerate the process of forcing greater productivity out of fewer
workers]{.underline}. These developments, combined with a massive new
round of primitive accumulation and displacement of hundreds of
millions, have given rise to a new global army of superfluous labor that
goes well beyond the traditional reserve army of labor that Marx
discussed. Global capitalism has no direct use for surplus humanity. But
indirectly, it holds wages down everywhere and makes new systems of
21st-century slavery possible (on the new slavery, see, i.a., Patel and
Moore, 2017, 30). Surplus humanity cannot consume and so does not
provide transnational capital with a significant market. Dominant groups
face the challenge of how to contain both the real and potential
rebellion of surplus humanity. [As world capitalism reaches the limits
of its extensive expansion, new spaces have to be violently cracked open
and the peoples in these spaces must be repressed by a global police
state]{.underline}. [The mechanisms of coercive exclusion include mass
incarceration and the spread of prison-industrial complexes, pervasive
policing, anti-immigrant legislation and deportation regimes, and the
manipulation of space in new ways so that both gated communities and
ghettos are controlled by armies of private security guards and
technologically advanced surveillance systems, ubiquitous, often
paramilitarized policing, "non-lethal" crowd control methods, and
mobilization of the culture industries and state ideological apparatuses
to dehumanize victims of global capitalism as dangerous, depraved, and
culturally degenerate]{.underline}. States abandon efforts to secure
legitimacy among this surplus population, and instead turn to
criminalizing the poor and the dispossessed, with tendencies towards
genocide in some cases. But these mechanisms also involve ideological
campaigns aimed at seduction and passivity among those locked out. [The
newfound ability of transnational capital to achieve political
domination through control over the means of intellectual production,
the mass media, the educational system, and the culture industries
allows it to achieve a much more profound and complete penetration into
the spheres of culture and community, indeed, into the life world
itself]{.underline}. Corporate marketing strategies depoliticize through
the manipulation of desire and of libido, so that the grievances and
frustrated aspirations of the excluded become channeled into petty
consumption and flight into fantasy rather than into placing political
demands on the system through collective mobilization. In this regard, I
observed in my earlier work that [the heightened role of political and
ideological domination in this digital age through control over media
and the flow of images and symbols would make any project of
21st-century fascism more sophisticated and, together with new
panoptical surveillance and social control technologies, probably allow
it to rely more on selective than generalized repression --- unless a
revolt from below comes to actually threaten the rule of the
TCC]{.underline}. [These new modalities of social control and
ideological domination blur boundaries, so that there may be a
constitutional and normalized neo-fascism]{.underline} (with formal
representative institutions, a constitution, political parties and
elections), [all while the political system is tightly controlled by
transnational capital and its representatives and any dissent that
actually threatens the system is neutralized if not
liquidated]{.underline} (see Robinson and Barrera, 2012). We may see a
"withering away" of constitutional order rather than a rupture, if a
global police state and the impulse towards 21stcentury fascism are not
contained. The Social Bases of 21st-Century Fascism Twentieth-century
fascism took root in an earlier stage of capitalist development, when
middle classes and the petty bourgeoisie that represented a significant
portion of the population were experiencing a destabilization of their
status and the threat of downward mobility into the ranks of the
proletariat. Fascist movements offered the ruling groups the ability to
successfully compete with mass working-class parties for the allegiance
of the middle classes and the petty bourgeoisie, although these
movements did recruit among the working class as well. These strata came
to be seen as the core social base of the fascist movements ---
instruments in the hands of national capitalist classes attempting to
resolve the crisis of capitalism (Rosengarten, 2014). The middle classes
and the petty bourgeoisie are strata that own their own means of
livelihood and therefore do not have to sell their labor to capital;
among them, small shopkeepers, business people, independent artisans and
professionals, family farmers, and other small commodity producers.
These strata were reduced to small pockets in the cores of world
capitalism as proletarianization accelerated in the latter half of the
20th century, and especially in the age of globalization. [While
analysis of the petty bourgeoisie remains important in assessing current
political processes, this class is not numerous enough to form a
critical mass that could provide a viable social base for 21st-century
fascism to triumph]{.underline}. [Today that role is played in the cores
of world capitalism by certain sectors of the working class.
Twenty-first--century fascist projects seek to organize a mass base
among historically privileged sectors of the global working class, such
as white workers in the Global North and urban middle layers in the
Global South, that are experiencing heightened insecurity and the
specter of downward mobility and socioeconomic
destabilization]{.underline}. As with its 20th-century predecessor, [the
project hinges on the psychosocial mechanism of displacing mass fear and
anxiety at a time of acute capitalist crisis towards scapegoated
communities]{.underline}, such as immigrant workers, Muslims and
refugees in the United States and Europe, southern African immigrants in
South Africa, Muslims and lower castes in India, Palestinians in
Palestine/ Israel, or the darker skinned and disproportionately
impoverished population in Brazil. [Far-right forces pursue this project
through a discursive repertoire of xenophobia, mystifying ideologies
that involve race/culture supremacy, an idealized and mythical past,
millennialism, a militaristic and masculinist culture that normalizes,
even glamorizes war, social violence and domination, and contempt toward
rather than empathy for those most vulnerable]{.underline}. [The key to
this neo-fascist appeal is the promise to avert or reverse downward
mobility and social destabilization; to restore some sense of stability
and security]{.underline}. [This discursive repertoire of 21st-century
fascism, of course, shares many features with classical 20th-century
fascism, including what Umberto Eco has characterized as a "cult of
tradition," "fear of diversity," a siege mentality, a sense of
deprivation of a clear social identity, "selective
populism]{.underline}," and Orwellian "newspeak" (Eco, 1995). However,
as I have emphasized, [these discursive and emotive elements take place
under very different circumstances, a distinct historical moment in
world capitalism]{.underline}. With regard to extreme masculinization,
although here is not the place for full discussion, the denigration of
women in general and the sexual predation of Trump (and of Duterte in
the Philippines, among others), almost seems to be a point in his favor
among his diehard base. This phenomenon may be a sexual sublimation of
what are fears of social and economic emasculation. On the matter of
contempt rather than empathy, witness Trump's notorious comments on poor
countries being "shithole countries," his mocking of a disabled
reporter, and so on. It is not too much of an analytical stretch to
associate such public displays of contempt with the process whereby
policies of aggression and repression of these vulnerable groups achieve
discursive or psycho-social legitimation in the commonsense
consciousness of those who would provide the mass social base for a
neo-fascist project. [There is a heavy overlap with ideologies of
national regeneration, national/race purity, and a mystique of heroism
that characterized 20th-century fascism]{.underline} (although in the
particular case of Trump, the latter resembles an extreme narcissistic
mystique of his self). [Twentyfirst--century fascism]{.underline}, like
its 20th-century predecessor, [is a violently toxic mix of reactionary
nationalism and racism. The nation]{.underline}, argued Benedict
Anderson, [is an "imagined political community," in which "the nation is
always conceived as a deep horizontal comradeship" regardless of the
actual inequality and exploitation that exists]{.underline} (Anderson,
1983, 15--16). In conjunction, argues Callinicos (1983, 38), [racism
offers workers from the dominant racial or ethnic group an imaginary
solution to real contradictions; recognition of the existence of
suffering and oppression, even though its solution is a false
one]{.underline}. [Neo-fascist projects on the rise at this time offer
precisely this mix of nationalism and racism in attempting to organize
better-off sectors of the working class experiencing social and economic
destabilization in the face of capitalist globalization]{.underline}.
The parties and movements associated with such projects have put forth a
racist discourse, less coded and less mediated than that of mainstream
politicians, targeting the racially oppressed, ethnic or religious
minorities, immigrants and refugees in particular as scapegoats. [It is
crucial to note that deteriorating socioeconomic conditions do not
automatically lead to racist backlash. A racist/fascist interpretation
of these conditions must be mediated by political agents and state
agencies]{.underline}. Trumpism, for instance, represents just such a
mediation. Here there is a great deal of insight to be had from the fact
that the presidential campaigns of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump
in the 2016 U. S. presidential elections appealed to the same social
base of disaffected workers, one with a left interpretation of the
crisis and the other with a far-right populist and openly racist
interpretation.3 [While there is nothing inevitable about a fascist
outcome to the current lurch to the far-right, the more the current
racist mobilization becomes entrenched the greater the danger of such an
outcome]{.underline}. [In the United States, the far right and
neo-fascists are attempting to reconstruct the white racist historic
bloc that to one extent or another reigned supreme from the end of
post--Civil War reconstruction to the late 20th century, but has become
destabilized through capitalist globalization]{.underline}. In Europe
the far-right and neo-fascist movements are following a very similar
path as Trump's, in terms of recruiting formerly privileged sectors
among the working classes who are suffering under the crisis by
scapegoating Muslims, immigrants, and other vulnerable sectors.
Similarly to Trump, [they are promising to stabilize the situation for
these precariatized sectors. "National" identity becomes a
stand-in]{.underline} (that is, a code) [for racist mobilization against
scapegoats. Yet the discourse of national regeneration is in sharp
contradiction with the transnational integration of capital and a
globally integrated production and financial system upon which hinge the
class and status interests of the major capitalist groups and state
elites]{.underline}. Here there is a critical distinction to be made
between the conjuncture of fascist projects in the last century and
those of the 21st century. Fascism in Germany and Italy arose at the
height of nation-state capitalism and it did offer some material
benefits --- employment and social wages --- to a portion of the working
class through corporatist arrangements, even as it unleashed genocide on
those outside the chosen group. [In this age of globalized capitalism
there is little possibility in the United States or elsewhere of
providing such benefits, so that the "wages of fascism" now appear to be
entirely psychological]{.underline}. In the regard, [the ideology of
21st-century fascism rests on irrationality --- a promise to deliver
security and restore stability that is emotive, not
rational]{.underline}. It is a project that does not and need not
distinguish between the truth and the lie. The Trump regime's public
discourse of populism and nationalism, for example, bears no relation to
its actual policies. In its first year, Trumponomics involved
deregulation --- the virtual smashing of the regulatory state ---
slashing social spending, dismantling what remained of the welfare
state, privatizations, tax breaks to corporations and the rich, and an
expansion of state subsidies to capital --- in short, neoliberalism on
steroids. This is a distinction lost on many commentators. German
monopoly capitalists turned to the Nazis to crush the powerful trade
unions, socialist and communist movements. But they also turned to the
Nazi state to open up vast new opportunities for accumulation and to
compete, including through territorial expansion, against capitalist
groups from other countries. In sharp distinction to this fusion of
German national capital with the fascist state, [Trumpism has sought to
open up vast new opportunities for profit-making inside the United
States]{.underline} ([and around the world]{.underline}) [for
transnational capital]{.underline}. [The Trump White House has called
for transnational investors from around the world to invest in the
United States, enticed by a regressive tax reform, unprecedented
deregulation, and some limited tariff walls that would benefit groups
from anywhere in the world that establish operations behind
them]{.underline}. "America is open for business," Trump declared at the
2018 meeting of the global elite gathered for the 2018 annual conclave
of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "Now is the perfect
time to bring your business, your jobs and your investments to the
United States" (Bierman, 2018, A3).

[**Climate change** is only **one aspect** of the problem. Everywhere we
look, the **natural systems** that maintain our planet in its
**habitable state** are rapidly **deteriorating**. Can we survive the
**destruction** of the tropical **rain forests** of the **Amazon** --
the **lungs of Earth**? Can we survive the **spread** of **dead
zones**]{.underline} -- areas too low in oxygen to sustain life --
[across our **oceans**? Can we make do without the **bees** and other
**insects** we]{.underline} currently [depend on to **pollinate** our
**crops**?]{.underline}

[Perhaps the **scariest thing**]{.underline} about the situation [isn't
the **vast scale** of breakdown in natural systems but the fact that
those entrusted with the **leadership** of our society appear determined
to **hasten us to our doom**]{.underline}. Instead of listening to the
advice of the scientists, firefighters, land managers and others who've
been sounding the alarm about climate change for decades, Scott Morrison
and Co. parrot propaganda points from the Murdoch press. Instead of
agreeing, finally, to contribute more to global efforts to reduce carbon
emissions, they double down on the expansion of Australia's booming coal
and gas industries, attempting all the while to distract the public with
fairy tales about greenies preventing back-burning and the fires just
being part of Australia's natural cycle.

Elsewhere in the world, the picture is the same. [Decades of global
**climate negotiations** have gone **nowhere**. Despite the increasingly
urgent warnings of scientists, **emissions continue to
rise**]{.underline}. And with the likes of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin
and Jair Bolsonaro in charge of some of the world's biggest economies,
the prospects for a major shift occurring soon appear terrifyingly dim.

Where did it all go wrong? The answer is suggested by the increasingly
popular slogan System change, not climate change. Morrison, Trump and
their fellow [fossil fuel enthusiasts act not simply in accordance with
their personal whims]{.underline} and desires [but as the **conscious
servants** of a system: **capitalism**. Proponents of capitalism talk as
if it's the **natural form** of human society]{.underline} -- something
that has existed since the dawn of time. [The reality,]{.underline}
however, [is that the age of capitalism spans only the past two to three
centuries.]{.underline} For the vast majority of our 200-300,000 year
history, humans lived in societies, like those of the Indigenous
inhabitants of Australia prior to invasion, characterized by collective
decision making and sharing of resources, not the system of private
property and the endless competitive scramble for individual gain that
define the world today.

If the capitalist system was most befitting of our human nature, you
would expect its emergence to have been embraced by all whose lives were
transformed by it. But [the birth of capitalism]{.underline} in the 17th
and 18th centuries [was an extremely **violent process** that was
**strongly resisted** from the start.]{.underline} As Karl Marx put it
in Capital: "The discovery of gold and silver in America, the
extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal
population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East
Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting
of black-skins, signaled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
production." Capital came into the world, he wrote, "dripping from head
to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt."

[Since the earliest days of human existence, we have had a significant
impact on the environment]{.underline}. Scientists believe, for
instance, that hunting, along with the use of fire and other land
management techniques employed by Australia's Indigenous population,
contributed to the extinction of the continent's megafauna.
Deforestation was a major problem in ancient Greece and the Roman
Empire. Air pollution from the burning of wood and coal was an issue in
London as early as the 12th and 13th centuries. [All this, however, was
on a **minuscule scale** compared to the **devastation** of the past
**200 years**, and particularly]{.underline} in the period [after World
War Two -- the era in which **capitalism came to dominate** every
corner]{.underline} of the globe.

In 1950, global carbon emissions totaled 5.28 billion tonnes. By 2017,
they were 36.15 billion tonnes. According to the World Wildlife Fund's
Living Planet Report 2018, [the **total population** of **mammals**,
**birds**, **fish** and **reptiles** has **declined by 60 percent**
since 1970. Every year, the rate of **extinctions** rises,]{.underline}
and scientists estimate that [a million animal and plant species may go
extinct over the coming decades]{.underline}. According to a 2016 report
by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the production of plastic has risen
20-fold since 1964 and is expected to double again in the next 20 years
and quadruple by 2050. Only around 5 percent of plastic ends up being
recycled. If current trends continue, the report predicts, [by 2050
there will, by weight, be **more plastic** in the world's oceans **than
fish**]{.underline}.

No one of these gloomy metrics, considered alone, can capture the depths
of the crisis we face. [In only 200 years]{.underline} of existence,
[capitalism has brought us to the brink of such a **calamitous
breakdown** in the world's natural systems that **our entire
civilization is now under threat**]{.underline}.

[Among Marx's most evocative metaphors for]{.underline} the operation of
[capital is his description of it as "dead labor, that, vampire-like,
only lives by sucking living labor,]{.underline} and lives the more, the
more labor it sucks". It's not only "living labor," however, that
sustains the vampire of capital, [but also the **natural inputs** of the
**productive process** -- the **raw materials** that labor works up into
the products that capitalists sell on]{.underline} the market for their
coveted profits.

[What makes capitalism **uniquely destructive** in
comparison]{.underline} to previous systems [is the **rupture** of the
**connection** between the main drivers of **economic life** and the
**natural world** that sustains us]{.underline}. A capitalist may own a
significant amount of land. But unlike the feudal lords of the Middle
Ages, their wealth isn't tied to the piece of land that they own. [If a
capitalist **destroys** their land]{.underline} -- say by digging up all
the coal or oil it contains, poisoning it with chemicals or exhausting
the fertility of the soil through over-farming -- [they can simply take
the **profits** they've generated from it and **buy more** land
elsewhere]{.underline}.

The vampire metaphor is powerful precisely because it speaks to this
fundamental rift between the lifeblood of capitalism -- profit -- and
society's underlying life systems, including labor and the natural
environment, that are the ultimate source of all wealth. Rolling Stone
contributor Matt Taibbi's description of investment bank Goldman Sachs
as "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,
relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like
money", can be extended to the whole capitalist class. [The
environmental (or other) **consequences** of their activities don't give
them much **pause** for concern as long as they're **making
money**]{.underline}.

[The wealth of the capitalist ruling class]{.underline} of today [is so
immense that even the **existential threat** posed by **climate change**
won't shake them into action]{.underline}. According to Oxfam, the
combined wealth of the world's 2,153 billionaires exceeds that of the
poorest 4.6 billion people, who make up 60 percent of the global
population. [Catastrophic events]{.underline} like the Australian bush
fires [are unlikely to faze them]{.underline} -- in contrast to the mass
of ordinary people impacted by the fires, they can easily buy their way
to safety.

[The ruling class's **lack of concern** for the **environment** is
reinforced by the **competitive nature** of the system. Each individual
capitalist must keep their **costs low** and their **profits high** to
stay ahead of their rivals. The main way]{.underline} they do this [is
by keeping workers' **wages down**. But if they can save money by not
dealing with the **environmental costs** of their operations, they'll do
that too]{.underline}.

[The capitalist class gains immense savings from treating
**environmental destruction** as an "externality" that they can pass on
to society]{.underline}. The International Monetary Fund calculated that
global subsidies to fossil fuel companies amount to US\$5.2 trillion a
year, approximately 6.4 percent of world GDP. Most subsidies relate to
the cost of dealing with the destructive consequences of all the carbon
emissions produced by burning fossil fuels. This includes the impacts of
climate change, along with the costs of health care associated with air
pollution and so on.

[You might wonder why governments are willing to let]{.underline} fossil
fuel companies and other [**destructive industries** get away with this.
The answer lies in the **role** of the **capitalist state**. We're
taught that it is a neutral body]{.underline} that mediates between the
conflicting interests of different social layers and guides society in
the collective interest. [The state, however, has **never been
neutral**. Modern **capitalist states** emerged in **conjunction** with
the rise of the **capitalist class** as the dominant economic power in
society, and they've always]{.underline}, as Marx put it, [been "a
**committee** for managing the **common affairs** of the **whole
bourgeoisie**]{.underline}."

[The role of the capitalist state]{.underline}, in other words, [is to
**protect** and **advance** the interests of **big business** and the
**rich**, rather than the mass of the population who **suffer the
consequences** of their **environmentally destructive**
practices]{.underline}. And again, this dynamic is reinforced by
competition on an international scale. Each national state defends the
interests of its capitalist class against those of their foreign rivals.
This involves both maintaining good business conditions (e.g. low wages
and a lack of environmental and other regulations) at home and
projecting power externally, through diplomatic and military means, to
ensure access to resources and markets around the world.

[The **destructive consequences** of these dynamics can be seen in
capitalism's almost uninterrupted **history of war**]{.underline}. And
they also help explain the continuing failure of global efforts to
secure agreement on any serious action to reduce carbon emissions or
address other major environmental issues. [Sacrificing **short term
profits** in the name of **long term sustainability** goes against the
DNA of the capitalist nation state]{.underline}. This is particularly
clear in the case of Australia, one of the world's most fossil
fuel-dependent nations. Neither the Liberals nor Labor are prepared to
forgo the tens of billions in profits that flow from coal and gas
exports. The strength of the fossil fuel industry is just too important
to Australia's status as a major regional power.

We're in a battle for our lives. [The **entire future** of the **human
experiment**]{.underline} -- so utterly miraculous and so terrifyingly
fragile -- [depends on what we do in the **coming years**]{.underline}
and decades. As Russian Marxist Nikolai Bukharin, writing a few years
after the revolution of 1917, put it: "[No system, including that of
human society, can exist in empty space; it is surrounded by an
'environment,' on which all its conditions ultimately depend. If **human
society** is not **adapted** to its environment, it is not meant for
this world; all its culture will **inevitably pass away**; society
itself will be **reduced to dust**]{.underline}."

The [jaw-dropping speed of COVID-19 vaccine development is a glorious
marvel of science, cooperation, and economic planning --- a glimpse of
how much more an egalitarian world could produce and achieve. But the
lifeboat ethics of vaccine rollout is a horrifying display of the
inefficiency and cruelty of capitalism.]{.underline} A medical
professional prepares to administer a vaccine. (Wikipedia Commons) Our

the first injection in the world of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine
to ninety-year-old British grandmother Margaret Keenan, applauded by
dozens of moist-eyed medical staff at University Hospital Coventry, it
was as glorious and moving a moment as any humanity has ever seen. A
jaw-dropping marvel of science, economic planning, and selfless,
humanist cooperation by [thousands of researchers around the globe, the
development of this and other vaccines hot on Pfizer's heels has taken a
mere nine months]{.underline} since the discovery of the disease, rather
than the years or even decades such medical research and development
(R&D) normally takes. They offer a glimpse of how much more an
egalitarian, rationalist world could produce and achieve, freed from the
fetters of profit. While the American private pharmaceutical giant and
its German biotech start-up partner may bear the name of the first
vaccine, [this is no triumph for capitalism. Pfizer-BioNTech, along with
the second-place finisher, Moderna, and the other front-runners, all
depended on years of public-sector funding for their success, and, in
many cases, on research actually performed by government or public
university labs long before 2020. And again during this plague year,
these private companies relied on state shepherding and bankrolling of
the vaccine development process or, in the case of Pfizer,
state-guaranteed purchase of millions of doses]{.underline}. In many
cases, national governments arranged purchase agreements and
manufacturing support ahead of clinical trial results so that rollout
could start as soon as regulatory approval was given, rather than having
to wait for approval before manufacture could begin. Washington promised
to purchase some \$2 billion worth of the Pfizer vaccine and guaranteed
about \$2.5 billion to Moderna for the development and manufacture of
its option. The incredible speed of vaccine development just about makes
up for the all-too-predictable news that the head of Pfizer cashed out
62 percent of his stock on the same day the company released the results
of its vaccine trial showing 90 percent--plus efficacy, and that
executives at Moderna made similar moves after their own announcement.
In both cases, the stock sale occurred through what the firms insist was
an entirely by the book, prearranged application of Rule 10b5-1, which
insider trading law permits. But, as NPR has reported, experts in
insider trading ethics say this is the thinnest of defenses of what is
"very suspicious" or even "wholly inappropriate" behavior. Even if we
are gullibly charitable in our assessment of the ethics of these moves,
strategically, they remain profoundly stupid, given the scale of vaccine
hesitancy. It is not enough to be ethical; one must be seen to be
ethical as well. So, to even appear to be engaging in insider trading
with respect to vaccine development is a gift to anti-vax campaigners
and COVID conspiracists. Such insider trading ethical fiascos aside, the
rapid development of the vaccine has stunned experts. They knew more
than anyone how long it normally takes for vaccine development. For
years, these same infectious disease researchers, clinicians, and public
health officials have damned the pharmaceutical giants for largely
getting out of the business of vaccine development several decades ago.
Contrary to anti-vax legend, pharmaceutical companies are, in reality,
loath to engage in vaccine production because of the financial risk
involved and their sheer unprofitability. Now, suddenly, in the face of
a nigh-on existential threat, when the state bashes CEO heads together
and takes on all financial risk, vaccines of stunning efficacy appear
after just months. It is almost identical to what happened during World
War II, when the US government, frustrated with the intransigence of
chemical companies and nascent pharmaceutical firms again fearing lack
of profitability, simply ordered cooperation across enterprises, made
investment decisions on behalf of the private sector, and covered the
costs of research, development, and manufacturing. The result was the
development or improvement of ten vaccines of military significance. The
same wartime planning efforts produced the mass rollout of the first
antibiotic, penicillin. Moving forward, these lessons show that the
[inefficiencies of the market must now permanently be done away with for
vaccine development related to all other infectious diseases that suffer
from a dearth of private R&D.]{.underline} For tuberculosis, for
example, we have only a feeble, century-old vaccine that ameliorates the
problem but is insufficient to prevent deaths from TB each year
equivalent to those killed by COVID-19. In 2020, COVID killed 1.7
million worldwide; in 2019, TB killed 1.4 million. But before we get out
the champagne and toast our genuinely heroic scientists and clinicians,
we have to recognize that while these vaccines are indeed a light at the
end of a very long tunnel, that same tunnel will be yet longer than it
needs to be, thanks once again to the irrationality, inefficiency, and
injustice of capitalism. It will be especially [unfair for those in the
developing world --- and even in many poorer, less populous parts of the
developed West, there will be cruelties for those who live outside the
metropolitan core,]{.underline} as there already have been throughout
2020 in the United States especially. In the spring, stories abounded of
testing, PPE, and ventilation machines being distributed on the basis of
who could pay the most rather than who needed them the most. Even
[Republican governors of small states were fuming at how orders, paid in
full, for essential equipment were canceled --- sometimes mid-shipment
--- so as to make more money servicing richer
jurisdictions]{.underline}. An almost identical crime is already in
progress once again, but this time with respect to the logistics of
vaccine manufacture and distribution. To explain the profound injustice
and hair-pulling inefficiencies of what is about to happen with respect
to the domestic and worldwide distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines, we
need to take a brief detour to explain how these vaccines work --- in
particular, how the ones first out of the gate are very different, even
revolutionary, compared to other vaccines. Conventional vaccines work
essentially the same way they did upon their discovery in the days of
Louis Pasteur. Inoculation involves exposure to a weakened or killed
virus, which thus presents to the immune system an antigen --- a
molecular structure that is part of a pathogen that prompts an immune
system response. The antigen we are focused on, with respect to the
SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, is the infamous "spike" protein
that covers its surface. The immune system then is able to remember and
recognize any "live" version of the pathogen if, in the future, it
attempts to invade the body. Now the immune system has a ready-prepared
capability of combating and defeating it. Depending on the virus, this
protection can last for life, a few years, or even a few months ---
hence the need for booster shots for some vaccines. Traditional vaccines
have been around for well over a century, and so the technology is
mature and the manufacturing process is well established --- even if the
supply chain is somewhat withered due to the aforementioned decades-long
retreat by Big Pharma from not just vaccine R&D but also vaccine
production. The major challenge with respect to rapid rollout of
traditional vaccines is that they need to be "grown" in hens' eggs or
insect cells. Each batch takes several weeks. There are eight main
vaccine techniques, including a handful of traditional, weakened virus
versions, among the roughly two hundred candidate COVID vaccines
currently at various stages of development (there are fifty-seven
presently undergoing clinical trials). Right now, the Pfizer-BioNTech
and Moderna vaccines are of most immediate interest and are the most
exciting in terms of the possibility that they may revolutionize vaccine
production. They are messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines, the concept of
which has been in development for many years --- funded primarily by,
you won't be surprised to hear by now, the public sector. (The
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a different method, or "molecular
platform" --- more on this shortly.) Messenger RNA, as you might
remember from high school biology, is the molecule that transcribes the
instructions in your DNA. This transcription is then read by ribosomes,
the little machines in your cells that use these transcribed
instructions to manufacture the proteins that make up almost everything
in your body. With mRNA vaccines, instead of presenting the immune
system with a whole virus, which has taken weeks to grow in hens' eggs,
just this bit of mRNA, embedded in a lipid nanoparticle (a fat molecule
that helps it enter a cell) with the instructions on how to manufacture
a viral antigen, is injected into the body. The mRNA then directs the
cell's ribosome protein factories to produce copies of the antigen (the
spike, in this case), sans virus. The immune system recognizes the
spikes as foreign and attacks them, then subsequently remembers how to
attack when confronted with the real thing. It's very clever on a number
of levels. Far smaller doses are required to prompt an immune response,
which means greater quantities can be produced much more rapidly than
traditional vaccines. Also, once the genetic sequence for an antigen
protein is known, you can quickly repurpose the same manufacturing
equipment --- bioreactors --- for this new antigen. Conventional vaccine
manufacture, meanwhile, requires slightly different bespoke equipment
each time. The mRNA molecular platform had already been developed well
ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant that as soon as the gene
sequence for the spike was identified, which happened within days of the
disease's discovery, the vaccine could immediately start being produced.
What took time was the clinical trials, and to speed them up, the
different phases of the trials were performed in parallel instead of
sequentially, as is normal practice. This is the reason vaccine
development has been so fast. In the future, when confronted with other
outbreaks of novel viruses, so long as we have set up the mRNA
production equipment ahead of time, ready to go, we can simply fire them
up with the new antigen genetic sequence. As it may be a long time
between outbreaks, without any opportunity for profit, such facilities
will likely need to be maintained or at least funded by the state simply
as a public service, like sewage systems or, more analogously, like fire
brigades, paid primarily to just be there, ready for when the emergency
comes. The downside is that while some other types of vaccine can be
kept stable in regular refrigerators, the lipid nanoparticle vehicles
for the mRNA need to be kept ultracold to avoid breaking down. The mRNA
molecule likewise begins to fall apart at room temperature. The
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires refrigerators that can keep the combo
at a cozy -70ºC (-94ºF). And this, what is called a "cold chain" --- a
low-temperature-sensitive supply chain --- is where we confront just the
first in a series of hurdles to efficient and fair rollout of the
vaccines that are caused by or exacerbated by market irrationality. Food
distribution worldwide already depends on a highly developed cold chain,
but an ultracold chain, with the sort of temperatures the Pfizer vaccine
requires, is a step beyond that. It's common for research labs to have
freezers that can keep things that cold, but not the pharmacies where,
for example, you might have received a flu shot. Pfizer is shipping the
vaccine in dry ice pack boxes. Once received, the dry ice needs to be
replenished within a day. Once taken out of the dry ice pack boxes, the
vaccine can be kept at regular refrigerator temperatures for twenty-four
hours, or a maximum of two hours once thawed at room temperature.
Ultracold freezers can extend shelf life by six months and are, in
principle, commercially available. As a result, major hospitals in
metropolitan areas are running around trying to get their hands on these
very cold but also very expensive freezers (which cost \$10--15,000 a
pop). And much like the hunt for personal protective equipment (PPE) and
ventilation machines in the spring, a disorganized every-man-for-himself
approach has returned in the winter. [Rural areas and towns with smaller
populations are being trampled in the stampede. The pandemic has
bludgeoned the finances of less well-off hospitals,]{.underline} and
these are expenditures they often just cannot afford. Even those
hospitals that could afford one or two freezers are being told by
manufacturers that delivery will take months; wealthier, larger
hospitals that are able to buy in bulk get priority.

### Sustainability -- Impact

#### Capitalism is [terminally]{.underline} unsustainable and [guarantees]{.underline} global extinction from climate change -- its try or die to develop a new socioeconomic system

The U.S. economy and society at the start of 2021 is more polarized than
it has been at any point since the Civil War. [The wealthy are awash in
a flood of riches, marked by a booming stock market, while the
underlying population exists in a state of relative, and in some cases
even absolute, misery and decline.]{.underline} The result is two
national economies as perceived, respectively, by the top and the bottom
of society: one of prosperity, the other of precariousness. At the level
of production, economic [stagnation is diminishing the life expectations
of the vast majority.]{.underline} At the same time, [financialization
is accelerating the consolidation of wealth by a very few]{.underline}.
Although [the current crisis of production associated with the COVID-19
pandemic has sharpened these disparities,]{.underline} [the overall
problem is much longer and more deep-seated, a manifestation of the
inner contradictions of monopoly-finance capita]{.underline}l.
Comprehending the basic parameters of today's financialized capitalist
system is the key to understanding [the contemporary contagion of
capital, a corrupting and corrosive cash nexus that is spreading to all
corners of the U.S. economy, the globe, and every aspect of human
existence.]{.underline} Free Cash and the Financialization of Capital
"Capitalism," as left economist Robert Heilbroner wrote in The Nature
and Logic of Capitalism in 1985, is "a social formation in which the
accumulation of capital becomes the organizing basis for socioeconomic
life."1 [Economic crises in capitalism]{.underline}, whether short term
or long term, [are primarily crises of accumulation, that is, of the
savings-and-investment]{.underline} (or surplus-and-investment)
[dynamics. Investment in new productive capacity in new or existing
businesses is what determines growth. Such investment decisions are
governed by expected profits on new investments.]{.underline} Viewed in
these terms, [the decline in the long-term growth rate experienced by
the mature, monopolistic economies]{.underline} of the United States,
Europe, and Japan over the last half century [can be seen as related
principally to the atrophy of net investment]{.underline}.2 [Existing
excess capacity in plant and equipment, a product of the monopolistic
structure of accumulation, tends to decrease expected profits on new
investment]{.underline}.3 [The U.S. economy has seen a long-term decline
in capacity utilization in manufacturing,]{.underline} which has
averaged 78 percent from 1972 to 2019---well below levels that stimulate
net investment.4 As a result, [the capital accumulation process within
production has stagnated, with existing idle capacity tending to shut
off the creation of new capacit]{.underline}y. From 1960 to 1980, it was
common for private net investment to constitute around 40 percent of
private gross investment. Since 2000, this has dropped to around 20
percent, even as gross investment has weakened relative to national
income.5 The significance of the atrophy of net investment in the core
capitalist countries cannot be exaggerated. As the foremost emerging
economy in the world today, China has what economist Zhun Xu calls a
"high Baran ratio," standing for investment as a share of economic
surplus. Conceptually, economic surplus---the difference between
national output and wage income or essential consumption---is gross
property income (profit, rent, interest). Zhun uses the income of the
top 10 percent as a proxy for economic surplus. On this basis, he
explains, China has invested around 80 percent of its economic surplus,
leading to high growth rates of 7 percent or higher. In contrast,
mature, monopolistic economies such as the Group of 7 (the United
States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Canada)
typically have relatively low Baran ratios, investing less than 50
percent of economic surplus, resulting in what for decades have been
weak and declining average annual growth rates.6 Given these conditions,
it is important to ask: What happens to that part of the economic
surplus held by corporations and individual capitalists that is not
invested in new capacity?7 Some of it is used for capitalist
consumption, but this has inherent limits. The vast economic surplus
(actual and potential) generated by the system of economic exploitation
far exceeds what can be spent in the luxury consumption of the wealthy,
however ostentatious. More importantly, capitalists do not desire to
consume the larger part of the economic surplus at their disposal,
since, above all else, they seek to amass wealth. Government spending
absorbs some of the economic surplus, as does waste in the business
process. However, government deficit spending also increases corporate
profits after taxes above the level determined by capitalist spending on
consumption and investment.8 Hence, [with both the growth of the federal
deficit and the stagnation of investment, the amount of free cash in
corporate coffers has dramatically expanded. This free cash plays a
central role in the financialization of capital and the resulting
extreme polarization of society.]{.underline}9 As stipulated by Craig
Medlen in Free Cash, Capital Accumulation and Inequality, free cash
equals corporate profits after taxes plus depreciation minus investment.
(In national income accounting, corporate profits after taxes plus
depreciation is known as corporate cash flow. The funds associated with
depreciation \[or capital consumption\] are part of the gross surplus
available to corporations.)10 A wider conception of free cash, utilized
in this article, also includes net interest. Hence, in the wide version,
Free Cash = Corporate Profits After Taxes + Depreciation + Net Interest
-- Investment.11 This free cash is held by corporations or is
distributed to stockholders through dividend payouts and/or stock
buybacks.12 Building on the research of Michał Kalecki, Medlen
demonstrates that [the amount of free cash is identical to the federal
government deficit minus the excess of savings over investment of the
noncorporate sector]{.underline} (now usually negative) [plus the
current account balance]{.underline}. The three factors of (1) the
federal deficit, (2) the country's current account balance (or the trade
deficit), and (3) the deficit spending of the noncorporate sector
(encompassing noncorporate business, housing, and personal finance) can
therefore be seen as underpinning free cash.13 Chart 1 shows the growth
of corporate free cash in the U.S. economy from the period immediately
after the Second World War to the present. Free cash, as non-invested
surplus, became a much bigger and bigger factor in the U.S. economy
beginning in the 1980s due mainly to the combined effects of a long-term
decline in corporate taxation, the increasing federal deficit, and the
atrophy of net investment.14 Free cash falls in recessions (due to lower
business activity and income), but then rockets up soon afterward due to
investment not keeping up with increasing economic activity, freeing up
more cash after investment. This sudden rebound in cash is also a
product of the fact that the Federal Reserve Board now steps in during
every recession, at precisely such "Minsky Moments" when the prospects
for investment are at their worst, with lavish provision of low-interest
credit. Another way of looking at this phenomenon is to chart the total
cash or liquid funds that corporations actually have ready at hand, if
they were to choose to invest (or otherwise productively use) the
surplus at their disposal. Of course, corporate investment is not
dependent on the prior availability of savings/surplus, since
capitalism, as Joseph Schumpeter long ago explained, is a system that
creates "credit ad hoc"; while John Maynard Keynes and Kalecki taught
that investment determines savings, not the other way around.15
Nevertheless, it is significant that [the cash funds of corporations in
the current phase of monopoly-finance capital far exceed profitable
investment outlets]{.underline}. At the beginning of 2020, nonfinancial
corporations were sitting on over \$4 trillion dollars in cash; before
the end of 2020 this had risen to over \$5 trillion.16 According to the
Federal Reserve Flow of Funds data, shown in Chart 2, total cash held by
U.S. nonfinancial corporations as a share of gross domestic product
(GDP)---much of it parked abroad in tax havens---has almost tripled
between the early 1990s and the present.17 The total cash holdings of
nonfinancial corporations on hand at any given time are not to be
confused with free cash, which is that part of the corporate cash flow
left over after investment in a given year---much of which is not held
as cash deposits but instead spent on mergers and acquisitions, stock
buybacks, and other financial instruments. Rather, total cash on hand,
as defined by the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds, simply measures the
actual cash deposits sitting in the accounts of nonfinancial
corporations presented as annual averages based on quarterly data.
Still, [the rapid growth of total cash currently held by nonfinancial
corporations in the form of ready monies, both absolutely and as a
proportion of GDP]{.underline} (as shown in Chart 2), [is a further
indication of an economy that has shifted from capital formation to
speculation.]{.underline} As we have seen, [when corporations do not
invest their economic surplus in new capital formation---primarily due
to vanishing investment opportunities in an economy characterized by
excess capacity---they are left with abundant free cash that is partly
returned to the shareholders through share buybacks and, to a lesser
degree, dividends. It is also used for speculation, including mergers,
acquisitions, and the panoply of corporate "cash management" techniques
that amount to the leveraging of free cash to enhance
returns]{.underline}.18 [This gives rise to a whole alphabet soup of
financial instruments, in which corporations use the cash at their
disposal partly as collateral for debt leverage, with nonfinancial
corporate debt rising rapidly as a share of national
income.]{.underline} [Predictably recurring internal corporate funds in
the form of free cash constitute a "flow collateral" allowing for
further leverage, feeding speculation. A speculative economy relies on
borrowed funds for leverage, backed up in part by cash. Expanding cash
reserves are also needed as hedges in case of financial defaults. The
whole system is a house of cards. The progressive financialization of
the capitalist economy, whereby the **financial superstructure continues
to expand as a share of the underlying productive economy**, has led to
**ever-greater asset price bubbles** and **growing threats of world
economic meltdown**.]{.underline} So far, a complete meltdown has been
headed off by central banks, as in the 2000 and 2008 financial crashes.
[At every major recurring disturbance, and with serious economic
repercussions, the monetary authorities pump massive amounts of cash
into the financial superstructure of the economy **only to give rise to
greater bubbles in the future**. Theoretically, stock values represent
future expected streams of earnings arising primarily from
production]{.underline}.19 [Nowadays]{.underline}, however, [**finance
has become increasingly autonomous from production**]{.underline} (or
the "real economy"), [relying on its own speculative "self-financing,"
leading to **financial bubbles, contagions, and crashes,** with the
monetary authorities intervening to keep the whole house of cards from
collapsing]{.underline}. [This serves to reduce the risk to speculators,
thereby keeping the value of stocks and other financial assets rising on
a long-term basis, along with the overall wealth/income
ratio.]{.underline} In these circumstances, so-called [asset
accumulation by speculative means has replaced actual accumulation or
productive investment as a route to the increase of wealth, generating a
condition of "profits without production]{.underline}."20 In order to
grasp the full significance of the financialization of the economy, it
is useful to look at the two conceptions of capital (relative to
national income) depicted in Chart 3.21 One of these, the numerator of
the lower line, is the traditional conception of capital as fixed
investment stock (physical structures and equipment) at historical cost
minus depreciation. This is called the fixed capital stock of the nation
and is tied directly to economic growth.22 It represents what economic
theorists from Adam Smith to Karl Marx to Keynes have referred to as the
accumulation of capital. Capital formation and national income are
closely related, generally rising and falling together, producing the
relatively flat line, representing the ratio of fixed capital stock to
national income, shown in Chart 3. Yet, [capital]{.underline}, as Marx
noted very early in the process, [has more and more taken on the
"duplicate" form of "fictitious capital]{.underline}," that is, [the
structure of financial claims (in monetary values) produced by the
formal title to this real capital]{.underline}. Insofar as economic
activity is directed to the appreciation of such financial claims to
wealth relatively independently of the accumulation of capital at the
level of production, it has metamorphosed into a largely speculative
form.23 This can be seen by looking again at Chart 3. In contrast to the
lower line, the upper line depicts what is traditionally seen as the
wealth/income ratio (which some economic theorists, such as Thomas
Piketty, conflate with the capital/income ratio, treating wealth as
capital).24 The numerator here is the value of corporate stocks. Since
the mid--1980s, [the ratio of stock value to national income has
increased more than 300 percent. This marks an enormous growth of
financial wealth, with speculation-induced asset growth sidelining the
role of productive investment or capital accumulation as such in the
amassing of wealth. This is associated with a massive redistribution of
wealth to the top of society]{.underline}. The top 10 percent of the
U.S. population owns 88 percent of the value of stocks, while the top 1
percent owns 56 percent.25 [Rising stock values relative to national
income thus mean, all other things being equal, rapidly rising wealth
(and income) inequality]{.underline}.26 The existence of the two
conceptions of capital (and of capital/income ratios) presented
here---one representing historical investment cost minus depreciation,
and conforming to the notion of accumulated capital stock, the other the
monetary value of stock equities (in economics traditionally treated as
wealth rather than capital)---is often downplayed within establishment
economics under the assumption that in the long run they will simply
fall in line with each other, and with national income. As leading
mainstream economic growth theorist Robert Solow writes: "Stock market
values, the financial counterpart of corporate productive capital, can
fluctuate violently, more violently than national income. In a recession
the wealth-income ratio may fall noticeably, although the stock of
productive capital, and even its expected future earning power, may have
changed very little or not at all. But as long as we stick to longer-run
trends...this difficulty can safely be disregarded."27 But can the
divergence of stock values from income (and from fixed capital stock) in
reality be so easily disregarded? Chart 3 depicts a sharp increase in
stock values relative to national income, which has now continued for
over a third of a century, with decreases in total stock values as a
ratio of national income (output) occurring during recessions, then
rebounding during recoveries.28 [The overall movement is clearly in the
direction of compounded financial hyperextension. This conforms to the
general pattern of the financialization of the capitalist economy,
constituting a structural change in the system associated with the
growth of monopoly-finance capital. This has gone hand in hand with a
bubblier economy, with financial bubbles bursting in 1987, 1991, 2001,
and 2008]{.underline}, but ultimately shored up by the Federal Reserve
and other central banks. [Today, vast amounts of free cash are spilling
over into waves of mergers and acquisitions, typically aimed at
acquiring megamonopoly positions in the economy]{.underline}. [A major
focus is the tech sector]{.underline}, much of which is directed at
commodifying all information in society, [in the form of a ubiquitous
surveillance capitalism]{.underline}.29 All financial bubbles derive
their animus from some common rationale, which claims that this time is
different, discounting the reality of a bubble. In the present case, the
rationale is that the advance of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple,
Amazon, Netflix, and Google), which now comprise almost a quarter of the
value of Standard and Poor 500's total capitalization, is unstoppable,
reflecting the dominance of technology. Apple alone has reached a stock
market valuation of \$2 trillion. All of this is feeding a massive
increase in income and wealth inequality in the United States, as the
gains from financial assets rise relative to income. Yet, like all
previous bubbles, this one too will burst.30 Kalecki determined that
[the export surplus on the U.S. current account increased free cash, as
did the federal deficit]{.underline}.31 However, the current account
deficit cannot be seen, in today's overall structural context, as simply
reducing free cash, because of the changed role of multinational
corporations in late imperialism, which alters other parts of the
equation. Due to globalization and the rise of the global labor
arbitrage, U.S. multinational corporations in their intrafirm relations
have in effect substituted production overseas by their affiliates for
parent company exports, thereby decreasing their investment in fixed
capital in the United States.32 The sales abroad of goods by
majority-owned affiliates of U.S. multinational corporations in 2018
were 14.5 times the exports of goods to majority-owned affiliates.33
[Foreign profits of U.S. corporations as a proportion of U.S. domestic
corporate profits rose]{.underline} from 4 percent in 1950 to 9 percent
in 1970 to 29 percent in 2019. [This mainly reflects the shift in
production to low unit labor cost countries in the Global
South]{.underline}. Samir Amin described [the vast expropriation of
surplus from the Global South, based on the global labor arbitrage, as a
form of "imperialist rent]{.underline}."34 This expansion of global
labor-value chains is also associated with an epochal increase in what
is called the non-equity mode of production, or arm's length production.
Companies like Apple and Nike rely not on foreign direct investment
abroad, but instead draw on subcontractors overseas to produce their
goods at extremely low unit labor costs, often generating gross profit
margins on shipping prices on the order of 50 to 60 percent.35 [The loss
of investment in the United States, as U.S. multinational corporations
have substituted production overseas, coupled with the growth of foreign
profits of U.S. megafirms, has further increased the free cash at the
disposal of corporations]{.underline} (even with a growing deficit in
the current account), thereby [intensifying the all-around
contradictions of overaccumulation, stagnation, and financialization in
the U.S. economy.]{.underline} Much of this free cash is parked in tax
havens overseas to escape U.S. taxes.36 [Washington uses its printing
press, through the federal deficit, to compensate for the U.S. current
account deficit]{.underline}. Foreign governments cooperate, providing
the "giant gift" of accepting dollars in lieu of goods, thereby
acquiring massive dollar reserves.37 At some point, however, [these
**contradictions are bound to undermine the hegemony of the dollar as
the world's reserve currency**, with dire ramifications for the
U.S.-based world empire.]{.underline}

The Central Flaws in the Neoclassical Theory of Growth

The intellectual [foundations of the decoupling narrative derive from
neoclassical economic theory,]{.underline} the prevailing paradigm of
explanation among orthodox economists that support capitalism.
Neoclassical theory is generally [plagued by **unrealistic assumptions**
about society]{.underline}, numerous [**math**ematical
**inconsistencies**, and]{.underline} has **[no predictive
power]{.underline}** at
all.[14](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en14) In
this piece, however, we focus on [the cardinal sin of this intellectual
train wreck: its rejection of physics and its ignorance of the natural
order.]{.underline} In the 1950s, the economist Robert Solow developed
one of the first major models to describe how economic growth
happens.[**^15^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en15) In
these versions of neoclassical theory, the production inputs of capital
and labor combine to produce outputs, or finished goods, that are traded
in the economy. Growth in capital leads to more output, but depreciation
in capital assets also drags down a portion of that output. The economy
eventually reaches a stationary state where growth and depreciation
balance each other out and there is no more growth. In order to produce
continuous growth, neoclassical theory argues that the economy needs a
steady stream of technological progress, defined as a gain in total
productivity. This gain implies that productive output can increase
while productive inputs are held constant. Solow came up with a
mathematical scheme for detecting the impact of this technological
growth on changes in GDP. Although his work earned widespread acclaim
from other neoclassical thinkers, much of it was based on dubious
mathematical results that did not actually validate his
claims.[**^16^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en16)

In extensions of Solow's original theory, [the productive inputs have
typically included capital, labor, and technology.]{.underline} Energy
is sometimes subsumed under the three traditional inputs, or it may be
treated as a separate input in and of itself. Critically, [the
production inputs are viewed as largely independent]{.underline} from
one another, [meaning that they can be substituted]{.underline} as
necessary in order to maintain or to boost the maximum level of
production. If societies are running short on natural resources,
neoclassical theory argues that these shortages can be overcome through
technological innovation, efficiency gains, or other forms of
substitution. Indeed, [neoclassical economists]{.underline} tend to
[assume that]{.underline} the long-run [sustainability of capitalism is
materially possible and all we need to do is figure out the social and
institutional arrangements]{.underline} that can ensure that
sustainability.[**^17^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en17) Solow
entertained the idea that the natural world does not provide limits to
economic growth on the following grounds: "If it is very easy to
substitute other factors for natural resources, then there is in
principle no 'problem.' The world can, in effect, get along without
natural resources, so exhaustion is just an event, not a
catastrophe."[**^18^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en18) Although
his model also showed that competition would eventually result in the
exhaustion of natural resources, his statement nicely describes the
general attitude that many economists hold about the inevitability of
growth under capitalism.

For a highly simplified toy model of what this all means, consider your
local pizza store. According to neoclassical theory, the pizza store can
maintain or boost current levels of pizza production in the face of any
shortfall. A shortage of workers can be overcome by adding more ovens. A
shortage of cheese can be overcome through technical improvements that
yield more efficient methods of making cheese. A shortage of electricity
can be overcome by increasing labor productivity, perhaps by training
the workers to make the pizzas faster under the new time constraints.
Everything can be replaced. Everything can be substituted, seemingly
without end. The ideas and principles just described represent
fundamental assumptions in neoclassical economics and they are often
used to explain the relationship between energy consumption and economic
growth. If there were no hard limits to substitution, then it would be
possible for our economies to keep growing even in an ecosphere with
declining quantities of natural resources and with highly chaotic,
nonlinear ecological consequences that result from the enormous energy
losses of capitalist societies. In other words, better technologies and
higher efficiencies would always be available to boost production,
regardless of any depletions or instabilities in the wider natural world
caused by those productivity gains.

[To chip away at this elaborate fantasy, it helps to begin with some
basic physics. The most fundamental limits to substitution come from
thermodynamics]{.underline}, the branch of physics that studies
quantities like heat, work, and energy. [Thermodynamic limits impose
constraints on the maximum efficiency of energy flows through
technological
syst]{.underline}ems.[**^19^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en19) [Car
engines, power plants, and photovoltaic cells are all limited in their
capacities to convert one type of energy into another.]{.underline}
[Tech]{.underline}nological progress [cannot overcome these
limits]{.underline}; no car engine can ever be more efficient than an
engine running on the Carnot
cycle.[**^20^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en20) In
an earlier article for this magazine, I defined the aggregate efficiency
of an economic system as the fraction of all primary energy consumption
that produces mechanical work and
electricity.[**^21^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en21) I
argued that [aggregate efficiencies are highly inertial over time
because improving them substantially requires enormous investments that
would disrupt the reigning economic order.]{.underline}

[Once a society has settled into a particular energy structure, changing
it much further becomes a daunting task because of elite classes and
groups that rely heavily on that structure for their wealth and
influence. We can look to]{.underline} the recent experience of [Germany
for a]{.underline} prominent [case study.]{.underline} In 2000, the
German government launched its ambitious *Energiewende*, a comprehensive
[plan to reduce]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions by
shifting]{.underline} energy production [towards renewable]{.underline}
sources, such as wind and
solar.[**^22^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en22) For
a time, the program made some notable achievements. Compared to 1990,
greenhouse gas emissions had declined 28 percent by 2017. That same
year, renewables reached a 13 percent share of primary energy
consumption. Although these numbers are impressive, [progress
has]{.underline} recently [come to a standstill.]{.underline} It has
become increasingly clear that [Germany will not reach]{.underline} the
climate [targets]{.underline} that it set for 2020. And [once we dig
into the numbers]{.underline} a bit deeper, [even those that look
impressive come with huge caveats.]{.underline} For example, the large
[reduction of]{.underline} carbon [emissions]{.underline} since 1990
[can be]{.underline} largely [attributed to the collapse of heavy
industry]{.underline} in East Germany after
reunification.[**^23^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en23) Over
the past eight years, greenhouse gas emissions from Germany have hardly
changed. The variabilities associated with [wind and solar]{.underline}
power have [open]{.underline}ed [up problems related to electricity
storage. Prices fluctuate]{.underline} dramatically [depending on
weather]{.underline} conditions. To compensate for these and other
issues, Germany began sabotaging its energy program by constructing a
series of new coal power plants when the coal industry pressured
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to relax its policies. The German
example offers an important lesson: **[the necessary substitution of
fossil fuels with renewables will never come fast enough under the
market logic of capitalism.]{.underline}**

[Another major limit]{.underline} to substitution [comes from the
ecological instabilities associated with excessive]{.underline} levels
of economic [growth. These]{.underline} instabilities can combine to
pump and [amplify existing natural phenomena.]{.underline} The amplifier
effect works as follows. [Economies absorb energy from the natural world
and then exploit that energy for]{.underline} cycles of [production and
consumption. For highly energy-intensive economies, these cycles
necessarily yield extensive levels of waste and
dissipation]{.underline}, or energy losses that are dumped back out to
the environment. [These energy losses]{.underline} are not "useless"
from the standpoint of physics or ecology. Under the right
circumstances, they [can power the formation of other natural dynamical
systems, including everything from viruses and bacteria to wildfires and
hurricanes.[24](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en24)]{.underline} [These
highly chaotic effects]{.underline} associated with energy-intensive
economies [are]{.underline} largely [ignored]{.underline} and dismissed
[by neoclassical theory]{.underline}, even though they have often played
a central role in the evolution of human
history.[**^25^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en25) As
a highly dissipative system, [capitalism regularly produces very
powerful amplifier effects.]{.underline} Collectively, [these amplifiers
are now creating]{.underline} what Marx called [a "metabolic rift"
between nature and society, which means that the ecological basis of
civilization is steadily eroding under profit-seeking and
energy-intensive development]{.underline} that does not care about
replacing what it
extracts.[**^26^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en26) **[The
natural world has major tipping points]{.underline}** that we should not
cross, **[but indefinite economic growth]{.underline}** through
substitution virtually **[guarantees]{.underline}** that some of
**[those critical thresholds will be breached, threatening the broader
ecosphere that supports human
civilization.]{.underline}[^27^](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en27)**

Consider another problem. Substitution can occur quite frequently on
small and restricted scales of economic activity. A pizza store can
always substitute certain ingredients for others. A homeowner can
substitute heating fuel for insulation. A company can replace older
light bulbs for more efficient lighting in its offices. And even some
countries can substitute various forms of wealth for others, at least
temporarily. The Pacific island nation of Nauru provides a classic
example that highlights the central themes of the debate. In the
twentieth century, Nauru possessed vast deposits of phosphate, which is
highly prized as an agricultural fertilizer. These deposits were
extensively mined, depleted, and then traded in global markets, allowing
Nauru to reach a sky-high standard of living by
1990.[**^28^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en28) Nauru
converted a portion of its earnings from the phosphate trade into a
public trust fund, which invested in manufactured capital through
financial markets. However, its impressive standard of living collapsed
sharply after the phosphate vanished, along with most of the money in
the trust
fund.[**^29^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en29) Nauru
offers a cautionary tale for the world as a whole. [If global
civilization runs out of natural resources, we cannot replace them by
investing in commodities through financial markets. People cannot eat
money. Substitution in the long run may be possible at the microlevel of
economic activity, but long-term macrolevel substitution is downright
wishful thinking.]{.underline}

We can better understand the limits to substitution on a global,
macroscopic level by considering a specific example: a global economy
meeting its electricity needs through the consumption of solar power.
[There are fundamental limits to the amount of solar energy absorbed by
solar panels that can be converted into useful electrical energy. Most
commercial photovoltaics convert less than 30 percent]{.underline} of
the solar energy they absorb into electricity; [the remaining energy
balance is lost as heat and infrared
radiation.]{.underline}[**^30^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en30) The
theoretical efficiency limits for the most advanced photovoltaic designs
are just under 90 percent, a number that not even the latest laboratory
experiments have come close to
matching.[**^31^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en31) But
[suppose neoclassical theory is right about its eternal commitment to
technological progress and that eventually we do manage to produce
photovoltaics that are 90 percent efficient]{.underline} at converting
solar energy. [Once all theoretical efficiency limits are actually
realized, boosting electricity production even further would require the
construction of new solar panels, which takes up more land]{.underline}.
As the earth has a finite surface area, [indefinite growth would not be
possible even with the proliferation of renewables.]{.underline} This
argument underscores the central point that [renewable
technologies]{.underline} are important, but they [cannot
solve]{.underline} the global [ecological crisis under the economic
regime of capitalism, which is completely reliant on the false promise
of eternal growth in production and consumption**. Substituting fossil
fuels for renewables while pushing for more growth would still lead to
the total ruin of global civilization**]{.underline} in a few centuries.

[Economists love to pretend that technological innovation can yield
greater "qualitative growth" without any corresponding "quantitative
growth."]{.underline}[**^32^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en32) On
the basis of improving knowledge and technological growth, [they believe
that the monetary value of stuff can keep increasing even as the
quantity of stuff itself remains stable. But what they fail to grasp is
that **tech**nological **innovations** do not happen magically---they
**also require energetic conversions.**]{.underline} [Changes to the
production cycle are dependent on the stock of electrical, chemical, and
mechanical energy available for research and training. A
coder]{.underline} sitting in front of a computer [writing a new program
needs energy to think and type. The computer itself needs
electricity]{.underline} to continue operating. [No possible improvement
can be made to computer programs without a continuous stream of
energetic conversions. Expansions in productivity require energy flows,
meaning that all forms of technological change are intertwined with the
energetic transformations that facilitate human existence]{.underline}.

[Tech]{.underline}nological [changes are physically embedded in greater
knowledge among people and the development of more productive assets,
both of which need energy and material flows to continue operating.
Thermodynamic limits also constrain the extent to which these flows can
be reduced while sustaining labor and capital.]{.underline} In short,
[technological changes themselves are subject to hard physical limits,
along with the qualitative growth that can be derived from
them.]{.underline} Power plants provide one of the most well-known
examples of the limits to technological growth. They have been hovering
near their peak efficiency ratings for decades and getting them to go
much further has proven to be extremely
difficult.[**^33^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2019/06/01/energy-economic-growth-and-ecological-crisis/#en33) [The
failure of breeder reactors for nuclear power plants highlights another
prominent technological bust, and plenty of other exotic technologies,
like fusion reactors, will inevitably end up in the same category. The
bloated profit margins of capitalism depend critically on the
energy-intensive basis of its entire existence. Take away that basis and
there is no more capitalism.]{.underline}

Arts, CJM\]

Dear Steven, I'm writing to respond to a letter you posted regarding
claims I made in the Guardian about the global poverty narrative. I'm
addressing you directly because I think it's preferable to engaging in
back-channel debates, and because I'd like to invite you to respond to
what follows. This is an important question, and it demands serious,
honest engagement. The point of my piece was that the story of global
poverty is more complex than you and Gates have been willing to
acknowledge, and the data do not support your narrative about neoliberal
globalization. Let me elaborate on my key points here, to clear up any
confusion, while also addressing your specific comments. First, the
long-term poverty graph (1820 to present) developed by Max Roser and
recently tweeted by Bill Gates is misleading and has little empirical
legitimacy. There are a few reasons for this. [Real **data on poverty
has only been collected since 1981, by the World Bank**. It is widely
accepted among those who research global poverty that **any data prior
to 1981 is simply too sketchy to be useful**]{.underline}, and going
back to as early as 1820 is more or less meaningless. The [**data for
1820--1970**]{.underline} comes from a source (Bourguignon and Morrisson
2002) that draws on the Maddison database on world GDP. That **[data was
never intended to assess poverty, but rather the distribution of GDP ---
and that for only a limited range of countries. Data for the Global
South is particularly thin]{.underline}**, and there is very little that
exists for prior to 1900. [The data is not robust enough to draw
meaningful conclusions about what was happening to people's livelihoods
during the colonial period.]{.underline} It is important to recognize
that the graph mixes two very different measures. **[The measure for
1820--1970 is based on estimates of GDP per capita, with only rough
guesses about household share]{.underline}**, and takes little if any
account of the goods and resources that people may have acquired from
their land, from trees, from forests, from rivers and the sea, and in
the form of gifts from relatives. We might try to speculate about the
share of GDP that the poorest people had, but that's very different from
telling us anything very useful about poverty. By contrast, the World
Bank's measure is based on surveys that seek to assess household income
and, wherever possible, consumption of all non-monetary goods. These two
disparate measures cannot be united into a single long-term trend and
cannot be used to draw confident conclusions. Roser's graph might make
for nice social media, but it's not rooted in science. In fact, uniting
the two methodologies is misleading in both directions. (1) By using GDP
per capita from 1820--1970, it likely understates the resources that
households had at their disposal in comparison to the representation of
the later period, and (2) By including total consumption from 1981
onward it likely overstates people's "income" in comparison to the
representation of the earlier period. The only way to construct a
legitimate long-term graph would be to use a single consistent
indicator. While data on GDP per capita alone is not regarded as a
robust way of assessing poverty, it is at least available (if too patchy
to be useful) for the whole period. But in such a graph the falloff in
poverty since 1981 would not be nearly as steep, as it would not count
non-monetary transactions. Alternatively, we could wait until someone
devises a reasonable method for measuring poverty in terms of household
consumption since 1820. But in the meantime, [I think it's wise to
refrain from making claims about long-term poverty trends that lack
empirical validity.]{.underline} You say: "Hickel's picture of the past
is a romantic fairy tale, devoid of citations or evidence." On the
contrary, as the above makes clear, it is the graph of the past on which
you so glibly rely that is devoid of meaningful evidence. As to my
actual claims about the past, my argument was straightforward. I simply
pointed out [that we **cannot ignore the fact that the period 1820 to
circa 1950 was one of violent dispossession across much of the Global
South**]{.underline}. If you have read any colonial history, you will
know [colonizers had immense difficulty getting people to work on their
mines and plantations.]{.underline} As it turns out, people tended to
prefer their subsistence lifestyles, and wages were not high enough to
induce them to leave. **[Colonizers had to coerce people]{.underline}**
into the labor market: imposing taxes, enclosing commons and
[**constraining access to food, or just outright forcing people off
their land.**]{.underline} You ask for citations. Here are some you
might try: Sven Beckert's Empire of Cotton, Ellen Wood's The Origin of
Capitalism: A Longer View, Mike Davis's Late Victorian Holocausts, Adam
Hochschild's King Leopold's Ghost, and of course Karl Polanyi's The
Great Transformation. [The process of forcibly integrating colonized
peoples into the capitalist labor system caused widespread
dislocation]{.underline} (a history I cover in The Divide). Remember,
this is the period of [the Belgian labor system in **the
Congo**]{.underline}, which [so upended local economies that 10 million
people died]{.underline} --- half the population. This is the period of
[**the Natives Land Act in South Africa**, which dispossessed the
country's black population of 90 percent]{.underline} of the country.
[This is the period of the **famines in India**, where 30 million died
needlessly as a result of policies the British imposed on Indian
agriculture.]{.underline} [This is the period of **the Opium Wars in
China** and the unequal treaties that immiserated the population. And
don't forget: **all** of this was conducted **in the name of the "free
market."**]{.underline} All of this violence, and much more, gets elided
in your narrative and repackaged as a happy story of progress. And you
say I'm the one possessed of romantic fairy tales. [The Maddison
database on which you rely might tell us **what the dispossessed gained
in GDP per capita** (eventually), but it does not tell us whether those
gains offset their loss of lands, commons, supportive communities,
stable local economies.]{.underline} And [it **tells us nothing about
what Global South economies might be like today had they been free to
industrialize on their own terms** (take the case of India, for
instance).]{.underline} Let me be clear: this is not a critique of
industrialization as such. It is a critique of how industrialization was
carried out during the period in question. [If people had willingly
opted into the capitalist labor system, while retaining rights to their
commons and while gaining a fair share of the yields they produced, we
would have a very different story on our hands]{.underline}. So let's
celebrate what industrialization has achieved --- absolutely --- but
place it in proper context: colonization, violence, dispossession, and
all. All we gain from ignoring this history is ignorance. Now, to the
present period. You say that the "massive fall of global extreme
poverty" is simply a neutral fact of the data. But here again the data
on this is more complex than you have ever acknowledged (I collaborated
with Charles Kenny to review the basics here). [**The narrative** that
you and Gates peddle **relies on a poverty line of \$1.90 per day.** You
are aware, I'm sure, that **this line is not a neutral phenomenon**,
handed down by the gods or given in nature.]{.underline} It was invented
by people, is used for particular ends, and is hotly contested both
inside and outside of academia. [Most scholars regard \$1.90 as far too
low to be meaningful]{.underline}, for reasons I have outlined in my
work many times (see here and here). See Reddy and Lahoti's withering
critique of the \$1.90 methodology here. Here are a few points to keep
in mind. Using **[the \$1.90 line shows that only 700 million people
live in poverty]{.underline}**. But note that the UN's Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that [**815 million people do not
have enough calories to sustain even "minimal" human activity. 1.5
billion are food insecure and do not have enough calories to sustain
"normal" human activity. And 2.1 billion suffer from malnutrition. How
can there be fewer poor people than hungry and malnourished people?** If
\$1.90 is inadequate to achieve basic nutrition and sustain normal human
activity, then it's too low --- period.]{.underline} It's time for you
and Gates to stop using it. Lifting people above this line doesn't mean
lifting them out of poverty, "extreme" or otherwise. Remember: \$1.90 is
the equivalent of what that amount of money could buy in the US in 2011.
The economist David Woodward once calculated that to live at this level
(in an earlier base year) would be like thirty-five people trying to
survive in Britain "on a single minimum wage, with no benefits of any
kind, no gifts, borrowing, scavenging, begging or savings to draw on
(since these are all included as 'income' in poverty calculations)."
That goes beyond any definition of "extreme." It is patently absurd. It
is an insult to humanity. In fact, even the World Bank has repeatedly
stated that the line is too low to be used in any but the poorest
countries, and should not be used to inform policy. In response to the
Atkinson Report on Global Poverty, they created updated poverty lines
for lower-middle-income (\$3.20/day) and upper-middle-income
(\$5.50/day) countries. At those lines, some 2.4 billion people are in
poverty today --- more than three times higher than you would have
people believe. But even these figures are not good enough. The USDA
states that about \$6.70/day is necessary for achieving basic nutrition.
Peter Edwards argues that people need about \$7.40 if they are to
achieve normal human life expectancy. The New Economics Foundation
concludes that around \$8 is necessary to reduce infant mortality by a
meaningful margin. Lant Pritchett and Charles Kenny have argued that
since the poverty line is based on purchasing power in the US, then it
should be linked to the US poverty line --- so around \$15/day. The
literature on this issue is now vast and nuanced --- I have only
scratched the surface here --- and yet you pretend it doesn't even
exist. That is intellectually irresponsible, and an inadequate approach
to scholarship. [You say: "The level at which one sets an arbitrary
cutoff like 'the poverty line' is irrelevant --- the entire distribution
has shifted, so the trend is the same wherever you set it."]{.underline}
Not so fast. In fact, the story changes quite a bit --- and you know it.
[If **we use \$7.40 per day, we see a decline in the proportion of
people living in poverty, but it's not nearly as dramatic as your rosy
narrative would have it.** In 1981 a staggering 71 percent lived in
poverty. Today it hovers at 58 percent (for 2013, the most recent data).
Suddenly your grand story of progress seems tepid, mediocre, and --- in
a world that's as fabulously rich as ours --- completely
obscene]{.underline}. **[There is nothing worth celebrating about a
world where inequality is so extreme that 58 percent of people are in
poverty, while a few dozen billionaires have more than all of their
wealth combined.]{.underline}** That's proportions. Don't get me wrong:
proportions are an important indicator --- and we should pay attention
to it. But absolute numbers are equally important. In fact, that is the
metric that the world's governments first agreed to target in the Rome
Declaration in 1996, the precursor to the Millennium Development Goals.
[The goalposts were shifted to proportions in the following years, which
created the impression of faster progress. But really now it's a moot
point: if the goal is to end poverty, what matters is absolute numbers.
Certainly that's what matters from the perspective of poor people
themselves.]{.underline} And [**if we look at absolute numbers, the
trend changes completely. The poverty rate has worsened dramatically
since 1981, from 3.2 billion to 4.2 billion**, according to World Bank
data. Six times higher than you would have people believe.]{.underline}
That's not progress, in my book --- that's a disgrace. It is a crushing
indictment of our global economic system, which is clearly failing the
majority of humanity. Your claims about global poverty intentionally
skate around this fact. Again, that is not responsible scholarship. But
what's really at stake here for you, as your letter reveals, is the
free-market narrative that you have constructed. Your argument is that
neoliberal capitalism is responsible for driving the most substantial
gains against poverty. This claim is intellectually dishonest, and
unsupported by facts. Here's why. **[The vast majority of gains against
poverty have happened in one region: East Asia]{.underline}**. As it
happens[, **the economic success of China and the East Asian
tigers**]{.underline} --- as scholars like Ha-Joon Chang and Robert Wade
have long pointed out --- **[is due not to the neoliberal
markets]{.underline}** that you espouse [**but** rather **state-led
industrial policy**, protectionism, and regulation]{.underline} (the
same measures that Western nations used to such great effect during
their own period of industrial consolidation). They liberalized, to be
sure --- but they did so gradually and on their own terms. [Not so for
the rest of the Global South]{.underline}. Indeed, these policy options
were systematically denied to them, and destroyed where they already
existed. From 1980 to 2000, the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank imposed brutal structural adjustment programs that did exactly the
opposite: slashing tariffs, subsidies, social spending, and capital
controls while reversing land reforms and privatizing public assets ---
all in the face of massive public resistance. During this period, the
number of people in poverty outside China increased by 1.3 billion. In
fact, even the proportion of people living in poverty (to use your
preferred method) increased, from 62 percent to 68 percent. (For
detailed economic data and references to the relevant literature, see
Chapter 5 of The Divide.) In other words, the imposition of neoliberal
capitalism from 1980 to 2000 made the poverty rate worse, not better.
Since 2000, the most impressive gains against poverty (outside of East
Asia) have come from Latin America, according to the World Bank,
coinciding with a series of left-wing or social-democratic governments
that came to power across the continent. Whatever one might say about
these governments (I have my own critiques), this doesn't sit very well
with your neoliberal narrative. But there is something else that needs
to be said here. You and Gates like to invoke the poverty numbers to
make claims about the legitimacy of the existing global economic system.
You say the system is working for the poor, so people should stop
complaining about it. When it comes to assessing such a claim, it's
really neither absolute numbers nor proportions that matter. What
matters, rather, is the extent of global poverty vis-à-vis our capacity
to end it. As I have pointed out before, [**our capacity to end
poverty** (e.g., the cost of ending poverty as a proportion of the
income of the non-poor) **has increased many times faster than the
proportional poverty rate has decreased**]{.underline} (to use your
preferred measure again). By this metric we are doing worse than ever
before. Indeed, [our civilization is regressing. Why? Because **the vast
majority of the yields of our global economy are being captured by the
world's rich**.]{.underline} As I pointed out in the Guardian piece,
[only 5 percent of new income from global growth goes to the poorest 60
percent of humanity --- people living on less than \$7.40/day. You have
neither acknowledged this as a problem nor attempted to defend
it]{.underline}. Instead you just ignore it, I suppose because it
undermines your claims about how well the economy is working for poor
people. Here's how well it's working: on our existing trajectory,
**[according to research published in the World Economic Review, it will
take more than one hundred years to end poverty at \$1.90/day and over
two hundred years to end it at \$7.40/day.]{.underline}** Let that sink
in. And to get there with the existing system --- in other words,
[**without a fairer distribution of income --- we will have to grow the
global economy to 175 times its present size.**]{.underline} Even if
[s**uch an outlandish feat**]{.underline} were possible, it [**would
drive climate change and ecological breakdown to the point of
undermining any gains** against poverty.]{.underline} It doesn't have to
be this way, of course. We can end poverty right now simply by making
the rules of our global economy fairer for the world's majority (I
describe how we can do this in The Divide, looking at everything from
wages to debt to trade). But that is an approach that you and Gates seem
desperate to avoid, in favor of a blustering defense of the status quo.
[You say,]{.underline} "The drastic decline in extreme poverty is
corroborated by measures of well-being other than income that are
correlated with prosperity, such as longevity, child mortality, maternal
mortality, literacy, basic education, undernourishment, consumption,
etc." Yes, [life expectancy, mortality, and education have
improved]{.underline} --- this is fantastic news that we should
celebrate! But, a few things: (1) You can't make an argument about
poverty by pointing to something else entirely. Consumption is
increasing, yes. But that's not what's at stake here. What's at stake is
whether consumption is increasing enough to raise people out of poverty.
(2) [I'll be the first to agree that income and consumption are not the
only measures of well-being. But one reason they are absolutely crucial
is because they allow us to assess inequality in the distribution of
world resources. **A higher life expectancy among the poor is no
justification for condemning them to a tiny and ever-shrinking share of
global income.**]{.underline} That is not a morally defensible position.
(3) In your work [you have invoked gains in life expectancy and
education as part of a narrative that seeks to justify neoliberal
globalization]{.underline}. But here again that's intellectually
dishonest. [What contributes most to improvements in life expectancy are
in fact simple public health interventions (sanitation, antibiotics,
vaccines), and what matters for education is, well, public
education]{.underline}. Indeed, the countries that have been most
successful at this are those that have robust, free health care and
education. Don't forget that [the US has worse infant mortality than
Cuba.]{.underline} (4) As for hunger, your claim here relies on a
methodology used by the FAO after 2012 that has been widely criticized
by scholars. The hunger-reduction narrative depends on a calorie line
that --- like your \$1.90 poverty line --- is too low to support normal
human activity, ignores the impacts of food price crises, and tells us
nothing about nutrient deficiencies. I cover this in detail in the
second half of this paper. According to the FAO's earlier methodology,
both the number and proportion of people in hunger was higher in 2009
than in 1995 --- another trend that you glibly ignore. In your
concluding point, you descend to citing a piece by Ryan Bourne, not an
academic who studies poverty but rather an employee of the Cato
Institute, a right-wing think tank funded by the Koch Brothers. The
piece is riddled with misleading claims which, when I pointed them out
to him, he never corrected. I don't think we should consider this a
valid source. You opened your letter by slandering me as a "Marxist
ideologue." I don't need to tell you that this doesn't count as an
argument, and doesn't cover for the fact that you haven't addressed any
of my substantive claims. In any case, I'm not quite sure what you mean.
If by Marxist ideologue you mean someone who points out that the poverty
data is more complex than your narrative allows, then, well, I suppose I
am.

## Alternative -- K

### Revolutionary Theory -- Alt

#### **The alternative is a commitment to a marxist revolutionary theory that connects in solidarity with anti-capitalist movements that are rising all over the globe. Building solidarity through different sphere of productions is key -- communism emerges out of the dialectical movement of labour and resistance that continually challenge capitalism through strategic interventions at every level of society. Centering the structure of capitalism is critical to organizing class resistance and building enduring political forms of communism.** 

**Harvey 09** (David-Harvey;  British Marxist economic geographer and
professor of anthropology and geography at CUNY, 12/16/09, "Organizing
for the Anti-Capitalist Transition",
<http://davidharvey.org/2009/12/organizing-for-the-anti-capitalist-transition/>)

**[The difference between socialism and communism is worth noting.
Socialism aims to democratically manage and regulate capitalism in ways
that calm its excesses and redistribute its benefits for the common
good. It is about spreading the wealth around through progressive
taxation arrangements while basic needs -- such as education, health
care and even housing -- are provided by the state out of reach of
market forces. Many of the key achievements of redistributive socialism
in the period after 1945, not only in Europe but beyond, have become so
socially embedded as to be immune from neoliberal
assault.]{.underline}** Even in the United States, Social Security and
Medicare are extremely popular programs that right wing forces find it
almost impossible to dislodge. The Thatcherites in Britain could not
touch national health care except at the margins. Social provision in
Scandinavia and most of Western Europe seems to be an unshakable
bed-rock of the social order. Communism, on the other hand, seeks to
displace capitalism by creating an entirely different mode of both
production and distribution of goods and services. **[In the history of
actually existing communism, social control over production, exchange
and distribution meant state control and systematic state planning. In
the long-run this proved to be unsuccessful]{.underline}** though,
interestingly, its conversion in China (and its earlier adoption in
places like Singapore) has proven far more successful than the pure
neoliberal model in generating capitalist growth for reasons that cannot
be elaborated upon here. Contemporary attempts to revive the communist
hypothesis typically abjure state control and look to other forms of
collective social organization to displace market forces and capital
accumulation as the basis for organizing production and distribution.
Horizontally networked as opposed to hierarchically commanded systems of
coordination between autonomously organized and self-governing
collectives of producers and consumers are envisaged as lying at the
core of a new form of communism. Contemporary technologies of
communication make such a system seem feasible. All manner of
small-scale experiments around the world can be found in which such
economic and political forms are being constructed. In this there is a
convergence of some sort between the Marxist and anarchist traditions
that harks back to the broadly collaborative situation between them in
the 1860s in Europe. While nothing is certain, it could be that 2009
marks the beginning of a prolonged shake out in which the question of
grand and far-reaching alternatives to capitalism will step-by-step
bubble up to the surface in one part of the world or another. The longer
the uncertainty and the misery is prolonged, the more the legitimacy of
the existing way of doing business will be questioned and the more the
demand to build something different will escalate. Radical as opposed to
band-aid reforms to patch up the financial system may seem more
necessary**[. The uneven development of capitalist practices throughout
the world has produced, moreover, anti-capitalist movements all over the
place. The state-centric economies of much of East Asia generate
different discontents (as in Japan and China) compared to the churning
anti-neoliberal struggles occurring throughout much of Latin America
where the Bolivarian revolutionary movement of popular power exists in a
peculiar relationship to capitalist class interests that have yet to be
truly confronted. Differences over tactics and policies in response to
the crisis among the states that make up the European Union are
increasing]{.underline}** even as a second attempt to come up with a
unified EU constitution is under way. **[Revolutionary and resolutely
anti-capitalist movements are also to be found, though not all of them
are of a progressive sort, in many of the marginal zones of capitalism.
Spaces have been opened up within which something radically different in
terms of dominant social relations, ways of life, productive capacities
and mental conceptions of the world can flourish.]{.underline}** This
applies as much to the Taliban and to communist rule in Nepal as to the
Zapatistas in Chiapas and indigenous movements in Bolivia, the Maoist
movements in rural India, even as they are world's apart in objectives,
strategies and tactics. The central problem is that in aggregate there
is no resolute and **[sufficiently unified anti-capitalist movement that
can adequately challenge the reproduction of the capitalist class and
the perpetuation of its power on the world stage. Neither is there any
obvious way to attack the bastions of privilege for capitalist elites or
to curb their inordinate money power and military might. While openings
exist towards some alternative social order, no one really knows where
or what it is. But just because there is no political force capable of
articulating let alone mounting such a program, this is no reason to
hold back on outlining alternatives.]{.underline}** Lenin's famous
question "what is to be done?" cannot be answered, to be sure, without
some sense of who it is might do it where. But a global anti-capitalist
movement is unlikely to emerge without some animating vision of what is
to be done and why. A double blockage exists: the lack of an alternative
vision prevents the formation of an oppositional movement, while the
absence of such a movement precludes the articulation of an alternative.
How, then, can this blockage be transcended? The relation between the
vision of what is to be done and why, and the formation of a political
movement across particular places to do it has to be turned into a
spiral. Each has to reinforce the other if anything is actually to get
done. Otherwise potential opposition will be forever locked down into a
closed circle that frustrates all prospects for constructive change,
leaving us vulnerable to perpetual future crises of capitalism with
increasingly deadly results. Lenin's question demands an answer. The
central problem to be addressed is clear enough. Compound growth for
ever is not possible and the troubles that have beset the world these
last thirty years signal that a limit is looming to continuous capital
accumulation that cannot be transcended except by creating fictions that
cannot last. Add to this the facts that so many people in the world live
in conditions of abject poverty, that environmental degradations are
spiraling out of control, that human dignities are everywhere being
offended even as the rich are piling up more and more wealth (the number
of billionaires in India doubled last year from 27 to 52) under their
command and that the levers of political, institutional, judicial,
military and media power are under such tight but dogmatic political
control as to be incapable of doing much more than perpetuating the
status quo and frustrating discontent. **[A revolutionary politics that
can grasp the nettle of endless compound capital accumulation and
eventually shut it down as the prime motor of human history, requires a
sophisticated understanding of how social change occurs. The failings of
past endeavors to build a lasting socialism and communism have to be
avoided and lessons from that immensely complicated history must be
learned. Yet the absolute necessity for a coherent anti-capitalist
revolutionary movement must also be recognized. The fundamental aim of
that movement is to assume social command over both the production and
distribution of surpluses. We urgently need an explicit revolutionary
theory suited to our times. I propose a "co-revolutionary theory"
derived from an understanding of Marx's account of how capitalism arose
out of feudalism. Social change arises through the dialectical unfolding
of relations between seven moments within the body politic of capitalism
viewed as an ensemble or assemblage of activities and practices: a)
technological and organizational forms of production, exchange and
consumption b) relations to nature c) social relations between people d)
mental conceptions of the world, embracing knowledges and cultural
understandings and beliefs e) labor processes and production of specific
goods, geographies, services or affects]{.underline}** f )
institutional, legal and governmental arrangements g) the conduct of
daily life that underpins social reproduction. Each one of these moments
is internally dynamic and internally marked by tensions and
contradictions (just think of mental conceptions of the world) but all
of them are co-dependent and co-evolve in relation to each other. The
transition to capitalism entailed a mutually supporting movement across
all seven moments. New technologies could not be identified and
practices without new mental conceptions of the world (including that of
the relation to nature and social relations). Social theorists have the
habit of taking just one of the these moments and viewing it as the
"silver bullet" that causes all change. We have technological
determinists (Tom Friedman), environmental determinists (Jarad Diamond),
daily life determinists (Paul Hawkin), labor process determinists (the
autonomistas), institutionalists, and so on and so forth. They are all
wrong. It is the dialectical motion across all of these moments that
really counts even as there is uneven development in that motion.
**[When capitalism itself undergoes one of its phases of renewal, it
does so precisely by co-evolving all moments, obviously not without
tensions, struggles, fights and contradictions. But consider how these
seven moments were configured around 1970 before the neoliberal surge
and consider how they look now and you will see they have all changed in
ways that re-define the operative characteristics of capitalism viewed
as a non-Hegelian totality. An anti-capitalist political movement can
start anywhere (in labor processes, around mental conceptions, in the
relation to nature, in social relations, in the design of revolutionary
technologies and organizational forms, out of daily life or through
attempts to reform institutional and administrative structures including
the reconfiguration of state powers). The trick is to keep the political
movement moving from one moment to another in mutually reinforcing
ways]{.underline}**. **[This was how capitalism arose out of feudalism
and this is how something radically different called communism,
socialism or whatever must arise out of capitalism. Previous attempts to
create a communist or socialist alternative fatally failed to keep the
dialectic between the different moments in motion and failed to embrace
the unpredictabilities and uncertainties in the dialectical movement
between them. Capitalism has survived precisely by keeping the
dialectical movement between the moments going and constructively
embracing the inevitable tensions, including crises, that result. Change
arises, of course, out of an existing state of affairs and it has to
harness the possibilities immanent within an existing
situation.]{.underline}** Since the existing situation varies enormously
from Nepal, to the Pacific regions of Bolivia, to the deindustrializing
cities of Michigan and the still booming cities of Mumbai and Shanghai
and the shaken but by no means destroyed financial centers of New York
and London, so all manner of experiments in social change in different
places and at different geographical scales are both likely and
potentially illuminating as ways to make (or not make) another world
possible. And in each instance it may seem as if one or other aspect of
the existing situation holds the key to a different political future.
**[But the first rule for a global anti-capitalist movement must be:
never rely on the unfolding dynamics of one moment without carefully
calibrating how relations with all the others are adapting and
reverberating. Feasible future possibilities arise out of the existing
state of relations between the different moments. Strategic political
interventions within and across the spheres can gradually move the
social order onto a different developmental path.]{.underline}** This is
what wise leaders and forward looking institutions do all the time in
local situations, so there is no reason to think there is anything
particularly fantastic or utopian about acting in this way. The left has
to look to build alliances between and across those working in the
distinctive spheres. An **[anti-capitalist movement has to be far
broader than groups mobilizing around social relations or over questions
of daily life in themselves. Traditional hostilities between, for
example, those with technical, scientific and administrative expertise
and those animating social movements on the ground have to be addressed
and overcome. We now have to hand, in the example of the climate change
movement, a significant example of how such alliances can begin to work.
In this instance the relation to nature is the beginning point, but
everyone realizes that something has to give on all the other moments
and while there is a wishful politics that wants to see the solution as
purely technological, it becomes clearer by the day that daily life,
mental conceptions, institutional arrangements, production processes and
social relations have to be involved. And all of that means a movement
to restructure capitalist society as a whole and to confront the growth
logic that underlies the problem in the first place.]{.underline}**
There have, however, to be, some loosely agreed upon common objectives
in any transitional movement. Some general guiding norms can be set
down. These might include (and I just float these norms here for
discussion) respect for nature, radical egalitarianism in social
relations, institutional arrangements based in some sense of common
interests and common property, democratic administrative procedures (as
opposed to the monetized shams that now exist), labor processes
organized by the direct producers, daily life as the free exploration of
new kinds of social relations and living arrangements, mental
conceptions that focus on self-realization in service to others and
technological and organizational innovations oriented to the pursuit of
the common good rather than to supporting militarized power,
surveillance and corporate greed. These could be the co-revolutionary
points around which social action could converge and rotate. Of course
this is utopian! But so what! We cannot afford not to be. Let me detail
one particular aspect of the problem which arise in the place where I
work. Ideas have consequences and false ideas can have devastating
consequences. Policy failures based on erroneous economic thinking
played a crucial role in both the run-up to the debacle of the 1930s and
in the seeming inability to find an adequate way out. Though there is no
agreement among historians and economists as to exactly what policies
failed, it is agreed that the knowledge structure through which the
crisis was understood needed to be revolutionized. Keynes and his
colleagues accomplished that task. But by the mid-1970s, it became clear
that the Keynesian policy tools were no longer working at least in the
way they were being applied and it was in this context that monetarism,
supply-side theory and the (beautiful) mathematical modelling of
micro-economic market behaviors supplanted broad-brush macro-economic
Keynesian thinking. The monetarist and narrower neoliberal theoretical
frame that dominated after 1980 is now in question. In fact it has
disastrously failed. We need new mental conceptions to understand the
world. What might these be and who will produce them, given both the
sociological and intellectual malaise that hangs over knowledge
production and (equally important) dissemination more generally? The
deeply entrenched mental conceptions associated with neoliberal theories
and the neoliberalization and corporatization of the universities and
the media has played more than a trivial role in the production of the
present crisis. For example, the whole question of what to do about the
financial system, the banking sector, the state-finance nexus and the
power of private property rights, cannot be broached without going
outside of the box of conventional thinking**[. For this to happen will
require a revolution in thinking, in places as diverse as the
universities, the media and government as well as within the financial
institutions themselves. Karl Marx, while not in any way inclined to
embrace philosophical idealism, held that ideas are a material force in
history. Mental conceptions constitute, after all, one of the seven

#### Critical Pedagogy Is key -- the alternative calls for solidarity through grass roots political movements that mobilize spaces of education microcosms of a broader struggle against capitalism.

[PPAE is a book of pedagogical theory (and in the spirit of
revolutionary critical pedagogy, performative acts of polemic should be
included within the field of theory proper), but as McLaren and
Jaramillo put it, this book's work is not intended "as grist for
advancing our careers in the academy but as a way of participating in a
wider political project in which we attempt (to echo Henry Giroux) to
make the pedagogical more politically informed and the political more
pedagogically critical" (p. 6). ]{.underline}Thus, McLaren and
Jaramillo's collaborations, though often conceptually and linguistically
dense, are not to be mistaken as yet another speculatory exercise in
pedagogical pontification about the problems of schools or how to
reconstruct them so as to emancipate their democratic potentials. [This
is not a Cartesian mediation on social reconstructionism, but an organic
attempt to **articulate a burgeoning worldwide standpoint theory born of
class warfare and other forms of transnational oppression that produce
the dehumanization of global society**. ]{.underline}Supporting this
claim are a variety of personal photos included as textual bookends
(which chronicle the authors' journeys and meetings with key
figures/groups over the last five years in places such as the Middle
East, Africa, and Latin America) that are emblematic of how McLaren and
Jaramillo have begun to construct a critical revolutionary pedagogy that
both walks its talk and makes its road by walking it. Indeed, the images
in PPAE undoubtedly gesture stylistically to those taken of Guevara
during his travels -- portraits produced to express the themes of unity,
companionship and the vital embodiment of collective struggle, what Ché
and Freire each meant in their respective ideas of a materialized
"revolutionary love" (McLaren, 2000). It should be observed that PPAE's
emblematic cover art, produced by Erin Currier, a mural of stirring
revolutionary portraits of everyday warrior women of color (which serve
as necessary expansions of the legacies that otherwise tend to brandish
names such as Zapata and Villa), similarly helps to evoke the potential
beauty and dignity of the historical struggle from below as refleshed
socialist passions in the face of the transnational imperialist
enterprise. [It is crucial, then, to recognize the extent to which PPAE
attempts to both **theorize and enact a critical revolutionary
pedagogy** that, as Gregory Martin (2005) describes, is "a radical shift
of social priorities...that **seeks to enrich the knowledge base of
grassroots political movements through the development of social
relations** (labour practices) **that encourage critical analysis,
genuine dialogue and problem solving based upon people\'s everyday
knowledge of capitalism."**]{.underline} When most progressive academics
are still engaged in coffee talk over how to better involve the local
community in campus life, McLaren and Jaramillo appear to have leapt
over imperialist barricades in order to speak with and forge a wider
resistance to present-day colonialist domination agendas. [In short,
with PPAE they provide a living example of how a **forged solidarity
between critical educators, political activists in social movements**,
informed workers of the world, and others involved in the growing
struggle against imperial capitalism can be the **fertile ground in
which critical revolutionary pedagogy can become rooted and begin to
sprout**. ]{.underline}By articulating a global working-class
standpoint, McLaren and Jaramillo are essentially tracing the objective
structures of global capitalism that have come to organize geo-political
versions of the modern state as well as the social conditions of local
communities across the planet. Further, by aligning their perspectives
on the margins of global imperialism, their theoretical work provides an
anthropological grounding that allows the authors to gain a variety of
outsider-within critical ideational status on the contradictions of
global capitalism that are at work within the U.S. presently. [PPAE
thusly spends a good amount of energy calling out and identifying these
dehumanizing aspects of the U.S. corporate-state-military-academic
complex which include, according to McLaren and Jaramillo, the
institution of a state of permanent war (p. 35), a rightist fomenting of
anti-immigration and other xenophobic attitudes throughout society (p.
99), the rise of anti-bilingual/multicultural efforts in educational
policy such as NCLB (p. 76), the corporate media and culture industry's
complicity in the erosion of an educated civil society (p. 49), the
blatant classism and racism underlying the Bush administration's
response to hurricane Katrina (p. 8), and the ecological genocide that
is a direct result of predatory capitalist expansion at all costs (p.
17). In opposition PPAE hopes to bear witness to the birth and
maturation of a movement within the field of education that viscerally
realizes "**the need for a new critical humanist pedagogy, an approach
to reading the world and the world that puts the struggle against
capitalism (and the imperialism inherent in it) at the center of the
pedagogical project, a project that is powered by the oxygen of
socialism's universal quest for human freedom and social justice"** (p.
20).]{.underline} Again, McLaren and Jaramillo's mapping of the domestic
contradictions of global capitalism evident here in the U.S. is
importantly not limited by a parochial view of the matter. Rather, the
spirit of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela, the work of critical
educators in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the historical legacy of an ongoing
attempt for an emancipated Cuba animates the collective thrust of the
book's thesis. For McLaren and Jaramillo, such sites are not isolated
instances of a controlled alternative to the capitalist form of life.
They clearly delineate a burgeoning constellation of socialist
resistance that is the movementgenerated possibility of another world
beyond the paltry business-class-as-usual driven political openings for
change in the social and educational structure of the United
States. [Drawing from the energy of the international workers movements,
McLaren and Jaramillo want also to re-organize a worldwide front of
critical, popular educators who will comprise an "educational left" (pp.
34-64) that works in concert with extrainstitutional revolutionary
forces]{.underline}. One task this educational left has is to provide a
map of the neoliberal educational landscape that highlights how the
stranglehold of a corporate media oligarchy continues to distribute
public knowledge through strong ideological filters, how standardized
educational curricula have ossified into the normative goal of education
and how the systematic segregation of people of color in schools all
challenge both leftist educators and society generally with complicated
and urgent problems. Therefore, McLaren and Jaramillo ask: "How can
critical educators reinvigorate the civil societarian left precisely at
a time when we are creating a world where elites are less accountable to
civil society than ever before?" (p. 52). According to the authors the
answer to this question lies largely in the potential for generating
concrete revolutionary critical pedagogy, [which means going beyond
progressive constructivist curricular methods towards developing
socialist sensibilities throughout the institution of public schooling
by conscientizing "teachers, students, families and other cultural
workers" (p. 63).]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Alt

#### Worldwide movement is possible\-\--[latent discontent]{.underline} is mounting but unifying under [collective struggle]{.underline} is a [historical necessity]{.underline} to [preserve humanity]{.underline}. 

**Foster \'19** \[John Bellamy; 2/1/19; Professor of Sociology at the
University of Oregon, PhD in Political Science from York University,
President and Board Member of the Monthly Review; \"Capitalism Has
Failed---What Next?\"
https://monthlyreview.org/2019/02/01/capitalism-has-failed-what-next/\]

Indeed, [history has been unkind to all such attempts to provide
detailed forecasts of the future]{.underline}, particularly if they
simply extend current trends and leave the bulk of humanity and their
struggles out of the picture. [It is for this reason that a
**dialectical view** is so important. The actual course of history can
**never be predicted**. The only thing certain about **historical
change** is the **existence** of the **struggles** that drive it forward
and that guarantee its discontinuous character. Both **implosions** and
**explosions** inevitably materialize, rendering the **world** for new
generations **different** than that of the old. History points to
**numerous social systems** that have **reached** the **limits** of
their ability to **adapt** their **social relations**]{.underline} to
allow for the rational and sustainable use of developing productive
forces. [Hence, the human past is dotted by **periods of regression**,
followed by **revolutionary accelerations**]{.underline} that sweep all
before them. As the conservative historian Jacob Burckhardt declared in
the nineteenth century, "a historical crisis" occurs when "a crisis in
the whole state of things is produced, involving whole epochs and all or
many peoples of the same civilization.... The historical process is
suddenly accelerated in terrifying fashion. Developments which otherwise
take centuries seem to flit by like phantoms in months or weeks, and are
fulfilled." He called this the "acceleration of historical processes."91

Burckhardt principally had in mind social revolutions, like the French
Revolution of 1789. This was an acceleration of history that, as the
modern French historian Georges Lefebvre explained, commenced as a
series of widening revolutions, mutating with terrifying speed, from an
aristocratic revolution to a bourgeois revolution to a popular
revolution and then a peasant revolution---finally taking on the
character of a historic "bloc, a single thing," seemingly unconquerable,
which reshaped much of world history.92

Could such a revolutionary acceleration of history, though on an
incomparably greater scale, happen in the twenty-first century? Most
establishment commentators in the hegemonic countries of the world
imperialist system would say no, based on their own narrow experience
and limited view of history. Nevertheless, [**revolutions** continue to
**break out** in the periphery of the world system]{.underline} and are,
even now, only put down by imperialist economic, political, and military
interventions. Moreover, [the **failure of capitalism** on a **planetary
scale** today **threatens all of civilization and life** on the
planet]{.underline} as we know it. [If **drastic changes** are not made,
**global temperature** this century will increase by 4° or even
6°C]{.underline} from preindustrial times, [leading to conditions that
will **imperil humankind**]{.underline} as a whole. Meanwhile, the
extreme capitalism of today seeks to expropriate and enclose all the
bases of material existence, siphoning off almost the entire net social
surplus and robbing the natural environment for the direct benefit of a
miniscule few.

[As a **direct result** of capitalist social relations, the **material
challenges** now facing humanity are greater than anything
ever]{.underline} seen before, [pointing to an **accumulation of
catastrophe** along with the **accumulation of capital**]{.underline}.93
[Hundreds of millions of people]{.underline} under these circumstances
[are already being **drawn into struggles** with the system, creating
the **basis** of a new **worldwide movement** toward
socialism]{.underline}. In his book [Can the Working Class Change the
World?]{.underline} Yates answers [**yes**, it can. But]{.underline} it
can [only]{.underline} do so [through a **unifying struggle** by workers
and peoples]{.underline} aimed at genuine socialism.94

[It may be **objected** that socialism has been tried and has failed and
hence **no longer exists** as an **alternative**]{.underline}. However,
[like the earliest attempts at capitalism]{.underline} in the Italian
city-states of the late Middle Ages, [which were **not strong enough**
to survive]{.underline} amongst the [feudal societies]{.underline} that
surrounded them, [the failure of the first experiments at socialism
presage nothing but its **eventual rebirth** in a new, **more
revolutionary**, **more universal** form, which examines and learns from
the failures]{.underline}.95 [Even in failure, socialism has this
advantage over capitalism: it is motivated by the demand for "freedom in
general," rooted in substantive equality]{.underline} and sustainable
human development---reflecting precisely those collective social
relations, [borne of **historical necessity** and the unending struggle
for human freedom, **crucial** to **human survival**]{.underline} in our
time.96

The great conservative economist Joseph Schumpeter, who, as Austrian
finance minister in Red Vienna, had allied himself for a time with the
socialist government and found himself attacked on all sides, once wrote
that [capitalism would perish not because of "the weight of economic
failure," but rather because its "very success" in pursuing its **narrow
economic ends**, had **undermined** the **sociological foundations** of
its existence. Capitalism]{.underline}, Schumpeter exclaimed,
["'inevitably' creates conditions in which it will not be able to
live]{.underline} and which strongly point to socialism as its heir
apparent."97 He was, it turns out, in many ways correct, though not
entirely in the way he expected. [The **global development** of
**monopoly capitalism** and **financialization** spearheaded by the very
same counterrevolutionary neoliberalism]{.underline} that first arose in
response to Red Vienna in the interwar years---at a time when Schumpeter
himself was a major actor---[has now undermined the material bases, not
so much of capitalism itself, but of global society and planetary
ecology. The result has been the emergence of an "atmosphere of almost
**universal hostility**" to the **prevailing social
order**]{.underline}, though, playing out in the confused context of the
present, less as opposition to capitalism itself than to
neoliberalism.98

[It is capitalism's undermining of the very basis of human existence
that will eventually **compel** the world's **workers** and **peoples**
to **seek new roads forward**. An **inclusive**, **class-based
movement** toward socialism in this century will **open up the
possibility** of qualitative **new developments** that the **anarchy**
of the capitalist-market society with its **monopolistic competition**,
**extreme inequality**, and **institutionalized greed** cannot possibly
offer]{.underline}.99 This includes the development of a socialist
technology, in which both the forms of technology utilized and the
purposes to which they are put are channeled in social directions, as
opposed to individual and class gain.100 [It introduces the prospect of
long-term **democratic planning** at all levels of society, allowing
decisions to be made and distributions to occur outside the logic of the
cash nexus]{.underline}.101 Socialism, in its most radical form, is
about substantive equality, community solidarity, and ecological
sustainability; it is aimed at the unification---not simply
division---of labor.

### NATO -- Alt

#### The alternative solves -- movements for peace are empirically successful against NATO's projects of militarism as activists are gaining momentum.

**Campbell 19** (Horace, Professor of African American Studies and
Political Science @ Syracuse University, "Global NATO: A 70-Year
Alliance of Oppressors in Crisis", Counter Punch, April 9)

NATO and the peace Movement in the USA

[The US military has been degraded by the humiliations in the war on
terror and the fact that many of the youths do not support the global
military campaign. The revolt of the youth in the Occupy Wall Street
Movement, #Black Lives matter, #MeTooMovement, along with new movements
such as the environmental justice movement and the other progressive
forces dictate that drone warfare, brain hacking and cyber warfare
become the choice tactics for contemporary militarism. The reversals for
the US military did not come about by accident]{.underline} and although
the US boasts the strongest military force in the world, the military
has suffered massive morale problems compounded by the fact that in many
communities where veterans come from now suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). With the rise in mental illness from veterans,
[young US citizens have no appetite for war.]{.underline} It is for
these reasons why the [peace and justice forces are not simply going to
discussions on the anniversary of NATO, but thoughtful commentators are
exposing the massive corruption of the military and Wall
Street.]{.underline} The revelations of the 'bottomless pit of the
Pentagon's budget' do not fully grasp the centrality of the US military
in the maintenance of the dollar. \[25\] Matt Taibbi has done excellent
journalistic work on the massive corruption of Wall Street, but the
connection was not made to NATO, the weaponization of Finance and global
racism. One hundred years ago W.E.B Dubois warned of the racist motives
behind imperial wars when he noted, "What do nations care about the cost
of war, if by spending a few hundred millions in steel and gunpowder
they can gain a thousand millions in diamonds and cocoa? How can love of
humanity appeal as a motive to nations whose love of luxury is built on
the inhuman exploitation of human beings, and who, especially in recent
years, have been taught to regard these human beings as inhuman." \[26\]

[Global NATO is now the front for chauvinism, the ideals of white
supremacy, islamophobia and hegemonic masculinity.]{.underline} It is
among the peoples of African descent where NATO has been weakest over
the past 70 years. [The Black Liberation Movement understood the
linkages between the false flag operations internationally and the war
against those fighting against racism in the USA.]{.underline} This
movement had been [at the forefront of breaking the legitimacy of the
war scare and the apartheid ideas of the US ruling class.]{.underline}
In the present period, [there are efforts to mobilize a small section of
the black bourgeoisie to be in the room for the planning for the
weaponization of everything, but Jim Crow habits and ideas die hard,
hence the political leadership remains in the hands of the
anti-imperialist and ant racist factions within the USA.]{.underline} It
is this force that is still [calling for the dismantling of
NATO]{.underline} just as it continues to oppose the African arm of NATO
called AFRICOM.

[The progressive forces in all parts of the world must oppose the
sanctions and militarism]{.underline} against Iran [because]{.underline}
this [war has all of the hallmarks of escalating and cascading far
beyond]{.underline} Iran. The exposure of the impact of Stuxnet (Code
named Operation Olympic Games) has not been fully discussed by the
progressives who are calling for the dismantling of NATO. The
interconnections between the militarists of Saudi Arabia along with the
Israeli lobby and those who are setting the belligerent tone of the US
against China in the South China Sea can be seen from the output of some
of the Washington think tanks, from the Islamophobia forces, and from
the branches of the armaments culture that thrive on war.

During the wars against the people of Vietnam, the peace and justice
forces matured and developed tactics to educate all sections of the
society. These tactics survived to educate the population on the lies
that were being peddled to embark on the occupation of Iraq. Despite the
humiliation of wasting thousands of lives and expending trillions of
dollars in useless war, the impetus for war is so ingrained that United
States is being pushed on to another war. [The difference for the war
planners at this moment is that the combined forces of peace and social
justice forces are much stronger than the pessimists make
out.]{.underline}

The African dimensions of the anti-militarist campaign

Many on the left in the United States and Europe are holding discussions
on the 70th anniversary of NATO but few if any of the Left commentaries
have implicated NATO in Africa and the global expansion of racism and
Islamophobia are now writing to oppose the war plans by the Israeli-
lobby in the USA. However, because the commentaries excluded Africa
there is no appreciation of how the revolutionary upsurges in all parts
of Africa have sharpened the alternatives in Africa and the constant
struggles of the youth for a new social system. The current struggles of
the workers and youths of Algeria is only the recent manifestation of
the turbulence in Africa which had been called the 'Arab Spring.' NATO
has collaborated with dictators such as the Field Marshall in Egypt to
derail the revolutionary upsurge in Egypt.

During the 20th century in every revolutionary situation, capital
fomented war to weaken the revolutionary forces. The pace of change in
Africa has created nervousness in the West and the deployment of French
troops and AFRICOM is meant to contain the mobilization and organization
of the oppressed in Africa. Workers of European descent are being lulled
by white supremacy, the terrorist scare and humanitarian interventions
to support the new military policies of global capitalism. The objective
conditions of real exploitation in Africa intensify social struggles for
better conditions so that the contours of revolutionary change will
expand. Thus, while the media insists on delinking the Algerian,
Egyptian and Tunisian revolts from the wider African struggles by
writing on the 'Arab spring,' worker protests enveloped numerous African
states with those such as the struggles in Swaziland, Uganda, Burkina
Faso, Gabon, Kenya, Senegal, Mali, South Africa, Nigeria and Ethiopia
percolating, awaiting the right moment for the maturation of the global
anti-imperialist and anti-racist forces.

It is from Africa where there is clarity on the tasks ahead. Reflecting
on the challenges and opportunities, the late Samir Amin had called for
'Audacity and more audacity.' In calling for the socialization of the
'ownership of the monopolies,' Amin spelt out how 'the historical
circumstances created by the implosion of contemporary capitalism
requires the radical left, in the North as well as the South, to be bold
in formulating its political alternative to the existing system.' While
economists in North America continuously complain that the barons of
Wall Street socialize losses while privatizing profits, Samir Amin spelt
out in great details for citizens of all continents,

['the alternative social project should be to reverse the direction of
the current social order (social disorder) produced by the strategies of
monopolies, in order to ensure maximum and stabilized employment, and to
ensure decent wages growing in parallel with the productivity of social
labor. This objective is simply impossible without the expropriation of
the power of monopolies.']{.underline}

If one reads an economist such as Samir Amin and others who are
progressive (in the US context) one can see that Amin is drawing from
the depth of the oppression on the world scale to elaborate
alternatives. The challenge of the left is to understand the outline of
the alternative social project and translate this into practical day to
day programs so that wherever one lives and works one should not succumb
to despair and pessimism. It is in the midst of this suffering where the
discussions on the future of NATO is taking place. The power of US
imperialism dictates that in all corners of the world humans are paying
attention to the twists and turns of the political leadership of the USA
in the midst of the extended capitalist recession since 2008. Our
intervention stressed the importance of the weaponization of finance
that thrust NATO to the forefront of the military management of the
international system. Sections of the progressive forces in Europe are
tinkering at the edges of this management seeking to carve out a space
for the EU in Africa but this author will argue that that the calls for
reform miss the essential militaristic nature of capitalism and that
only a break with the system will avoid all-out war. Samir Amin in his
input on "Financial Collapse, Systemic crisis? Illusory answers and
necessary answers," warned humanity,

If the USA has formulated an objective of military control of the
planet, it is because, without it, they cannot secure the exclusive
access to these resources. As we know: China, India and the South as a
whole need them as well for their development. For the USA, they must
limit the access and ultimately, there is only one means: war.\[27\]

Progressives must brace for intensified struggles

In the final analysis we must go back to the Middle East where an
alliance between women in Bahrain, Israel, Yemen, Iran and Saudi Arabia
holds promise for a new platform. The women of Egypt gave us that notice
when they mobilized to come out in forces across religious and class
lines. These women are opposed to fundamentalist who want women to cover
up but will disrobe them and beat them if they fight for their rights.
This new mobilization of progressive women can now be seen in the
politics of the USA where a new generation is maturing with new skills
to fully mobilize against the NATO and the Pentagon. What remains to be
seen is whether these forces will oppose the massive expenditures of the
Pentagon and return to the call of Seymour Melman for demilitarization
and the conversion of the military, financial, information complex.

While the energies of many are focused on the issues of electoral
politics, progressives must remain alert to new false flag operations of
NATO. [We are in a revolutionary moment and revolutionaries cannot be
pessimistic. There are three important tasks: dismantle NATO, fight
imperialism, racism, and white supremacy globally and be at the
forefront for social justice and solidarity in all parts of the
world.]{.underline}

### Cyberwar -- Alt

#### The alternative solves. The role of debaters as academics is to reject the proliferation of securitized cyberwar discourse in the capitalist unconscious.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko 19** (Nick, associate professor @
University of Western Ontario in Faculty of Information and Media
Studies, Svitlana, assistant professor of communication @ Simon Fraser
University, "What is to be done?", Chapter 3, Cyberwar and Revolution:
Digital Subterfuge in Global Capitalism)

[As]{.underline} both of us are [academics, we are concerned with how
the neoliberal university is occupied today by cyberwar. Responding to
the exhortations of states and corporations for a supply of labor power
adequate to cyberwar conditions, institutions of postsecondary education
are proliferating cybersecurity programs]{.underline} (Talley 2013;
Ritchie 2016; Wilson 2017). [They are also the target of intensifying
cyberattacks, some aimed at military-related research]{.underline}
(Ismail 2017; Young and Bennett 2017). But, most immediately from our
point of view, the university has become a place where students receive
mutually contradictory messages from faculty teaching critical theory
about the risks of state and corporate surveillance and the public
relations teams hired by higher administrators that encourage them to
"like" the university's profile on Facebook, follow it on Twitter, and
become full participants in a regime of corporate promotion and
selfbranding. [Not only does this jeopardize pedagogical
work]{.underline} (except when one manages to use such instances as case
studies for politicoeconomic analysis in class, which is admittedly
rare) [but it is also unethical given the general awareness]{.underline}
(including by higher administrators and public relations teams) [that
youths are being aggressively targeted by corporate
platforms.]{.underline} This targeting does not just leave young people
feeling stressed, defeated, overwhelmed, anxious, nervous, stupid,
silly, useless, and like a failure. [It also prepares them as the
unthinking data-subject cannon fodder for wars already being waged with
computational propaganda, botnets, and the viral relay of virtual
weaponry with real material consequence.]{.underline}

We and our [students are subjects of the "capitalist unconscious," "the
alienated subject at work in every discursive action"]{.underline}
(Tomšič 2015, 54). Lacan traced the notion of the subject to the
beginning of modern science, which initiated the emancipation of the
human from theocratic social orders, replacing a ritualistic relation to
the world of nature. Unfortunately, as Samo Tomšič argues, "[the
emancipatory political potential of scientific revolution" was captured
and "neutralized" by a counterrevolutionary capitalism that "needs to be
thought of as the restoration of pre-modernity within
modernity"]{.underline} (235). [This neutralization he characterizes as
the construction of "a closed world, marked by totality, finitude and
centralization"---the world market, mobilizing atomized, narcissistic,
and competitive individuals in never-ending and all-subsuming commodity
exchange, a world whose purported eternity and completion negate the
perception of "contingency, infinity and instability" that is the true
core of scientific emancipation. Pointing to a parallelism between Marx
and Lacan, Tomšič observes that capitalist modernity "ceases at the
critical point of the subject"]{.underline} (235). He explains,

While capitalism considers the subject to be nothing more than a
narcissistic animal, Marxism and psychoanalysis reveal that the subject
of revolutionary politics is an alienated animal, which, in its most
intimate interior, includes its other. This inclusion is the main
feature of a non-narcissistic love and consequently of a social link
that is not rooted in self-love. (233)

[The atavistic "pre-modernity within modernity" of capitalism, and the
disaster of its capture of advanced science, is nowhere more clearly
demonstrated today than by its tendencies toward cyberwar.]{.underline}
As the young Althusser (1946, 14) [wrote in the midst of the
"apocalyptic panic" following the explosion of the first atomic weapons,
"the world in which humanity trembles before what it has itself wrought
is an extravagant image of the proletarian condition, in which the
worker is enslaved by his own labour: it is quite simply, the same
world."]{.underline}

### AT: Transition War -- Alt

#### Peaceful transition is possible but [try or die]{.underline} for recovery post conflict if there's war.

**Hanappi \'19** \[Hardy; 1/7/19; PhD in Economics from the University

Integrated Capitalism to Disintegrating Capitalism. Scenarios of a Third
World War,\"
<https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/91397/1/MPRA_paper_91397.pdf/>\]

It should not come as a surprise that a [change of the dominant mode of
production]{.underline} of human society [takes place by a **clash** of
**brute forces**]{.underline}, of worldwide war. Limiting his attention
to the aspect of equality of men the anthropologist Walter Scheidel
describes in fascinating historical detail how [wars always preceded the
setup of large scale new organization of society]{.underline}, see
\[Scheidel, 2017\]. To which extent such a war again is on the agenda
today - contrary to the existence of DC - clearly is a question of
forecasting. The previous section of this chapter used a scenario
technique to sketch some contours of a possible third World War. These
scenarios are not independent, mixtures of them are to be expected, e.g.
a common strategy of a player in scenario 1 is to stir up national civil
war (scenario 2) in a satellite country of its opponent (e.g.
Yugoslavia); or to use the rhetoric of scenario 3 to support the fight
of national class struggle (scenario 2). But [will WW3 happen at
all?]{.underline}

[Not necessarily,]{.underline} but with a frightening high probability.
[Some **counterstrategies** already have been mentioned]{.underline}
along the discussion of the scenarios. [The **immediate
candidate**]{.underline}, of course, [is a **global peace
movement**]{.underline}. This movement already played a pivotal role in
ending the Vietnam War, being an incubator for the worldwide cultural
revolution of 1968. As the short life and the macroeconomic impotence30
of this rebellion showed, any movement with durable impact needs not
only roots in personal perceptions and feelings, it also needs a very
sophisticated and well-developed blueprint of the overall working of a
global democratic society. [A mode of production is a complicated
political economy entity, which needs a **complicated system design**.
Fortunately, the explosive **accumulation** of **human knowledge**, of
**science**, should]{.underline} be able to [provide just that -- if it
were not handcuffed by]{.underline} the singular tasks tailored by
[Disintegrating Capitalism. The next best counteraction]{.underline}
thus [is to **organize** the carriers of this knowledge]{.underline},
e.g. [scientists, in a **progressive global class**. Even if WW3
happens, chances are that a **restart is possible** and the
**blueprint** of a **better mode of production** is
**needed**]{.underline}. In this case Umberto Eco's vision of an
upcoming new Middle Ages31, with monasteries (today: universities?)

### AT: Locked In -- Alt

#### Capitalism has primed you with [cognitive bias]{.underline}\-\--the belief that capitalism is [inevitable]{.underline} or [natural]{.underline} is a myth that [ignores decades of interdisciplinary science]{.underline}\-\--organization without privatized profit is both possible and [naturally aligned]{.underline} with human nature.

**Raymond \'20** \[Robert; 1/5/20; contributor to Truthout, Senior
Producer, Designer, and Creative Director of The Response; \"How
Economists Tricked Us Into Thinking Capitalism Works,\"
https://truthout.org/articles/how-economists-tricked-us-into-thinking-capitalism-works/\]

These days, it seems like [someone is always trying to]{.underline}
**[privatize]{.underline}** [something.]{.underline} One day it's the
Trump administration contemplating the privatization of the Department
of Veterans Affairs. The next it's the Tories looking to sell off the
U.K.'s National Health Service, or [economists promoting "market-based"
solutions to the]{.underline} [**climate crisis**. In this age of
**neoliberalism**, the rallying cry for politicians and
economists]{.underline} alike [is always]{.underline} for "[More
privatization! More markets!]{.underline} Sell it all off to the private
sector!"

Of course, much of the time [this faith in the market is used as a cover
by those looking to simply **make a profit**]{.underline} --- or by the
politicians representing their interests. But this is not always the
case. [There are many who actually believe]{.underline}, wholeheartedly,
[that markets are the]{.underline} **[most efficient]{.underline}** [and
even]{.underline} the **[most ethical]{.underline}** [way to run a
society. And because this is the worldview that is]{.underline}
**[taught in the vast majority]{.underline}** [of economics
departments]{.underline} throughout the world, [it's not surprising that
this is the dominant worldview among those in power]{.underline}.

[It's an ideology that was]{.underline} **[carefully
crafted]{.underline}** [during the time of the early Western economists
like]{.underline} **[Adam Smith]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**David Ricardo**. Homo sapiens are actually **Homo economicus**, the
theory goes: selfish, competitive, rational agents who are
all]{.underline} [constantly seeking to]{.underline} efficiently
[maximize their own personal well-being]{.underline}.

No need to despair, however, because economists have figured out that
these inherent traits can actually be utilized for good, through a
social relation known as the market. By its nature, the market
encourages competition and efficiency, and thus, by relying on the
self-maximizing behavior of individuals, market capitalism is the only
economic system that truly accepts human nature for what it is. And in
fact, it's the only system uniquely situated to actually channel this
nature into a net positive outcome for society.

How does this all work? Well, when they are free to make choices that
maximize their own interests, people in a market system negotiate on a
price and quantity of a product or service until a sort of equilibrium
is established. It's a natural process of compromise that leaves
everyone satisfied and also leads to an efficient way of producing and
distributing goods and services. Everyone wins. And, the theory goes, it
just so happens that the process aligns perfectly with human nature.
It's a fascinating theory. The only thing is, it's completely wrong.

[The **foundation** of this **theory** relies on an **assumption** about
**human nature** that has been]{.underline} **[discredited over and
over]{.underline}** [by research across **multiple scientific
disciplines**]{.underline}. It turns out that [Homo economicus is
a]{.underline} [**fairytale**, an outdated **misconception**, a
gross]{.underline} **[distortion of reality]{.underline}**. [Yet, it
still serves as the **theoretical foundation** of our entire economic
system]{.underline}.

Studies have determined that [the Homo economicus personality is an
extremely rare one]{.underline}. Instead, [most humans are marked by a
deep capacity for **reciprocity**, **cooperation** and
**selflessness**.]{.underline} For example, research shows that [by 14
months of age, children are already beginning to help each
other]{.underline} by handing over objects that others are
unsuccessfully reaching for. [This]{.underline} **[empathic
behavior]{.underline}** [only increases as children grow older and begin
to share]{.underline} things that they value with others [and even
object to other people's violation of social norms]{.underline}.

[These are all early signs of]{.underline}
**[prosociality]{.underline}** --- [behavior that is marked by
an]{.underline} **[intent to help or benefit others]{.underline}**. [And
importantly, this behavior is motivated by a]{.underline} **[genuine
concern]{.underline}** for others and not by selfishness.

[Evolutionary biologists]{.underline} have [also largely debunked the
theory of Homo economicus]{.underline}. Researchers like David Sloan
Wilson and others have determined that [more prosocial groups will
robustly outcompete less prosocial groups, meaning that prosociality was
an **advantageous trait**]{.underline} [when it came to the]{.underline}
**[natural selection]{.underline}** of early humans. And [these theories
are not new]{.underline}. Over a century ago, the anarchist theorist
Peter Kropotkin wrote convincingly on how [the **survival of our
species**]{.underline} [has depended more on cooperation than on the
heroic efforts of isolated individuals]{.underline}. It certainly is
difficult imagining an early human taking down a woolly mammoth without
engaging in highly coordinated prosocial behavior. How else could the
human species evolve to dominate the globe if not by cooperating with
one another to overcome the many challenges our species faced?

Another place where we see the myth of Homo economicus debunked is in
the research that comes out of post-disaster communities. In her
landmark book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Rebecca Solnit presents a
thesis arguing that [humans have an **innate capacity**]{.underline}
[toward]{.underline} **[collectivism]{.underline}** --- and that these
traits tend to reveal themselves most strongly in community response to
disasters. Far from resorting to antisocial behavior after a disaster (a
myth which the media tend to elevate), Solnit's book outlines enumerable
instances where communities demonstrate prosocial behaviors like
cooperation, solidarity, sacrifice and generosity instead.

"In the wake of an earthquake, a bombing, or a major storm, most people
are altruistic, urgently engaged in caring for themselves and those
around them, strangers and neighbors as well as friends and loved ones,"
Solnit writes. "Decades of meticulous sociological research on behavior
in disasters, from the bombings of World War II to floods, tornadoes,
earthquakes, and storms across the continent and around the world, have
demonstrated this."

Yet, [despite the overwhelming evidence contradicting it, we've come
to]{.underline} **[accept Homo economicus]{.underline}** as the truth.
[Perhaps not always consciously, but it]{.underline} haunts our dreams,
our imagination. It [**confines** our **sense of
possibility**]{.underline} [and **imposes boundaries**]{.underline} [as
arbitrary as those that **carve** up **ecosystems** and **communities**
into nation-states]{.underline}.

[Market capitalism has been **imposed onto us**, often at the point of a
gun, and as a result, we've been]{.underline} **[forced to
internalize]{.underline}** [the idea that we are a]{.underline}
[**selfish**, **competitive** and **greedy** species]{.underline}. Well,
that's just human nature, we'll acquiesce when we hear about the
profiteering of pharmaceutical companies or the greed of investment
bankers. But [the thing this, that's]{.underline} **[not human
nature]{.underline}** --- [it's just what we've been]{.underline}
**[coerced into thinking]{.underline}** [by an unfeeling economic system
that dominates every facet of our life]{.underline}. And in many ways,
**[Homo economicus is a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}**.

It's been demonstrated that studying economics actually makes you more
selfish. Studies have shown that economics students are much less likely
than other students to donate money that was given to them into a common
pool; that they are more likely to "freeride" and are also more likely
to defect than to cooperate; that they are more likely to participate in
deception for personal gain; and even that they are more likely than
their peers to rate greed as "generally good," "correct" and "moral."

And it's not just students: economics professors give less money to
charity than professors in other fields --- including history,
philosophy, education, psychology, sociology, anthropology, literature,
physics, chemistry and biology.

[When faced with the overwhelming evidence that Homo
economicus]{.underline} --- [and thus the whole neoclassical economic
project]{.underline} --- [is]{.underline} [**nonsense**, the
**defenders** of the]{.underline} **[status quo]{.underline}** [tend to
rely on another]{.underline} **[myth]{.underline}**: [that **there is no
alternative**]{.underline}. Margaret Thatcher famously uttered those
words over 30 years ago, paving the way for an age of neoliberalism that
has seen the dismantling of the social safety net, the stagnation of
wages and the rise of extreme inequality.

But the thing is, [there are alternative ways of **organizing society**
that reflect the human capacity for **reciprocity**, **selflessness**
and **cooperation**. The **worker cooperative model**]{.underline}
[promotes **equity**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[democracy]{.underline}** [by giving workers ownership and control
over their workplaces.]{.underline} It does so in a way that not only
aligns with our inherently human traits, but in a way which has been
shown to be more efficient and productive than the traditional workplace
models.

[There is also the **commons model**]{.underline} [that reflects how
communities **organized themselves** for **thousands of
years**]{.underline} [before they were torn off their land in the
enclosure acts of 17th-century England. The commons are a way
of]{.underline} **[organizing production and distribution]{.underline}**
[where resources are **held in common**]{.underline} [and
are]{.underline} **[accessible to every member of society]{.underline}**
[to be managed collectively for the]{.underline} **[benefit of
all]{.underline}**.

In fact, the political economist Eleanor Ostrom actually won the Nobel
Prize in Economics in 2009 for disproving the long-held belief known as
[the "tragedy of the commons,"]{.underline} a theory [which
held]{.underline} that [resources held in common by communities
would]{.underline} naturally [be overused and depleted]{.underline}.
Ostrom's work demonstrated that this assumption [is]{.underline}
**[false]{.underline}**, and that [it is in fact very possible for
resources to be managed collectively **without
privatization**.]{.underline}

There are many ways that community resources can be collectivized
instead of privatized, from land trusts that take land off of the market
to policy proposals like Medicare for All, which represents a major
shift in how we view our collective responsibility when it comes to
health care, or the Green New Deal, which recognizes our collective
responsibility to prioritize climate justice in the fight against
climate change.

[The alternatives to market capitalism are out there]{.underline} ---
and the thing is, [they actually align much more closely to the natural
human tendencies toward reciprocity and sharing. The theories behind
modern economics have left us with a]{.underline} **[burning
planet]{.underline}** [and with]{.underline} **[skyrocketing
inequality]{.underline}** --- it's time to put them to rest.

And [whether economists and politicians choose to accept it or not, the
days of Homo economicus are]{.underline} [**limited**, because a
**society based off of a lie cannot go on indefinitely**]{.underline}.

#### "No alternative" is an [elite fallacy]{.underline}\-\--grassroots activists are laying the seeds for the [end of capitalism]{.underline}, but global [commitment is key]{.underline}.

Our Future Must Be One Without Economic Growth

So focused on serving the needs of the wealthy elites, most governments,
[political leaders and policy-makers are stuck in the certainty that
"**there is no alternative**]{.underline}" and their plans lie at the
core of that belief. [The proposals support "**business as usual**" with
a coat of]{.underline} **[greenwash]{.underline}** and a nip and tuck
here and there. [They **fail** to recognize that economic **growth** is
in]{.underline} **[direct conflict]{.underline}** [with
**decarbonization**, slowing down **global warming**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} [**redistributing wealth**, and that we must eliminate
or vastly reduce certain activities altogether]{.underline}.

[It is time to **expose** the]{.underline} **[extreme
fallacy]{.underline}** [behind mainstream policy positions regarding the
climate crisis. Decarbonization that will slow global warming is going
to require **more than a few tweaks to the system**]{.underline} and
nods to green investment. [It will demand that we]{.underline}
**[jettison our current economic paradigm]{.underline}** altogether [and
replace it with a more]{.underline} **[socialist]{.underline}**,
**[participatory]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[democratic]{.underline}** [paradigm that puts social and
environmental needs at its center and massively redistributes
wealth]{.underline}. We are only kidding ourselves if we think it can
happen any other way.

[Many millions of us have already come to this realization. Recent polls
conducted in Britain]{.underline}, for example, [showed that just 6
percent wanted to go back to the economy as it was before the COVID-19
pandemic]{.underline} and 82 percent wanted to prioritize health and
well-being over economic growth. [Grassroots **activists**
and]{.underline} **[movements]{.underline}** [are busy creating and
implementing the]{.underline} **[alternatives]{.underline}** [to the
status quo. "Ordinary" people are light-years ahead of the governments
and political leaders in taking these courageous steps.]{.underline}

Despite the heroic efforts of everyday people working at localized
levels, there are three hard truths we must face. The first is that [our
governments and political leaders are a major barrier. They may be
pathetic but they hold the levers of power]{.underline}, albeit on
behalf of the elites. [The second hard truth is that efforts at
localized levels are insufficient. Solving the climate crisis will
necessitate the **end of capitalism**]{.underline} [and that
necessitates **action on a global scale**]{.underline} [through global
**coordination**]{.underline}, **[planning]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[regulation]{.underline}**. Both of these truths,
therefore, make it critical for our governments and leaders to catch up
and start working for and with us.

2.8 CHOOSING CAPITALISM TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT: LARGE-SCALE DEPLOYMENT

Finally, a third reason that [**[cap]{.mark}**italism [is **suited
to**]{.mark} the job of **[environmental]{.mark}
restoration**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[protection]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is its ability to
**undertake**]{.underline} [and complete]{.underline} **[projects at
very large scales]{.underline}**. In keeping with a major thesis of this
book, construction at very large scales should give us a little pause,
because of the propensity of capital to metastasize into a source of
political resistance to change. But some global problems, especially
climate change, may require very large-scale enterprises.

For example, [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}** may **[[already]{.underline}]{.mark}**
have [**[passed a threshold]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[climate
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[tech]{.mark}**nology
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} almost certainly [**[needed]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [chemically]{.underline} **[[capture
carbon]{.mark} dioxide]{.underline}** [from ambient air.]{.underline}
But carbon dioxide is only about 0.15% of ambient air by molecular
weight, and [a tremendous amount of]{.underline} ambient [air must be
processed just to capture a small amount of carbon dioxide]{.underline}.
This technology has often been referred to as \"**[direct air
capture]{.underline}**,\" or \"carbon removal.\" [Given
that]{.underline} inherent [limitation, direct air capture technology
[must be deployed **at vast scales**]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to
make any appreciable difference in greenhouse gas concentrations. There
is certainly no guarantee that direct air capture will be a silver
bullet. But [if it is to be an effectual item on a menu of survival
techniques, it will [more **assured**]{.mark}ly be accomplished
[under]{.mark} the]{.underline} incentives of [a **[cap]{.mark}**italist
**economy**]{.underline}.

[Capitalism might]{.underline} [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} [help with
the looming crisis of climate change by helping to]{.underline}
**[[ensure]{.mark} the [supply of]{.mark}]{.underline}** vital life
staples such as [**[food, water]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [other basic needs in future
**[shortages]{.mark}**]{.underline} [caused by
climate-change]{.underline}. [In a climate-changed future, there is
the]{.underline} distinct [possibility that supplies of vital life
staples may run short]{.underline}, possibly for long periods of time.
[**Droughts** are projected]{.underline} to last longer, with water
supplies and growing conditions increasingly precarious. [Capitalist
enterprise could]{.underline}, first of all, [provide the]{.underline}
[**impetus to** finally **reform**]{.underline} a dizzying multitude of
**[price distortions]{.underline}** [that plague **water** supply and
**ag**riculture]{.underline} worldwide. Second, **[capitalist
enterprise]{.underline}** [can]{.underline} **[undertake scale
production]{.underline}** [of some emergent technologies that might
alleviate shortages.]{.underline} [**Desal**ination
technology]{.underline} [can convert salty seawater into]{.underline}
drinkable [freshwater]{.underline}.54 A number of environmental and
economic issues need to be solved to deploy these technologies at large
scales, but [in a crisis]{.underline}, [**solutions will** be more
**likely to present themselves**]{.underline}.

[A technology that is already being adopted]{.underline} to produce food
[is the modernized version of old-fashioned greenhouses.]{.underline}
The tiny country of the Netherlands, with its 17 million people crowded
onto 13,000 square miles, is the second largest food exporter in the
world,55 exporting fully three-quarters that of the United States in
2017.56 The secret to Dutch agriculture is its climate-controlled,
low-energy green-houses that project solar panel-powered artificial
sunlight around the clock. Dutch greenhouses produce lettuce at ten
times the yield57 and tomatoes at fifteen times the yield outdoors in
the United States58 while using less than one-thirteenth the amount of
water,59 very little in the way of synthetic pesticides and, of course,
very little fertilizer given its advanced composting techniques.
[Sustained shortages in a climate-changed future might require that
a]{.underline} **[capitalist]{.underline}** [take hold of **greenhouse
growing and expand production**]{.underline} **[to feed the
masses]{.underline}** [that might otherwise revolt]{.underline}.

2.9 **[CHOOSE CAPITALISM]{.underline}**

[Clearly, the job]{.underline} in front of humankind [is enormous,
complex, and many-faceted]{.underline}. The best hope is to be able to
identify certain human impacts that are clearly harmful to the global
environment, and to disincentivize them. Getting back to notions of
institutions in capitalism, [what is crucial is aligning the right
incentives with profit-making activity]{.underline}. [What capitalism
does **so well**]{.underline} --- beyond human comprehension --- **[is
coordinate activity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[send broad
signals about scarcity]{.underline}**. [Information about a wide variety
of environmental phenomena is]{.underline} extremely [difficult to
collect and process]{.underline}. If a set of environmental taxes can
help establish a network of environ-mental prices, then an unfathomably
large and complex machinery will have been set in motion in the right
direction.

Also, [because of the need for new scientific solutions to this daunting
list of problems, **[new science and tech]{.mark}**nology [is]{.mark}
desperately [**needed**. **Cap**]{.mark}italism **[is tried and
true]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} terms of **[producing
innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Again drawing upon the study of
institutions, it is not so much that individuals need a profit-motive in
order to tinker, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [the prospect of
**[profit]{.mark}**-making **[has to be present]{.mark}** in order for
institutions]{.underline}, including corporations, [to devote resources,
attention, and energy towards the development of solutions]{.underline}
to environmental problems. Corporations can and should demonstrate
social responsibility by attempting to mitigate their impacts on the
global environment, but a much more conscious push for new knowledge,
new techniques, and new solutions are needed.

Finally, **[the scale of needed change is profound]{.underline}**. [Huge
networks of infrastructure]{.underline} centered upon a fossil
fuel-centered economy [must]{.underline} somehow [be replaced or
adapted]{.underline} to new ways of generating, transmitting, consuming,
and storing energy. [A global system of feeding seven billion
humans]{.underline} (and counting), unsustainable on its face, [must be
morphed into something else that]{.underline} can fill that huge role.
[About a billion and a half cars and trucks]{.underline} in the world
[must]{.underline}, over time, [be swapped out]{.underline} for vehicles
that must be dramatically different.

[This is a daunting to-do list]{.underline}, **[but look]{.underline}**
a bit more **[carefully]{.underline}** among the gloomy news. Elon
[Musk]{.underline}, a freewheeling, pot-smoking entrepreneur [shows
signs of breaking into not one, but two industries]{.underline}
dominated by behemoths with political power. Thanks to California
emissions standards, [**auto**mobile manufacturers have developed [cars
that emit a **fraction**]{.mark} of what they did]{.underline} less than
a generation ago. [Hybrid **[e]{.mark}**lectric
**[v]{.mark}**ehicle**[s]{.mark}** have]{.underline} thoroughly
[penetrated an American market that powerful American politicians had
tried to cordon off]{.underline} for American manufacturers only. [At
least two companies have developed **[meat substitutes]{.mark}** that
are]{.underline} now widely judged to be [indistinguishable from
meat]{.underline}, and have established product outposts in the ancient
power centers of fast food, McDonald\'s and Burger King. The tiny
country of [the **Netherlands**]{.underline}, about half the size of
West Virginia, [exports almost **as much [food]{.mark}** []{.mark}as the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, able to ship fresh
produce all the way to Africa. At bottom, **[all of [these
accomplishments]{.mark}]{.underline}** and thousands more
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** and were **[[capitalist]{.mark} in
nature.]{.underline}** While they collectively repre-sent a trifle of
what still needs to be accomplished, [they were also undertaken without
the correct incentives in place, and]{.underline} thus also [represent
the]{.underline} tremendous **[promise of capitalism]{.underline}**.

#### Cap is sustainable -- innovation is key to solve the climate and the alt can't solve

**Karlsson 21** -- Associate Professor in political science at Umea
University (Rasmus, \"Learning in the Anthropocene\" Soc. Sci. 10, no.
6: 233. <https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10060233> 18 June 2021)

Unpacking this argument, it is perhaps useful to first recognize that,
[**stable as the Holocene** may have seemed from a human perspective,
**[life was always]{.mark}** [vulnerable to]{.mark} a number of
**[cosmic risks,]{.mark} such as bolide collisions**, **risks that
[only]{.mark}** advanced **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [can
mitigate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [**the Black Death** of the
14th century should serve as a powerful reminder of the extreme
[vulnerability **of pre-industrial societies**]{.mark} at a
microbiological level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to
think of the Holocene as providing a relatively stable baseline against
which the ecological effects of technological interventions could
hypothetically be evaluated. With most human activities being
distinctively local, nature would for the most part "bounce back" (even
if the deforestation of the Mediterranean basin during the Roman period
is an example of that not always being the case) while larger
geophysical processes, such as the carbon cycle, remained entirely
beyond human intentional control. Even if there has been some debate
about what influence human activities had on the preindustrial climate
(Ruddiman 2007), anthropogenic forcing was in any case both marginal and
gradual. All this changed with the onset of the Great Acceleration by
which humans came to overwhelm the great forces of nature, causing
untold damage to fragile ecosystems and habitats everywhere, forever
altering the trajectory of life on the planet (Steffen et al. 2011b).
[In a grander perspective, **humanity may** one day become an
interplanetary species and thus instrumental in safeguarding **the
long-term existence of biological life**,]{.underline} but for the
moment, [its impact is ethically dubious at best as the glaciers melt,
the oceans fill up with plastics, and vast number of species are driven
to extinctio]{.underline}n. Faced with these grim realities, **[it is of
course not surprising that the first impulse is to seek to restore some
kind primordial harmony and restrain human activities]{.underline}**.
Yet, it is [important]{.underline} to acknowledge that, even if their
aggregate impact may have been within the pattern of Holocene
variability, [**[pre-modern]{.mark}** Western agricultural [societies
were]{.mark} hardly "sustainable" in any meaningful sense. [Experiencing
permanent scarcity]{.mark}, violent [conflict]{.mark} was
endemic]{.underline} (Gat 2013), and as much as some contemporary
academics like to attribute all evils to "capitalism" (Malm 2016),
pre-capitalist societies exhibited no shortage of religious intolerance
and other forms of social domination. It is thus not surprising that
some have argued the need to reverse the civilizational arc further yet
and return to a preliterate hunter-gather existence (Zerzan 2008) even
if this, obviously, has very little to do with existing political
realities and social formations. Under Holocene conditions, the
short-term human tragedy may have been the same, but it did not
undermine the long-term ability of the planet to support life[. In a
world of eight billion people, already accumulated emissions in the
atmosphere have committed the planet to significant warming under the
coming centuries, with an increasing [probability that]{.mark} committed
[warming]{.mark} already [exceeds]{.mark} the **[1.5-]{.mark}**degree
target of the Paris Agreement even if all fossil-fuel emissions were to
stop today]{.underline} (Mauritsen and Pincus 2017). This means that
[**sustained [negative emission]{.mark}**s, presumably **in combination
with [SRM]{.mark}**, [will]{.mark} most likely **be needed** just **to
[stabilize]{.mark}** global **[temperatures]{.mark}**,]{.underline} not
to mentioning countering the flow of future emissions. According to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), assuming that all the
pledges submitted under the Paris Agreement are fulfilled, **[[limiting
warming]{.mark} to 1.5 degrees [will]{.mark} still [require]{.mark}
negative emissions in the range of 100---1000 gigatons of
CO2]{.underline}** (Hilaire et al. 2019, p. 190). The removal of carbon
dioxide at gigaton scales from **[the atmosphere]{.underline}** [will
presumably require the existence of an advanced [industrial]{.mark}
[society]{.mark} since low-tech options, such as afforestation, will be
of limited use]{.underline} (Gundersen et al. 2021; Seddon et al. 2020),
especially in a future of competing land-uses. It is against this
backdrop of worsening climate harms that the limits of "precaution", at
least as conventionally understood, become apparent. [While degrowth
advocates tend to insist that [behavioral change]{.mark}, even
explicitly betting on a "social miracle"]{.underline} (Kallis 2019, p.
195), **[is]{.underline}** always **[preferable]{.underline}** to any
technological risk-taking (Heikkurinen 2018), that
**[[overlooks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [both the scope of the
sustainability challenge and the [lack of public consent]{.mark} to
**any** sufficiently **radical** political project]{.underline}
(Buch-Hansen 2018). While there may be growing willingness to pay for,
say, an electric vehicle (Hulshof and Mulder 2020), giving up private
automobile use altogether is obviously a different animal, to say
nothing about a more fundamental rematerialization of the economy
(Hausknost 2020). [Again, the problem is one in which change either (a)
remains marginal yet ecologically insufficient or (b) becomes
sufficiently radical yet provokes a strong political
counterreaction]{.underline}. A similar dynamic can be expected to play
out at the international level where **[[countries that remain]{.mark}
[committed to growth]{.mark} would quickly [gain a military
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To make matters worse, there is also a
temporal element to this dynamic [since any regime of [frugality]{.mark}
and localism [would]{.mark} have to [be policed]{.mark}
indefinitely]{.underline} in order to prevent new unsustainable patterns
of development from re-emerging later on. All this begs the obvious
question[, if the political and economic enforcement of the planetary
boundaries are]{.underline} **[fraught [with]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
[[political and social difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark}, would it not
be better to instead [try to transcend them through technological
innovation]{.underline}? Surprisingly, any high-energy future would most
likely be subject to many of the same motivational and psychological
constraints that hinder a low-energy future. While history shows that
existing nuclear technologies could in theory displace all fossil fuels
and meet the most stringent climate targets (Qvist and Brook 2015), it
seems extremely unlikely, to put it mildly, that thousands of new
reactors will be built over the course of the coming decades in response
to climate change. Outside the world of abstract computer modelling,
real world psychological and cultural inertia tends to ensure that
political decision-making, at least for the most part, gravitates to
what is considered "reasonable" and "common sense"---such as medium
emissions electricity grids in which wind and solar are backed by
biomass and gas---rather than what any utilitarian optimization scenario
may suggest. Even if the global benefits of climate stabilization would
be immense, the standards by which local nuclear risks are assessed, as
clearly illustrated by the Fukushima accident which led to a worldwide
retreat from nuclear energy despite only causing one confirmed death
(which, though obviously regrettable, has to be put in relation to the
hundred and thousands of people dying every year from the use of fossil
fuels), underscores the uneven distribution of perceived local risks
versus global benefits and the associated problem of socio-political
learning across spatial scales. Almost two decades ago, Ingolfur
Blühdorn identified "simulative eco-politics" as a key strategy by which
liberal democracies reconcile an ever-heightened rhetoric of
environmental crisis with their simultaneous defense of the core
principles of consumer capitalism (Blühdorn 2007). Since then,
declarations that we only have "ten years to save the planet" have
proliferated, and so have seemingly bold investments in renewable
energy, most recently in the form of US President Joseph Biden's USD
2.25 trillion climate and infrastructure plan. Still, without a
meaningful commitment to either radical innovation or effective
degrowth, it is difficult to see how the deployment of yet more wind
turbines or the building of new highways will in any way be
qualitatively different from what Blühdorn pertinently described as
sustaining "what is known to be unsustainable" (Blühdorn 2007, p. 253).
However, all is not lost in lieu of more authentic forms of
eco-politics. [Independent of political interventions, accelerating
**[technological change]{.mark}**, in particular with regard to
computing and intelligent machine labor, may one day [make]{.mark}
large-scale precision [manipulation]{.mark} of the physical world
[possible]{.mark} in ways that may [solve]{.mark} many [problems]{.mark}
that today **seem [intractable]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Dorr 2016).
Similarly, [**[breakthroughs in]{.mark} synthetic [bio]{.mark}logy** may
[hold the key to]{.mark} environmentally benign biofuels and
[carbon]{.mark} utilization technologies]{.underline}. Yet, all such
progress remains hypothetical and uncertain for now. Given what is at
stake, there is an obvious danger in submitting to naïve technological
optimism. What is less commonly recognized is that naïve optimism with
regard to the prospects of behavioral change may be equally dangerous.
**[While [late-capitalist affluence]{.mark} has [enabled]{.mark} many
[postmaterial identities]{.mark} and behaviors, such as bicycling,
[hobby farming]{.mark}, and other forms of emancipatory self-expression,
a [collapsing economy]{.mark} could quickly [lead to]{.mark} a reversal
back to [survivalist values]{.mark}, traditional hierarchical forms of
[domination, and violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Quilley 2011, p. 77).
As such, it is far from obvious what actions would actually take the
world as a whole closer to long-term sustainability. If sustainability
could be achieved by a relatively modest reduction in consumption rates
or behavioral changes, such as a ban on all leisure flights, then there
would be a strong moral case for embracing degrowth. Yet, recognizing
how farreaching measures in terms of population control and consumption
restrictions that would be needed, the case quickly becomes more
ambiguous. [While traditional environmentalism may suggest that
**[retreating from the]{.mark}** global [economy]{.mark} and adopting a
low-tech lifestyle would increase resilience]{.underline} (Alexander and
Yacoumis 2018), it may do very much the opposite by [further fragmenting
global efforts and **[slowi]{.mark}**ng the pace of technological
[innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Without]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
orderly and [**[functioning]{.mark}** world [trade]{.mark} system, local
resources [scarcities]{.mark} would be
**[exacerbated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as seen most recently with the
different disruptions to vaccine supply chains. In essence, given the
lack of a stable Holocene baseline to revert to[, it becomes more
difficult to distinguish proactionary "risk-taking" from "precaution",
especially as many **[ecosystems have]{.mark}** already [been damaged
beyond]{.mark} natural [recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context,
it is noteworthy that many of the [**technologies** that can be expected
to be most crucial for managing a period of prolonged overshoot (such as
next-generation nuclear, engineering biology, large-scale carbon capture
and SRM) are also ones that traditional environmentalism is most
strongly opposed]{.underline} to. 3. Finding Indicators
[**[From]{.mark}** the [vantage point]{.mark} of the
[far-future]{.mark}, at least the kind depicted in the fictional
universe of Star Trek]{.underline}, human **[evolution is]{.underline}**
a fairly straightforward affair along an Enlightenment trajectory by
which ever greater instrumental capacity is matched by similar leaps in
psychological maturity and expanding circles of moral concern. With the
risk of sounding Panglossian, [one may argue that the **[waning of
interstate war]{.mark}** in general and the [fact]{.mark} that [there
has not been]{.mark} any major [nuclear]{.mark} [exchange]{.mark} in
particular, does [vindicate]{.mark} such an **[optimistic
reading]{.mark}** of histor]{.underline}y. While there will always be
ups and downs, as long as the most disastrous outcomes are avoided,
there will still be room for learning and gradual political
accommodation. Taking such a longer view, it would nevertheless be
strange if development was simply linear, that former oppressors would
just accept moral responsibility or that calls for gender or racial
justice would not lead to self-reinforcing cycles of conservative
backlash and increasingly polarizing claims. Still, over the last couple
of centuries, there is little doubt that [human civilization has
advanced significantly, both technologically and ethically (Pinker
2011), at least from a liberal and secular perspective]{.underline}.
However, unless one subscribes to teleology, there is nothing inexorable
with this development and, it may be that the ecological, social, and
political obstacles are simply too great to ever allow for the creation
of a Wellsian borderless world (Pedersen 2015) that would allow everyone
to live a life free from material want and political domination. On the
other hand, much environmental discourse tends to rush ahead in the
opposite direction and treat the c limate crisis as ultimate evidence of
humanity's fallen nature when **[the counter-factual case, that it would
be possible for a technological civilization to emerge without at some
point endangering its biophysical foundations, would presumably be much
less plausible.]{.underline}** From an astrobiological perspective, it
is easy to imagine how the atmospheric chemistry of a different planet
would be more volatile and thus more vulnerable to the effects of
industrial processes (Haqq-Misra and Baum 2009), leaving a shorter time
window for mitigation. Nick Bostrom has explored this possibility of
greater climate sensitivity further in his "vulnerable world hypothesis"
(Bostrom 2019) and it begs to reason that mitigation efforts would be
more focused in such a world. However, since climate response times are
longer and sensitivity less pronounced, climate mitigation policies have
become mired in culture and media politics (Newman et al. 2018) but also
a statist logic (Karlsson 2018) by which it has become more important
for states to focus on their own marginal emission reductions in the
present rather than asking what technologies would be needed to
stabilize the climate in a future where all people can live a modern
life.

The [past 30 years have seen immense progress **in [improving]{.mark}
the [quality of life]{.mark} for much of humanity**.]{.underline}
Extreme [[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the number of people living
on less than \$1.90 per day --- [has fallen by nearly two-thirds, [from
1.9 **billion to**]{.mark} around [650 **million**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Life expectancy has risen]{.underline}]{.mark} in most of the world,
[along with literacy and access to education]{.underline}, [while infant
mortality has fallen]{.underline}. Despite perceptions to the contrary,
**[the average person born today is likely to have access to more
opportunities and have a [better]{.mark} quality of [life than at any
other point]{.mark} in human history]{.underline}**. [Much of this
increase in human wellbeing has been [propelled by]{.mark} rapid
[economic growth]{.mark} driven largely by state-led industrial policy,
particularly in poor-to-middle income countries.]{.underline} However,
[this growth has come at a cost]{.underline}: [between 1990 and
2019]{.underline}, global [emissions of CO2 **increased by
56%.**]{.underline} [Historically, economic growth has been closely
linked to increased energy consumption]{.underline} --- and increased
CO2 emissions in particular --- leading some to argue that a more
prosperous world is one that necessarily has more impacts on our natural
environment and climate. There is a lively academic debate about our
ability to "absolutely decouple" emissions and growth --- that is, the
extent to which the adoption of clean energy technology can allow
emissions to decline while economic growth continues[. [Over
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [past 15 [years,]{.mark} however, **[something
has begun to change]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Rather than a 21st century
dominated by coal that energy modelers foresaw, **[global [coal]{.mark}
use peaked in 2013 and is now [in]{.mark} [structural
decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [We have succeeded in making [clean
energy cheap]{.mark}, with solar power and battery storage [costs
falling]{.mark} 10-fold since 2009]{.underline}. The world produced more
electricity from clean energy --- [solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear ---
than from coal over the past two years]{.underline}. And, according to
some major oil companies, **[peak [oil]{.mark} is upon us]{.underline}**
--- not because we have run out of cheap oil to produce, but because
[[demand is falling]{.mark} and [companies expect further
decline]{.mark} as consumers increasingly shift to electric
vehicles.]{.underline} The [world has long been experiencing a relative
**[decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between]{.mark} economic [growth
and]{.mark} CO2 [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [with the
emissions per unit of GDP **falling for the past 60
years**]{.underline}. [This is the case even in countries
like]{.underline} **[India and China]{.underline}** that [have been
undergoing rapid]{.underline} economic [growth.]{.underline} But
relative decoupling alone is inadequate in a world where global CO2
emissions need to peak and decline in the next decade to give us any
chance at limiting warming to well below 2℃, in line with Paris
Agreement targets. Thankfully, there is increasing evidence that [the
world is [on track **to absolutely decouple**]{.mark} **CO2 emissions
and economic growth**]{.underline} --- with global [CO2
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially having [[peaked in
2019]{.underline}]{.mark} **[and [unlikely to increase]{.mark}
substantially [in the coming decade]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While an
emissions peak is just the first and easiest step towards eventually
reaching the net-zero emissions required to stop the world from
continuing to warm, it [demonstrates that linkages between emissions and
economic activity are not an immutable law, but rather simply a result
of our current means of energy production.]{.underline} In recent years
we have seen more and more examples of absolute decoupling --- economic
growth accompanied by falling CO2 emissions. [Since 2005,]{.underline}
[[32 countries]{.mark} with a population of at least one million people
**have [absolutely decoupled]{.mark}**]{.underline} emissions from
economic growth, both for terrestrial emissions (those within national
borders) and consumption emissions (emissions embodied in the goods
consumed in a country). This includes the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [Japan, Mexico, Germany, U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, [France, Spain, Poland, Romania, Netherlands,
Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary, Belarus, Austria, Bulgaria, El
Salvador, Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Norway, Ireland, New
Zealand, Croatia, Jamaica, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, and
Cyprus.]{.underline} Figure 1, below, shows the declines in territorial
emissions (blue) and increases in GDP (red). To qualify as having
experienced absolute decoupling, we require countries included in this
analysis to pass four separate filters: a population of at least one
million (to focus the analysis on more representative cases), [declining
territorial emissions over the 2005-2019 period (based on a linear
regression), declining consumption emissions, and increasing real GDP
(on a purchasing power parity basis, using constant 2017 international
\$USD).]{.underline} We chose not to include 2020 in this analysis
because it is not particularly representative of longer-term trends, and
consumption and territorial emissions estimates are not yet available
for many countries. There is a wide range of rates of economic growth
between 2005-2019 among countries experiencing absolute decoupling.
Somewhat counterintuitively, there is no significant relationship
between the rate of economic growth and the magnitude of emissions
reductions within the group. **[While it is unlikely that there is not
at least some linkage between the two factors, there are plenty of
examples of countries (e.g., Singapore, Romania, and Ireland)
experiencing both extremely rapid economic growth and large reductions
in CO2 emissions.]{.underline}** One of the [primary [criticisms
of]{.mark}]{.underline} some prior analyses of absolute [[decoupling
is]{.underline}]{.mark} that they ignore
**[[leakage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specifically, the offshoring of
manufacturing from high-income countries over the past three decades to
countries like China has led to "illusory" drops in emissions, where the
emissions associated with high-income country consumption are simply
shipped overseas and no longer show up in territorial emissions
accounting. There is some truth in this critique, as there was a large
increase in emissions embodied in imports from developing countries
between 1990 and 2005. After 2005, however, [structural changes in China
and a growing domestic market led to a reversal of these trends; the
[amount of emissions "exported"]{.mark} from developed countries to
developing countries **[has]{.mark} actually [declined]{.mark} over the
past 15 years.**]{.underline} This means that, for many countries, [both
territorial emissions and consumption emissions]{.underline} (which
include any emissions "exported" to other countries) **[have jointly
declined]{.underline}**. In fact, on average, consumption emissions have
been declining slightly faster than territorial emissions since 2005 in
the 32 countries we identify as experiencing absolute decoupling. Figure
2, below, shows the change in consumption emissions (teal) and GDP (red)
between 2005 and 2019. There is a pretty wide variation in the extent to
which these countries have reduced their territorial and consumption
emissions since 2005. Some countries --- such as the UK, Denmark,
Finland, and Singapore -- have seen territorial emissions fall faster
than consumption emissions, while the US, Japan, Germany, and Spain
(among others) have seen consumption emissions fall faster. Figure 3
shows reductions in consumption and territorial emissions for each
country, with the size of the dot representing the size of the
population in 2019. **[[Absolute decoupling is
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [There is no physical law requiring
economic growth --- and broader increases in human wellbeing --- to
necessarily be linked to CO2 emissions]{.underline}. All of the
**[[services that we rely on today]{.mark} that emit fossil
fuels]{.underline}** --- electricity, transportation, heating, food ---
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} in principle **[[be replaced by]{.mark}
near-[zero carbon alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though these are
more mature in some sectors (electricity, transportation, buildings)
than in others (industrial processes, agriculture).

realizing that degrowth is bad."
https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth

I was going to write a lengthy post explaining why
"**[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}**" --- the idea that we need to halt
economic growth in order to save the planet --- **[[is]{.mark} a very
[bad]{.mark} idea]{.underline}**. But in the meantime, other people have
written that post, or recorded that podcast, and done it well. These
include Branko Milanovic, Kelsey Piper, and Ezra Klein. So instead I'll
write a shorter post trying to catalog and boil down the arguments
against degrowth.

But first, let's go over the standard argument, so we can see why these
new arguments are necessary.

The standard argument against degrowth

First, note that the typical argument against degrowth, which I laid out
in a Bloomberg post a while back, is that we don't need it; [we can
[raise]{.mark} human [living standards **without exhausting the
planet**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This argument was capably put forward by
Andy McAfee, in his excellent book More From Less, which you should buy
and read. Essentially, [the idea that economic growth requires growth in
resource use is **false**]{.underline}; [[rich countries]{.mark} have
started to grow while **[us]{.mark}ing less and [less of the
planet's]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}most important
**[resources]{.underline}**. [For example, here is U.S. use of **fresh
[water]{.mark}** []{.mark}and various **[metals]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[as well as]{.underline} trade-adjusted
[**[carbon]{.underline}**]{.mark} emissions:

![Chart, bar chart Description automatically

generated](media/image7.png){width="4.287387357830271in"
height="3.027083333333333in"}

So the idea here is that **[we don't need degrowth]{.underline}**;
instead, [we can keep raising everyone's standard of living **without
exhausting the planet's resources**]{.underline}. Because
[growth]{.underline} doesn't just mean using more and more stuff;
instead, it [can mean finding **more efficient ways** to use the stuff
we have.]{.underline}

[Degrowthers]{.underline} have two counters to this. Their first
counter, typically, is to [show]{.underline} a graph of [resource use
for the entire world, and show that it's correlated with global growth.
This is a **weak response**]{.underline}, for two reasons:

1.  [**[Degrowthers]{.underline}** [have no idea how to
    combine]{.underline} ]{.mark}[various [resources]{.mark} into an
    overall measure]{.underline} of resource use, [so they]{.underline}
    typically [go with gross weight. This is **absurd**]{.underline},
    since **[some materials are recyclable]{.underline}** [and
    others]{.underline} are not --- [if you "use" a ton of copper you
    **still have the copper**, whereas if you "use" a ton of oil, your
    oil is gone]{.underline}. It's also absurd because [it doesn't take
    into account]{.underline} the **[relative abundance]{.underline}**
    of resources --- [if you figure out how to substitute 2 tons of sand
    for 1 ton of oil, you're getting more efficient, since sand is much
    more plentiful]{.underline} than oil (and doesn't pollute as much
    when you use it). [A lot of growth is figuring out how to substitute
    plentiful resources for rare ones, and simply adding up gross
    tonnage **ignores this**.]{.underline}

2.  **[[Past trends are no guarantee]{.mark} of future
    trends]{.underline}**. [Until the 70s]{.underline}, for instance,
    U.S. economic [[growth was]{.mark} closely [correlated with]{.mark}
    both energy use and carbon [emissions]{.mark}; after the 70s,
    [this]{.mark} correlation **broke down completely** and the lines
    [started moving in **opposite directions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
    [Degrowthers present historical curves as if these are
    law]{.underline}s of nature, but we know that **[they are
    not]{.underline}**. The trend is your friend only til the bend at
    the end. And [the fact that [rich countries]{.mark} have hit an
    [inflection point]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}where economic
    growth no longer depends on growing resource **[use [is a strong
    indicator]{.mark} that [industrializing
    countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}like China
    [**[will]{.underline}**]{.mark} also hit this point [as
    well]{.underline}. (And no, falling use in rich countries is mostly
    not due to outsourcing, as the emissions graph above illustrates.)

So [this degrowther argument is just **wrong**]{.underline}. But
[degrowthers]{.underline} have a second, far better
[counter]{.underline} to McAfee's notion that we can have our cake and
eat it too: [Decoupling isn't happening fast enough. If we
wait]{.underline} for China and India and all the countries of Africa to
industrialize in a resource-intensive way like today's developed
countries did, and then to dematerialize their growth like today's
developed countries are doing now, [it will be far too late]{.underline}
and the planet will suffer ecological catastrophe.

**[This argument isn't]{.underline}** as **[strong]{.underline}** as it
sounds --- China and India and [[the rest will]{.mark} be able to
**[take advantage of]{.mark} the efficiency-inducing
[tech]{.mark}nologies** created [by]{.mark} the [developed
countries]{.mark}, like solar]{.underline} power (indeed, they are
already doing so). [And they will be able to embrace "dematerialized"
goods]{.underline} and services [like social networks]{.underline} and
video games (sorry, Xi Jinping) very early in their growth path. [So
these countries' resource use trajectories **won't look quite like the
U.S.**' or Europe's.]{.underline}

But [this degrowther argument does contain a nugget of
truth]{.underline}: Global resource [use is currently]{.underline} on an
[unsustainable]{.underline} trajectory. Here, via Zeke Hausfather, are
the current projections for global warming by century's end, even with
the advances in techologies like solar:

**\[CHART OMITTED\]**

Any one of these scenarios represents utter global catastrophe.

So even if there is a sustainable growth path, we are not currently on
it. About this, degrowthers are right; a gentle, natural transition to
green growth is possible, but is an unaffordable luxury. **[But
[degrowth]{.mark}ers' prescription is]{.underline}** the
**[wrong]{.underline}** one.

[The reason]{.underline}, in a word, [is **politics**]{.underline}. [The
kind of massive intention reordering of global production and
consumption]{.underline} that degrowthers fantasize about [[is]{.mark}
not just **pragmatically [impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[to
implement]{.underline}, [it's the]{.underline} kind of
[thing]{.underline} that essentially **[everyone in the
world]{.underline}** [except]{.underline} for a few very shouty people
in Northern Europe and the occasional [Twitter activist]{.underline}
**[is going to reject]{.underline}**. To see why, let us turn to the
excellent articles/podcasts by Milanovic, Piper, and Klein.

[The political argument against **degrowth**]{.underline}

Milanovic actually has two excellent posts on the topic of degrowth. In
the first one, he lays out why [forcing developing countries to stay in
poverty would be **bad**]{.underline}:

> Let us [suppose]{.underline}, for the sake of the argument, that [we
> interpret "degrowth" as the decision to fix global GDP at its current
> level...Then]{.underline}, unless we change the distribution of

[Enforcing [global degrowth would]{.mark} require **[freez]{.mark}ing
[world income]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}at about \$17,000/year.
That means that [most people in the world would **never even come close
to current rich-world living standards**]{.underline} --- instead, they
would at best only be able to reach the level currently enjoyed in China
or Botswana. Perhaps that's not such a horrible fate, but as Milanovic
notes, [this would require **impoverishing most of the population** of
developed countries]{.underline}. He elaborates on this point in his new
post, pulling no punches:

Milanovic quite rightly waves away degrowthers' protestations that GDP
is not a good measure of human welfare. GDP isn't perfect, he notes, but
it's close enough where the basic point stands.

[Demanding]{.underline} that [people in rich countries accept absolutely
catastrophic declines]{.underline} in their living standards **[is a
political non-starter]{.underline}**. Klein, on his podcast, tries to
point this out as gently as possible:

[Milanovic is less gentle, calling [this "**outright magical
thinking**]{.mark}".]{.underline} He is correct. [When you look at how
much people in America are willing to sacrifice in terms of their
material well-being in order to fight climate change, it's **far
less**]{.underline} than what Klein is talking about. And Klein is
really softballing it here --- [it's not just giving up **beef** and
**SUVs**, it's a dramatic reduction in the size of **housing** and the
amount of **food** and the ease of **transportation** and the quality of
**medical care**]{.underline} that people in rich countries enjoy. [It
is, frankly, **not happening**]{.underline}.

But [even this vastly understates the political and practical
difficulties of degrowth]{.underline}. Piper adds several key points.
First of all, she notes, because developed countries have been
decoupling resource use and growth for a while now, [curbing resource
use will actually cause a lot more restrictions on developing
countries]{.underline} than Milanovic's simple calculations would
suggest:

> From a climate change perspective, though, there's a problem \[with
> simply reducing rich-world living standards\]. First, it means that
> [degrowth would do nothing about the **bulk of emissions**, which are
> occurring in **developing countries**.]{.underline}

This is an incredibly important point. For example, [[China]{.mark} now
[produces more CO2]{.mark} emissions than the U.S., the EU, and Japan
combined:]{.underline}

> ![Chart, line chart Description automatically
> generated](media/image8.png){width="3.688024934383202in"
> height="2.6039074803149607in"}

(**[And no, this is not because of outsourcing]{.underline}**, as [you
can see by looking at the trade-adjusted emissions
numbers]{.underline}.)

Another way of looking at this is that [China's CO2 emissions per dollar
of GDP are more than twice America's]{.underline}, and about five times
that of the EU. Any global degrowth plan that actually reduces resource
use is going to entail more pain for China than its GDP numbers would
suggest, simply because China is at a more resource-intensive stage of
growth.

[Do you think **China will accept a substantial diminution of its living
standards**]{.underline}, in order [to satisfy the
environmental-economic diktats of activists]{.underline} in Northern
Europe? [If so, you need to **rethink a great many
things**]{.underline}.

Anyway, Piper makes a second crucially important point. So far we've
been waving our hands and talking about lowering rich-world GDP while
raising GDP for poor countries. In fact, economies don't work like that:

> Second, the global economy is more interconnected than Hickel implies.
> When Covid-19 hit, poor countries were devastated not just by the
> virus but by the aftershocks of virus-induced slowdowns in consumption
> in rich countries.
>
> There's some genuine appeal to the idea of an end to "consumerism,"
> but the pandemic offered a taste of how [a sudden drop in rich-world
> consumption would]{.underline} actually [affect the developing
> world]{.underline}. Covid-19 dramatically curtailed Western imports
> and tourism for a time. [The [consequences in poor countries were
> **devastating**. **Hunger** rose, and **child mortality**
> followed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Degrowth would thus require deep changes in the entire way that the
global economy works. Change happens, but not like that; implementing
the kind of reallocation schemes that degrowthers throw around with
abandon would require global economic planning that would put Gosplan to
shame. Klein points this out, again rather gently:

> [[Degrowth is]{.underline}]{.mark}, as its advocates understand it, a
> act of global [economic planning]{.underline} really **[without equal
> anywhere in human history]{.underline}**. It is an act of
> extraordinary central planning.

In other words, **[it is [abject fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Taken together, [these criticisms are **utterly
devastating**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the entire
[degrowth]{.underline} project. In its current form, [it will not
advance beyond a **media fad**]{.underline}. No matter how shrilly
degrowthers quote apocalyptic projections, [the things they call for
simply **will not happen**.]{.underline}

### Sustainable -- Dematerialization

#### Capitalism causes [dematerialization]{.underline} which solves sustainability 

**Zitelmann 21** -- studied history and political sciences, graduating
with a doctorate "summa cum laude" in 1986. His dissertation was
published in both German and English: Hitler. The Policies of Seduction.
Rainer Zitelmann began his career lecturing history at the Freie
Universität Berlin from 1987 to 1992. He then became chief editor at one
of the leading and most prestigious publishing houses in Germany,
Ullstein-Propyläen. He followed this with the role of section editor at
the major German daily newspaper "Die Welt", which he held until 2000.

World?,\" National Interest, 2-12-2021,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/consumption-presumption-are-human-beings-destroying-world-178114)

[Some people claim]{.underline} that [we need to cut our
consumption]{.underline} or there will be no hope for the planet. Such
[[claims]{.mark} are [based]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the thesis that continued growth increases the
rate at which the earth's [[finite resources]{.underline}]{.mark} are
consumed and, moreover, leads to irreversible climate change. And
**[such warnings are [by no means new]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In 1970,
for instance, the Club of Rome attracted a great deal of attention with
the publication of The Limits to Growth. A Report for the Club of Rome's
Project on the Predicament of Mankind, which has to date sold more than
thirty million copies in thirty languages. The book warned people to
change their ways and had a clear message: the world's raw materials,
and in particular, oil would soon be used up. In twenty years, the
scientists predicted, we would have used the very last drop of oil. Of
course, the Club of Rome's models for the depletion of oil---and almost
all other major raw materials---were wrong. [According to the
scenarios]{.underline} presented in The Limits to Growth, [[we
should]{.mark} now [be]{.mark} living on a planet that has been [devoid
of]{.mark} [natural gas, copper]{.mark}, lead, aluminum and tungsten for
decades]{.underline}. And **[we were supposed to have run out of silver
in 1985.]{.underline}** Despite the bleak forecasts, as of January 2020,
the United States Geological Survey estimated silver reserves worldwide
at 560,000 tons. Employing an extensive array of data, the American
scientist Andrew McAfee proves in his book More from Less that
**[[economic growth]{.mark} is [no longer]{.mark} [coupled to]{.mark}
the [consumption]{.mark} of raw materials.]{.underline}** Data for the
United States, for example, show that [[of seventy-two
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, from aluminum to zinc, **[[only six are
not yet post-peak]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, [[despite
the]{.mark} fact [that the]{.mark} U.S. [economy has grown]{.mark}
strongly]{.underline} in recent years, **[[consumption]{.mark} of many
commodities [is]{.mark} actually [decreasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Back in 2015, the American environmental scientist Jesse Ausubel wrote
an essay, "The Return of Nature: How Technology Liberates the
Environment," showing that [Americans are consuming fewer and fewer raw
materials per capita. [Total consumption]{.mark}]{.underline} of steel,
copper, fertilizer, wood and paper, which had previously always risen in
line with economic growth, **[[had plateaued]{.mark} and was now in
constant decline]{.underline}**. Such [across-the-board
reductions]{.underline} in natural resource consumption are [[only
possible because of]{.mark} much-maligned
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[companies]{.mark} are constantly
[developing more efficient production]{.mark} methods and reducing the
amount of raw materials they consume.]{.underline} Of course, **[they
are]{.underline}** not **[doing this]{.underline}** primarily to protect
the environment but **[[to cut costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What\'s
more, a [constant stream of innovations]{.underline} has
[promoted]{.underline} the trend of miniaturization or
[dematerialization]{.underline}. Just think of your smartphone. How many
devices has your smartphone replaced and how many raw materials did they
use to consume? Nowadays, many people no longer have a fax machine or
street atlas because they have everything they need on their smartphone.
Some even use their phones instead of a wristwatch. You used to need
four separate microphones in your telephone, cassette recorder,
Dictaphone and video camera, today you just need one---in your
smartphone. [The finite nature of the world's natural resources is one
argument against growth]{.underline}, **[[climate change]{.mark} is
another]{.underline}**. Let's take China as an example:
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [emits more CO2 than any other
country]{.underline} in the world and is
**[[building]{.underline}]{.mark}** a number of **[new [nuclear power
plants]{.mark} in order to [achieve carbon neutrality]{.mark} by
2060]{.underline}**. With the new build program well underway, China's
first new-generation nuclear power plant recently went into operation.
In the very near future, China intends to start exporting power plants.
[The latest generation of nuclear power plants is much safer than
earlier models---and can play [a pivotal role]{.mark} in the fight
against climate change]{.underline}. In the United States, Joe
[[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} is already [evaluating]{.underline} the
advantages of small modular reactor (SMR) **[nuclear power
plants]{.underline}**. As the name suggests, SMRs are smaller than
traditional nuclear fission reactors and offer a maximum capacity of
three hundred megawatts. In the [U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, for example, a consortium led by Rolls-Royce has
announced plans to [[build]{.underline}]{.mark} up to sixteen
[[SMR]{.mark} power plants]{.underline}. So far, two reactors of this
type are in operation, both onboard the floating nuclear power plant
"Akademik Lomonosov, which supplies heat and electricity to the Siberian
city of Pevec and its one hundred thousand inhabitants. Anticapitalists
blame capitalism for resource consumption and climate change. But
[[political decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}---[such as]{.underline}
Germany's decision to phase out [nuclear
energy]{.underline}---frequently **[[have a negative impact on climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Telling people to cut their
consumption]{.underline} must seem like [pure mockery to
the]{.underline} hundreds of [millions of [people]{.mark}]{.underline}
around the world who are still [living [in]{.mark} extreme
[poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[What they [need]{.mark}
is]{.underline}** more capitalism and **[[economic
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Just like [in
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, where the number of [people living in
extreme [poverty]{.mark} has [fallen from 88]{.mark} percent [in]{.mark}
19[81]{.mark} [to]{.mark} less than [1]{.mark} percent
[today]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Andrew McAfee's book has an
optimistic message about how we don\'t have to turn back the clocks and
cut our consumption: capitalism and technological progress are allowing
us to steward the world's resources, rather than stripping them bare.

### Tech Inev

#### The technology age is [inevitable]{.underline}. Global capitalism, political momentum, and militarism prove. 

**Kelly '16** (Kevin; 2016; Awarded author, founder of Wired Magazine,
citing data from the past thirty years; Book*, The Inevitable:
Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future*)

In the three decades since then, this [[technological
convergence]{.mark} between communication and computation has **spread,
sped up, blossomed, and [evolved]{.mark}**. The internet]{.underline}/
web/ mobile system has [moved]{.underline} from the fringes of society
(where it was pretty much ignored in 1981) [[to]{.mark} the [center
stage of]{.mark} our modern global [society]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
past 30 years [the social economy based on this technology has had its
ups and downs and seen its heroes come and go, but it is very clear
there have been **large-scale trends** governing what has happened.
These broad historical [trends are crucial because]{.mark} the
**[underlying conditions]{.mark}** that birthed them [are]{.mark}
**still [active and developing]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark} strongly
[suggests]{.mark} that [these trends **will continue to
increase**]{.mark} in the next few decades]{.underline}. [There is
**nothing on the horizon to decrease them.**]{.underline} Even the
forces we might think could derail them, like crime, war, or our own
excesses, also follow these emerging patterns. In this book I describe a
dozen of these inevitable technological forces that will shape the next
30 years. "Inevitable" is a strong word. It sends up red flags for some
people because they object that nothing is inevitable. They claim that
human willpower and purpose can--- and should!--- deflect, overpower,
and control any mechanical trend. In their view, "inevitability" is a
free will cop-out we surrender to. [When the notion of the inevitable is
forged with fancy technology]{.underline}, as I do here[, the objections
to a preordained destiny are even more fierce and
passionate.]{.underline} One definition of "inevitable" is the final
outcome in the classic rewinding thought experiment. If we rewound the
tape of history back to the beginning of time and reran our civilization
from the start again and again, a strong version of inevitability says
that, no matter how many times we reran it, every time we end up with
teenagers tweeting every five minutes in 2016. That's not what I mean. I
mean inevitable in a different way. [[There is **bias in**]{.mark} **the
nature of [technology]{.mark}** [that tilts]{.mark} it [in certain
directions]{.mark} and not others]{.underline}. All things being equal,
[the physics and mathematics that rule the dynamics of technology tend
to favor certain behaviors. These tendencies exist primarily in the
aggregate forces that shape the general contours of technological forms
[and do not govern specifics]{.mark} or particular
instances.]{.underline} For example, [the form of an
internet]{.underline}--- a network of networks spanning the globe---
**[was inevitable]{.underline}**, but the specific kind of internet we
chose to have was not. The internet could have been commercial rather
than nonprofit, or a national system instead of international, or it
could have been secret instead of public. [Telephony]{.underline}---
long-distance electrically transmitted voice messages--- [was
inevitable]{.underline}, but the iPhone was not. The generic form of a
four-wheeled vehicle was inevitable, but SUVs were not. Instant
messaging was inevitable, but tweeting every five minutes was not.
Tweeting every five minutes is not inevitable in another way. [[We are
morphing so fast]{.mark} that [our ability to invent]{.mark} new things
[outpaces the rate we can civilize]{.mark} them.]{.underline} These days
it takes us a decade after a technology appears to develop a social
consensus on what it means and what etiquette we need to tame it. In
another five years we'll find a polite place for twittering, just as we
figured out what to do with cell phones ringing everywhere. (Use silent
vibrators.) Just like that, this initial response will disappear quickly
and we'll see it was neither essential nor inevitable. [The kind of
[inevitability]{.mark} I am speaking of here in the digital realm [is
**the result of momentum**]{.mark}**.** The momentum of an ongoing
technological shift. The strong tides that shaped digital technologies
for the past 30 years will **continue to expand and harden** in the next
30 years]{.underline}. These apply to not just North America, but to the
entire world. Throughout this book I use [examples]{.underline} from the
United States because readers will be more familiar with them, but for
each I could have easily found a corresponding example in India, Mali,
Peru, or Estonia. The true leaders in digital money, for example, [are
in Africa and Afghanistan]{.underline}, where e-money is sometimes the
only functioning currency. [China]{.underline} is way ahead of everyone
else in developing sharing [applications]{.underline} on mobile. But
while [culture]{.underline} can advance or retard the expression, the
[**underlying forces** are universal]{.underline}.

### Cap Solves War

#### Solves Nuclear War

**Bedell, '21** (Denise Bedell has an Honors BA in Psychology at the
University of Windsor and wrote a thesis, Peace Through Profit: How
Capitalism Helps Restore and Revive Former Warzones, This is Capitalism

[Meet and Greet Looking more closely at]{.underline} the [experiences of
recent war zones]{.underline} makes clear how **[[capitalism]{.mark} can
[bring together]{.mark} former [opponents]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [By
[improv]{.mark}ing citizens' quality of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}
through economic development, and by creating interdependency through
trade, this can [[reduce]{.mark} the [incentive]{.mark} for nations to
take up arms]{.underline} against their neighbors. [Take the
Balkans.]{.underline} The Balkan peninsula is made up of Croatia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia,
Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and the European part of Turkey. This
[region was a hotbed of conflict when the former Yugoslavia]{.underline}
[broke up at the end of the cold war]{.underline} (and, in fact the
region has a long history of armed conflict). The [[Kosovo]{.mark} War
in 1998-1999, for example,]{.underline} was fought [between the Serbian
Yugoslav authority]{.underline} (by then, Yugoslavia was made up of
Serbia and Macedonia) --- which controlled Kosovo --- [and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army]{.underline} (backed by NATO air support). The
[deadly [conflict]{.mark} saw thousands massacred]{.underline} in what a
U.N. court would later deem a "systematic campaign of terror." Those
dark days are far gone, however, and [these [neighbors now work together
in]{.mark} a virtuous [econ]{.mark}omic [cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Early in 2018, Pristina, [the capital of Kosovo, hosted a four-day trade
fair]{.underline} --- at which [70 of the 174 companies present were
Serbian]{.underline}. "I hope [we will send the signal that the
cooperation is already there]{.underline}," noted Marko Cadez of
Serbia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "The people are working, the
people are employing, making products, making profits --- and that is
most important for our country." Or consider relations between [[India
and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [strategic and military
rivals]{.underline} that [have threatened nuclear war on numerous
occasions.]{.underline} [Despite these tensions]{.underline},
[[bilateral trade]{.mark} between the two]{.underline} countries [[was
worth]{.mark} around [\$2.6 billion]{.mark} in 2016]{.underline},
according to Indian government figures. Unofficial estimates suggest
that it is twice that amount --- and that the potential for trade is
many times greater yet. "[Peace building and peacemaking]{.underline}
[will always be subject to the larger political issues]{.underline}
between India and Pakistan," according to a report in 2017 from the
independent and non-partisan federally mandated United States Institute
of Peace (USIP). But, according to USIP, [economic and trade
cooperation]{.underline} can [offers a path toward greater stability and
peace between the countries]{.underline} --- and across South Asia as a
whole. A research report titled "Pakistan-India Relations: Peace Through
bilateral Trade" --- by Muhammad Ali, Noreen Mujahid and Aziz ur Rehman
of the University of Karachi --- determined that by [increasing
bilateral [trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, it [can [help **resolve political
issues**]{.mark} between the two countries]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} **[reduce poverty]{.underline}**. The report,
published in the European Scientific Journal, noted: "[If Pakistan and
India normalize their economic relations]{.underline}, it will enhance
the formal trade --- and as a result, [both the countries will earn
significant revenue]{.underline}, which is lost due to informal trade."
The authors stated that as formal trade volumes rise, "[both governments
will be compelled to]{.underline} **[normalize their political
relations]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[resolve their border
disputes]{.underline}** [in an amicable manner]{.underline}." Hence ---
[as trade increases]{.underline}, [pressure mounts on the
authorities]{.underline} **[to ensure nothing interferes]{.underline}**
[with those economic ties]{.underline}. Internal Strength
[[Capitalism]{.mark} not only [facilitates peace]{.mark} between
nations]{.underline}, **[but also within them]{.underline}**. [Rwanda
experienced]{.underline} a [horrific genocide in the]{.underline}
[1990s]{.underline}. But [since then]{.underline}, the [country has
undergone a dramatic transformation]{.underline} --- in part, [because
of the hard work of companies that have partnered with the
government]{.underline} and outside agencies **[to [create]{.mark}
sustainable [businesses]{.mark} and industries]{.underline}** [that are
building a stable and growing economy]{.underline}. [One of the many
companies]{.underline} [that]{.underline} has [helped engender peace and
create stability]{.underline} since Rwanda's darkest days [is Westrock
Coffee]{.underline}. CEO Scott Ford's pioneering work has helped to
build a sustainable, free-market system for independent coffee producers
in the country. [Ford espoused]{.underline} [a direct]{.underline} trade
[model]{.underline} --- [paying local smallholder farmers a fair market
value for]{.underline} their [coffee beans]{.underline}. He also built
an agricultural training institute for local farmers, many of whom are
women. As [Ford explained]{.underline}: "[What we are trying to do in
Rwanda]{.underline} [is]{.underline} be the engine that
[help]{.underline}s [them create their own \[economic\]
ecosystem]{.underline}." (read more of his story here). Another example
in Rwanda is [[A]{.mark}frica [I]{.mark}mproved
[F]{.mark}oods]{.underline}, which [specializes in fortified foods to
combat malnutrition]{.underline}. At an event earlier this year to mark
the genocide, [AIF's chief executive]{.underline}, Amar Ali, [[outlined
how business]{.mark} can help [prevent]{.mark} the
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that lead to
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. "At Africa Improved Foods, we want to be
a flagship for Rwanda --- not only in what we build and the products we
produce, but also the way we treat each other," he said. "[Everybody is
a human being first]{.underline}, and should be treated as such ---
[irrespective of gender, race, religion, tribe,]{.underline} or any
other categorization." In September of 2018, AIF received an SDG award
for sustainable consumption (based on the UN's Sustainable Development
Goals) from the Swiss Green Economy Symposium. The award recognized the
company for its innovative joint venture in Rwanda, along with the
government of Rwanda, a consortium of various banks, and the
International Finance Corporation, for promoting local production by
buying farmers' maize and soy yields directly at competitive prices.
[AIF's factory in Kigali]{.underline}, the Rwandan capital, [provides
work to some 300 people]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
local-sourcing program [provides around 24,000 Rwandan farmers with
stable, sustainable income]{.underline}. [Capitalism]{.underline} not
only [creates an environment for peace]{.underline} but [[when
cap]{.mark}italism [stumbles]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [so
do]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [prospects]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[for]{.mark} **international [harmony]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [In
2016]{.underline}, [more]{.underline}]{.mark} [countries
[experienced]{.mark} violent [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} [than at any
time in nearly 30 years]{.underline}. Not coincidentally, trade growth
has been in something of a rut for most of the period since the global
financial crisis. [[In that]{.underline}]{.mark} calamitous
[[year]{.underline}]{.mark} of 2016, [[trade growth]{.underline} [fell
below 3%]{.underline}]{.mark} for the fifth consecutive year.

Economic recovery efforts since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis

**[there are [growing concerns about the increased possibility of
large-scale military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

More worryingly, in [[the current political landscape, prolonged

war.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Crisis responses limited

[The [2008]{.mark}-2009 global financial crisis [almost 'bankrupted'
governments]{.mark} and caused systemic collapse]{.underline}.
[[Policymakers managed to pull the world economy from the brink,]{.mark}

[low]{.mark}, if not negative real [interest

economy. Since then, despite promising to do so, policymakers have not
seriously pursued, let alone achieved, such needed reforms.

Instead, [ostensible structural reformers have taken advantage of the
crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts to further 'casualize'
labour markets]{.underline}. This lack of structural reform has meant
that the unprecedented liquidity central banks injected into economies
has not been well allocated to stimulate resurgence of the real economy.

From bust to bubble

Instead, [easy credit raised asset prices to levels even higher than
those prevailing before 2008]{.underline}. US house prices are now 8%
more than at the peak of the property bubble in 2006, while its
price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in 2008 and in
1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great Depression.

[As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, [another economic
crisis]{.mark} --- possibly [more severe than the last]{.mark}, as the
economy has become less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions
--- [is]{.mark} considered **[likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A decade of
such unconventional monetary policies, with very low interest rates, has
greatly depleted their ability to revive the economy.

The implications beyond the economy of such developments and policy
responses are already being seen. Prolonged economic distress has
worsened public antipathy towards the culturally alien --- not only
abroad, but also within. Thus, [[another round of economic
stress]{.mark} is deemed likely to **[foment unrest, conflict, even
war]{.mark}** as it is blamed on the foreign.]{.underline}

International trade shrank by two-thirds within half a decade after the
US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, at the start of the Great
Depression, ostensibly to protect American workers and farmers from
foreign competition!

Liberalization's discontents

**[Rising economic [insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, inequalities and
deprivation are expected to strengthen ethno-populist and jingoistic
nationalist sentiments, and **[[increase social tensions and turmoil,
especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or
threatened.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Thus, **[[ethno-populist]{.mark} inspired chauvinistic [nationalism may
exacerbate tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[leading to
conflicts]{.mark} and tensions among countries, as in the
1930s.]{.underline} Opportunistic leaders have been blaming such
misfortunes on outsiders and may seek to reverse policies associated
with the perceived causes, such as 'globalist' economic liberalization.

Policies which successfully check such problems may reduce social
tensions, as well as the likelihood of social turmoil and conflict,
including among countries. However, these may also inadvertently
exacerbate problems. The recent spread of anti-globalization sentiment
appears correlated to slow, if not negative per capita income growth and
increased economic inequality.

To be sure, globalization and liberalization are statistically
associated with growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism.
[Declining real incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently
strengthened ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening
economic liberalization itself, both within and among
countries.]{.underline}

Insecurity, populism, conflict

Thomas Piketty has argued that a sudden increase in income inequality is
often followed by a great crisis. Although causality is difficult to
prove, with wealth and income inequality now at historical highs, this
should give cause for concern.

Of course, other factors also contribute to or exacerbate civil and
international tensions, with some due to policies intended for other
purposes. Nevertheless, even if unintended, such developments could
inadvertently catalyse future crises and conflicts.

Publics often have good reason to be restless, if not angry, but the
emotional appeals of ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are
leading to chauvinistic policy measures which only make things worse.

At the international level, despite the world's unprecedented and still
growing interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed as the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist
policies without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual
allies.

#### Capitalism [solves war]{.underline} on a massive scale -- it creates lock-in mechanisms that bind countries together and economically dampens conflict -- robust studies 

**Dafoe 14** (Allan Dafoe & Nina Kelsey; assistant professor in
political science at Yale & research associate in international
economics at Berkeley; Journal of Peace Research, "Observing the
capitalist peace: Examining market-mediated signaling and other
mechanisms,"
http://jpr.sagepub.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/51/5/619.full)

[Countries with liberal political and economic systems **rarely use
military force** against each other.]{.underline} This anomalous [peace
has been most prominently attributed to the 'democratic
peace']{.underline} -- the apparent tendency for democratic countries to
avoid militarized conflict with each other (Maoz & Russett, 1993; Ray,
1995; Dafoe, Oneal & Russett, 2013).More recently, however, [scholars
have proposed that the [liberal peace]{.mark} could be]{.underline}
partly (Russett & Oneal, 2001) or [primarily]{.underline} (Gartzke,
2007; but see Dafoe, 2011) **[[attributed to]{.mark} liberal [economic
factors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[such as commercial and financial
interdependence]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In particular, Erik Gartzke,
Quan Li & Charles Boehmer (2001), henceforth referred to as GLB, have
demonstrated that [measures of capital openness have a substantial and
**statistically significant association with peaceful** dyadic
relations]{.underline}. Gartzke (2007[) confirms that this association
is robust to a large variety of model specifications.]{.underline} To
explain this correlation, GLB propose that countries [with [open capital
markets]{.mark} are more able to [credibly signal]{.mark} their [resolve
through]{.mark} **the [bearing of]{.mark} greater economic [costs prior
to]{.mark} the outbreak of [militarized conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
This explanation is novel and plausible, and resonates with the
rationalist view of asymmetric information as a cause of conflict
(Fearon, 1995). Moreover, it implies clear testable predictions on
evidential domains different from those examined by GLB. In this article
[we exploit this opportunity by constructing a confirmatory test of
GLB's theory of **market-mediated signaling**. We first develop an
innovative quantitative case selection technique to identify crucial
cases where the mechanism of market-mediated signaling should be most
easily observed]{.underline}. Specifically, we employ quantitative data
and the statistical models used to support the theory we are probing to
create an impartial and transparentmeans of selecting cases in which the
theory -- as specified by the theory's creators --makes its most
confident predictions.We implement three different case selection rules
to select cases that optimize on two criteria: (1) maximizing the
inferential leverage of our cases, and (2) minimizing selection bias. We
examine these cases for a necessary implication of market-mediated
signaling: that key participants drew a connection between conflictual
events and adverse market movements. Such an inference is a necessary
step in the process by which market-mediated costs can signal resolve.
For evidence of this we examine news media, government documents,
memoirs, historical works, and other sources. We additionally examine
other sources, such as market data, for evidence that economic costs
were caused by escalatory events. Based on this analysis, we assess the
evidence for GLB's theory of market mediated costly signaling. Our
article then considers a more complex heterogeneous effects version of
market-mediated signaling in which unspecified scope conditions are
required for the mechanism to operate. Our design has the feature of
selecting cases in which scope conditions are most likely to be absent.
This allows us to perform an exploratory analysis of these cases,
looking for possible scope conditions. We also consider alternative
potential mechanisms. Our cases are reviewed in more detail in the
online appendix.1 To summarize our results, [our confirmatory test finds
that while **market-mediated signaling may be operative in the most
serious disputes, it was largely absent in the less serious disputes**
that characterize most of the sample of militarized interstate
disputes]{.underline} (MIDs). [This suggests either that other
mechanisms account for the correlation between capital openness and
peace, or that the scope conditions for market-mediated signaling are
restrictive]{.underline}. Of the signals that we observed, **[[strategic
market-mediated signals were]{.mark} relatively more [important]{.mark}
than automatic market-mediated signals in the most serious
conflicts.]{.underline}** [We identify]{.underline} a number of
potential scope conditions, such as that (1) [the conflict must be
driven by bargaining failure arising from uncertainty and (2) the
economic costs need to escalate gradually and need to be substantial,
but less than the expected military costs of conflict]{.underline}.
Finally, there were a number of other explanations that seemed present
in the cases we examined and could account for the capitalist peace:
**[[capital openness is associated with]{.mark} greater [anticipated
economic costs of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [capital openness
leads **third parties** to have a greater stake in the conflict and
therefore be more willing to intervene;]{.underline} a dyadic acceptance
of the status quo could promote both peace and capital openness; and
countries seeking to institutionalize a regional peace might
instrumentally harness the pacifying effects of liberal markets. The
correlation: Open capital markets and peace The empirical puzzle at the
core of this article is the significant and robust correlation noted by
GLB between high levels of capital openness in both members of a dyad
and the infrequent incidence of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs)
and wars between the members of this dyad (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001).
The index of capital openness (CAPOPEN) is intended to capture the
'difficulty states face in seeking to impose restrictions on capital
flows (the degree of lost policy autonomy due to globalization)'
(Gartzke & Li, 2003: 575). CAPOPEN is constructed from data drawn from
the widely used IMF's Annual Reports on Exchange Arrangements and
Exchange Controls; it is a combination of eight binary variables that
measure different types of government restrictions on capital and
currency flow (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 407). The measure of CAPOPEN
starts in 1966 and is defined for many countries (increasingly more over
time). Most of the countries that do not have a measure of CAPOPEN are
communist.2 GLB implement this variable in a dyadic framework by
creating a new variable, CAPOPENL, which is the smaller of the two
dyadic values of CAPOPEN. This operationalization is sometimes referred
to as the 'weak-link' specification since the functional form is
consonant with a model of war in which the 'weakest link' in a dyad
determines the probability of war. CAPOPENL has a negative monotonic
association with the incidence of MIDs, fatal MIDs, and wars (see Figure
1).3 The strength of the estimated empirical association between peace
and CAPOPENL, using a modified version of the dataset and model from
Gartzke (2007), is comparable to that between peace and, respectively,
joint democracy, log of distance, or the GDP of a contiguous dyad
(Gartzke, 2007: 179; Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 412). In summary,
CAPOPENL seems to be an important and robust correlate of peace. The
question of why specifically this correlation exists, however, remains
to be answered. The mechanism: Market-mediated signaling? Gartzke, Li &
Boehmer (2001) argue that the classic liberal account for the pacific
effect of economic interdependence -- that interdependence increases the
expected costs of war -- is not consistent with the bargaining theory of
war (see also Morrow, 1999). GLB argue that 'conventional descriptions
of interdependence see war as less likely because states face additional
opportunity costs for fighting. The problem with such an account is that
it ignores incentives to capitalize on an opponent's reticence to fight'
(Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 400.)4 Instead, GLB (see also Gartzke,
2003; Gartzke & Li, 2003) argue [that financial interdependence could
promote peace by facilitating the sending of **costly signals**. As the
probability of militarized conflict increases, states incur a variety of
automatic and strategically imposed economic costs as a consequence of
escalation toward conflict.]{.underline} [Those states that persist in a
dispute despite these costs will reveal their willingness to tolerate
them, and **hence signal resolve**]{.underline}. [The greater the degree
of economic interdependence, the more a resolved country could
demonstrate its willingness to suffer costs ex ante to militarized
conflict.]{.underline} Gartzke, Li & Boehmer's mechanism implies a
commonly perceived costly signal before militarized conflict breaks out
or escalates: if market-mediated signaling is to account for the
correlation between CAPOPENL and the absence of MIDs, then visible
market-mediated costs should occur prior to or during periods of real or
potential conflict (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001). Thus, the proposed
mechanism should leave many visible footprints in the historical record.
[This theory predicts that these visible signals must arise in any
escalating conflict, involving countries with high capital openness, in
which this mechanism is operative]{.underline} Clarifying the signaling
mechanism Gartzke, Li & Boehmer's signaling mechanism is mostly
conceptualized on an abstract, game-theoretic level (Gartzke, Li &
Boehmer, 2001). In order to elucidate the types of observations that
could inform this theory's validity, we discuss with greater specificity
the possible ways in which such signaling might occur. [A conceptual
classification of costly signals The term signaling connotes an
intentional communicative act by one party directed towards
another]{.underline}. Because the term signaling thus suggests a willful
act, and **[a signal of resolve is only credible if it is
costly]{.underline}**, [scholars have sometimes concluded that states
involved in bargaining under incomplete information could advance their
interests by imposing costs on themselves and thereby signaling their
resolve]{.underline} (e.g. Lektzian & Sprecher, 2007). However, the
game-theoretic concept of signaling refers more generally to any
situation in which an actor's behavior reveals information about her
private information. In fact, [states frequently adopt sanctions with
low costs to themselves and high costs to their rivals because doing so
is often a rational bargaining tactic on other grounds: they are trying
to coerce their rival to concede the issue.]{.underline} [[Bargaining
encounters]{.mark} of this type can be conceptualized as a type of
war-of-attrition game [in which each **actor attempts to coerce the
other through the imposition of escalating costs**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Such encounters also provide the opportunity for signaling: when states
resist the costs imposed by their rivals, **they 'signal' their
resolve.**]{.underline} If at some point one party perceives the
conflict to have become too costly and steps back, that party 'signals'
a lack of resolve. Thus, [this kind of signaling arises as a by-product
of another's coercive attempts.]{.underline} In other words, costly
signals come in two forms: self-inflicted (information about a leader
arising from a leader's intentional or incidental infliction of costs on
himself) or imposed (information about a leader that arises from a
leader's response to a rival's imposition of costs). Additionally,
[costs may arise as an automatic byproduct of escalation towards
military conflict or may be a tool of statecraft that is strategically
employed during a conflict.]{.underline} The automatic mechanism
stipulates that as the probability of conflict increases, **[various
[economic assets will lose value due to the risk of conflict and
investor flight]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However, the occurrence of these
costs may also be intentional outcomes of specific escalatory decisions
of the states, as in the case of deliberate sanctions; in this case they
are strategic. [Finally, at a practical level, [we identify]{.mark}
three different potential kinds of economic costs of militarized
conflict]{.underline} that may be mediated by open capital markets:
[**[capital costs from political risk, monetary coercion, and business
sanctions.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[Ideally]{.underline}, the [mitigation of climate risks
will]{.underline} **[coincide]{.underline}** [with and]{.underline}
**[contribute]{.underline}** [to the development of improved or even
entirely novel **sources of energy**]{.underline} [that will increase
the **long-term chances of humankind's survival**]{.underline} [by means
of]{.underline} **[[space colonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This
[is]{.mark} **not an un[realistic]{.mark} expectation**]{.underline},
[given that the mitigation of climate risks consists]{.underline}, to a
large degree, [of replacing fossil fuels with other, less harmful
sources of energy]{.underline}. However, [some [climate]{.mark} change
[mitigation]{.mark} strategies might actually]{.underline}
**[[harm]{.mark} the [long-term prospects]{.mark} of
humankind]{.underline}**.

First, [it is possible that dominant climate change
[mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} strategies [[will]{.mark} actively
**[exclude]{.mark}** any form of]{.underline} **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [from the repertoire of climate-friendly
energy sources. Existing and experimental]{.underline} (molten salt)
[fission reactors could play a significant role in replacing
carbon-heavy energy sources]{.underline}, but pro-environmental
attitudes often overlap with anti-nuclear sentiments \[65\]. As a
result, and in combination with other problems such as large-scale
market failures of existing fission reactors (one of the reasons being
that generating electricity from fossil fuels is cheaper) \[66\],
nuclear fission does not currently have significant standing as a
"cleantech" contribution to climate change mitigation. From a long-term
perspective, an unfavorable view of nuclear energy in the context of
climate change might mean that technological progress in the areas of
nuclear fission and fusion might come to a halt (for example, due to
explicit bans or implicit disincentives). [If such a scenario came to
be, our [attempts at **colonizing space** would]{.mark}
almost]{.underline} **[certainly [fail]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [There
are currently no alternatives to **fission** and **fusion**, and it
is]{.underline} **[highly improbable]{.underline}** [that Solar power
alone could suffice for sustaining **extraterrestrial
habitats**]{.underline}.

Second, [there is some probability that climate change mitigation
strategies will **change the social order**]{.underline} [towards
a]{.underline} **[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [philosophy. Degrowth
is a vague socio-economic concept and social movement that]{.underline},
in general, [[calls for]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[contraction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the global and national
economies by means [of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[lower
production]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[[consumption]{.mark}

[more **profound changes**]{.underline} [to the "capitalist" system
of]{.underline} **[economic [production]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[67\].
Degrowth or degrowth-like approaches are being actively considered as
climate risk mitigation strategies \[68, 69\], and [degrowth would
almost certainly be a highly effective measure for mitigating climate
change]{.underline}. After all, if we were to drastically reduce or even
completely eliminate the (industrial) sources of greenhouse gases, [the
amount of greenhouse gases that are being emitted would accordingly
drastically sink. [From]{.mark} the **long-term
[perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} **humankind's
[survival]{.mark}**[, degrowth is **problematic**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in at least two ways. [First, there is a risk that the general
[contraction of]{.mark} economic [activity would]{.mark} also slow
or]{.underline} [**[eliminate progress]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the domain of]{.underline}
[**[energy]{.underline}**, [which would,]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn,
[[reduce]{.mark} the [probability of]{.mark} **successful [space
colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline} [due to an absence of **suitable
energy sources**]{.underline}. [Second, and more fundamental: [If
degrowth were]{.mark} to become [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[dominant]{.mark} societal [paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [it is
**uncertain** whether]{.underline}]{.mark} [the long-term survival of
humankind by means of **[space colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[would be]{.mark} regarded a **[desirable]{.mark} goal**]{.underline}.
[In a literal sense, [establishing]{.mark} **extraterrestrial [colonies
would mean growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [the size of the total human
population would grow,]{.underline} and the area of space-time that
humans occupy would grow.

[In a more philosophical sense, [degrowth might]{.mark} even
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[antithetical to]{.mark} space
[colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Even though both degrowth and
space colonization have a similar moral goal]{.underline} -- [increasing
wellbeing]{.underline} -- , [the ends to that goal are very different.
Within degrowth]{.underline} philosophy, [the goal is,]{.underline}
metaphorically speaking, [not to "live beyond our means": We should
strive for "ecological balance", and such a state should increase
the]{.underline} **[average wellbeing]{.underline}**. [But the frame of
reference is the status quo; Earth and humankind as we know it
**today**. [Space colonization]{.mark},]{.underline} on the other hand,
[[operates with a]{.mark} much]{.underline} [**[larger frame]{.mark}**
of reference]{.underline}: **[[All]{.mark} the [future
generations]{.mark} of humans]{.underline}** (and other sentient beings)
[who could enjoy wellbeing if we succeed in colonizing
space]{.underline} -- [and who will categorically be **[denied]{.mark}
that [wellbeing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[if we fail to colonize]{.mark}
space]{.underline} \[70\]. [The goal of space colonization as a **moral
project**]{.underline} [is not to live beyond our means, but to actively
**redefine** and]{.underline} **[expand]{.underline}** [what our means

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/01/spacexs-success-is-one-small-step-man-one-giant-leap-capitalism/)

[It was one small step for man, one [giant leap for
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Only three countries have ever launched
human beings into orbit. This past weekend, **[SpaceX became the first
private company ever to do so]{.underline}**, when it sent its Crew
Dragon capsule into space aboard its Falcon 9 rocket and docked with the
International Space Station. [This was accomplished by a company Elon
Musk started in 2002 in a California strip mall warehouse with just a
dozen employees and a mariachi band]{.underline}. [At a time when our
nation is debating the merits of socialism[, **SpaceX**]{.mark} **has
given us [an incredible testament to]{.mark} the power of
[American]{.mark} free [enterprise]{.mark}.**]{.underline} While the
left is advocating unprecedented government intervention in almost every
sector of the U.S. economy, from health care to energy, today [Americans
are celebrating the successful privatization of space
travel.]{.underline} If you want to see the difference between what
government and private enterprise can do, consider: **[It [took a
private company to give us]{.mark} the first [space vehicle]{.mark} with
touch-screen controls instead of antiquated knobs and buttons. It took a
private company to give us [a capsule that can fly]{.mark} entirely
autonomously from launch to landing --- including docking --- without
any participation by its human crew. It also took a private company to
invent [a reusable rocket]{.mark} that can not only take off but land as
well.]{.underline}** When the Apollo 11 crew reached the moon on July
20, 1969, Neil Armstrong declared "the Eagle has landed." On Saturday,
SpaceX was able to declare that the Falcon had landed when its rocket
settled down on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean --- ready to be used
again. That last development will save the taxpayers incredible amounts
of money. [[The cost to NASA]{.mark} for launching a man into space on
the space shuttle orbiter was [\$170 million]{.mark} per seat, compared
with just \$[60 million]{.mark} to \$67 million [on the Dragon]{.mark}
capsule.]{.underline} The cost for the space shuttle to send a kilogram
of cargo into to space was \$54,500; with the Falcon rocket, the cost is
just \$2,720 --- a decrease of 95 percent. And while the space shuttle
cost \$27.4 billion to develop, the Crew Dragon was designed and built
for just \$1.7 billion --- making it the lowest-cost spacecraft
developed in six decades. [SpaceX did it in six years --- far faster
than the time it took to develop the space shuttle]{.underline}. [The
[private sector does it better, cheaper, faster and more
efficiently]{.mark} than government. [Why?
**Competition**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Today, SpaceX has to compete
with a constellation of private companies --- including legacy aerospace
firms such as Orbital ATK and United Launch Alliance and innovative
start-ups such as Blue Origin (which is designing a Mars lander and
whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Post) and Virgin Orbit (which is
developing rockets than can launch satellites into space from the
underside of a 747, avoiding the kinds of weather that delayed the
Dragon launch). [In the race to put the first privately launched man
into orbit, upstart SpaceX had to beat aerospace behemoth Boeing and its
Starliner capsule to the punch]{.underline}. It did so --- for more than
\$1 billion less than its competitor. **[That [spirit of
competition]{.mark} and innovation will [revolutionize space
travel]{.mark} in the years ahead]{.underline}**. Indeed, Musk has his
sights set far beyond Earth orbit. [Already, [SpaceX is working
on]{.mark} a much larger version of the Falcon 9 reusable rocket called
Super Heavy that will carry a deep-space capsule named Starship capable
of carrying up to 100 people to the moon and eventually to
Mars.]{.underline} Musk's goal --- the reason he founded SpaceX --- is
to [**colonize Mars and [make humanity a multiplanetary
species]{.mark}**. He has set a goal of founding a million-person city
on Mars [by 2050]{.mark} complete with iron foundries and pizza
joints]{.underline}. Can it be done? Who knows. But this much is
certain: **[[Private-sector innovation]{.mark} is [opening the
door]{.mark} to a new era of space exploration.]{.underline}** [Wouldn't
it be ironic if, just as capitalism is allowing us to explore the
farthest reaches of our solar system, Americans decided to embrace
socialism back here on Earth?]{.underline}

As of now, [[N.A.S.A. does not plan]{.mark} on]{.underline} sending
[a]{.underline} ~~manned~~ [[mission to Mars]{.mark} until the
2030s]{.underline} --- assuming, of course, they get the government
funding they need to undertake such a massive project.
[Considering]{.underline} the [recent cuts to]{.underline} deep [space
exploration]{.underline}, down nearly \$300 million from 2016, [I am not
certain what the condition of the program will look like in another two
years]{.underline}...much less the gap between now and the 2030s.

[Where, then ]{.underline}--- [if the government]{.underline} and its
agencies [will not provide us with the money for
exploration ]{.underline}--- [will we turn]{.underline} to slake our
thirst for cosmic space travel[?]{.underline}

SpaceX. Private corporations. [[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Seeing this article in the news, [reading]{.underline} day after day
[[the story of budget cuts]{.mark} to N.A.S.A.]{.underline} in regards
to deep-space exploration and other related programs, [got me thinking
about]{.underline} just [how important it will be for private
companie]{.underline}s and corporations [to undertake these
projects]{.underline}...[such as]{.underline} Elon Musk's
[[SpaceX,]{.mark} and [countless others]{.mark}]{.underline} (read the
full list here).

The problem is that [we have gotten it into our heads that Capitalism is
the root cause of our economic woes]{.underline} in the United States,
perhaps [failing to understand that]{.underline} such policies are
something like a double-edged sword: [they [could]{.mark} also [be our
salvation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This article provides a great list of the pro's and con's of Capitalism.
I would recommend you take the short passing of time it requires to read
it through-and-through before continuing.

Now then.

I have never been for for fully-unhindered Capitalism. [I do not believe
that the government should stay out of economic affairs
entirely]{.underline}, for as provided in the article many of the con's
relate to improper regulation (monopolization) as opposed to something
fundamentally wrong, [but I do not believe that any government should be
going about shoving their claws into every economic affair either. There
must be a healthy balance]{.underline}, especially [if Capitalism is to
work as it is supposed to work]{.underline}. The same goes for any
policy. The government should be there to bolster competition between
businesses...not favor one or bail-out the other. The more regulation,
the more interference or amendment, the less it works...but this mix of
regulation and free market must fall in the "goldilocks zone" if the
citizens of said society are to reap its full benefit.

[If not, like planets about a star, the society shall either burn or
freeze]{.underline}.

[One of those benefits is highlighted by]{.underline} Elon Musk's
[[SpaceX]{.mark}: the intervention of [private]{.mark}ly-funded
[companies to do things]{.mark} that a traditional [government]{.mark}
agency [cannot.]{.mark} Namely, the exploration and]{.underline}
eventual [[colonization of Mars]{.mark} in a reasonable, step-by-step
timeframe]{.underline}...[[unlike the]{.mark} "we will get to it
eventually" mindset plaguing]{.underline} the bowels of [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[[government]{.underline}]{.mark}. Were not the policies in place to
foster the growth of private companies, our best chance at getting
people out of Earth-orbit --- the Bush-approved, now-cancelled,
insanely-expensive Constellation program --- would have gone the way of
promises and well-wishes.

It is my hope that Elon Musk and space entrepreneurs like him are not
simply blowing steam, and that one day --- perhaps even within my
lifetime --- I could be on my way to a space hotel on the Moon, flying
aboard a space airliner with the name of a private company plastered
across the side.

[Regardless, [if we humans are to]{.mark} truly [become a multi-planet
species]{.mark} [we must not hinder]{.mark} [economic growth]{.mark}
with narrow thoughts. We must not become confused that the "[problems
down here" and the "problem of getting out there" must be in
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}; they do not need to, and we must not
suppose they should. They are two separate issues with two unique sets
of problems, and thus [this policy of taking resources from one to give
to the other will only ensure that neither issue is given that which it
needs]{.underline}, or enough to fix what must be solved.

### Good -- Warming

#### Cap solves warming -- sustainable, private-industry tech key, alt fails and results in transition wars.

**Smith 19** (Noah Smith; PhD in economics from the University of
Michigan and Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He was an assistant professor
of finance at Stony Brook University; 4/5/19; \"Dumping Capitalism Won't
Save the Planet\";
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism;
Bloomberg)

It has become fashionable on social media and in certain publications to
argue that capitalism is killing the planet. Even renowned investor
Jeremy Grantham, hardly a radical, made that assertion last year. The
basic idea is that the profit motive drives the private sector to spew
carbon into the air with reckless abandon. Though many economists and
some climate activists believe that the problem is best addressed by
modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, many activists believe
that the problem can't be addressed without rebuilding the economy along
centrally planned lines. [The climate threat is certainly dire, and
**carbon taxes** are **unlikely** to be enough to **solve** the problem.
But **[eco-socialism]{.mark}** is probably [**not** going to be]{.mark}
**an [effective]{.mark} method** of addressing that threat.
**[Dismantling]{.mark}** an **entire economic system** [is **never
easy**]{.mark}, and probably [would **touch off armed conflict**]{.mark}
and **[major political upheaval]{.mark}**. In the scramble to win those
battles, even the **[socialists]{.mark}** would almost **certainly
[abandon]{.mark}** their **limitation** on fossil-fuel use --- either to
support military efforts, or to keep the population from turning against
them. The precedent here is the Soviet Union]{.underline}, whose
multidecade effort to reshape its economy by force amid confrontation
with the West led to profound environmental degradation. [The
**[world\'s climate does not have several decades]{.mark}** to spare.
**Even without international conflict**]{.underline}, there's [**[little
guarantee]{.mark}** that **[moving away]{.mark} from capitalism** would
**[mitigate]{.mark}** our **impact** on the environment. Since
**[socialist]{.mark}** leader Evo Morales took power in
**Bolivia**]{.underline}, living standards have improved substantially
for the average Bolivian, which is great. But this has come at the cost
of **[[higher emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Meanwhile, the
**[capitalist]{.mark} U.S** managed to **[decrease]{.mark}** its per
capita **[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} a bit [during this same
period]{.underline} (though since the U.S. is a rich country, its
absolute level of emissions is much higher). In other words, in terms of
economic growth and carbon emissions, Bolivia looks similar to more
capitalist developing countries. That suggests that faced with a choice
of enriching their people or helping to save the climate, even socialist
leaders will often choose the former. And that same political calculus
will probably hold in China and the U.S., the world's top carbon
emitters --- leaders who demand draconian cuts in living standards in
pursuit of environmental goals will have trouble staying in power. [The
**[best hope]{.mark}** for the climate therefore lies in [**reducing**
the **tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon
emissions**]{.mark}. That **[requires tech]{.mark}nology** ---
[**solar**, **wind** and **nuclear**]{.mark} **power**, [**energy
storage**, **electric cars**]{.mark} and other vehicles,
[carbon-free]{.mark} cement production and so on. The [best]{.mark}
climate policy [plans all involve tech]{.mark}nological improvement as a
key feature.]{.underline} Recent developments show that the
[**technology-centered approach [can work]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A
recent report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyzed about [**7000
projects** in **46 countries**, and found that **[large drops in the
cost]{.mark}** of solar power from photovoltaic systems, wind power and
lithium-ion batteries have made utility-scale renewable electricity
competitive with fossil fuels. A **76 percent decline** in the cost of
energy for short-term battery storage since 2012 is especially
important.]{.underline} In a blog post, futurist and energy writer Ramez
Naam underscores the significance of these developments. Naam notes the
important difference between renewables being cheap enough to outprice
new fossil-fuel plants, and being inexpensive enough to undercut
existing plants. The former is already the case across much of the
world, which is among the reasons for an 84 percent decrease in the
number of new coal-fired plants worldwide since 2015. But when it
becomes cheaper to scrap existing fossil-fuel plants and build
renewables in their place, it will allow [**[renewables]{.mark}** to
start [**replacing** **coal** and **gas**]{.mark} much more
quickly.]{.underline} Naam cites examples from Florida and Indiana where
this is already being done. He cites industry predictions that replacing
existing fossil-fuel plants with renewables will be economically
efficient almost everywhere at some point in the next decade.
Electricity is far from the only source of carbon emissions --- there's
also transportation, manufacturing (especially of steel and cement),
home and office heating, and agriculture to worry about. But [the [rapid
advance]{.mark} of **solar** **technology** is a huge victory in the
struggle against climate change, because it will allow people all over
the world to have electricity without cooking the planet. And
[how]{.mark} was this victory achieved? A [combination]{.mark} of
**smart [government policy]{.mark}** [and **private
industry**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Massachusetts Institute of Technology
researchers Goksin Kavlak, James McNerney and Jessika Trancik in a
recent paper evaluated the factors behind the solar-price decline from
1980 to 2012. [They concluded that from 1980 to 2001, government-funded
research and development was the main factor in bringing down costs, but
from 2001 to 2012, the **[biggest factor was economies of
scale]{.mark}**. These economies of scale were **[driven by private
industry increasing output]{.mark}**, but with government subsidies
helping to increase the incentive to ramp up production.]{.underline}
It's apparent, therefore, [that **[both government and profit-seeking
enterprises]{.mark}** have their **[roles to play.]{.mark}** Government
funds the development of early-stage technology and then helps push the
private sector toward adopting those technologies, while [**private
companies** compete to **find ever-cheaper methods**]{.mark} of
implementation. Instead of eco-socialism, it's **eco-industrialism**.
[If there's **any system that can beat climate change, this looks like
it.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: Inequality

#### Inequality is decreasing at [unprecedented rates]{.underline} by [every metric]{.underline}.

**McAfee, 19**---cofounder and codirector of the MIT Initiative on the
Digital Economy at the MIT Sloan School of Management, former professor
at Harvard Business School and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society (Andrew, "The Global Gallop of the Four Horsemen,"
*More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using
Fewer Resources---and What Happens Next*, Chapter 10, pg 235-240,
Kindle, dml)

In 2016 the economist and columnist Noah Smith reviewed [the evidence on
**poverty around the world**]{.underline}, and his conclusion was
notably exuberant: \"This [is]{.underline} incredible---[**nothing short
of a miracle**. Nothing like this has **ever happened before** in
recorded history]{.underline}.\" A graph created by Max Roser clearly
reveals the \"miracle\" Smith was talking about, and how right he was
that [the improvement is **without precedent**]{.underline}. The graph
doesn\'t show the percentage of people living in poverty, but instead
something even more important: the total number of extremely poor people
on earth.

The World\'s War on Poverty

[The **total number of poor people** in the world]{.underline} peaked
right at the time of the first Earth Day in 1970, then [started to
**slowly decrease**]{.underline}. But the real miracle came when
[this]{.underline} happy [decline **accelerated** during the twenty-
first century. In **1999**, **1.76 billion** people were living in
extreme poverty. Just **sixteen years later**, this number had
**declined by 60 percent**, to **705 million**]{.underline}. Hundreds of
millions fewer people are living in poverty now than in 1820, when the
world\'s total population was seven times smaller than it is today.

[Much of this decline is reflective of what occurred in **China**,
which]{.underline}, as we saw in the previous chapter, threw off
economic socialism beginning in 1978 and [**let capitalism work its
poverty-reducing miracles**. But the story of global poverty reduction
**isn\'t a purely Chinese one**]{.underline}. As the graph below shows,
[**every region around the world** has seen **large poverty reductions**
in recent years]{.underline}. The speed of the recent decline indicates
that [it\'s **no longer ridiculous** to talk about **completely
eliminating extreme poverty** from the planet]{.underline}. The World
Bank thinks [this might be possible by **2030**]{.underline}.

[It\'s **not just incomes** that have improved]{.underline}. As I
consult Our World in Data and other **[comprehensive sources of
evidence]{.underline}**, I [**struggle** to find **even a single
important measure** of human material well-being that\'s **not getting
better** in most regions around the world]{.underline}.

Here are recent trends in a few key areas.

Daily Bread

![Chart, diagram Description automatically generated with medium

height="2.9702974628171477in"}

[As recently as **1980**, the global average number of available daily
calories **wasn\'t enough**]{.underline} to permit an active adult male
to maintain his body weight. Less than thirty-five years later, however,
[**every region in the world** met this standard of twenty-five hundred
daily calories]{.underline}.

Clean Living

![Chart, line chart Description automatically

height="2.6437915573053368in"}

[More than **90 percent** of the world\'s people now have access to
**improved water**]{.underline};VII [in **1990** only a bit more than
**75 percent** did. The situation is similar for **sanitation**: in
**1990** only a **bit more than half** of the world\'s people had it;
now, **more than two-thirds** do]{.underline}.

Young Minds

![Chart, line chart Description automatically

height="2.4370319335083113in"}

[The trend in **secondary education enrollment** around the world
is]{.underline} similar to the one for sanitation, but [**even
sharper**: in 1986 **fewer than half** of the world\'s teenagers were in
school; at present, **more than 75 percent** are]{.underline}.

One Thing We Say to Death: Not Today

By now the pattern should be familiar: [**life expectancy** at birth has
**gone up around the world**]{.underline} in recent decades:

![Diagram Description automatically
generated](media/image13.png){width="3.349501312335958in"
height="2.2498906386701663in"}

As we saw in chapter 1, [global life expectancy was about **28.5 years
in 1800**. Over the next 150 years, that number **increased by 20
years**. Then]{.underline}, in the years between 1950 and 2015, it
increased [by **25 more**. These gains are **now
universal**]{.underline}; Southern Africa has regained the 10 years of
expected life lost during its terrifying AIDS crisis.

[One of the reasons life expectancy has **gone up so quickly** is the
**collapse** in both **child** and **maternal mortality** around the
world]{.underline}:

![Chart, line chart Description automatically
generated](media/image14.png){width="3.356687445319335in"
height="2.4763287401574803in"}

[I find these mortality declines **especially fast**, **large**, and
**broad**]{.underline}. Today, [we **still have desperately poor
regions**, **failed states**, and the **decimations of war**. But in
**no region today** is the child mortality rate **higher** than the
world\'s average rate was in **1998**]{.underline}.

Convergent

Trends in maternal and child mortality highlight a critical fact that\'s
often overlooked: [**around the world**, inequality in **most important
measures** of human material well-being is **decreasing**. Poor
countries are **catching up** to rich ones, and **gaps** that were once
large are **shrinking**. Inequalities in income and wealth dominate the
news, and in many places these gaps are large and growing]{.underline}.
They re also important, so well look at economic inequality in the next
two chapters.

[But]{.underline} it\'s true, too, that [there are **other kinds of
inequality** that we should care about as we examine the human
condition: inequalities in **health**, **education**, **diet**,
**sanitation**, and other things that **matter deeply** for the quality
of a person\'s life. Here the news is **profoundly good**; these
inequalities are **collapsing**]{.underline}. As the four horsemen have
galloped around the world in recent decades, they\'ve made life better
not only for those people and countries that were already rich but for
just about everyone else. [**Everywhere**, **fewer mothers** and
**babies are dying**, more kids are **getting an education**, more
people have **adequate nutrition** and **sanitation**.]{.underline}

[It\'s **essential to acknowledge these global victories** because they
show us that **what we\'re doing is working**]{.underline}. Tech
progress, **[capitalism]{.underline}**, public awareness, and responsive
government [are **spreading around the world** and **improving
it**]{.underline}. It\'s often said that insanity is doing the same
thing over and over but expecting different results. The corollary might
be that ignorance is not examining the results of what\'s being done.
Over and over, when we look at the evidence, we see that the four
horsemen are improving our world.

## Link Defense/Turns

### Permutation

#### The perms solve best -- restructuring capitalism is possible

**Mazzucato '21** \[Mariana; Jan 28; Professor in the Economics of
Innovation and Public Value at University College London where she is
the founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public
Purpose; "Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism," p.
204-10\]

This book has applied what I believe is the immensely powerful idea of a
mission to solving the 'wicked' problems we face today. In it, I have
argued that [tackling grand challenges will only happen if we reimagine
**government as a prerequisite for restructuring capitalism** in a way
that is inclusive, sustainable and **driven by
innovation**.]{.underline}

First and foremost, this means reinventing government for the
twenty-first century -- equipping it with the tools, organization and
culture it needs to drive a mission-oriented approach. It also means
bringing purpose to the core of corporate governance and taking a very
broad stakeholder position across the economy. It means changing the
relationship between public and private sectors, and between them and
civil society, so they all work symbiotically for a common goal. The
reason for the emphasis on rethinking government is simple: **[only
government has the capacity to bring about transform]{.underline}**ation
**[on the scale needed.]{.underline}** The relationship between economic
actors and civil society shows our problems at their most profound, and
this is what we must unravel.

[We can start by recognizing that capitalist markets are an outcome of
how each actor in the system is organized and governed, and how the
different actors relate to one another]{.underline}. This holds for the
private and public sectors and for other sectors such as non-profits.
**[No particular kind of market behaviour is inevitable]{.underline}**.
[For example, the market pressure often cited as forcing a business to
neglect the long term in favour of the short term, as too many companies
do today, is the product of a particular organization of the
market]{.underline}. **[Nor is there anything inevitable in government
bureaucracies]{.underline}** [being too slow to react to challenges such
as digital platforms and climate change.]{.underline} Rather, [both are
outcomes of agency, actions and **governance** structures that are
chosen inside organizations, as well as the legal and institutional
relationships between them. It is all down to design within and between
organizations.]{.underline}

Capitalism is, indeed, in crisis. But the good news is that we can do
better. We know from the past that public and private actors can come
together to do extraordinary things. I have reflected on how, fifty
years ago, going to the moon and back required public and private actors
to invest, to innovate and to collaborate night and day for a common
purpose. Imagine if that [collaborative purpose]{.underline} today was
to [build a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism: green production
and consumption]{.underline}, [less inequality]{.underline}, greater
personal fulfilment, **[resilient health care]{.underline}** and healthy
ageing, sustainable mobility and digital access for all. But small,
incremental changes will not get us to those outcomes. We must have the
courage and conviction to lift our gaze higher -- to lead transformative
change that is as imaginative as it is ambitious, aiming for something
far more ambitious than sending a man to the moon.

To do this successfully, [governments need to invest in their internal
capabilities -- building the competence and confidenc]{.underline}e to
think boldly, partner with business and civil society, catalyse new
forms of collaboration across sectors, and [deploy instruments that
reward actors willing to engage with the difficulties]{.underline}. The
task is neither to pick winners nor to give unconditional handouts,
subsidies and guarantees, but to pick the willing. And missions are
about making markets, not only fixing them. They're about imagining new
areas of exploration. They're about [**taking risks**, not only
'de-risking']{.underline}. And if this means making mistakes along the
way, so be it. Learning through trial and error is critical for any
value-creation exercise. [Ambitious missions also have the courage to
tilt the playing field.]{.underline}

If [government]{.underline} is indeed a value creator that is driven by
public purpose, its [policies should reflect and reinforce]{.underline}
that. Too many green policies today are just minor adjustments to a
trajectory that still favours the old waste-prone behaviours and the
financial casino that worsens inequality. [A healthy economy that works
for the whole of society must tilt the playing field consistently to
reward behaviours that help us achieve agreed and desirable
goals.]{.underline} That means achieving [coherence in a **multiplicity
of fields**]{.underline}, from **[taxes]{.underline}** to
**[regulation]{.underline}**, from **[business law]{.underline}** to the
**[social safety net]{.underline}**.

As emphasized throughout the book, [it is key to not pretend that social
missions are the same as technological ones]{.underline}. With
challenges that are more 'wicked' it is essential that moonshot thinking
is linked with support to underlying government systems. For example, a
[moonshot around]{.underline} disease testing or **[health
priorities]{.underline}** [must interact closely with the public-health
system, not **replace** or **circumvent** it]{.underline}. Similarly, a
moonshot around [clean growth]{.underline} must [interact with transport
systems and planning authorities and understand behavioural
change]{.underline}. Thus it is [critical to]{.underline} perceive
missions not as siloed projects but as being intersectoral, bottom-up,
and [building on existing]{.underline} systems (such as **[innovation
systems]{.underline}**, among others).

Governments cannot pursue missions alone. They must work alongside
purpose-driven businesses to achieve them. As I've argued in this book,
this requires addressing one of the biggest [dilemmas of modern
capitalism]{.underline}: **[restructuring business]{.underline}** [so
that private profits are reinvested back into the economy rather than
being used for short-term financialized purposes]{.underline}. Missions
can accelerate this shift by shaping expectations about where business
opportunities lie and also getting a better return for public
investment. In this sense they can begin to walk the talk of stakeholder
value. This means creating a more symbiotic form of partnership and
collaboration in different sectors, whether in health, energy or digital
platforms. A market-shaping perspective requires governing these
interactions so that intellectual property rights, data privacy, pricing
of essential medicines and taxation all reflect what needs to happen to
reach the common objective. [In health that must mean health innovation
driven by the mission of better health care for all; in energy it must
mean divestment from fossil fuels and the creation of public goods like
green infrastructure and green production systems]{.underline} that
protect the earthly oasis that Armstrong referred to; and in the digital
domain it must mean the use of [digitalization to improve the access of
all people to the power of the technologies of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- while ensuring both data privacy and that our
welfare states are strengthened, not weakened, by digital platforms.

**[Doing capitalism differently]{.underline}** [requires reimagining the
full potential of a public sector driven by public purpose --
democratically defining clear goals]{.underline} that society needs to
meet by investing and **[innovating together]{.underline}**. It requires
a fundamentally new relationship between all economic actors willing and
able [to tackle complexity to achieve outcomes that matter.]{.underline}

[Growing distrust of capitalism follows from]{.underline} its failure to
address major [socioeconomic challenges]{.underline}, not least [climate
change and inequalities]{.underline} in opportunity, income, and wealth.
While private [incentives under capitalism are good at stimulating
**efficiency, growth, and innovation**]{.underline}, [they]{.underline}
also [generate unequal income]{.underline} and wealth distributions
(even in a context of intense competition), often at odds with social
norms of fairness. Moreover, [capitalist systems tend to underinvest in
public goods]{.underline} like education, health care, and social
insurance -- all critical factors in the pandemic response -- while also
discounting negative externalities such as greenhouse-gas emissions.

[These shortcomings of capitalism]{.underline} are predictable, but they
[are **remediable through public policies and institutions**. Tax and
transfer policies and minimum wages]{.underline} can reduce income and
wealth disparities, just as [public investment in education, training,
and health care can enhance opportunity]{.underline} by providing access
to good jobs and fostering the creation of new enterprises. Likewise, [a
price on carbon dioxide and regulations limiting or banning carbon
emissions]{.underline} can help the world avert the existential threat
of climate change.

[Critics of capitalism]{.underline} often [miss]{.underline}
([or]{.underline} choose to [ignore]{.underline}) [that there is **no
single canonical model**]{.underline}. [Europe's]{.underline} various
["social market" models differ]{.underline} significantly [from the
neoliberal variant in the US.]{.underline} And even within the US, there
are important differences between states and localities.

Some of these distinctions have been highlighted in the responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic and recession. All advanced economies have deployed
unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus in the face of
"K-shaped" or "dual" recessions in which lower-wage workers have
suffered disproportionately more than other cohorts. Unlike the US,
[Germany and several other European countries have deployed measures
specifically designed to keep as many workers as possible in their
jobs]{.underline}. Because these countries have generous social
insurance and benefits, including sick leave and family leave, workers
and their families have been able to cope with both COVID-19 and sudden
drops in their incomes.

Differences in national health-care models have also become more
apparent. Unlike European capitalist systems that provide universal
coverage, 14.5% of America's non-elderly population (ages 18-64) remains
uninsured. Moreover, owing to America's heavy reliance on employer-based
insurance, the pandemic has pushed at least 15 million more workers at
least temporarily into the uninsured pool.

With their strong public-health systems, many European countries were
also better equipped to carry out widespread testing and vaccine
distribution. The US, meanwhile, has utterly failed to contain the
virus, and is now delegating the vaccination campaign to under-resourced
state and local authorities.

In another contrast with the US, Europe has dedicated about one-third of
its massive stimulus program to investments aligned with its commitment
to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. America's federal stimulus
measures have been silent on climate with few conditions of any kind.

Within the US, individual states' responses to the COVID-19 crisis
reflect different variants of capitalism. In California, Governor Gavin
Newsom's recent 2021-22 budget proposal reveals some distinctive
features. In terms of health-care coverage, California remains a
national leader with a Medicaid program covering more than 13 million
people. Despite the pandemic-induced recession, the state is increasing
its minimum wage to \$14 per hour in 2021, on track to realize the
target of \$15 per hour in 2022 for all businesses employing 26 or more
workers; many municipalities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco,
have already achieved or exceeded the \$15 target. (On January 1, 2021,
20 other states also raised their minimum wages, whereas the US federal
minimum wage has remained unchanged at \$7.25 per hour since 2009.)

California has also expanded coverage of its Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) and Young Child Tax Credit to include undocumented workers who
are otherwise denied the benefits of federal stimulus packages.
Together, these tax credits applied to 3.6 million California households
in 2020, adding \$1 billion in total income. The state also passed new
legislation significantly expanding unpaid family-leave rights.
Employers with as few as five employees now must provide this option as
well as more time for paid sick leave for workers forced to self-isolate
or quarantine as a result of COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis.

Looking ahead, Newsom has proposed an additional \$600 one-time cash
payment to all taxpayers who are eligible for the state's EITC in 2021.
His proposed 2021-22 budget also earmarks \$372 million to expedite the
distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and includes \$4.5 billion for
programs to drive economic growth and job creation once restrictions on
normal activities have been lifted. These programs include \$575 million
in grants to small businesses and nonprofits, in addition to the \$500
million for such grants implemented in late 2020 amid forced business
closures. The proposal also allocates up to an additional \$50 million
for the California Rebuilding Fund, a public-private partnership, to
support up to an additional \$125 million of low-interest loans to
underserved small businesses throughout the state.

California's distinctive approach to market capitalism also emphasizes
climate sustainability, using both carbon pricing and efficiency
standards to achieve ambitious decarbonization targets. Under a 2018
state law, 60% of electricity must come from renewable resources by
2030, and 100% by 2045. California runs the world's fourth-largest
cap-and-trade system and will be setting even lower caps (and thus a
higher carbon price) next month. In September 2020, Newsom announced an
executive order requiring that zero-emission vehicles account for 100%
of new car sales by 2035. His proposed budget seeks \$1.5 billion to
accelerate the infrastructure investment needed to achieve this goal.

President-elect Joe [Biden has just announced a \$1.9 trillion emergency
rescue plan to counter the pandemic's surge and provide substantial
relief to workers, families, small businesses, and state and local
governments]{.underline}. Prompt congressional passage of this plan is a
critical first step in the renovation of America's outdated neoliberal
version of capitalism. As the economy recovers from the deep and uneven
COVID-19 recession, [the US must "build back better"]{.underline} by
strengthening its social safety net, increasing public investment in
education, health care, and other public goods, and rejoining the global
charge against climate change. **[Lessons from the more successful
variants of market capitalism in Europe and California point the way
forward.]{.underline}**

### AT: Cyber

#### Cyber threat is [legitimate]{.underline}\-\--means and motive exist. 

**Wintch '21** \[Timothy; April 30; active-duty major in the United
States Air Force, M.A. in Military Studies from the American Military
University; Homeland Security Today, "Perspective: Cyber and Physical
Threats to the U.S. Power Grid and Keeping the Lights on,"
<https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/>\]

[Among **critical infrastructure**]{.underline} sectors [in the U.S.,
**energy** is]{.underline} perhaps the most [crucial]{.underline} of the
16 sectors defined by the Department of Homeland Security. [This
sector]{.underline} is so vital because it [provides the energy
**necessary** to run **every other** critical infrastructure
sector]{.underline}. However, [the U.S. **power grid**, the **backbone**
of the]{.underline} energy [sector, is built upon an **aging skeleton**
that is becoming **increasingly vulnerable** every day. Whether from
**terrorists** or]{.underline} nation-states like [**Russia** and
**China**, the]{.underline} power grid [is susceptible]{.underline} to
not just physical attacks, but also [to cyber intrusion]{.underline} as
well. However, much of this threat can be mitigated if the U.S. takes
the appropriate steps to safeguard the power grid and avoid a potential
catastrophe in the future.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism on U.S. soil has been at the forefront
of American consciousness. [**C**ritical **i**nfrastructure provides an
**appealing target** because of the **disproportionally** large impact
even a **small attack** can have on]{.underline} the
[sectors]{.underline}. In particular, [the power grid represents
a]{.underline} particularly [lucrative target]{.underline}, both [in
terms of]{.underline} the [**ease of access** and the **large
impact**]{.underline} it can make. The National Research Council stated
that [the]{.underline} U.S. power [grid is "**vulnerable** to
intelligent **multi-site attacks** by]{.underline} knowledgeable
[attackers intent on causing **maximum**]{.underline} physical
[damage]{.underline} to key components [on a **wide geographical
scale**."]{.underline}[\[1\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn1)
Additionally, the physical security of transmission and distribution
systems is difficult due to the dispersed nature of these key
components, which in turn is advantageous to attackers as it reduces the
likelihood of their
capture.[\[2\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn2)
From 2002-2012, approximately 2,500 physical attacks occurred against
transmission lines and towers worldwide and approximately 500 attacks
against transformer
substations.[\[3\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn3)
[Terrorists have the **motivation** to attack the]{.underline} U.S.
power [grid]{.underline} but [the **very nature** of the **grid** makes
it **highly vulnerable**. The power grid is]{.underline} not only [at
risk from]{.underline} physical attacks, but also [nation-state
**cyberattacks**]{.underline}.

[One nation that has]{.underline} shown [both the **capability** and
**intent**]{.underline} to use attacks against critical energy
infrastructure [is **Russia**]{.underline}, as demonstrated in their
2015 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. A Russian cyber threat group
known as Sandworm, which used its BlackEnergy malware, attacked
Ukrainian computer systems that provide remote control of the Ukraine
power
grid.[\[4\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn4)
This attack, and another in 2016, each left the capital Kiev without
power, prompting cyber experts to raise concern about the same malware
already existing in NATO and the U.S. power
grids.[\[5\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn5)
In any conflict between Russia and NATO, not only would similar
cyberattacks pose a threat, but so would potential physical attacks
severing fuel oil and natural gas lines to Western Europe. [Russia
has]{.underline} both [the capability and intent to **attack** critical
infrastructure, particularly **power grids**, during **future
conflicts** in their "**hybrid warfare**"]{.underline} approach.

[Another nation]{.underline} that has the capability to attack critical
energy infrastructure [is **China**]{.underline}, representing a threat
to not just the U.S. energy infrastructure but also that of our allies
whose support would be vital in a major conflict. A recent NATO report
highlighted this threat from China's Belt and Road Initiative, stating
that ["\[China's\]]{.underline} foreign direct [investment in strategic
sectors]{.underline} \[such as energy generation and distribution\]
[...raises **questions** about whether]{.underline} access and control
over such [infrastructure can be maintained]{.underline}, particularly
[in **crisis**]{.underline} when it would be required to support the
military."[\[6\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn6)
Like Russia, [China has been **active** with **cyber intrusions**
in]{.underline} U.S. [energy infrastructure]{.underline}. The Mission
Support Center at Idaho National Laboratory characterized these as
attacks as "multiple intrusions into US ICS/SCADA \[Industrial Control
Systems/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\] and smart grid tools
\[that\] may be aimed more at intellectual property theft and gathering
intelligence to bolster their own infrastructure, but it is likely that
they are also using these intrusions to develop capabilities to attack
the \[bulk electric system\], as
well."[\[7\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn7)
China, therefore, has both the capability and intent to conduct cyber
intrusions and attacks for myriad reasons.

Another arm of this threat is the reliance the U.S. energy industry has
on imports from China, especially transformers. In early 2020, federal
officials seized a transformer in the port of Houston that had been
imported by the Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Company before sending it to
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque. Sandia is contracted by the
U.S. Department of Energy for mitigating national security
threats.[\[8\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn8)
The Wall Street Journal reported that "Mike Howard, chief executive of
the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility-funded technical
organization, said that the diversion of a huge, expensive transformer
is so unusual -- in his experience, unprecedented -- that it
suggests officials had significant security
concerns."[\[9\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn9)
Previously destined for the Washington Area Power Administration's Ault,
Colo., substation, the transformer is believed to have been seized due
to "backdoor" exploitable hardware emplaced by the Chinese prior to
shipment.[\[10\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn10)
Shortly after these events, President Trump issued Executive Order
13920, "[Securing the United States Bulk-Power
System](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-securing-united-states-bulk-power-system/),"
essentially limiting the import of Chinese-built critical energy
infrastructure components due to concerns about
cybersecurity.[\[11\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn11)
Interestingly, Jiangsu Huapeng "boasted that it supported 10 percent of
New York City's electricity
load."[\[12\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn12)

Franklin Kramer, the former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs, testified before a U.S. House of
Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee during an energy and
power hearing in 2011 and said that a ["**highly-coordinated** and
**structured** cyber,]{.underline} physical, or blended [attack on the
bulk power system]{.underline}, however, [could result in
**long-term**]{.underline} (**[irreparable]{.underline}**) [damage to
key system components in]{.underline} multiple simultaneous or
[**near-simultaneous** strikes."]{.underline} He added that ["an
**outage** could]{.underline} result with the potential to [affect a
**wide geographic area** and cause large]{.underline} population
[centers to lose power]{.underline} for extended
periods."[\[13\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn13)
Even the inclusion of features such as smart grids to [the **overall**
grid structure poses **new vulnerabilities** through]{.underline} their
[connectivity]{.underline}. Kramer stated that "such [connectivity
means]{.underline} that the [distribution system could be a **key
vector** for a]{.underline} national [security **attack** on the
grid."]{.underline}[\[14\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn14)

### AT: Biotechnology

#### Biomedical innovation solves all [sustainability warrants]{.underline}\-\--that's a defense of our methodology and a disad to theirs.

New [biological capabilities have the potential to bring sweeping change
to economies and societies]{.underline}. [The effects will be felt
across value chains, from how R&D is conducted to the physical inputs in
manufacturing to the way medicines and consumer products are delivered
and consumed]{.underline}. These capabilities include the following: ---
**[[Biological means could be used to produce]{.mark} a large share of
[the]{.mark} global [economy's physical materials]{.mark}, potentially
[with improved]{.mark} performance and
[sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Significant [[potential
exists]{.mark} to improve the characteristics of materials,
[reduce]{.mark} the [emissions]{.mark} profile of manufacturing and
processing, and shorten value chains.]{.underline} Fermentation, for
centuries used to make bread and brew beer, is now being used to create
fabrics such as artificial spider silk. [[Biology is increasingly being
used to create novel materials]{.mark} that can raise quality, introduce
entirely new capabilities, be biodegradable, and be produced [in a way
that generates]{.mark} significantly [less carbon
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mushroom roots rather than animal hide
can be used to make leather.11 Plastics can be made with yeast instead
of petrochemicals. --- [Increased control and precision in methodology
is occurring across the value chain, from delivery to development and
consumption with more personalization.]{.underline} [[Advances in
biological sciences have made R&D]{.mark} and delivery processes [more
precise]{.mark} and predictable; the character of R&D is shifting from
discovery by accident to rational design]{.underline}. Increasing
knowledge of human genomes and the links between certain genes and
diseases is enabling the spread of personalized or precision medicine,
which can be more effective than the one-size-fits-all therapies of the
past.12 [Precision also [applies to ag]{.mark}riculture, [where]{.mark}
insights from a plant or soil's [microbiome increasingly can be used to
optimize yield]{.mark} as well as to offer consumers with, for instance,
personalized nutrition plans based on genetic tests]{.underline}.13 ---
The capability to engineer and reprogram human and nonhuman organisms is
increasing. **[[Gene therapies]{.mark} could [offer]{.mark} complete
[cures of]{.mark} some [diseases]{.mark} for the first
time]{.underline}**. The same [technical advances that are driving
capabilities that improve human health can be used to introduce valuable
new traits that, for instance, improve the output or yield of nonhuman
organisms like microbes, plants, and animals. [Crops can be]{.mark}
genetically [engineered]{.mark} to produce higher yields and be more
heat- or drought-resistant, for instance]{.underline}. By permanently
genetically altering the vectors spreading disease (such as mosquitoes),
[gene drives could be used to prevent vector-borne diseases, including
malaria, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, and Lyme disease]{.underline},
although they also come with ecological risks.14 --- New
**[[methodologies using]{.mark} automation, machine learning, and
proliferating [biological data are enhancing discovery]{.mark},
throughput, and productivity in R&D]{.underline}**. Biology and
computing together are accelerating R&D, thereby addressing a
productivity challenge. McKinsey analysis in 2017 found that the ratio
of revenue to R&D spending in the biopharmaceutical industry hit a low
point in productivity between 2008 and 2011.15 [An explosion of
biological data due to cheaper sequencing can be used by biotech
companies and research institutes that increasingly are using robotic
automation and sensors in labs that could increase throughput up to ten
times]{.underline}.16 Further, advanced analytics, more powerful
computational techniques, and AI can be leveraged to provide better
insights during the R&D process. --- Potential is growing for interfaces
between biological systems and computers. A new generation of biomachine
interfaces relies on close interaction between humans and computers.
Such interfaces include neuroprosthetics that restore lost sensory
functions (bionic vision) or enable signals from the brain to control
physical movement of prosthetic or paralyzed limbs. Biocomputers that
employ biology to mimic silicon, including the use of DNA to store data,
are being researched. DNA is about one million times denser than
hard-disk storage; technically, one kilogram of DNA could store the
entirety of the world's data (as of 2016).17 While these are early days,
**[the [scope and scale]{.mark} of these emerging capabilities [could
have a broad impact on economies]{.mark} and societies, touching
multiple domains both directly and indirectly]{.underline}**. [These
[applications]{.mark} may [change everything from the food]{.mark} we
consume to textiles [to]{.mark} the types of [health]{.mark} treatments
we receive and how we build our physical world.]{.underline} The
potential value is vast. As noted, as much as **[[60 percent of the
physical inputs to the global economy could be produced
biologically]{.mark}, and even [modest progress]{.mark} toward that 60
percent number [could be transformative]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Beyond
the physical world, [[innovations could]{.mark} transform prevention,
diagnostics, and [treatment]{.mark} of [disease.]{.mark} At least 45
percent of the global disease burden could be addressed with
capabilities that are scientifically conceivable today]{.underline},
according to our analysis. [Bio innovations, such as high-throughput
screening, CRISPR, and machine learning for analyzing large and complex
biological data, have also begun to shape R&D]{.underline}. We estimate
that roughly 30 percent of private-sector R&D in major economies is in
industries where biological data, biological inputs, or biological means
of production could be used.18

### AT: Artificial Intelligence

#### AI regulation is [good]{.underline}! Positive benefits solve extinction. 

**Tzimas '21** \[Themistoklis; 2021; Faculty of Law at the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki; Legal and Ethical Challenges of Artificial
Intelligence from an International Law Perspective, "Chapter 2: The
Expectations and Risks from AI," p. 9-32\]

Therefore, [it is]{.underline} only [natural to be]{.underline} at least
[skeptical towards a future with entities possessing equal or superior
intelligence and levels of autonomy; the prospect even of **existential
risk** looms as **possible**]{.underline}.7

AI that will have reached or surpassed our level of intelligence make us
wonder why would highly autonomous and intelligent AI want to give up
control back to its original creators?8 Why remain contained in
pre-deﬁned goals set for it by us, humans?

[Even AI in its **current** form]{.underline} and narrow intelligence
[poses risks because of its **embedded-ness** in an ever-**growing
number** of **crucial aspects of our lives**. The role of AI in
**military**, **ﬁnancial**]{.underline},9 [**health**, **educational**,
**environmental**, **governance networks**-among **others**---are areas
where **risk** generated by AI---even **limited**]{.underline}---
autonomy [can be **diffused** through]{.underline} [**non-linear
networks**, with **signiﬁcant** impact--- even
**systemic**]{.underline}.10

The answer therefore to the question whether AI brings risk with it is
yes; as Eliezer Yudkowski comments the greatest of them all is that
people conclude too early that they understand it11 or that they assume
that they can achieve it without necessarily having acquired complete
and thorough understanding of what intelli- gence means.12

Our projection of our---lack of complete---understanding of the concept
of intelligence on AI is owed to our lack of complete comprehension of
human intelligence too, which is partially covered by the prevalent and
until now self- obvious, anthropomorphism because of which we tend to
identify higher intelligence with the human mind.

Yudkowski again however suggests that AI "refers to a vastly greater
space of possibilities than does the term "Homo sapiens." When we talk
about "AIs" we are really talking about minds-in-general, or
optimization processes in general. Imagine a map of mind design space.
In one corner, a tiny little circle contains all humans; within a larger
tiny circle containing all biological life; and all the rest of the huge
map is the space of minds-in-general. The entire map ﬂoats in a still
vaster space, the space of optimization processes."13

Regardless of what our well-established ideas are, there are many,
different intelligences and even more signiﬁcantly, there are
potentially, different intelli- gences equally or even more evolved than
human.

From such a perspective, the unprecedented---ness of potential AI
developments and the mystery surrounding them emerges as not only the
outcome of pop culture but of a radical transformation of our---until
recently---self---obvious identiﬁcation of humanity with highly evolved
and dominant intelligence.14

[The **lack of understanding** of intelligence and therefore of AI may
be **frightening** but **does not lead necessarily to regulation**---at
least to a **proper** one. We could **even** be led into **mak**ing
potentially **catastrophic choices**, on the basis of **false
assumptions**.]{.underline}

[On top of our lack of understanding, we should add a sentiment of
**anxiety**]{.underline} as well as of expectations, [which intensiﬁes
as an atmosphere of emergency]{.underline} and of expected
groundbreaking developments [grows]{.underline}. The most graphic
description of this feeling is the potential of a moment of singularity,
as mentioned above according to the description by Vinge and Kurzweil.

As the mathematician I. J. Good--Alan Turing's colleague in the team of
the latter during World War II---has put it: "Let an ultraintelligent
machine be deﬁned as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual
activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is
one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could
design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an
"intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far
behind. Thus the ﬁrst ultraintelligent machine is the last invention
that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to
tell us how to keep it under control."15 This is in a nutshell the
moment of singularity.

The estimates currently foresee the emergence of ultra or super
intelligence---as it is currently labelled---or in other words of
singularity, somewhere between 20 and 50 years from today, further
raising the sentiment of emergency.16 We cannot even foretell with
precision how singularity would look like but we know that because of
its expected groundbreaking impact, both states and private entities
compete towards gaining the upper hand in the prospect of the
singularity.17

Despite the fact that such predictions have been proven rather
optimistic in the past18 and therefore up to some extent inaccurate,
there are reasons to assume that their materialization will take place
and that the urgency of regulation will be proven realistic.

After all, part of the disappointments from AI should be blamed on the
fact that certain activities and standards, which were considered as
epitomes of human intelligence have been surpassed by AI, only to
indicate that they were not eventu- ally satisfactory thresholds for the
surpassing of human intelligence.19 Partially because of AI progress we
realize that human intelligence and its thresholds are much more
complicated than assumed in the past.

The vastness's of deﬁnitions of intelligence, as well as its
etymological roots are enlightening of the difﬁculties: "to gather, to
collect, to assemble or to choose, and to form an impression, thus
leading one to ﬁnally understand, perceive, or know".20

As with other relevant concepts, the truth is that until recently our
main way to approach intelligence for far too long was "we know it, when
we see it". AI is an additional reason for looking deeper into
intelligence and the more we examine it, the most complicated it seems.

The combination of lack of complete understanding of intelligence, the
unpredictability of AI, its rapid evolution and the prospect of
singularity explain both the fascination and the fear from AI. Once the
latter emerges, we have no real knowledge about what will happen next
but only speculations, which until recently belonged to the area of
science ﬁction.

We are for example pretty conﬁdent that the speed of AI intelligence
growth will accelerate, once self---improvement will have been achieved.
The expected or possible chain of events will begin from AI capacity to
re-write its own algorithms and exponentially self---improve, surpassing
human intelligence, which lacks the capacity of such rapid
self---improvement and setting its own goals.21

We can somehow guess the speed of AGI and ASI evolution and possibly
some of its initial steps but we cannot guess the directions that such
AI will choose to follow and the characteristics that it will
demonstrate. Practically, we credibly guess the prospects of AI beyond a
certain level of development.

Two [**existential issues** could emerge: ﬁrst, an imbalance of
intelligence at **our expense**]{.underline}---with us, humans becoming
the inferior species---[in favor of non-biological entities and secondly
a lack of even fundamental conceptual communication between the two most
intelligent "species". Both of them heighten the fear of **irreversible
changes**]{.underline}, once we lose the possession of the superior
intelligence.22

[However, we need to consider the **expectations as well**. The
**positive side**]{.underline} [focuses on the so-called **friendly**
AI, meaning AI which will **beneﬁt** and **not harm** humans, thanks to
its advanced intelligence]{.underline}.23

[AI bears the promise of signiﬁcantly enhancing human life on various
aspects, beginning from the already existing, narrow
applications]{.underline}. The [**enhance**d
**automation**]{.underline}24 in the industry [and the shift
to]{.underline} **[autonomy]{.underline}**,25 [the take---over by AI of
tasks]{.underline} even at [the]{.underline} **[service
sector]{.underline}** which can be considered as "tedious"---i.e. in the
banking sector---[**climate** and **weather forecasting**]{.underline},
[**disaster** response]{.underline},26 [the potentially better
**coop**eration among different actors in complicated matters such as in
matters of **information**, **geopolitics** and **i**nternational
**r**elations]{.underline}, [**logistics**, **resources**]{.underline}
ex.27

[The realization of the positive expectations depends up to some extent
upon the **complementarity** or not, of AI with **human**
intelligence]{.underline}. However, what friendly AI will bring in our
societies constitutes a matter of debate, given our lack of unanimous
approach on what should be considered as beneﬁcial and therefore
friendly to humans---as is analyzed in the next chapter.

[Friendly AI for example bears the prospect of freeing us from hard
labor or even further from **unwanted** labor; of generating further
economic **growth**; of dealing in unbiased, speedy, effective and
cheaper ways with sectors such as **policing**]{.underline},
[**justice**, **health**, **environment**al **crisis**, natural
**disasters**, **education**, **governance**, **defense**]{.underline}
[and several more of them which necessitate decision-making, with the
involvement of sophisticated intelligence]{.underline}.

[The synergies between human intelligence and AI "promise" the
**enhancement of humans in most of their aspects**]{.underline}. Such
synergies may remain external---humans using AI as external to
themselves, in terms of analysis, forecasts, decision---making and in
general as a type of assistant-28 or may evolve into the merging of the
two forms of intelligence either temporarily or permanently.

The second profoundly enters humanity, existentially---speaking, into
uncharted waters. Elon Musk argues in favor of "having some sort of
merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence" and his
company "Neuralink" aims at implanting chips in human brain. Musk argues
that through this way humans will keep artiﬁcial intelligence under
control.29 The proposition is that of "mind design", with humans playing
the role that God had according to theologies.30

While the temptation is strong---exceeding human mind's capacities, far
beyond what nature "created", by acquiring the capacity for example to
connect directly to the cyberspace or to break the barriers of
biology31---the risks are signiﬁcant too: what if a microchip
malfunction? Will such a brain be usurped or become captive to
malfunctioning AI?

The merging of the two intelligences is most likely to evolve initially
by invoking medical reasons, instead of human enhancement. But the
merging of the two will most likely continue, as after all the limits
between healing and enhancement are most often blurry. This development
will give rise, as is analyzed below, to signif- icant questions and
issues, the most of crucial of which is the setting of a threshold for
the prevalence of the human aspect of intelligence over the artiﬁcial
one.

Human nature is historically improved, enhanced, healed and now,
potentially even re-designed in the future.32 Can a "medical science"
endorsing such a goal be ethically acceptable and if yes, under what
conditions, when, for whom and by what means? The answers are more
difﬁcult than it seems. As the World Health Organi-
zation---WHO---provides in its constitution, "Health is a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or inﬁrmity".33

Therefore, why discourage science which aims at human-enhancement, even
reaching the levels of post-humanism?34 Or if restrictions are to be
imposed on human enhancement, on what ethics and laws will they be
justiﬁed? How ethically acceptable is it to prohibit or delay
technological evolution, which among several other magniﬁcent
achievements, promises to treat death as a disease and cure it, by
reducing soul to self, self to mind, and mind to brain, which will then
be preserved as a "softwarized" program in a hardware other than the
human body?35

After all, "According to the strong artiﬁcial intelligence program there
is no fundamental difference between computers and brains: a computer is
different machinery than a person in terms of speed and memory
capacity."36

While such a scientiﬁc development and the ones leading potentially to
it will be undoubtedly, groundbreaking technologically-speaking, is it
actually---ethically- speaking---as ambivalent as it may sound or is it
already justiﬁed by our well--- rooted human-centrism?37

Secular humanism may have very well outdated religious beliefs about
afterlife in the area of science but has not diminished the hope for
immortality; on the contrary, science, implicitly or explicitly predicts
that matter can in various ways surpass death, albeit by means which
belong in the realm of scientiﬁc proof, instead of that of metaphysical
belief.38

If this is the philosophical case, the quest for immortality becomes
ethically acceptable; it can be considered as embedded both in the
existential anxiety of humans, as well as in the human-centrism of
secular philosophical and political victory over the dei-centric
approach to the world and to our existence.

From another perspective of course and for the not that distant
philosophical reasons, the quest for immortality becomes ethically
ambiguous or even unacceptable.39 By seeking endless life we may miss
all these that make life worth living in the framework of ﬁniteness. As
the gerontologist Paul Hayﬂick cautioned "Given the possibility that you
could replace all your parts, including your brain, then you lose your
self-identity, your self-recognition. You lose who you are! You are who
you are because of your memory."40

In other words, once we begin to integrate the two types of
intelligence, within ourselves, until when and how we will be sure that
it is human intelligence that guides us, instead of the AI? And if we
are not guided completely or---even further---at all by human
intelligence but on the contrary we are guided by AI which we have
embodied and which is trained by our human intelligence, will we be
remaining humans or we will have evolved to some type of meta-human or
transhumant species, being different persons as well?41

AI promises tor threatens to offer a solution by breaking down our
consciousness into small "particles" of information---simplistically
speaking---which can then be "software-ized" and therefore "uploaded"
into different forms of physical or non-physical existence.

Diane Ackerman states that "The brain is silent, the brain is dark, the
brain tastes nothing, the brain hears nothing. All it receives are
electrical impulses\--not the sumptuous chocolate melting sweetly, not
the oboe solo like the ﬂight of a bird, not the pastel pink and lavender
sunset over the coral reef\--only impulses."42 Therefore, all that is
needed---although it is of course much more complicated than we can
imagine---is a way to code and reproduce such impulses.

Even if we consider that without death, we will no more be humans but
something else, why should we remain humans once technologies allow us
be something "more", in the sense of an enhanced version of "being"? Why
are we to remain bound by biological evolution if we can re-design it
and our future form of existence?

Why not try to achieve the major breakthrough, the anticipated or hoped
digita- lization of the human mind, which promises immortality of
consciousness via the cyberspace or artiﬁcial bodies: the uploading of
our consciousness so that it can live on forever, turning death into an
optional condition.43

Either through an artiﬁcial body or emulation-a living, conscious
avatar---we hope---or fear---that the domain of immortality will be
within reach. It is the prospect of a "substrate-independent minds," in
which human and machine consciousness will merge, transcending
biological limits of time, space and mem- ory" that fascinates us.44

As Anders Sandberg explained "The point of brain emulation is to
recreate the function of the original brain: if 'run' it will be able to
think and act as the original," he says. Progress has been slow but
steady. "We are now able to take small brain tissue samples and map them
in 3D. These are at exquisite resolution, but the blocks are just a few
microns across. We can run simulations of the size of a mouse brain on
supercomputers---but we do not have the total connectivity yet. As
methods improve, I expect to see automatic conversion of scanned tissue
into models that can be run. The different parts exist, but so far there
is no pipeline from brains to emulations."45

The emulation is different from a simulation in the sense that the
former mimics not only the outward outcome but also the "internal causal
dynamics", so that the emulated system and in this particular case the
human mind behaves as the original.46 Obviously, this is a challenging
task: we need to understand the human brain with the help of
computational neuroscience and combine simpliﬁed parts such as simulated
neurons with network structures so that the patterns of the brain are
comprehended. We must combine effectively "biological realism
(attempting to be faithful to biology), completeness (using all
available empirical data about the system), tractability (the
possibility of quantitative or qualitative simulation) and understanding
(producing a compressed representation of the salient aspects of the
system in the mind of the experimenter)".47

The technological challenges are vast. Technologically speaking, the
whole concept is based on some assumptions which must be proven both
accurate and feasible.48 We must achieve technology capable of scanning
completely the human brain, of creating software on the basis of the
acquired information from its scanning and of the interpretation of
information and the hardware which will be capable of uploading or
downloading such software.49 The steps within these procedures are
equally challenging. Their detailed analysis evades the scope of this
book.

Some critical questions---they are further analyzed in the next
chapters---emerge however: how will we interpret free will in emulation?
What will be the impact of the environment and of what environment? How
will be missing parts of the human brain re-constructed and emulated?
What will be the status of the several emulations which will be
created---i.e. failed attempts or emulations of parts of the human
brain---in the course of the search for a complete and functioning
emulation? Will they be considered as "persons" and therefore as having
some right or will they be considered as mere objects in an experimental
lab? How are we going to decode the actual subjective sentiments of
these emulations? Essentially, are emulations the humans "themselves"
who are emulated or a different person? Even further what will human and
person mean in the era of emulation?

From a different perspective, the victory over death may be seen as a
danger of mass extinction, absorption or de-humanization. In this new,
vast universe of emulations will there be place for humans?50

From the above---mentioned discussion, it becomes obvious that at a
large extent, the prospect of risk or of expectation is a matter of
perspective, for which there is no unanimous agreement in the present.
This may be the greatest danger of all, for which Asimov warned us:
unleashing technology while we cannot communicate among us, in the face
of it.

The existential prospect as well as the risks by AI may self-evidently
emerge from technological advances but are determined on the basis of
politico---philosophical or in the wider sense, ethical assumptions.
This is where the need for legal regulation steps in. Such a need was
often underestimated in the past in favor of a solely technologically
oriented approach---although exceptions raising issues other than
technological can be found too.51 The gradual raising of
ethic---political, philosoph- ical and legal issues constitutes a rather
recent development, partially because of the realization of the
proximity of the risks and of the expectations.

The public debate is often divided between two "contradictory" views:
fear of AI or enthusiastic optimism. The opinions of the experts differ
respectively.

Kurzweil, who has come with a prediction for a date for the emergence of
singularity---until 2045---expects such a development in a positive way:
"What's actually happening is \[machines\] are powering all of us,"
Kurzweil said during the SXSW interview. "They're making us smarter.
They may not yet be inside our bodies, but, by the 2030s, we will
connect our neocortex, the part of our brain where we do our thinking,
to the cloud."52

In a well-known article---issued on the occasion of a ﬁlm---Stephen
Hawking, Max Tegmark, Stuart Russell, and Frank Wilczek shared a
moderate position: "[The potential **beneﬁts** are **huge**;
**everything that civilization has to offer** is a product of **human**
intelligence; we cannot **predict** what we might achieve when this
intelligence is **magniﬁed** by the tools **AI** may provide, but the
**eradicat**ion of **war, disease, and poverty**]{.underline} [would be
high on anyone's list. Success in creating AI would be the **biggest
event in human history**. . . Unfortunately, it **might also be the
last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks**]{.underline}."53

Still, [the [degrowth]{.mark} project [is **nowhere near**]{.mark}
enjoying [the]{.mark} degree and type of [support it needs]{.mark} if
its policies are to be implemented through democratic
processes]{.underline}. [The number of political parties]{.underline},
labour [unions, business associations and international organisations
that have]{.underline} so far [embraced degrowth is modest to say the
least]{.underline}. [Economic and political [elites]{.mark}, including
social democratic parties and most of the trade union movement, [are
**united** in]{.mark} the [belief that]{.mark} economic [growth is
**necessary and desirable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This consensus finds
support in the prevailing type of economic theory and underpins the main
contenders in the neoliberal project, such as centre-left and
nationalist projects]{.underline}. In spite of the world\'s
multidimensional crisis, [a [pro-growth]{.mark} discourse in other words
continues to be hegemonic: it [is]{.mark} widely considered **[a]{.mark}
matter of [common sense]{.mark}** that continued economic growth is
required]{.underline}.

It is also noteworthy [that economic and political [elites]{.mark}, to a
large extent, continue to [support the]{.mark} neoliberal [project,
**even in the face of its**]{.mark} **evident
[shortcomings]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
20[[08]{.mark} financial [crisis **did not**]{.mark} result in the
[weaken]{.mark}ing of transnational financial [capital]{.mark} that
could have paved the way for a paradigm shift]{.underline}.
[[Instead]{.mark} of coming to an end, neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}
has arguably [entered a **more authoritarian
phase**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bruff, 2014). [The main reason the power
of [the **pre-crisis coalition remains intact**]{.mark} is that
governments stepped in and saved the dominant fraction by means of
massive bailouts]{.underline}. [It is a foregone conclusion that this
fraction and [the wider coalition]{.mark} behind the neoliberal paradigm
(transnational industrial capital, the middle classes and segments of
organized labour) [will consider]{.mark} the [degrowth]{.mark} paradigm
[**unattractive** and]{.mark} that such social forces [will **vehemently
oppose**]{.mark} the implementation of [degrowth
policies]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Rees, 2014: 97).

While degrowth advocates envision a future in which market forces play a
less prominent role than they do today, degrowth is not an antimarket
project. As such, it can attract support from certain types of market
actors. In particular, it is worth noting that social enterprises, such
as cooperatives (Restakis, 2010), play a major role in the degrowth
vision. Such enterprises are defined by being 'organisations involved at
least to some extent in the market, with a clear social, cultural and/or
environmental purpose, rooted in and serving primarily the local
community and ideally having a local and/or democratic ownership
structure' (Johanisova et al., 2013: 11). Social enterprises currently
exist at the margins of a system, in which the dominant type of business
entity is profit-oriented, shareholder-owned corporations. The further
dissemination of social enterprises, which is crucial to the transitions
to degrowth societies, is -- in many cases -- blocked or delayed as a
result of the centrifugal forces of global competition (Wigger and
Buch-Hansen, 2013). Overall, social enterprises thus (still) constitute
a social force with modest power.

Ougaard (2016: 467) notes that one of the major dividing lines in the
contemporary transnational capitalist class is between capitalists who
have a material interest in the carbon-based economy and capitalists who
have a material interest in decarbonisation. The latter group, for
instance, includes [manufacturers of equipment for the production of
renewable energy]{.underline} (ibid.: 467). As mentioned above,
[degrowth advocates have singled out renewable energy as one of the
sectors that needs to grow in the future]{.underline}. As such, it seems
likely that the owners of national and transnational companies operating
in this sector would be more positively inclined towards the degrowth
project than would capitalists with a stake in the carbon-based economy.
Still, [the prospect of the "green sector" emerging as a driving force
behind degrowth currently appears meagre]{.underline}. [Being under the
control of transnational capital]{.underline} (Harris, 2010), such
[companies generally embrace the "green growth" discourse, which 'is
deeply embedded in neoliberal capitalism' and indeed serves to adjust
this form of capitalism 'to crises arising from contradictions within
itself']{.underline} (Wanner, 2015: 23).

In addition to [support from the social forces engendered by the
production process, a political project 'also needs the political
ability to mobilize majorities in parliamentary democracies, and a
sufficient measure of at least passive consent']{.underline} (van
Apeldoorn and Overbeek, 2012: 5--6) if it is to become hegemonic. As
mentioned, [degrowth enjoys little support in parliaments, and certainly
the pro-growth discourse is hegemonic among parties in
government]{.underline}.5 [With capital accumulation being the most
important driving force in capitalist societies, political
decision-makers are generally eager to create conditions conducive to
production and the accumulation of capital]{.underline} (Lindblom, 1977:
172). [[Capitalist states]{.mark} and international organisations
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[**"programmed"** to facilitate]{.mark}
capital [accumulation]{.mark}, and do as such constitute a strategically
selective terrain that works to the disadvantage of the degrowth
project]{.underline}.

[The main advocates of the degrowth project are grassroots]{.underline},
small fractions of left-wing parties and labour unions as well as
academics and other citizens who are concerned about social injustice
and the environmentally unsustainable nature of societies in the rich
parts of the world. The project is thus ideationally driven in the sense
that support for it is not so much rooted in the material circumstances
or short-term self-interests of specific groups or classes as it is
rooted in the conviction that degrowth is necessary if current and
future generations across the globe are to be able to lead a good life.
While there is no shortage of enthusiasts and creative ideas in the
degrowth movement, [it has only modest resources compared to other
political projects]{.underline}. [To put it bluntly, the [advocates of
degrowth **do not possess instruments**]{.mark} that enable them [to
force]{.mark} political [decision-makers to listen to -- let alone
comply with -- their views]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, [they are in a
weaker position than the labour union movement was in its heyday, and
they are in a far weaker position than the owners and managers of large
corporations are today]{.underline} (on the structural power of
transnational corporations, see Gill and Law, 1989).

6\. Consent

It is also safe to say that [degrowth enjoys no "passive consent" from
the majority of the population]{.underline}. For the time being,
[[degrowth remains **unknown** to most]{.mark} people]{.underline}.
[Yet, [if it were]{.mark} to become generally [known, most]{.mark}
people [would]{.mark} probably [**not** find the vision]{.mark} of a
smaller economic system [appealing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is not
just a matter of [degrowth being 'a **missile word** that]{.mark}
backfires' because it **[triggers negative feelings]{.mark}** in people
when they first hear it]{.underline} (Drews and Antal, 2016). [It is
also a matter of the actual content of the degrowth
project]{.underline}.

Two issues in particular should be mentioned in this context. First, for
many, the anti-capitalist sentiments embodied in the degrowth project
will inevitably be a difficult pill to swallow. Today, [the vast
majority of people find it almost impossible to conceive of a world
without capitalism]{.underline}. [There is a 'widespread sense that not
only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but
also that it is now impossible to even imagine a coherent alternative to
it']{.underline} (Fisher, 2009: 2). As Jameson (2003) famously observed,
[[it is]{.mark}, in a sense, [**easier to imagine the end of the world**
than]{.mark} it is to imagine the end [of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [not only is degrowth -- like
other anti-capitalist projects -- up against the challenge that most
people consider capitalism the only system that can function; it is also
up against the additional challenge that it speaks against economic
growth in a world where the desirability of growth is considered common
sense]{.underline}.

Second, [[degrowth is **incompatible** with]{.mark} the
[lifestyles]{.mark} to which [many]{.mark} of us who live in rich
countries have become accustomed]{.underline}. [Economic growth in the
Western world is, to no small extent, premised on the existence of
consumer societies and an associated consumer culture most of us find it
difficult to completely escape]{.underline}. In this culture, [social
status, happiness, well-being and identity are linked to
consumption]{.underline} (Jackson, 2009). Indeed, it is widely
considered a natural right to lead an environmentally unsustainable
lifestyle -- a lifestyle that includes car ownership, air travel,
spacious accommodations, fashionable clothing, an omnivorous diet and
all sorts of electronic gadgets. [This Western norm of consumption has
increasingly been exported to other parts of the world, the result being
that never before have so many people taken part in consumption patterns
that used to be reserved for elites]{.underline} (Koch, 2012). [If
degrowth were to be institutionalised, many citizens in the rich
countries would have to adapt to a materially lower standard of
living]{.underline}. That is, while the basic needs of the global
population can be met in a non-growing economy, not all wants and
preferences can be fulfilled (Koch et al., 2017). Undoubtedly,
[[many]{.mark} people in the rich countries would [experience]{.mark}
various [limitations on]{.mark} their [consumption]{.mark} opportunities
[as]{.mark} a [**violent encroachment** on]{.mark} their [personal
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [whereas many recognize that
contemporary consumer societies are environmentally unsustainable, fewer
are prepared to actually change their own lifestyles to reverse/address
this]{.underline}.

At present, then, the degrowth project is in its "deconstructive phase",
i.e., the phase in which its advocates are able to present a powerful
critique of the prevailing neoliberal project and point to alternative
solutions to crisis. At this stage, not enough support has been
mobilised behind the degrowth project for it to be elevated to the
phases of "construction" and "consolidation". It is conceivable that at
some point, enough people will become sufficiently discontent with the
existing economic system and push for something radically different.
Reasons for doing so could be the failure of the system to satisfy human
needs and/or its inability to resolve the multidimensional crisis
confronting humanity. Yet, [various **[material and ideational
path-dependencies]{.mark}** currently [stand in the way]{.mark} of such
a development, particularly in countries with large
middle-classes]{.underline}. [[Even if]{.mark} it were to happen that
[the majority wanted a break with the]{.mark} current [system, it is
**far from given**]{.mark} that a system based on the ideas of [degrowth
is what they would demand]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No transition\-\--degrowth assumes magic!

[The difficulty]{.underline} of discussion [with
**degrowers**]{.underline} [comes from the fact that they]{.underline}
and the rest of us [live in]{.underline} two [different]{.underline}
ideological [worlds. **[Degrowers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[live in a
world of **magic**]{.underline},]{.mark} [where]{.underline} merely [by
listing]{.underline} the names of [desirable ends they]{.underline} are
supposed to somehow [happen]{.underline}. [[In that world, one does not
need]{.underline}]{.mark} to bother with numbers or **[[facts,
trade-offs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, first or second bests; [one merely
needs to conjure up]{.underline} what he/she **[desires]{.underline}**
and it will be there.

Now degrowers are not irrational people. The reason why they are pushed
in this magical corner is because when they try to "do the numbers" they
are led to an impasse. They do not want to allow for significant
increase in world GDP because it will, even if decoupling (of which they
are skeptical) happens, drive energy emissions too high. [If one wants
to keep world GDP more or less as now one must]{.underline} (A)
"[freeze]{.underline}" [today's global income distributions so that some
10-15% of the world population continue to live below the absolute
poverty line]{.underline}, and [one-half of the world population below
\$PPP 7 dollars per day]{.underline} (which is, by the way,
significantly below Western poverty lines). [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} however **[[unacceptable to the poor
people]{.mark}, to the poor countries, and even to
degrowers]{.underline}** themselves.

[Thus they]{.underline} must [try something else]{.underline}: introduce
[a]{.underline} different [distribution]{.underline} (B) [where
everybody]{.underline} who is [above the current mean world
income]{.underline} (\$PPP 16 per day) [is driven down]{.underline} to
this mean, and the poor countries and people are, at least for a while,
allowed to continue growing until they too achieve the level of \$PPP 16
per day. But [the problem with that approach is that one would have to
engage in a massive reduction of incomes for all those who make more
than \$PPP 16 which is practically all of the Western
population]{.underline}. Only 14% of the population in Western countries
live at the level of income less than the global mean. This is probably
the most important statistic that one should keep in mind.
[[Degrowers]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[need to **convince 86% of the
population living in rich countries** that]{.mark} their [incomes are
too high and need to be reduced. They would have to preside over
**economic depressions for about a decade**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
then let the new real income stay at that level indefinitely. (Even that
would not quite solve the problem because in the meantime, many poor
countries would have reached the level of \$PPP 16 per day and they too
would have to be prevented from growing further.) It is quite obvious
that [such a [proposition is a **political
suicide**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus [**[degrowers do not wish to spell
it out]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### You can't just [wish away]{.underline} the current system. 

Andrew **SAYER 95**, Reader in Social Theory and Political Economy at
Lancaster University \[*Radical Political Economy: A Critique*, 1995, p.
33-34\]

[Any criticism presupposes the possibility of a better way of
life]{.underline}; to expose something as illusory or contradictory is
to imply the possibility and desirability of a life without those
illusions and contradictions. This much has been established by critical
theorists such as Habermas and Apel. Yet the notion that critique
implies a quest for the good is a highly abstract one. [Up to a point,
particular critiques do imply something]{.underline} a little [more
specific than]{.underline} the standpoint of [a better
life]{.underline}. The [critique of capitalism\'s]{.underline} anarchic
and uneven [development implies a critical standpoint or contrast space
of an imagined society with]{.underline} a rationally ordered and
[even]{.underline} process of [development. The critique of class points
to the desirability of a classless society]{.underline}. Naturally,
society would be better if its illusions, conflicts and contradictions
were reduced, but [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} naturally [[want to know
**how** this could be achieved]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[desirability]{.underline}]{.mark} of a life without contradictions or
illusions [[does not make it feasible]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Critical social science does not merely identify illusions,
irrationality or contradictions but attempts to provide explanations of
their sources, locating the \'unwanted determinations\' of behaviour, as
Bhaskar (1989) puts it. [It would be strange]{.underline}, to say the
least, [if an analysis of the causes of]{.underline} problems such as
[hunger and exploitation were unable to indicate anything about
alternatives which would eliminate them. [If a critical theory
**cannot** ]{.mark}**begin** to [indicate how to eliminate
problems]{.mark} we must]{.underline} inevitably [[be suspicious]{.mark}
of its claims to have identified their causes. [If the
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} implied by a critical standpoint [[is
**not feasible**,]{.mark} then any [critique]{.mark} made from that
standpoint [is]{.mark}]{.underline} thereby **[seriously
[weakened]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Not to put too fine a point on it, the
[critique of]{.underline}, say, [capitalism]{.underline}\'s anarchic and
uneven development would [lose much of its force if all]{.underline}
\[END PAGE 33\] [advanced economies were necessarily]{.underline}
anarchic and [uneven]{.underline} in their development, though one could
still criticize advanced economies - not just capitalist ones - from the
very different standpoint of a \'deep ecology\', calling for a return to
small-scale, more primitive economies (Dobson, 1990).

[We need to know enough about the]{.underline} critical standpoint and
the implied [alternative to be able to judge]{.underline} first [whether
it really is feasible and desirable]{.underline}. Since knowledge is
\'situated\' and bears the mark of its author\'s social position, this
includes assessing whose standpoint it is made from. Does it privilege
the position of a particular group (e.g. male workers, advanced
countries)? Does it imply a society without difference? If it suggests
greater equality on whose terms is equality to be defined?7 [We
have]{.underline} also [to ask whether [remedying]{.mark} one set of
[problems would generate others]{.mark}]{.underline} (it usually does),
[and whether these would be worse]{.underline} than the original
problems. [This is rarely considered in radical political economy,
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} usual [implicit [assumption]{.mark} being
[that all bad things go]{.mark} together [in capitalism and all
good]{.mark} things [under socialism/communism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
[it is possible that some of the]{.underline} \'contradictions\' involve
[[dilemmas]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[can\'t be eliminated along with
capitalism]{.mark}. [Evaluations]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of
desirability therefore [[need to be]{.mark} cross-[checked with]{.mark}
assessments of [feasibility, and **optimistic assumptions**]{.mark} of
inevitable improvement **[suspended]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[There are two kinds of feasibility]{.underline} which might be
considered:

> 1 [whether a certain]{.underline} desired [end-state or goal can be
> realized]{.underline} - for example, how people can be politically
> mobilized to make it happen; and
>
> 2 [whether]{.underline}, assuming enough people are willing to try to
> make it happen, [the goal or end-state is feasible in
> itself]{.underline}, e.g. could one have an advanced economy without
> money?

[It is]{.underline} usually [only the first of these questions that
radicals address]{.underline}, the standard response to utopian
discussions being not \'would it work?\' but \'yes but how are you going
to get from here to there?\' But while many might think it idle to
ignore (1), it is surprising how little attention is given to (2), [as
if the journey mattered more than the destination]{.underline}. I fully
accept that I am not offering suggestions on (1) in this book, and only
ideas pertinent to (2): but then [I don\'t see how large-scale political
mobilization can precede a well-worked out conception of a feasible
alternative]{.underline}.

### Transition Wars -- Alt

[It has become **fashionable**]{.underline} on social media and [in
certain publications to argue that **capitalism is killing the
planet**]{.underline}. Even renowned investor Jeremy Grantham, hardly a
radical, made that assertion last year. [The **basic idea** is that the
**profit motive** drives the **private sector** to **spew
carbon**]{.underline} into the air with reckless abandon. Though many
economists and some climate activists believe that the problem is best
addressed by modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, [many
activists believe that the problem can't be addressed **without
rebuilding** the **economy**]{.underline} along centrally planned lines.

[The climate threat is certainly dire]{.underline}, and carbon taxes are
unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [But eco-socialism
is]{.underline} probably [**not** going to be an **effective method** of
addressing that threat. **Dismantling** an **entire economic system** is
**never easy**, and probably would **touch off armed conflict** and
**major asdasd upheaval**. In the scramble to win those battles, even
the socialists would almost certainly abandon their limitation on
**fossil-fuel use**]{.underline} --- [either to support **military
efforts**, or to keep the population from turning against them. The
precedent here is the **Soviet Union**, whose multidecade effort to
**reshape its economy** by **force** amid **confrontation** with the
West led to profound **environmental degradation**. The world\'s climate
does not have several decades to spare]{.underline}.

[Even **without international conflict**, there's **little guarantee**
that moving away from capitalism would **mitigate our impact** on the
environment]{.underline}. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power
[in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially]{.underline}
for the average Bolivian, which is great. [But this has come at the cost
of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed to **decrease
its per capita emissions**]{.underline} a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, [in terms of **economic growth** and **carbon
emissions**, Bolivia looks]{.underline} similar to more
[capitalist]{.underline} developing countries. [That suggests that
**faced with a choice** of enriching their people or helping to save the
climate, even **socialist leaders** will often choose the former. And
that same political calculus will probably hold in China and the
U.S.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [leaders who
demand **draconian cuts** in **living standards** in pursuit of
environmental goals will have **trouble staying in power**]{.underline}.

[The **best hope** for the climate therefore lies in **reducing the
tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon emissions**.
That requires **technology**]{.underline} --- [**solar**, **wind** and
**nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars** and other
vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The **best climate
policy** plans all involve **technological improvement** as a **key
feature**.]{.underline}
