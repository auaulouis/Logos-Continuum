[Greater investments in AI R&D are essential to maintaining American
leadership in AI.]{.underline} Throughout the 20th century[, the federal
government played a critical role in fueling technological innovation by
funding pivotal basic research]{.underline}. [Government funding was
essential to developing the transistor, the Global Positioning System,
and the Interne]{.underline}t---inventions that transformed the world
economy. [Yet over the past several decades, federal government spending
on R&D]{.underline} as a percentage of GDP [declined]{.underline} from
about 1.2 percent in 1976 to around 0.7 percent in
2018.[3](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn3) This
is a worrisome trend as the federal government remains the main funder
of basic
research.[4](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn4) [Government
support again could be pivotal both in fostering new AI breakthroughs
and ensuring that the U.S. government has access]{.underline} to those
breakthroughs.

[U.S. government entities already are pursuing important AI R&D
initiatives.]{.underline} The National Science Foundation funds an array
of basic research and partners with stakeholders across government,
academia, and the private sector to foster advances in the
field.[5](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn5) The
National Institutes of Health are incorporating deep learning to improve
disease screening and natural language processing for information
retrieval and
discovery.[6](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn6) In
2018, [the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the
Department of Defense organization charged with developing emerging
technologies, launched a \$2 billion multi-year campaign to incentivize
the creation of a range of new AI capabilities and
applications.[7](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn7)]{.underline}

Unclassified federal government spending on defense AI R&D in FY2020
will be about \$4 billion, according to a Bloomberg analysis from March
2019.[8](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn8) In
September 2019, the White House announced an FY20 non-defense AI R&D
budget request of nearly \$1
billion.[9](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn9)

In contrast, the level of Chinese government spending on AI R&D is not
clear. Complete annualized figures for Chinese government spending are
not publicly available. Instead, only announcements of planned,
multi-year spending offer a window into the scale of overall government
R&D spending at the national, provincial, and local
levels.[10](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn10) For
instance, two Chinese cities alone announced the creation of RMB 100
billion (approximately \$15 billion) multi-year AI development funds
while Beijing unveiled plans for a \$2 billion AI research park in
2018.[11](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn11)

The United States enjoys robust private sector R&D funding. Precise
figures are hard to discern because companies typically do not divulge
details for R&D expenditures in their financial statements and privately
owned firms do not have such reporting requirements. That said, looking
at overall R&D expenditures by major AI-intensive companies gives a
sense of the scale of private investments in AI R&D. The combined 2018
R&D expenditures by U.S. firms Alphabet, IBM, Facebook, Microsoft, and
Amazon was \$80.5
billion.[12](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn12)

China's tech giants also report significant R&D investments, although
they are considerably smaller than those of their U.S. counterparts.
Leading Chinese AI firms Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent collectively spent
\$9.1 billion on R&D in
2018.[13](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn13) These
firms are also major investors in Chinese AI
startups.[14](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn14)

[In contrast, Europe is a laggard]{.underline}. Combined R&D spending by
the EU (national governments and private investments) is projected to be
EUR 20 billion (approximately \$22.1 billion) in 2020, up from about EUR
3.7 billion (approximately \$4.1 billion) in
2016.[15](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn15)

[The United States' dominant position in startup funding, a key driver
of technological innovation, is starting to erode. In 2017, the U.S.
share of global AI startup funding was less than half of the world's
total]{.underline}---ceding the lead to China---for the first time
ever.[16](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn16) This
happened despite venture capital funding of American AI startups growing
at a 36 percent compound annual growth rate since
2013.[17](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn17)

Figures are clearer for all national R&D spending, beyond simply AI, and
indicate worrisome trends. Other countries are outpacing the United
States with faster growth of their national R&D budgets. Total U.S.
national (public and private) R&D expenditures as a share of GDP have
been mostly stagnant since 1996. China quadrupled its R&D expenses as a
share of GDP over the same time frame, and countries like Israel and
South Korea also significantly ramped up
spending.[18](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn18) As
a result, the U.S. share of global R&D has declined over the past
several decades, falling from 69 percent in 1960 to 28 percent in 2016.
From 2000 to 2015, the United States accounted for 19 percent of global
R&D growth, while China accounted for 31
percent.[19](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn19) China
is on track to top the United States in total R&D investments (in
purchasing power parity-adjusted dollars) as soon as
2019.[20](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn20)

[R&D is a key driver of long-term economic
growth]{.underline}.[21](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn21) The
Congressional Budget Office reaffirmed in 2018 that federal R&D spending
is a positive influence on private R&D spending and increases
macroeconomic
growth.[22](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn22) Authors
of a ten-year study of 28 EU economies concluded that a 1 percent
increase in R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP would cause an
increase of real GDP growth rate of 2.2
percent.[23](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn23)

[The United States gains further benefits from federal R&D spending
through effective technology diffusion. Technology transfers from the
public to the private sector are stipulated in several
laws.[24](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn24) This
legislation gives ownership and title to federally funded research by
universities and small businesses]{.underline} [and]{.underline} has
[resulted in thousands of spin-off companies, increased technology
transfer, and greater
innovation]{.underline}.[25](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn25) Under
these laws, the U.S. receives government royalty-free access to the
research.[26](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/the-american-ai-century-a-blueprint-for-action#fn26)

Accessed Online on 6-22-22)

[During the analysis of U.S. biosecurity and biodefense
policy]{.underline}, several capability, implementation, and
infrastructure gaps were identified. That is, [goals]{.underline} which
[are plainly stated in biodefense legislation]{.underline}, presidential
directives, or other policy instruments, are found to be associated with
few implemented programs or actions. [These gaps include: • Capability
Gaps: o Microbial forensics is an underinvested field in the United
States]{.underline} and internationally, but [could be enhanced by
leveraging technologies such as bioinformatics and next generation
sequencing]{.underline}. [Two U.S. government policies highlight the
need for microbial forensic capabilities]{.underline}:
HSPD10/[Biodefense for the 21st Century]{.underline} (2004) [and the
National Strategy to Support Research in Microbial Forensics Attribution
Investigations and National Security]{.underline} (2009).(56, 57) [These
strategies]{.underline}, along with recent reports completed by the
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine and the
Government Accountability Office [can]{.underline} help
[define]{.underline} nearterm [recommendations]{.underline} for
addressing this gap. [Leveraging new biotechnologies may enhance
capabilities for microbial forensics at a lower overall
cost]{.underline} and/or higher throughput than traditional forensics
methods. o [Systems for scanning scientific advances]{.underline} that
[could lead to new technology developments exist in offices that
support]{.underline} or conduct [research]{.underline} and advanced
development. However, end-users often do not have access to these
systems or have similar systems of their own, which limits field
application and relevance to biodefense activities. o [Despite
significant investment in biosurveillance approaches and platforms, the
underlying data used to develop effective early warning methods is
highly variable and uncertain.]{.underline} This challenge suggests a
gap in robust approaches for generating reliable, curated input data. In
addition, this challenge highlights the lack of communication and
interaction between scientific experts and policy-makers, which may be
needed to ensure that existing, verified data is included in the
decision-making process of preparedness activities and potential
emergency situations. o [The increasing convergence of scientific
disciplines, changing funding paradigm, and expansion of biotechnology
practitioners suggests]{.underline} that [greater attention is needed on
evaluating the security implications of biological and biotechnological
advances and applications]{.underline} that are not only focused on
pathogens and toxins. In 2014, the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, FBI, and United National Interregional Crime and
Justice Research Institute published a report on the national and
transnational security implications of Big Data in the Life Sciences.
This report acknowledged the increasing production of genomic data by
research, clinical, and direct-to-consumer organizations throughout the
world; the continuously advancing computational and data science
capabilities; and the frequency of cyberattacks of health care and
insurance databases. This combination of factors led the FBI and others
to evaluate more closely the potential national security risks presented
by these activities and approaches for reducing the risks while not
adversely affecting commercial, research, and clinical innovation. •
[Infrastructure Gap o Despite investment on basic research on pathogens,
the academic research sector, including the biocontainment laboratories,
are not considered a critical infrastructure and therefore, have little
to no external financial or expert support]{.underline} to prepare for,
respond to, and recover from potential events. However, [the basic
knowledge about pathogens are generated by this sector and the
capabilities to identify newly-emerging or never-beforeseen pathogens
are resident within this sector]{.underline}. o Very few policies and
programs exist for promoting resiliency in the biodefense, health, and
research sector. But, resiliency is a local issue, which suggests that
[the federal government role may be in facilitating preparedness,
planning, and recovery efforts. No policy appears to include outreach
efforts to the scientific community to promote resiliency.]{.underline}
o Although the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and
Response Act of 2002 includes a section on support for applied
biosafety, very little, if any, funding has been appropriated for
research to generate the data needed to evaluate effectiveness of
biosafety measures. • Implementation Gap o [Several sectors and
organizations do not have sufficient funds to support compliance with
biosecurity regulations]{.underline} so they choose not to participate
in activities involving restricted agents. The most significantly
affected sectors are public health and veterinary diagnostic
laboratories, which require external funding and technical support to
maintain compliance with the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT)
Regulations. o The continuous changes to the BSAT Regulations have
resulted in significant challenges and delays in federal implementation
and local compliance. Although federal regulators previously have met
with the regulated community to discuss changes to federal BSAT
policies, these outreach activities seem to have ended. Instead, [the
Federal Select Agent Program directors have initiated new efforts that
involve interaction and engagement with local Federal Bureau of
Investigation Weapons of Mass Destruction]{.underline} Coordinators. o
Practical resources for enabling program managers, research reviewers,
and scientists to assess the risks and benefits of research do not
exist. [These resources would ensure that science and technology
investments for promoting biodefense and health security objectives can
be leveraged maximally while risks are addressed
adequately]{.underline}. [o Annual and inconsistent investment in
nonproliferation activities, specifically for cooperative threat
reduction programs]{.underline}, limits long-term sustainability of
partnerships and outcomes. [Threat reduction or bioengagement programs
require long-term planning, engagement, and funding to increase the
likelihood of sustainability]{.underline} of activities (e.g., through
financial support of the recipient country), enabling an exit strategy
for U.S. government funding. [o Effective measures for evaluating
biosecurity policy implementation have not been developed.]{.underline}
Members of the scientific and security community routinely have stated
that the development of measures are not feasible because measuring the
absence of an event (i.e., measuring a negative result) is impossible.
Conversely, [measures for evaluating some biodefense investments do
exist]{.underline}, each different from another. This variability
highlights inconsistencies that may arise from the different, often ad
hoc evaluation metrics used to assess biodefense investments. o No
analytic framework currently exists for assessing opportunity costs of
biosecurity policy. Often direct costs are calculated in advance as part
of regulatory impact assessments. But, indirect costs and downstream
consequences, which represent opportunity costs of a policy, resulting
from these direct costs are not calculated. However, many in the
regulated community use arguments about opportunity cost when engaging
in policy discussions, highlighting the importance of considering costs
downstream of direct time and financial investments.

#### US policy alone is better

**Bandow 19**- Senior Fellow at the CATO Institute (Doug, "NATO No
Longer Serves American Interests," CATO Institute, 12-5-19, Accessed

Ultimately [the alliance decided to expand its membership, even though
the enemy had disappeared]{.underline}. Doing so violated multiple
assurances given to Moscow. NATO also initiated "out‐​of‐​area"
activities, which meant defending other than member states. This
ironically turned the pact into an offensive instrument, first used to
dismember Serbia in 1999. In essence, NATO had gone from a means to an
end, with war the new means. Said Sen. Richard Lugar, then chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the organization would "go out
of area or out of business." And, as public choice economists would
predict, no one involved in the alliance wanted the latter. The [Soviet
Union's collapse triggered European disarmament, which]{.underline} in
turn [intensified American demands for greater burden‐​sharing,
which]{.underline} the [Europeans]{.underline} continued to
[ignore]{.underline}. The process continued for years, demonstrating,
perversely, that the less Europe did the more America would. Hence the
bizarrely named "European Reassurance Initiative" after Russia's
intervention in Ukraine: the Europeans were essentially promised that
even if they did nothing Washington would remain at their side---though
whining all the way. U.S. policymakers appeared to accept the need to
subsidize the Europeans in order to keep them dependent. Washington
opposed any proposals for independent spending and action, preferring
that Europe do more, but only under America's direction. The alliance
continued to add members. Most recently it accepted Montenegro, with
North Macedonia awaiting treaty approval by the 29 current members. Next
up, the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, featured in the novel The Mouse that
Roared! [The latest]{.underline} out‐​of‐​area [wars]{.underline} have
been distant, unconventional conflicts: Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria,
of which the latter triggered French President Emmanuel Macron's
complaint about a lack of allied coordination. Some NATO fans call the
organization a "global alliance," presumably ready to act as global cop.
In every case, of course, the heavy lifting inevitably
[fall]{.underline}s [on Washington. Every recent president criticized
Europeans for failing to make sufficient contributions]{.underline} for
the common defense. Defense Secretary Robert Gates suggested that the
alliance itself was at risk, since "[there will be dwindling
appetite]{.underline} and patience [in]{.underline} the U.S.
[Congress]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in [the American body politic
writ large, to expend]{.underline} increasingly [precious
funds]{.underline} on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to
devote the necessary resources ... in their own defense." President
Trump expressed similar sentiments, though more crudely. Alas, the
burden‐​sharing debate is unproductive. [The issue should be
burden‐​shedding]{.underline}. Even when President Trump does the right
thing, he does so badly. So it is with NATO. But [the alliance's "brain
death" reflects its inherent problems]{.underline}, not his dreadful
management. Quite simply, [it makes no sense for U.S. taxpayers to
subsidize the defense of nations capable of defending
themselves.]{.underline} Shared interests will continue to justify
military cooperation. However, the alliance as today constituted no
longer serves American interests. [NATO's problems are many and
fundamental.]{.underline} First, [America and Europe no longer face an
existential threat, let alone a common one]{.underline}. [Which makes
united action by such a diverse membership so difficult]{.underline}.
Russia is no Soviet Union. Vladimir Putin is no Joseph Stalin. The
Russian Federation is an unpleasant actor but has reverted to a pre‐​1914
great power, insisting on border security and international respect.
There is no prospect of a Russian attack on the U.S. and little more
chance of one on Europe, Old or New. Although plausible, even a
successful grab of the Baltic States would yield little benefit for much
cost. [Russia's, Europe's, and America's interests often
clash]{.underline}---they understandably have different perspectives on
economic predominance in Ukraine and political predominance in Syria,
for instance---but most such issues are of only limited importance. Even
the disputes over Georgia and Ukraine are peripheral matters for Europe
and America. However, the latter is existential (in the case of the
latter) security concerns for Russia. NATO expansion moved the
transatlantic alliance a thousand miles eastward; Western‐​backed "color
revolutions" placed unfriendly governments in neighboring states;
Ukraine was heartland territory for the Russian Empire and the Soviet
Union; and Crimea, transferred in 1954 to Ukraine as part of an internal
Soviet political deal, contains the important Black Sea military base at
Sebastopol. Moscow views its "near abroad" rather like Washington views
Latin America. The U.S. officially does not believe in spheres of
interest, but the Trump administration reacted badly to Russian
involvement in Venezuela. The president said: "Russia has to get out."
Then‐​National Security adviser John Bolton announced: "We strongly
caution actors external to the western hemisphere against deploying
military assets to Venezuela, or elsewhere in the hemisphere, with the
intent of establishing or expanding military operations." Thus, Moscow's
behavior, though unjustified, is essentially defensive toward the West.
That conclusion is backed by Russian military deployments. Mike Kofman
of Harvard University's Belfer Center argued: "Despite provocative air
and naval activity concentrated in the \[Baltic\] area Russian forces
base there are principally defensive, and aging to boot." Despite
increasing indications that the Putin government might be interested in
reducing tensions over Ukraine, the allies have yet to offer the one
concession that might cause Russia to moderate its behavior: the end of
NATO expansion. Second, [most Europeans don't appear to fear for their
security]{.underline}. Despite the public hysteria surrounding Moscow's
often unsavory behavior, few Europeans worry about Russia. The Baltics
and Poland express a different perspective, yet their military spending,
around two percent of GDP, remains paltry if they truly believe their
independence to be at stake. The continent faces other modest security
issues, primarily emanating from the Middle East and North Africa, but
few are susceptible to a military response and none require a larger
European military. France and the United Kingdom have greater
international interests related to their colonial past, but even [their
willingness to intervene is declining.]{.underline} Earlier this year
former U.S. ambassadors Douglas Lute and Nicholas Burns made the
astonishing claim that NATO's problems "represent the most severe crisis
in the security environment in Europe since the end of the Cold War and
perhaps ever." More than in September 1939? August 1914? During the
Napoleonic Wars and French Revolution? German Chancellor Angela Merkel
was only slightly less hysterical in declaring: "Maintaining NATO today
is even more in our own interest than it was in the Cold War---or at
least as important as it was in the Cold War." In fact, Europe may be
more secure than ever before. Third, significant military spending
increases---as opposed to incremental movement by some states toward
NATO's two percent objective---are unlikely. Even Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo admitted that when he asks Europeans to do more, "they say
'It's tough. Our voters just really don't like to spend money on
defense'." This is an eminently sensible response, given the absence of
a serious threat and Washington's oft‐​demonstrated determination to
defend the continent, no matter what. As a share of GDP European
military expenditures, last year ran 1.51 percent, the same in 2012. The
future is not likely to be much better. Military spending by the
continent's small states has little impact on overall spending while the
five most economically significant European countries range from awful
to unimpressive. Most notably, Germany was at a dismal 1.23 percent of
GDP last year. Moreover, the Bundeswehr's readiness is terrible. Two
years ago the Rand Corporation estimated it would take a month for
Berlin to mobilize a heavy armored brigade. In January Bundestag
Military Commissioner Hans‐​Peter Bartels reported that few of the
Bundeswehr's shortcomings had been fixed, despite increased
expenditures: "There is neither enough personnel nor materiel, and often
one confronts shortage upon shortage." Having previously agreed to hit
two percent in 2024, Chancellor Merkel now says Berlin will do so in the
early 2030s. Even if her latest assurance was credible, her current
coalition faces potential collapse and she might be out of office as
early as next year. If the Left forms an upcoming government military
outlays are likely to go into reverse. Fourth, the Europeans know that
they can rely on the U.S. to act irrespective of how little they
contribute to their militaries. For years Washington has whined,
complained, demanded, begged, and insisted that its allies do more,
without noticeable effect. Only Russia's 2014 intervention in Ukraine
triggered the beginning of a modest increase in European military
outlays, which predates Trump's demands. Even when he and past
presidents insisted that America's allies do more, their administrations
have conducted business as usual and emissaries have visited Europe
dedicated to "reassuring" even Europe's laggards of Washington's eternal
commitment to defend the continent no matter what. Virtually every Trump
appointee at State and Defense has undercut the president's dramatic
rhetoric by insisting on America's unshakeable commitment to maintaining
the Pentagon's defense dole, actually increasing the money spent on and
troops deployed to Europe. Fifth, [Europeans are well able to defend
themselves]{.underline}. Although maybe not easily with their current
force structure. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas insisted that
"Without the United States, we are currently unable to protect
ourselves." Yes, currently, because Europe does not spend more and does
so more effectively. [Europe has an equivalent economy and a larger
population than America.]{.underline} The continent possesses eleven
times the economic strength and nearly four times the population of
Russia. Already Europeans devote four times as much as Moscow to the
armed forces. And Europe could do much more. Collective action obviously
can be difficult, but that could be eased by a sense of urgency. The
continent doesn't do more because it doesn't want to do more, not
because it can't do more. NATO Secretary‐​General Jens Stoltenberg went
further, contending that "we need to avoid any perception that Europe
can manage without NATO, because two World Wars and the Cold War taught
us that we need a strong transatlantic bond to preserve peace and
stability in Europe." He apparently hasn't noticed that fascism, Nazism,
and communism have disappeared from the continent. [The greatest barrier
to the Europeans managing without America's aid is their lengthy
dependence on the U.S.]{.underline} That makes the transition more
complicated and perhaps traumatic, but not impossible. Sixth, [many
Europeans don't want to defend each other, or America]{.underline}. In a
YouGov survey earlier this year, only 42 percent of French, 53 percent
of Germans, and 59 percent of Britons believed the alliance had an
important role to play in the continent's defense. Almost uniformly,
[Europeans were more concerned about terrorism, which the alliance is
ill‐​equipped to handle, than invasion]{.underline}. The willingness of
people in NATO members to aid allied states varied dramatically, with
support in some cases falling into the teens. There was inconsistent
backing for military action even in the most important alliance members.
For instance, the majority of French and British were mostly unwilling
to defend other states, except each other.

This judgment is shared by many countries. China, Russia, members of the
European Union, Japan, and South Korea all are increasing AI research,
development, and training[. China in particular sees advances in AI as a
key means to surpass the United States in both economic and military
power.]{.underline} China has stated its intent to be the world leader
in AI by 2030 and is making major investments to achieve that goal.

[The United States needs to respond to this technological challenge in
the same way it responded to prior]{.underline} technology
[competitions]{.underline}, such as the space race. [U.S. leadership in
AI is critical]{.underline} not only because technology is a key enabler
of political, economic, and military power, but also [because the United
States can shape how AI is used around the world.]{.underline} As this
report explains, while AI can be used for incredible good by societies,
it already is being abused by authoritarian states to surveil and
repress their populations. And [advances in AI technology are enabling
future malign uses, such as launching sophisticated influence attacks
against democratic nations.]{.underline} [The United States must make
sure it leads in AI technologies and shapes global norms for usage in
ways that are consistent with democratic values and respect for human
rights.]{.underline}

[This CNAS report offers sensible ways to ensure U.S. leadership in the
coming "AI century."]{.underline} If you are seeking a primer on AI or a

[The United States has been working to codify the National Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Initiative that focuses on six strategic
pillars: improving AI innovation, advancing trustworthy AI, creating new
education and training opportunities through AI, improving existing
infrastructure through new technologies, facilitating federal and
private sector utilization of AI to improve existing
systems,]{.underline} and promoting an international environment that
supports further advances in AI. In April 2022, the U.S. Department of
Commerce, and the National Institute on Standards (NIST) announced
members of the inaugural National Artificial Intelligence Advisory
Committee (NAIAC), which will be tasked with advising the Biden
administration on how to proceed with national AI governance efforts. At
their [first
meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq-CydVwLDw&t=1s) on May 4,
2022, [the NAIAC discussed the use of AI pertaining to U.S.
competitiveness, issues related to workforce, and whether there is
adequate national oversight of AI systems.]{.underline} Taken together,
[the objectives of the national AI initiative and the creation of the
NAIAC will ensure strategic and timely approaches to the design and
deployment of autonomous systems, as well as further establish national
norms.]{.underline}

Of equal importance is that the technology needs to be improved for
domestic use cases as part of this national effort, especially in areas
with the potential to create either differential treatment or disparate
impact for federally protected and other vulnerable populations. If the
U.S. excludes such considerations from national governance discussions,
historic and systemic inequalities will be perpetuated, limiting the
integration of the needs and lived experiences of certain groups into
emerging AI innovations. Poor or inadequate decisions around financial
services and creditworthiness, hiring, criminal justice, health care,
education, and other scenarios that predict social and economic
mobilities stifle inclusion and undercut democratic values such as
equity and fairness. These and other potential harms must be paired with
pragmatic solutions, starting with a comprehensive and universal
definition of bias, or the specific harm being addressed. Further, the
process must include solutions for legible and enforceable frameworks
that bring equity into the design, execution, and auditing of
computational models to thwart historical and present-day discrimination
and other predatory outcomes.

While [the NAIAC is the appropriate next step in gathering input from
various stakeholders within the private and public sectors, as well as
from universities and civil society stakeholders]{.underline},
representatives from more inclusive and affected groups are also key to
developing and executing a more resilient governance approach. In 2021,
the Brookings Institution Center for Technology Innovation (CTI)
convened a group of stakeholders prior to the NAIAC formation to better
understand and discuss the U.S.'s evolving positions on AI. Leaders
represented national and local organizations advocating for various
historically-disadvantaged and other vulnerable populations.

Accessed Online on 6-22-22)

The multi-use nature of emerging biotechnology presents several unique
challenges to biosecurity policy and governance. Biosecurity and
biodefense---broadly conceptualized---will be affected by emerging
biotechnologies in a variety of ways which only now are beginning to be
understood. In 2016[, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
required the U.S. government to create a new "National Biodefense
Strategy", along with an implementation plan]{.underline} that
encompasses the well over 100 existing biodefense and biosecurity
policies and programs[. The NDAA also requires an assessment of all
existing governance to date]{.underline}, the analysis for which has not
been made public. Although some have done work to evaluate the landscape
of policies, no one yet has done a comprehensive relational analysis of
their implementation. However, [without a system-wide evaluation of all
policy, the immediate and longer-term consequences to U.S. objectives
for countering biological threats may never be understood.]{.underline}
To better understand biosecurity and biodefense policy implementation
and broader consequences, the authors have undertaken a comprehensive,
relational analysis of all biodefense and biosecurity policies since
1913. The creation of such a relational "landscape" of policy enabled
the authors to: 1) make fundamental observations about the biodefense
policy landscape as it currently exists; 2) provide direction for the
analysis of opportunity costs associated with the implementation of
policies; 3) support the evaluation of policies; and 4) delineate clear
needs for incorporation in the roadmap. Included in the analysis were
U.S. Code, international agreements and partnerships, guidance,
guidelines, and agency and executive-level strategies as primary
components. U.S. Code, which encompasses enacted legislation and
regulations, was used to prevent double-counting of policies. Once
assembled, each policy was tagged by policy type, subject area, primary
biodefense objective for which the policy was created, and the
biodefense objectives that the policies indirectly affect after
implementation. Figure 8 illustrates our approach used to analyze U.S.
biodefense and biosecurity policies. Gephi was used to create the
network maps and Tableau was used to create the dot graphs.(50, 51) All
policies included in this analysis are publicly available through the
U.S. Code, Code of Federal Regulations, Government Printing Office,
White House archives, PHE.gov, and individual agency websites. To map
policies to biodefense objectives, the authors evaluated the utility of
using either the four pillars of biodefense in the 2004 Homeland
Security Presidential Directive 10/Biodefense for the 21st Century or
the seven objectives in the National Strategy for Countering Biological
Threats. However, neither of these objectives included the full range of
biodefense objectives. Therefore, [the objectives used in this analysis
are listed below and cover the full spectrum of biodefense
activities]{.underline}: • Situational Awareness, which includes threat
assessment, risk assessment, and intelligence • [Prevention, which
includes export control, physical security, personnel security, cyber
security, nonproliferation, and threat reduction]{.underline} •
[Preparedness, which includes preparedness planning, community
engagement, research and development of medical countermeasures, and
detection and biosurveillance activities]{.underline} • [Response •
Recovery Science and technology capabilities supporting biodefense
objectives are: • Natural, engineering, and social science research •
Medical countermeasure research and development • Biosurveillance and
detection • Forensics]{.underline} The science and technology
capabilities often fall under more than one biodefense objective and
therefore, are included as separate objectives in our policy analysis.
In addition, biosafety is listed separately in the policy analysis
primarily because both of its definitions -- measures to prevent
laboratory exposure or release of pathogens and to prevent environmental
release of genetically modified organisms for the protection of
biodiversity -- may help to address biosecurity risks. Laboratory
biosafety measures provide overlapping benefits for laboratory
biosecurity. Furthermore, [U.S. policies on safety of biotechnology
products and recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids are part of the
overall governance landscape of biology and biotechnology]{.underline},
including research about which security concerns are raised. [For
example, synthesis of the extinct horsepox virus using
commercially-synthesized DNA has elicited significant concern among
security experts about its dual use potential]{.underline}. This
research would not be covered under any U.S. biosecurity policy if
conducted in the U.S. because horsepox is an animal only pathogen that
went extinct on its own. However, this research would be covered under
U.S. biosafety and worker protection policies if conducted in the United
States. Because of its complexity and the concern it has generated among
some national security experts, the authors have developed a policy case
study on this research.

[Biological threats are]{.underline} inherently [difficult to
calibrate]{.underline}. In the natural environment, [emerging and
re-emerging pathogens are constantly evolving and spread
opportunistically]{.underline}. [The intentions and capabilities of
human actors]{.underline} to exploit biological agents for purposes of
terrorism and war [are also in flux]{.underline} as advancing
biotechnologies enable both state and nonstate actors to develop new
threats. Thus, bio surprise is inevitable, even when the risk is
generally acknowledged. Following the initial surprise, [rapid detection
and assessment are critical to staying ahead of the threat]{.underline}.
a. [Looking ahead]{.underline} a decade, [emerging infectious diseases
will likely intensify]{.underline}. A combination of factors, including
increased human encroachment into remote habitats and the effects of
global warming, can be expected to increase the frequency of epidemics
and pandemics. Participants agreed that the United States does not have
the luxury of preparing for one or the other (naturally-occurring or
man-made); it must be prepared for both. b. [Early warning can make a
huge difference in mitigating]{.underline} human and other
[consequences]{.underline}. [This requires broad surveillance, reliable
information, and broad information sharin]{.underline}g. The United
States and the international community have multiple capabilities in
place to look for early warning signs of an emerging public health
crisis, but these depend on a high degree of scientific competence and
credibility. Both have diminished in recent years or have failed to
adapt in the face of growing political and societal challenges to
authority and expertise. Divestment, disinformation, and outright
attacks have all been contributing factors. c. With early indicators in
hand, the role of the scientific community is to out-race the unfolding
public health crisis by rapidly characterizing the biological source,
openly sharing epidemiological data, [implementing public health
measures (such as maskwearing, contact tracing, and isolating the sick),
and developing medical therapeutics]{.underline}. [The ability to do
these has greatly advanced]{.underline} in recent years, with improved
international cooperation within the scientific community a contributing
factor. The potential pathways to medical solutions have also increased
significantly (e.g., there are currently 44 vaccines for COVID-19 in
clinical evaluation and another 154 in preclinical stages). 3. [Looking
to the future, specific actions should be in place to enable an
effective crisis response. This includes steps to enable the rapid
production and deployment of diagnostic tests, monoclonal antibodies,
antivirals, and anti-inflammatory drugs]{.underline}. [It also includes
steps to maintain a capacity for large-scale development and production
of vaccines and new therapeutic drugs.]{.underline} In addition, better
predictive models would improve the analysis of alternative
interventions; however, [these models require access to well curated and
prepositioned data sets]{.underline}. [A key challenge in accelerating
responses by the medical research community is the improved use of
research]{.underline} that has not yet been peer reviewed; some
innovative mechanisms to rapidly review, assess, and make available
worthy research are now up and running. 4. In addition, many of the
global and regional partnerships needed to respond effectively have not
worked as desired during COVID-19 and are in need of repair. These
partnerships include the following: public-private, public
health-national security, medical-law enforcement, U.S.- allies,
international organizations-member states, government-news media,
elements of the supply chain, etc. 3 5. To a significant extent,
[further revisions to national strategy will be driven by lessons
learned from the COVID-19 epidemic]{.underline}. As the pandemic tapers
off, [governmental attention and funding are likely to remain
high]{.underline}---for a while. If the past is any guide, however,
other demands will emerge, and both attention and funding will decline.
G[iven the expectation of an increased frequency of public health crises
in the future, specific actions should be taken now while there is
increased funding and public attention]{.underline} on the problem. a.
[Successful management of a health crisis requires a whole of government
response]{.underline}. Essential capabilities include the ability to
rapidly get all stakeholders to the table, generate reliable data,
quickly define required decisions and make them, rapidly identify and
cope with unexpected facets of the problem, coordinate the distribution
of limited resources, and coordinate implementation activities across
state, federal, and local lines. They also include the ability to manage
the domestic and international political dimensions of a situation,
rather than try to pretend that a public health crisis is not a
political event. The opportunity to learn and practice these skills will
improve their efficacy during a crisis. b. [Communicating effectively in
crisis is an especially important skill.]{.underline} Past crises have
repeatedly taught a lesson about the importance of communicating with
empathy. This means telling the truth, providing hope, setting
expectations, and being explicit about "the ask" of the audience. c.
Much more can be done both nationally and internationally to strengthen
existing capacities and add new capabilities. Significant gaps remain in
the global architecture of institutions and processes for managing
biological risks, whether naturally occurring or man-made. d. [The
United States should also learn from the successes of its COVID-19
response, particularly those from Operation Warp speed]{.underline}.
Many panelists commented that the speed by which vaccine candidates have
advanced to clinical trials was amazing. This success story demonstrates
how the U.S. government can help underwrite cost and risk of new vaccine
development for pharmaceutical companies.

[The prevailing approach to managing pandemic risks is to quickly detect
and respond to infectious diseases as they arise.]{.underline} The tools
for doing so have steadily improved since the 1980s. Panelists cited two
in particular: first, in the mid-1990s, U.S. and Israeli support
developed the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network, a
unified online software platform for diagnosing diseases and identifying
potential treatments. With the twin advent of genomic science and
improved computing power, [U.S. universities and federally funded
research centers developed significant bioinformatics capabilities to
aid in the processing of emergent pandemic data and the identification
of responses.]{.underline} [The widespread use of relatively
inexpensive, high throughput genomic sequencing has aided bioinformatics
efforts]{.underline} and may aid in characterizing the risks of future
pandemics. The genomes of over 2000 viruses have been sequenced thus
far, although approximately 300,000 mammalian viruses remain
unsequenced. In contrast, [success in predicting the emergence of
harmful pathogens has proved more elusive]{.underline}. A stronger
worldwide surveillance system that monitors people with novel and
unusual diseases would provide additional early warning before pandemics
emerge. However, [there are domestic and geopolitical barriers to the
development of such a surveillance system.]{.underline} Governments are
hesitant to provide external researchers with the kind of access
necessary to conduct good disease surveillance, while sustained access
might require a degree of international cooperation that is unrealistic
in an era of renewed interstate competition. In addition[, all pathogens
are somewhat unique, and the emergence of a particularly virulent
infectious diseases can overwhelm the ability of public and private
sector actors]{.underline} to prevent spread of a contagion and rapidly
produce vaccines and treatments. These challenges affect both man-made
and natural pathogens. Man-made threats are further complicated by the
dual-uses of many emerging biotechnologies which lack effective means
for establishing norms to enforce their misuse. [Early warning and
response could also be significantly improved with a better
understanding of which pathogens might infect humans and cause adverse
effects. This could contribute to efforts to anticipate natural
pathogens as well as potential man-made threats. A framework for
understanding the movement of pathogens from animal to human hosts would
involve several aspects]{.underline}, including identifying whether
animals and humans share particular cell receptors that would allow for
infection, the intracellular components that would allow viruses to
replicate, and the mechanism of cross-species transmission. [Panelists
also identified the importance of studying single- and double-stranded
RNA and DNA viruses to better understand their replication]{.underline}.
[The U.S. government through DARPA and other funding has sponsored
several efforts to develop tools for anticipating future
pandemics]{.underline}. Nevertheless, such efforts must contend with the
unique attributes of otherwise related pathogens. For instance,
SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes [COVID-19, proved to be
more infectious and more harmful than other coronaviruses.]{.underline}
5 Nevertheless, panelists emphasized that it was too costly an effort to
study all identified viruses to understand potential risks. A more
fruitful approach was to invest in better global biosurveillance to
filter out "signals" from "noise"---that is, to leverage the
capabilities of the global health community to provide credible early
warning when potential pathogens first begin to spread. While there is
national interest in anticipating emerging threats, participants did not
identify a clear path forward for U.S. government efforts. [One
recommendation was that the U.S. Intelligence Community reassess its
standards for confidence when making judgments about potential pandemic
risks. Excessively high confidence requirements for community acceptance
of judgments could]{.underline}, the argument goes, [limit further study
of a potential threat. Another recommendation was to leverage artificial
intelligence and computing capabilities to better mine large data
sources for insight into emergent threats.]{.underline}

[Leading in biotechnology is crucial for many U.S. economic and
strategic goals]{.underline}; however, [the U.S. must balance these with
necessary regulation and oversight.]{.underline} Geopolitical events,
such as global pandemics or great power competition, can also influence
this balancing act. How can leaders strike the right balance to attain
maximal benefit and prosperity for the United States? It was also clear
that professionals in the biological sciences should play a role in
determining this balance, potentially through organizations such as the
National Academies that bridge the scientific and policy communities. 12
[Responsible leadership is a central factor in establishing the
necessary oversight starting at labs and extending to the
intergovernmental sphere. Biotechnology and biosecurity regimes call for
principled leadership that is responsive to scientists, policymakers,
and stakeholders across institutions. Engaged leaders devise whole of
enterprise solutions]{.underline}, an issue noticeably lacking with
COVID-19 and a theme which will certainly appear in the future.
Accordingly, oversight from knowledgeable leaders is a vital force in
crafting policy [that will spur innovation to build trust across
sectors. Leaders and bureaucrats setting the regulatory tone should be
mindful of striking the right balance:]{.underline} scientists who labor
under burdensome regulatory regimes may be stymied in their pursuit of
technological advancement. Leaders should avoid counterproductive
measures such as layers of oversight, redundant paperwork, or a
distrustful culture that hinder scientists' spirit of risk taking or
engagement beyond a stovepiped world. One troubling reality exists: much
of global oversight falls between seams of multinational organizations,
and cooperation from scientists and policymakers is essential to remedy
a dilemma brought further into relief by COVID-19. [There is no
ambiguity on the necessary role of scientific expertise in biosecurity
and biotechnology:]{.underline} to leverage cooperation to play an
outsized role in working beyond the sphere of geopolitical competition.
Panelists were unanimous in scientists' power to work effectively across
borders, to make friends via science. Forging relationships based on
like-minded scientific expertise creates the possibility for the
scientific community to harmonize interests that may sit uneasily
between sparring nations' heads of state. A basis for a Track 2 or 1.5
dialogue between different governments may run through the long-standing
friendships that were cultivated by scientists before the return of
great power competition. Scientist-to-scientist bonds offer policymakers
with a foundation to utilize not only for diplomatic ends, but also in
the possibility of a future global pandemic that necessitates
collaboration. [Scientific relationships will be the cornerstone for
future cooperation, even when the fires of geopolitical competition
flare up.]{.underline} Biotechnological competition with China
represents a rupture from the past and threatens American primacy in
this domain. Chinese policymakers identified biotechnology as a key
space for China to dominate. China's prioritization of biotechnology
meets multiple ends for a state poised to shape geopolitics: Chinese
biosecurity, the nation's economy, and the health of the Chinese people.
[China's strategic whole of nation investment in biotechnology aims to
unseat the United States from its place of historic control over the
material and intellectual production of biotechnology]{.underline}. In a
break from historic competitors, a rival nation-state is pouring
resources into technology development at levels that are comparable with
the United States' publicprivate funding streams. [With the arrival of a
near peer competitor in biotechnology, how should U.S. policymakers
strike the right policy balance?]{.underline} On the one hand,
stakeholders in government, philanthropy, and the private sector cannot
underestimate the magnitude of the challenge. The implications for the
United States extend beyond facing a competitor. China's military-civil
fusion, alongside torrents of state funding, aspires to fuse agents
across China into the mission of overtaking America's global position.
The stakes are clear, and the consequences of losing preeminence for
American biosecurity and economy should not be underestimated. 13 On the
other hand, engagement with Chinese scientists and policymakers should
not be dismissed out of hand. The experts agreed that China should be
encouraged to take up a partnership role in the global biosecurity and
biotechnology architecture. Evidence of Chinese willingness to
participate exist at the institutional and personal level, and the
voices on both sides of the Pacific urging cooperation should not be
squelched. An American whole of enterprise solution to compete with
China can exist in parallel with outreach efforts to prevent future
pandemics. Striking the right balance between engaging and competing
with China will not be easily executed, yet it is a policy solution that
leaders in Beijing and Washington must embrace[. A whole of sector push
to facilitate developing nations' biotechnology and biosecurity
development can garner influence for the United States]{.underline}.
[Developed countries no longer hold a monopoly over biotechnologies.
Developing countries are increasing investments in biotechnology, and
this represents an opportunity for the United States to assert global
leadership.]{.underline} [Leveraging the United States' scientific
expertise to compete against China, shape norms, and usher in a global
regulatory regime is not only a positive series of outcomes. It gestures
to a policy agenda for the America's role in the world's biotechnology
and biosecurity frontier]{.underline}. Nation-state competition is not
the only challenge facing the United States. [A pattern of panic and
neglect historically led policymakers and the public to abandon
investments in biosecurity of the order required to overcome COVID-19
and future pandemics]{.underline}. Institutions that preserve focus on
biosecurity and biotechnology must be built that strike the right
balance between encouraging oversight, elevating scientific expertise,
competing with China, and cooperating internationally. [The United
States' security, health, and economy are tethered to a biotechnological
future that demands attention, not neglect.]{.underline}

#### Funding for the WHO is critical 

**Nature 20** ("Withholding funding from the World Health Organization
is wrong and dangerous, and must be reversed"; Nature; April 17, 2020;
<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01121-1>) Accessed
11/21/21//

[De-funding the WHO is especially dangerous for those low-income
countries in which the agency's work is crucial to maintaining standards
of public-health infrastructure, and also to tackling killer
diseases]{.underline}. The WHO's epidemiologists, clinicians and
logistics personnel are right now overseeing more than 35 emergency
operations, including a measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and a cholera outbreak in Yemen. On top of its emergency
operations, [the WHO handles ongoing efforts to treat tuberculosis and
diabetes; eradicate polio; and study tropical diseases]{.underline}.
This is all on an annual budget of roughly \$2.4 billion. Of this, the
WHO's emergency-response budget is approximately \$280 million. By
contrast, the agency that tackles public-health emergencies in the
United States --- the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention --- has
a total budget of around \$12.7 billion this year. Finding the balance A
pandemic is always a big test for the WHO. In previous health
emergencies, the agency has been criticized for acting too slowly, or
--- in the case of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic --- overstating the
risks. But leading public-health researchers and practitioners agree
that, so far in the current crisis, the agency has offered leadership
and acted according to the evidence it has received. [The WHO was
notified of a cluster of pneumonia cases by China on 31 December, and it
began an emergency-response process the following day. Its many actions
since then include posting and updating guidance on how to diagnose
COVID-19, vetting diagnostic tests and distributing them around the
world. The agency's science division convened world experts to survey
potential therapeutics. From this, it developed an adaptable
clinical-trial protocol, known as SOLIDARITY, that has been launched
globally. More recently, the WHO has set up a supply-chain management
system to try to ensure that low-income countries are not left without
tests, medical equipment or protective gear for health workers --- given
the fierce competition for these limited resources. The WHO declared a
public health emergency of international concern]{.underline}, or PHEIC,
on 30 January. That announcement is a trigger for the agency's member
governments to follow its recommendations. These include establishing a
comprehensive programme of testing, quarantining people suspected to be
infected, and tracing their contacts. Some countries acted quickly,
including Germany, Singapore and South Korea. But the United States is
among those that has not followed these particular recommendations. Even
now, it does not have a national infrastructure for testing for the
virus, nor for tracing the contacts of those infected with it. [In early
March, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleaded with the
world when he said: "You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it
is. That means robust surveillance to find, isolate, test and treat
every case, to break the chains of transmission."]{.underline} But the
[Trump administration chose not to follow the WHO's advice. Instead,
influential lawmakers have been calling for an investigation into the
WHO's actions, claiming that the agency was too slow to sound the alarm
and too deferential to the Chinese government]{.underline}. At the same
time, they are implicating the WHO in wider questions being directed at
China's government. These include that China could have acted more
quickly to lock down in the days after the first outbreak, and that
public officials withheld important information. Such questions must be
asked of China, but they are not for the WHO --- which acts at the
behest of governments --- to answer. And [they are not reasons to
de-fund the agency.]{.underline} It is, of course, crucial that lessons
are learnt from all stages of this pandemic. [Once it is over, there
will be many national and international investigations and inquiries ---
including the WHO's own --- and these will uncover what went right, what
went wrong and what could have been done better. It is always tough to
operate in a pandemic, and tougher still when essential cooperation
between governments is at a low ebb. Such inquiries will be an
opportunity to improve and to grow. They are not a reason to undermine
or attack.]{.underline} This [pandemic needs the world to follow a
coordinated plan, covering decisions including how and when lockdowns
are to be relaxed]{.underline}. It is extraordinary that more than three
months into the outbreak, such a plan is nowhere to be seen. On 19
April, the health ministers of the G20 group of nations will meet
virtually. When they do, they must put such a plan in place. The best
hope of achieving that is for all nations to work with the WHO and other
international agencies. [It is right that researchers, funders and
governments have been protesting against Trump's decision, and they must
continue to do so in the strongest terms. Those in the United States
must also lobby their lawmakers at every level. **The president and his
administration must not withhold funding from the WHO**.]{.underline}
[Doing so will place more lives at risk and ensure that the world takes
longer to emerge from this crisis.]{.underline} Nearly 70 years ago, the
United States was instrumental in helping to establish the WHO. [Nations
realized that they needed such an agency in part because they couldn't
tackle pandemics by acting alone. It is a sad indictment of the state of
our world that the agency is now having to fight for its future while
doing the job it was created to do. We need to support the WHO so it is
at its strongest, not undermine it at such a crucial hour.]{.underline}
