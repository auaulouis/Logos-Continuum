The Alliance's Achievements in Cyber So Far [Over the past fifteen
years, NATO's approach to cyber issues has evolved from addressing cyber
defense in primarily technical terms to viewing it as essential to the
alliance's strategic context]{.underline}. **[The need to "strengthen
capabilities and to defend against cyberattacks" was first acknowledged
by allied leaders at their 2002 summit meetings in
Prague.1]{.underline}**919NATO, Prague Summit Declaration, November 21,
2002. However, [after Estonia's digital infrastructure was hit by
cyberattacks in 2007, NATO admitted that a confrontation between states
might involve a cyber dimension, and at the Bucharest Summit in 2008
adopted its first cyber-defense policy]{.underline}. The 2008 conflict
between Russia and Georgia demonstrated that cyberattacks have the
potential to become a major component of conventional warfare. In
parallel[, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE)]{.underline} was accredited as a NATO Centre of Excellence in
2008. Since then, it [has grown into a strong, international knowledge
hub for cyber defense, bringing together top cyber experts across
fields---government, military, industry, and academia---from 29 nations
for interdisciplinary research, training, and exercises in four focus
areas: technology, strategy, operations, and law. The]{.underline}
[center connects a trusted community of like-minded states who wish to
share information and expertise in cyber security. CCDCOE's best-known
projects are Locked Shields, one of the world's largest and most
comprehensive cyber-defense exercises; the annual cyber conference
CyCon; and the Tallinn Manual, which looks at cyber operations within
the context of international law. At the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago,
allied leaders reaffirmed their commitment to improving the alliance's
cyber defenses by bringing all of NATO's networks under centralized
protection.]{.underline} At the 2014 Wales summit, [**NATO recognized
that international law applies in cyberspace and declared that, since
the impact of a cyberattack could be as harmful to modern societies as a
conventional attack, cyber defense is a part of NATO's collective
defense mandate. Thus, NATO acknowledged that cyberspace is an
operational domain for potential adversaries.** NATO's 2016 Warsaw
summit resulted in a declaration recognizing that cyberspace has evolved
into a separate domain of military operations,]{.underline} in which the
alliance "must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on
land, and at sea." The subsequent roadmap included the drafting of a
NATO cyber operations doctrine, as well as the development of military
cyber capabilities. In January 2020, the Allied Joint Doctrine for
Cyberspace Operations was published "to plan, execute, and assess
cyberspace operations in the context of allied joint
operations."2020NATO, Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations,
January 2020. At the Warsaw summit, [NATO]{.underline} heads of state
and government [signed a Cyber Defence Pledge, in which they outlined
how nations protect their cyber networks]{.underline}. NATO developed
detailed questionnaires and metrics related to the pledge and uses them
to regularly report on how each nation delivers on its cyber
commitments. Allies also discussed how to strengthen the cyber component
of NATO's Command Structure. The Command Structure is the military
backbone of the alliance; it is what makes NATO unique. NATO has
continuously adapted its Command Structure over the past decades to take
account of a changing security environment. In February 2018, NATO
defense ministers established the Cyberspace Operations Centre (CyOC) as
part of NATO's SHAPE Command Structure, with the aim of integrating the
allies' cyber capabilities into NATO military-operations planning. The
"eyes and ears" of the respective commanders in cyberspace, CyOC aims at
enhancing situational awareness in cyberspace and helping integrate
cyber into NATO's planning and operations at all levels. [CyOC is the
first cyber-dedicated entity within the Command Structure. The "eyes and
ears" of the respective commanders in cyberspace, CyOC aims at enhancing
situational awareness in cyberspace and helping integrate cyber into
NATO's planning and operations at all levels.]{.underline} While CyOC
operates within the existing NATO frameworks, its main aim is to equip
the Supreme Allied Commander Europe with any necessary tools to operate
in cyberspace.2121Wiesław Goździewicz, "Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided
Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA)," Cyber Defense, November 11, 2019. As
CyOC moves toward initial then final operating capacity, it will be
critical that it is staffed with sufficient---and sufficiently
expert---personnel.2222NATO, NATO\'s Role in Cyberspace, February 19,
2019. [During NATO's July 2018 summit, the allies affirmed, for the
first time, their determination "to employ the full range of
capabilities, including cyber, to deter, defend against, and counter the
full spectrum of cyber threats," shifting away from securing cyberspace
with defensive measures only.]{.underline} The "full range" of cyber
capabilities means that both defensive and offensive capabilities can be
deployed by NATO, in line with its defensive mandate and in accordance
with international law. As NATO will not develop or acquire any
offensive capabilities, it will rely, like in other operational domains,
on the voluntary contributions of allies. [In late 2020, a team of
experts appointed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and chaired
by Thomas de Maiziere of Germany and Wes Mitchell of the United States
gave their recommendations on how NATO could enhance its political role
and better coordinate military tasks and political strategies among its
members. In 2021, Stoltenberg's NATO 2030 included eight of those
recommendations to guide the revision of NATO's Strategic
Concept.23]{.underline}

#### The link is not unique or NATO's quantum and DIANA plans should have caused the impact -- affects entire emerging tech sector

**Naujokaityte and Burke 22** - Goda Naujokaitytė and Fintan Burke are
frequent contributors to Science\|Business and emerging technology
analysts, \[*"NATO to launch €1B fund for high tech start-ups in dual
use technologies,\"* Science\|Business, 4/1/2022,
https://sciencebusiness.net/news/nato-launch-eu1b-fund-high-tech-start-ups-dual-use-technologies\]RA

[NATO has launched a new research programme called DIANA to bring
industry, start-up companies and academia together to research new
dual-use technologies that address both societal problems and national
security issues. The Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic (DIANA) is focusing on technologies such as artificial
intelligence, big data processing, quantum-enabled technologies,
autonomy, biotechnology, novel materials and space.]{.underline} In its
initial stage[, DIANA will run a network of more than 10 accelerator
sites and over 50 test centres in innovation hubs across NATO alliance
countries.]{.underline} [The aim is to give innovators the means to
bring dual use technologies closer to the market. No budget for the
network has been announced yet, but pilot activities will start as early
as summer 2023, with the aim of being fully up and running in 2025.
There is also a complementary €1 billion venture capital fund for early
stage start-ups.]{.underline} Tomas Jermalavičius, head of studies at
the Estonia-based think tank International Centre for Defence and
Security (ICDS), says this marks a notable shift in the alliance's
stance on innovation. "[It's almost a revolutionary step. Creating this
NATO structure shows flexibility and ability to take advantage of all
the capacities that exist in the private sector, where innovations are
born]{.underline}," he said. [Until this point, the alliance has only
supported applied research through the Collaboration Support Office in
Paris, leaving a gap in support for translating technologies to the
market.]{.underline} The bid to spruce up its innovation capabilities
predates the Russian invasion and was agreed on at the 2021 NATO Summit
in Brussels. The fleshed out plans for DIANA were published last week,
following a meeting of NATO defence ministers. This is not the only
military research announcement to pop up in the past weeks, with the US,
Australia and UK setting out the AUKUS Quantum arrangement which eyes
expanded quantum, hypersonic and other joint weapons research.
Technology dominance [**The nine technologies NATO wants to advance are
AI; data and computing; autonomy; quantum-enabled technologies;
biotechnology and human enhancements; hypersonic technologies; space;
novel materials and manufacturing; and energy and propulsion.** These
are all strategic for NATO if it is to maintain technological dominance.
Losing grip was one of the drivers for DIANA]{.underline}, Jermalavičius
says. [The bid for technology dominance over countries like China and
Russia is also a driver for DIANA's goal of shortening the technology
development cycle, especially when it comes to software, AI and
quantum.]{.underline} "It's a long horizon, but capabilities do not
appear overnight," said Jermalavičius. The plan is for DIANA to launch
challenge calls for non-dilutive financing that does not require
start-ups to give up equity or ownership in their company. Mentoring,
technology testing and potential contract opportunities will be
available to go hand in hand with the financing. This will be delivered
through network of innovation hubs across the alliance. One such site is
the Big Data for Smart Society Institute (GATE) based in Bulgaria. An
official at GATE said that the institute's work in DIANA will focus on
digital health, intra governmental communications and using data in
industry and city infrastructure. One focus will be on disinformation
research. However the official noted [DIANA is still in its early
stages]{.underline}. Talks are ongoing with NATO to flesh out exactly
how cooperation will work between research centres, the national
government, and the NATO secretariat. The approved charter stipulates
some details, though others are still to be discussed, for example the
affiliated centres of the network and the points of contact between
them. [The official said that many of these are likely to be finalised
at a meeting at the end of June.]{.underline} Host institutions Last
week, **[the UK and Estonia were announced as the hosts of the European
part of DIANA.]{.underline}** The Estonian accelerator will be based in
Tallinn, while Imperial College London will host the UK headquarters at
its Translation & Innovation Hub, from where the Institute for Security
Science and Technology will lead Imperial's work in DIANA. The UK
headquarters is also supported by the UK Defence and Security
Accelerator (DASA), which funds projects that have uses in defence and
security. The accelerator works with major defence companies and the US
Department of Defence's Tri-Service Office. [The UK and Estonian
accelerators are to support start-ups working on dual-use technologies
with funding and expertise.]{.underline} Researchers will also be able
to use facilities such as the Defence BattleLab in Dorset, UK, a test
centre that has air and sea ranges to test defence equipment. A DASA
representative said research at the UK headquarters is likely to focus
first on AI and autonomy, which is a focus of DIANA as a whole. Over
time the UK site could to expand into biotechnology and materials. Nine
accelerators are foreseen in Portugal, UK, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia,
Italy, Turkey, Greece, and Czech Republic. Most European NATO members
will host test sites, of which there will be 47 in total, except for
France, Lithuania, and five Balkan countries, Slovenia, Croatia,
Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia. Quantum in Denmark **[Denmark
is leading DIANA's quantum bid, with an accelerator to be located at the
Niels Bohr Institute at Copenhagen University]{.underline}**. The
Technical University of Denmark, Aarhus University and the Danish
National Metrology Institute will also provide test centres and
manufacturing facilities. For now, the goal is to augment the overall
quantum capacities in the alliance, rather than focus on dual-use
technologies. "The main mission here is to augment the entire NATO
alliance within quantum technology," said Jan Westenkær Thomsen, head of
the Niels Bohr Institute. [Denmark has been one of the leaders in
quantum physics since the 1920s,]{.underline} when Bohr and his
colleague Max Planck put forward the quantum theory. This deep expertise
in quantum has resulted in many spin out companies, Thomsen noted. In
the coming months, Thomsen and his colleagues will be hashing out the
details of the centre with NATO. One of the universities' goals is to
use the know how of Denmark's biotechnology accelerator at the
Copenhagen Bio Science Park to reinforce the quantum counterpart. [There
will also be cooperation with other DIANA centres.]{.underline} "This
was already an integral part. I'm hoping this will be a main theme in
negotiations with NATO," said Thomsen. Thomsen hopes the DIANA project
will start delivering in five to ten years time, and he is positive
about its potential. "It's of course difficult to say at this stage, but
it's a great idea to pull resources from the whole NATO alliance
together," he said. "I'm pretty sure this will really change something
for the better." Multi-sovereign venture capital Before DIANA is up and
running, the €1 billion Innovation Fund is expected to start making
awards to start-ups developing dual-use technologies at the beginning of
next year. **[NATO says the fund will be, "the world's first
multi-sovereign venture capital fund".]{.underline}** It will be a
patient investor, giving companies uninterrupted support for 15 years to
scale up innovations. [NATO also intends to invest in the funds of
venture capital firms that are already investing in technologies the
alliance wants to promote.]{.underline}

### No Link -- generic/no burden sharing

#### Their burden sharing arguments are wrong -- all countries benefit from NATO stability

**Kupochan 19** -- Charles Kupochan is Professor of International
Affairs at Georgetown University and a Senior Fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations, \[*\"NATO Is Thriving in Spite of Trump,\"* Mar 20,
2019, Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-03-20/nato-thriving-spite-trump\]

Trump's diatribes are not the only cause of the unease[. A broadening
chorus of realist strategists claims that the United States is overdue
for]{.underline} a major strategic [retrenchment and that it is past
time for Europe to tend its own garden]{.underline}. Even staunch
defenders of NATO express doubts about its future. Some worry that the
growing U.S. preoccupation with East Asia will lure the United States
away from its Atlantic calling and generate transatlantic tensions over
how to deal with the rise of China. Others fear that democratic
backsliding among members is compromising the alliance's values-based
solidarity. Close NATO watchers are concerned that EU efforts to more
deeply integrate European foreign and defense policy could ultimately
weaken the Atlantic link. And debate rages on both sides of the Atlantic
as to whether NATO enlargement has enhanced or eroded European stability
and whether to continue expansion despite the costs to the West's
relationship with Russia. [These worries are unwarranted]{.underline}:
[NATO at 70 is actually in remarkably good shape]{.underline}. [Yes,
European allies have been laggards on defense spending]{.underline}, and
some members---Hungary, Poland, and Turkey in particular---have
tarnished democratic credentials. [But NATO has demonstrated an
impressive ability to adapt to the changing geopolitical
environment]{.underline} since the Cold War's end, [ensuring that the
United States and Europe remain each other's go-to
partners]{.underline}. The alliance opened its doors to the new
democracies that emerged from the former Soviet bloc, helping to anchor
security and democracy in a wider Europe. Since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014, members have taken important steps to strengthen
deterrence against the Kremlin's adventurism. NATO has struck
partnerships across the globe and carried out ambitious missions well
beyond the territory of member states---most notably in the Balkans,
Afghanistan, and Libya. All the while, [the alliance has retooled to
address new hazards such as cyberthreats, terrorism, hybrid warfare, and
migration]{.underline}. Precisely because NATO has been so nimble and
effective, it enjoys strong political support on both sides of the
Atlantic, leaving Trump virtually alone as a vociferous critic.

### No Link --Russia

#### Political competition and perceived anti-Russian sentiment drives Russian diplomacy, NATO's not key

This assumption contradicts events of recent months and the historical
record. While Vladimir Putin has claimed that his goal is keeping
Ukraine out of NATO, he also insisted that he was just conducting
military exercises. Instead, he is invading Ukraine again. He likewise
insisted in 2014 that he wasn't capturing Crimea, despite the presence
of his unidentified "Little Green Men" and his subsequent annexation of
the peninsula, or that he was not fighting in Ukraine's Donbas area in
the east all these years, despite all evidence to the contrary. [There
is no reason to take Putin at his word. His Feb. 21 diatribe conferring
Russian recognition of independence for the two eastern Ukrainian
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and his order for Russian troops to move
in as ostensible "peacekeepers" shows clearly his disdain for diplomatic
resolutions.]{.underline} Moreover, **[this is not even primarily about
NATO.]{.underline}** NATO's eastward expansion may have played a role in
straining the relationship between Russia and the West, but mainly
because, for Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly abandon it for the
greener pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung. However, [Putin's
rhetoric and actions over almost two decades reveal that his goals
extend beyond imposing neutrality on Ukraine or even staving off further
NATO expansion.]{.underline} **[The larger objective is to re-establish
Russian political and cultural dominance over a nation that Putin sees
as one with Russia, and then follow up by undoing the European
rules-based order and security architecture established in the aftermath
of World War II.]{.underline}** Given these goals, Ukrainian neutrality
is a woefully insufficient concession for Putin. [If Russia's main
concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have reacted with rhetoric
and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after each step in the NATO
expansion process.]{.underline} [The largest wave of NATO's eastward
expansion took place in March 2004,]{.underline} when seven Eastern
European countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic states.
Russia "grumbled," as the New York Times put it then, by adopting a Duma
resolution criticizing the expansion, but [no hostile and sustained
rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement as a Western plot against
Russian interests.]{.underline} In 1997, [Ukraine's President Leonid
Kuchma signed the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and
Ukraine, and in 2002, he publicly declared Ukraine's interest in NATO
membership, to little opposition from Russia]{.underline}. The NATO
membership issue has ebbed-and-flowed within Ukraine, as presidents
alternated in power who were either more pro-Western or more
pro-Russian. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko advocated during his
2005-2010 tenure for Ukraine to be granted a NATO membership action plan
(MAP), a program of preparation for entry into the alliance, while
successor President Viktor Yanukovych backed away from the idea after
2010. Russia did not respond to any of these pro-NATO moves by Ukrainian
presidents with military threats and aggression. [Russia knows further
NATO expansion to the east is highly improbable because certain alliance
members have long balked at the prospect]{.underline}, making the
required consensus impossible to attain. [Russia also has an
authoritarian ally within NATO, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán,
who can help stave off any future consensus]{.underline}, and other NATO
members such as Germany and France do not support membership for
Ukraine, Georgia, or other post-Soviet states. [The security guarantee
that Russia demands now goes much further than membership
issues]{.underline}. Putin's Feb. 21 speech shows he perceives any
security cooperation between Ukraine and NATO, from modernization of
airports to training exercises, as a "knife to \[Russia's\] throat."
Even after a new pro-Western government in Ukraine that followed the
2014 incursions again embraced the goal of NATO membership and Ukrainian
public support for such a move rose, Ukraine's accession was that much
more unlikely because of the alliance's reluctance to embrace new
members embroiled in territorial disputes**[. If Putin's main concern
now was to keep Ukraine out of NATO, he had nothing to fear in 2014,
when he first invaded Ukraine and had even less to fear in 2021, when he
embarked on the current escalation.]{.underline}** If Not NATO, What is
Putin's Escalation About? A longer look at [Putin's]{.underline} two
decades in power shows that, above all, he [fears political competition
in the neighborhood.]{.underline} W[hen mass protests over rigged
elections swept across the post-Soviet space in 2003-2005,]{.underline}
toppling the Georgian and Kyrgyz incumbents and preventing the
pro-Russian candidate from taking office in Ukraine, [the Kremlin
exploded with fiery rhetoric about Western-backed anti-Russian
plots.]{.underline} A recent book on conspiracy theories in the Russian
media since 1995 shows that the 2003-2005 "color revolutions" were the
top source of conspiratorial, anti-Western narratives. All 1997-2002
NATO enlargement summits are lower in the ranking of analyzed events.
American realists have long argued that Russia was too weak to strike
back with actions, but evidence shows that the Kremlin did not react
with strong rhetoric either. [Instead of decrying NATO expansion, Russia
prioritized complaints about Western political "meddling" in its
neighboring countries, by which Russia meant U.S. and European support
for domestic democratization drives.]{.underline} In 2014, when Russia
annexed Crimea and instigated an armed insurgency in eastern Ukraine,
NATO membership for Ukraine hadn't even been on the agenda. Rather, the
spark for Russia was the ouster of the increasingly authoritarian
pro-Russian President Yanukovych, following months of street protests.
Those "Euromaidan" protests had erupted after Yanukovych backpeddled,
following pressure and bribery from Russia, from signing a trade
agreement with the European Union. So why was 2014 so concerning to
Russia that it chose to invade[? Given Putin's rhetoric]{.underline}
about Euromaidan as a Western-backed plot, [the most obvious conclusion
is that he was afraid that regime change and democratization in Ukraine
might reach]{.underline} -- -- [or at least set an example for ---
Russian society and destabilize Putin's increasingly consolidated
authoritarianism]{.underline}. Research on the color revolutions and on
the third wave of democratization in the region shows that this
neighborhood effect was real. In other words, **[it's not NATO at its
doorsteps that's so concerning to the Kremlin, but political
competition, because it threatens authoritarian stability and introduces
prospects of democratization.]{.underline}**

United States Institute of Peace,
https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/03/china-not-russia-taiwan-not-ukraine\]RA

China Is Not Russia Russia under Putin has repeatedly dispatched its
armed forces for combat missions overseas to a range of countries,
including Georgia, Syria and Ukraine, as well as conducted major
military interventions against other states, most recently Kazakhstan
(albeit at the invitation of that country's president). [Moscow has also
actively supported armed groups and militias in some of these same
countries and others.]{.underline} [Although China has also been active
and assertive in the use of its armed forces beyond its borders in
recent years,]{.underline} **[Beijing has eschewed large-scale combat
operations]{.underline}**. Around its periphery, China has engaged in
provocations, confrontations and even violent clashes[. But
China,]{.underline} unlike Russia, [has refrained from massive
interventions, invasions or occupations of other countries since it
invaded Vietnam in 1979. China's largest deployments of troops overseas
in the post-Cold War era have been on U.N. Peacekeeping
missions.]{.underline} Whereas Russia has more than 20 military
installations beyond its borders, to date, **[China has only one
official military base on foreign soil]{.underline}** --- in Djibouti
(established in 2017) --- and a handful of other facilities it does not
formally acknowledge. Of course[, Beijing has a history of using its
potent armed forces and muscular coercive apparatus within China's
borders]{.underline} to repress vigorously peaceful protesters,
political dissidents and disaffected ethnic minority peoples. The
locations of these operations include Beijing, Tibet and Xinjiang, as
well as Hong Kong. China has also not hesitated to employ armed force
and a wide array of coercive instruments around its periphery. This
includes building roads and bunkers in remote frontier areas of the high
Himalayas along its contested border with India and constructing
artificial islands and military installations in disputed waters of the
South China Sea. In recent years, [China's armed forces have also
engaged in deadly clashes and violent confrontations with Indian army
units along the disputed Line of Actual Control and harassed and rammed
the fishing boats and coast guard vessels of Vietnam, the Philippines
and other countries.]{.underline} Putin appears to relish projecting the
image of a strongman who is routinely willing to thumb his nose at the
rest of the world. By contrast, Xi --- at least to date --- has mainly
sought to cultivate a statesmanlike image on the global stage. At times
he has given speeches attempting to cast China as a more responsible,
less meddlesome and values-free version of the United States. And Xi has
invested a lot of time and resources in promoting a set of high-profile
international efforts intended to demonstrate that China is a
constructive and proactive great power. Employing positive rhetoric
touting "win-win" solutions and aspirations to build a "community with a
shared future for mankind," [China under Xi's leadership has launched
ambitious efforts such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Putin, by contrast, has made no
real effort to offer an alternative to U.S. global leadership beyond
delivering vague grandiose declarations]{.underline} (often in tandem
with Xi) and has offered the world little in the way of economic
stimulus beyond the prospect of more energy exports and hype about the
Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Despite consisting of only a handful of
Soviet successor states, the EAEU is touted as Russia's answer to
China's BRI. In terms of geostrategic activism, Russia's major
multilateralist initiatives have tended to involve China. These include
the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 and
the formation of the BRICS grouping in 2010. The former is a security
community with a Central Asian focus consisting of Russia, China and
four Central and two South Asian states. The latter is a loose
association of some of the world's largest "emerging economies": Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa. However, Moscow's most
significant geostrategic maneuver under Putin has been to strengthen
Russia's strategic partnership with China. Both Beijing and Moscow
insist that their relationship is not an alliance and their 2001 treaty
of friendship --- which was renewed in 2021 --- does not commit either
signatory to come to the defense of the other in case of military
conflict. Yet, the Sino-Russian relationship is a clearly consequential
alignment that has grown closer in recent years, particularly as their
respective relationships with the United States have deteriorated.
[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put China in a very uncomfortable
position: Beijing does not want to antagonize Moscow but neither does it
want to damage its relations with Washington and European
capitals.]{.underline} Consequently, China has equivocated in its
statements and actions. [Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for
peace but has stopped short of condemning Russia or calling upon Moscow
to withdraw its military.]{.underline} The lengthy joint statement of
February 4, 2022, issued by Putin and Xi during the Russian leader's
visit to Beijing on the eve of the Winter Olympics, makes no mention at
all of Ukraine --- and [China has pointedly abstained on all U.N.
Security Council resolutions related to Russia's invasion. Xi appears to
have asked Putin to delay any military action against Ukraine until
after the Olympics.]{.underline} Russia's invasion poses other
difficulties for China both in terms of running counter to Beijing's
long espoused principles in foreign affairs and its adverse impact on
China's national interests in Ukraine. Russia's actions clearly
contradict China's cornerstone foreign policy principles of
noninterference in other countries' affairs and respecting territorial
integrity. Moreover, China has sizable economic investments in Ukraine
and is a good customer of Ukraine's armaments industry. In 2020, Ukraine
signed the BRI cooperation agreement, which further bolstered the
economic relationship between the two countries and marked Ukraine as an
important partner in Beijing's signature foreign policy and economic
initiative. [**Taiwan Is Not Ukraine** The fact that Ukraine is not a
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was almost
certainly a decisive factor in Putin's calculus to invade
Ukraine.]{.underline} Russia's commander in chief knew that his invading
forces would likely not have to contend with the militaries of any other
countries. And if there were any lingering doubts in the Kremlin about
the disposition of the most powerful member of NATO, U.S. President Joe
Biden stated publicly that the United States would not send military
forces to help defend Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Biden administration
has taken strong steps to reinforce NATO allies in Eastern Europe and
provide robust military assistance to Ukraine. By contrast, [Xi and his
Politburo colleagues have long been convinced that Taiwan has the
resolute support of the world's most capable military.]{.underline} [The
People's Liberation Army]{.underline} --- as all branches of China's
armed forces are known --- [continues to assume that if it launches an
invasion of Taiwan, the U.S. military will swiftly and decisively
intervene.]{.underline} **[The U.S.-Taiwan relationship, while
technically "unofficial" due to the One China policy, has strengthened
in recent years.]{.underline}** On February 28, the Biden administration
sent an unofficial delegation of former U.S. defense and national
security officials to Taiwan as a signal to China of that commitment.
[It remains true that the greatest deterrence to a massive Chinese
military attack on the island is Beijing's assumption that war with
Taiwan also means a war with the United States.]{.underline} However,
**[there is no formal military alliance between the United States and
Taiwan]{.underline}**. [The defense pact binding Washington to Taipei
was formally abrogated in 1979.]{.underline} So why is Beijing convinced
that Washington has an ironclad alliance-like relationship with Taiwan?
There are at least two reasons. First, successive U.S. administrations
have publicly committed themselves to support Taiwan against Chinese
aggression and have regularly sold arms to the island's armed forces.
Second, although there is no language in the1979 Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) that explicitly commits the United States to come to Taiwan's
defense in the event of an attack on the island by China, many in
Washington believe that such a commitment exists. While there are
different interpretations as to what the TRA means, the most significant
fact is that the vast majority of U.S. political and military leaders
are fully convinced that this legislation binds the United States to a
de facto alliance with Taiwan. [China's increased military assertiveness
and greater level of armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait and
elsewhere around China's periphery in recent years have only served to
strengthen the conviction in Washington that the island is a staunch
democratic partner worthy of U.S. support as it tries to defend tiny
Taiwan against efforts by Beijing to coerce the island into unwanted
unification with China.]{.underline} However, [Taiwan]{.underline},
unlike Ukraine, [is not a member of the United Nation]{.underline}.
While Ukraine has ambassador-level diplomatic relations with more than
180 countries, including China and the United States, Taiwan only has
full diplomatic ties with approximately a dozen countries and none of
these are major powers. Yet, thanks to the TRA, Taipei enjoys robust
quasi-diplomatic relations with Washington, and thanks to Taiwan's
pragmatic ingenuity, the island possesses a vibrant worldwide network of
de facto diplomatic missions. [Although Ukraine's diplomatic standing is
far superior to Taiwan's, the European country's military alliance
status is less impressive]{.underline} --- Ukraine is not a member of
NATO, although it is a very active member of NATO's Partnership for
Peace initiative. While Taiwan also has no formal military allies, the
island has several close and consequential security partners, most
notably the United States.

How the United States Should Compete Today [The United States is
competing with China in technology with one hand tied behind its back.78
While the United States has leading technology companies, the government
is underperforming in its role as a critical catalyst of S&T
innovation]{.underline}. The federal government has played a more active
role in protectionist measures relating to Chinese tech in recent years,
including export controls, investment screening, and executive orders
banning Chinese firms, but the government has yet to bring to bear its
substantial tools to help stoke the fires of American innovation. For
the first time in nearly a century, the United States confronts a
strategic rival that is capable of overtaking it as the world's leading
economic, military, and technological power, and one that is
economically entangled with the United States. [Policymakers in Congress
and the White House need to recalibrate U.S. government involvement in
the country's innovation ecosystem to maximize advantages and
opportunities and to successfully address the challenges that the United
States will face in the global technology contest.]{.underline} The
nature of this competition is fundamentally different from what America
has faced since the 1940s. For the first time in nearly a century the
United States confronts a strategic rival that is capable of overtaking
it as the world's leading economic, military, and technological power,
and one that is economically entangled with the United States. [China is
leveraging comprehensive state-directed efforts such as Made in China
2025, Standards 2035, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Digital Silk
Road to guide its technology development at home and push its goals of
making Chinese technology and technology standards dominant
worldwide.]{.underline} Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian
President Vladimir Putin attend a meeting during the Belt and Road
International Forum, an initiative aimed at pursuing dominance in a
number of key technology areas. The United States must respond with
policies that focus on research and development, patenting, and standard
setting. (The Russian Presidential Press and Information
Office/Wikimedia) [The hallmarks of these initiatives include strategic
goals and plans backed with substantial financial resources for R&D,
patenting, and standard setting.]{.underline} [Neither the United States
nor any of the tech-leading democracies has anything equivalent, setting
the stage for an uneven competition where Beijing is better positioned
to have the upper hand over the long term]{.underline}. This is not to
say the United States should emulate China's top-down approach. Many
aspects of China's approach, such as the creation and promotion of
national champions; the coddling of inefficient state-owned enterprises;
export subsidies, forced technology transfers, and other illiberal trade
practices; and the lack of accountability and oversight are anathema to
the American system. At the same time, Beijing's policies have had
impressive results. China is the world's largest trader, accounting for
12.4 percent of global trade in 2018.79 [China's R&D spending has grown
at an average of 15 percent annually since 1998. It is on track to
overtake the United States in total R&D spending by the mid-2020s and is
at the forefront of foundational technologies such as AI, 5G, and
quantum computing.80]{.underline} The U.S. response has been largely
protectionist and unilateral, focused on export controls, tariffs, and
repatriation of manufacturing, while R&D spending remains flat as a
percentage of GDP and policies to attract and retain high-skilled
foreigners become increasingly restrictive. American policymakers must
emphasize what is lacking so far: the proactive policies American
policymakers can put in place to bolster America's ability to
outcompete. [To effectively compete with China, the United States needs
a technology strategy for the 21st century and a new approach to
multilateral cooperation and collaboration. **The United States has an
unmatched strategic advantage over China in this technology competition:
a global network of allies and partners.**]{.underline} **[Harnessing
this network for multilateral collaboration is critical to the success
of a national technology strategy.]{.underline}** [The United States
does not enjoy a monopoly over the technologies that will drive the
21st-century economy, but the United States also does not have to go it
alone]{.underline}. [**By partnering with other tech-leading nations,
the United States and its allies and partners can bring far more
financial and human resources to bear in this competition than China can
alone.** Opportunities for multinational collaboration on technology
policy abound. The United States could look to existing groupings such
as the Five Eyes, the National Technology and Industrial Base, and the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to enhance such
collaboration.]{.underline} There are also proposals to create new
groupings: U.K. government officials have proposed a "Democracy 10" to
tackle 5G and other technology issues; and former U.S. government
officials have proposed alliance frameworks to tackle a range of
technology policy issues.81 A recent CNAS report by an international
group of researchers lays out what countries should comprise such a
grouping, how it should be organized and structured, how it should
function, and what its top priorities should be.82 Recommendations A
strategy's success hinges on implementation. No expression of strategic
direction is complete without actionable recommendations. As the initial
framing document for a series of publications that will define and
outline a U.S. national technology strategy, this report lays out the
four pillars that comprise the actions necessary to execute it. The
pillars are to promote America's ability to compete; protect key U.S.
technological advantages; partner with allies to maximize success; and
plan effectively to reevaluate and adjust the strategy as needed. This
section offers recommendations for each pillar. They include the highest
priority actions U.S. policymakers should undertake to safeguard
long-term U.S. technological competitiveness. It is by no means an
exhaustive list. Rather, it is an opening salvo meant to underscore the
scope and scale of the challenge, highlight the urgency with which the
United States must act, and stimulate ideas for a broader set of
necessary actions. Taken together, these pillars and the recommendations
that underpin them are guidelines for a 21st-century industrial policy.
The American experience with industrial policy throughout its history
shows that it is beneficial and necessary to have government involvement
in technology development and that it is feasible to do so in a manner
that encourages rather than constrains innovations by the private
sector. The recommendations that follow are crafted with that spirit in
mind and are the baseline for American success in the global technology
competition. Promote America's Capacity to Compete The U.S. government
needs to take comprehensive and urgent action to lay the groundwork for
long-term and comprehensive structural improvements to its science and
technology base. There are four categories of recommendations to promote
U.S. competitiveness: 1. Increase investments in research and
development in the United States. While tech-leading countries around
the world have increased their R&D spending, the United States has kept
steady as a percentage of GDP for decades. The U.S. share of global R&D
fell from 69 percent in 1960 to 28 percent in 2016.83 During that
period, the share of R&D investments by the federal government shrank by
more than half, meaning that private industry is now driving R&D to a
much greater extent. In response, Congress should act by: Raising
federal government spending on R&D to at least 2 percent of GDP by 2030,
up from around 0.7 percent in 2020. This spending is critically
important to maintaining long-term capacity for technological leadership
and innovation. The U.S. government remains the largest funder of basic
research, which is foundational to game-changing technological
achievements.84 Promoting an increase of total national (public and
private) R&D expenditures to at least 4.5 percent of GDP by 2030, from
under 3 percent in 2020, to keep in line with other leading technology
nations. Tax incentives, targeted grants and contracts, and prize
competitions all serve to stimulate private-sector investments.

[NATO brought peace to the most violent continent on the planet by
binding its states together in a collective security pact that forbid
them from fighting each other and committed them to coming to one
another's defense.]{.underline} In this way, the emphasis on [NATO as a
hedge against Russian aggression]{.underline} overlooks its role in
bringing peace to its member states and gives the false impression of a
zero-sum relationship wherein Russia can win only if Europe loses. Since
its establishment in 1949, NATO has created a hedge against potential
Russian aggression[, but it is far from its only purpose.]{.underline}
In keeping Europeans from killing one another, [NATO opened the
continent to trade and the free movement of peoples, thereby paving the
way for the European Union]{.underline}, as Timothy Andrew Sayle points
out in his epic history of NATO, Enduring Alliance. [It made
social-democratic institutions like universal health insurance and paid
family leave possible by sharing the costs of defense among a multitude
of states.]{.underline} [It helped spread democracy by demonstrating
that democracies are safe and secure, prosperous and peaceful, in their
relations with one another. Thus, an ever increasing array of states
sought entry into the club of wealthy democracies as a refuge from
violence and disorder. And in bringing such a diversity of peoples
together, NATO helped transform some of the most militaristic and
nationalistic societies in the world into some of its most peaceful and
cosmopolitan.]{.underline} In this way, [it probably also played a part
in transforming colonial regimes like Britain and France, Portugal and
Spain, into normal nation states.]{.underline} If the vast majority of
us have forgotten what a danger European states were to one another and
how militaristic European societies could be, it is largely due to the
way collective security arrangements allowed them to let their guards
down. Thus, [the idea that NATO is an imperialistic military
organization bent on expansion misses the point.]{.underline} NATO was
always a critical hedge against the Soviet Union, but when the Berlin
Wall fell it remained essential to the institutional architecture at the
heart of the European Union. Its [abandonment would have come coupled
with dramatic increases in military budgets and corresponding decreases
in social safety net programs.]{.underline} And it would have [brought
about the remilitarization of Europe's most vulnerable states, which it
would have set on a quest for new protectors, thereby spurring the
creation of new power blocks. **In so doing, it might have spelled an
end to the fledgling European Dream.**]{.underline} Of course,
[collective security pacts also send a signal to would be aggressors
that if they ever did attack, they would be up against several states at
once, and in the case of NATO dozens.]{.underline} [But NATO has been an
astonishingly peaceful military pact.]{.underline} Over the course of
its near three-quarters of a century existence, it has carried out only
three military interventions, a statebuilding mission in Afghanistan,
and a small counter-terrorism operation in Iraq[. It stopped the Bosnian
Genocide]{.underline}, which had already killed well over hundred
thousand people, through a limited bombing campaign in 1995, which
killed only 27 civilians. [It halted the ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo]{.underline}, which threatened to displace hundreds of thousands
of people, through a more extensive bombing campaign in 1999, which
according to Human Rights Watch killed up to 529 Serbian civilians.
Finally, [NATO helped bring down the Gaddafi regime]{.underline} after
he embarked on the most intensive killing spree of any leader in the
Arab Spring and then threatened to go "door to door" hunting down the
rest. According to Libya's own ambassador to the United Nations, who
Secretary General Ban Ki Moon described as begging the U.N. to intervene
in an unprecedented display of sobbing before the General Assembly,
Gaddafi had just given the signal for his troops to commit genocide.
According to Gallup, 75 percent of Libyans told pollsters a year after
the intervention that they had wanted NATO to intervene, in spite of the
intervention having killed 60 civilians, according to the UN Human
Rights council. It was only three years later in 2014, following the
degeneration of the world order brought about by Putin's unanswered
theft of the Crimea and Assad's unanswered obliteration of his own
country, that Britain and France would allow the Libyan statebuilding
mission to fall apart as the country slipped into civil war. All in all,
over the course of its three-quarter century history, [NATO military
missions were probably directly responsible for less than a thousand
civilian deaths spread out over three humanitarian
interventions]{.underline}, the vast majority of which involved a state
that is now an associate of NATO, which is on track for entry into the
European Union in three years. [The only other major campaign it engaged
in was a humanitarian mission in Afghanistan]{.underline}, where member
states mostly helped with statebuilding, police trainings, financial
management, and the provision of aid following the United States'
unilateral invasion in 2001. In a remarkable act of coordination, NATO
member states each took on a different element of the statebuilding
mission in Afghanistan, with only the United Kingdom engaging in heavy
fighting in one small province, which they had committed to keeping
secure. [If these campaigns are remembered as being vastly more violent,
and if a narrative has emerged that sees NATO as an expansionist
imperial force, it is mostly because NATO missions are often confused in
our collective memory with those of the United States and the former
empires of Europe.]{.underline} It is also the result of Russian
propaganda, which claims a "sphere of influence" tied to its former
imperial possessions, many of which have joined NATO. And this points to
another misunderstanding about how NATO actually works. [Potential
members request to join it, and far from being pressured, they have to
demonstrate a commitment to democracy and the rule of law if they are to
be let in. States have the right to join whatever international
associations they want, and spheres of influence are a dated claim
seldom invoked today outside of the Putin regime and Trump
administration.]{.underline} Meanwhile, states on the periphery of
Russia have a better reason for seeking entry into NATO than ever
before. Yet, in overlooking the way collective security pacts foster the
peaceful relations and prosperity of their member states, we help foster
a narrative that sees NATO as an expansionist military organization
locked in a zero-sum competition with Russia. Yet, [Russians will only
win when they establish genuinely democratic institutions, the rule of
law, and the domestic respect for human rights]{.underline}. [If Putin
has overplayed his hand as much as it seems, they might soon find
themselves lining up for NATO membership as well]{.underline}. And if
that turns out to be the case, it would not be a reason to disband NATO
but rather extend the order it has brought to Europe to Russia as well.
[This vision of a liberal internationalist order, wherein democratic
states extend the rule of law and a respect for human rights to an ever
increasing array of voluntary members, may appear utopian amid the
threats and crimes against humanity of autocrats today. But it is no
more fantastic than the "European Dream" of a peaceful continent of
democratic states would have appeared at the end of the Second World
War.]{.underline} Stranger things have been known to occur than
democracy breaking out following the downfall of fascist strongmen and
peace breaking out after war.Published 2 weeks ago on June 4, 2022By

A VALUABLE ALLIANCE NATO is entering its eighth decade in quite good
health because it succeeds admirably in advancing the shared interests
of its members. Russian aggression in Ukraine has brought back into
focus NATO's traditional mission of territorial defense. At its 2016
summit, NATO took the prudent step of deploying combat-ready battalions
in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. The United States has
augmented its presence on the eastern flank, and the Trump
administration has agreed to increase spending on European defense and
deploy additional U.S. troops on the continent. At its 2018 summit, NATO
established two new commands to enhance the security of maritime
connections between North America and Europe and improve force mobility
within Europe. [NATO helped end ethnic conflict in the
Balkans]{.underline} in the 1990s [and has kept troops there ever since

What Trump fails to understand is that [the disparity in spending, with
the U.S. paying more than its allies, is not a bug of the system. It is
a feature. This is how the great postwar statesmen designed it, and this
immensely foresighted strategy has ensured the absence of great power
conflict---and nuclear war---for three-quarters of a
century.]{.underline} [The open, liberal world order we know today was
built in the wake of World War II and expanded after the collapse of the
Soviet Union]{.underline}. **[By design, it is led by the United States;
by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military hegemony over Eurasia
while uniting Europe under the U.S.' protection.]{.underline}** [The
goal of this American grand strategy is to prevent any single power from
dominating the region and turning on the United States and its allies.
American hegemony serves, too, to quell previously intractable regional
rivalries, preventing further world wars.]{.underline} Dean Acheson,
George Marshall and the other great statesmen of their generation
pursued this strategy because they had learned, at unimaginable cost,
that [the eternal American fantasy of forever being free of
Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in other words---was just
that: a fantasy.]{.underline} Four hundred thousand American men lost
their lives in the European theaters of the First and Second World Wars.
(American fatalities in all of the other 20th-century
conflicts---including Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total
one-quarter of that number.) [Our postwar statesmen were neither weak
nor incompetent. They were the architects of the greatest foreign policy
triumph in U.S. history. So successful was this policy that Americans
now---most of whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of these
wars---see peace, unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's natural
state.]{.underline} This is an illusion. For centuries, Europe was the
fulcrum of global violence. With the age of global exploration, it
became the globe's primary exporter of violence, the tempo and horror of
the carnage rising every century with improvements in technology for
violence. The Scramble for Africa, the division and colonization of that
continent by Europe, is a case in point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa
Conference, which assembled the representatives of 13 European powers to
settle their colonial claims to Africa by diplomacy in place of arms,
did lead to peace in Europe for several years. Africans, however, would
not recall these years for their exceptional comity. For example, the
conference indulged King Léopold II's claim that the Congo Free State
was his private property. Ten million Congolese souls perished under his
ministrations. In recognizing this history of blood, however, we must
recognize something equally true: In the wake of World War II, liberal
democracy saw its fullest realization in the West. This flourishing of
peace and human rights cannot be explained by a sudden outbreak of
European pacifism. (Consider the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an
infuriated President Dwight Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian
War.) It happened because during World War II, Europe destroyed itself,
leaving the United States overwhelmingly powerful by comparison, its
only rival the Soviet Union. Through the application of economic,
diplomatic and military force majeure, the United States suppressed
Europe's internal security competition. This is why postwar Europe
ceased to be the world's leading exporter of violence and became,
instead, the world's leading exporter of luxury sedans. Only America,
and massive power as the U.S. exercised it, could have pacified and
unified Europe under its aegis. No other continental country possessed
half the world's GDP. No other country had enough distance from Europe
to be trusted, to a large extent, by all parties and indifferent to its
regional jealousies. [No other country had a strategic, moral and
economic vision for Europe that its inhabitants could be persuaded
gladly to share.]{.underline} Indeed, **[Europeans cooperated with the
U.S. program because it created conditions under which both the United
States and Europe flourished]{.underline}**. The United States assisted
Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13 billion of aid in the form
of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars, roughly \$113 billion.) It
midwifed the groupings and treaties that would become the European
Union. It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella with the NATO
treaty. Article V of the treaty, its most important element, declares
that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. These
policies were intended not only to counter the Soviet Union, but to
condition Europe's prosperity upon its integration into a single market,
with free movement of goods, capital and labor. [The founders of these
institutions fully intended them to be the foundations of a United
States of Europe, much like the United States of America.]{.underline}
[Profound economic interdependence, they believed, would make further
European wars impossible. At the same time, the United States built an
open, global order upon an architecture of specific institutions: the
United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the International
Court of Justice.]{.underline} This order is in many respects an
empire---a [Pax Americana]{.underline}---but it [is more humane than any
empire that preceded it, with institutions that are intended to benefit
all parties. Postwar U.S. statesmen believed that prosperous, liberal
democracies that traded freely with each other would neither go to war
with each other nor the United States.]{.underline} They ascribed, in
other words, to the so-called Democratic Peace theory---a theory with
overwhelming empirical support. [The U.S. military was always an
integral part of the plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the
rubble.]{.underline} Since World War II, U.S. troops have been deployed
in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot be dominated by a single power
capable of monopolizing its resources and turning them against [the U.S.
The United States has built overwhelmingly massive military assets there
to deter local arms races before they begin, and it has simultaneously
assured those under U.S. protection that there is no need to begin local
arms races, for their safety is guaranteed. American grand strategy
rests upon the credibility of its promise to protect American allies;
this credibility rests, in turn, upon U.S. willingness to display its
commitment.]{.underline} (The Berlin Airlift, when U.S. troops airlifted
supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade, was precisely such a
display.) In return for the United States' commitment, U.S. allies have
accepted America's dominant role in the international system. In the
postwar era, just as now, the enemies of liberal democracy sought to
undermine the order the U.S. was building. Precisely because [the
Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West under the United
States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda organs cranked into
overdrive to denounce it.]{.underline} A cartoon, for example, published
in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's administrator, Paul
Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on destroying the sovereignty of
European nations. The French paper L\'Humanité, which reliably parroted
Moscow's line, wrote, "After disorganizing the national economies of the
countries which are under the American yoke, American leaders now intend
conclusively to subjugate the economy of these countries to their own
interests." [The Soviet Union's criticism of the Marshall Plan and other
American involvement in Europe was eerily similar to the language
Russia's now uses in its campaign to undermine NATO and the EU. The
vocabulary and tropes of Russian propaganda are widely echoed, wittingly
or unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and other antiliberal
politicians, parties and movements throughout the West.]{.underline}
With the men who built the postwar world order now in their graves, and
the memory of carnage and horror buried with them, a very sizable
constituency of Americans has forgotten that their country built this
system for a reason---that the United States does not maintain its
alliances as an act of foolish largesse. [The loudest exponent of the
idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the European Union was
"created to destroy us," and that multilateral institutions such as the
World Trade Organization assault the "sovereignty" of the nations
concerned is, unfortunately, the president of the United States. It's
hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are. History
can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is never so
cooperative]{.underline}. [Global free trade sustains modern economic
life. An interruption to this trade---carried out chiefly on global
shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S. military---would bring modern
life to an end. The Second World War proved not only that isolationism
and American-Firstism were fantasies, but exceptionally childish and
dangerous ones, at that. In the age of hyperglobalized trade,
international air travel, the internet, nuclear weapons and
intercontinental ballistic missiles, these fantasies are even more
childish and dangerous. The U.S. may be on another continent, but it is
not on another planet. It is true that the U.S. spends more on its
military, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of GDP, than any
European country. That was always part of the deal. The U.S. is a global
superpower. It can fight a war anywhere in the world, invade any country
at will, and (at least in theory) fight multiple simultaneous major
wars---even in space.]{.underline} Of course this costs more. It is in
America's advantage to be the only power on the planet that can do this.
Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage for other
countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do. Europe is
America's biggest export market, as designed. We want Europeans to spend
their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not razing Flanders to the
ground yet again. Yet Trump's refusal to deter our shared enemies and
protect our allies risks provoking a regional European arms
race---exactly what the U.S. has sought to avoid for 74 years. It is an
invitation to adventurism from Putin. Trump's refusal to adopt the
encouraging language of past presidents toward European integration,
language that until now has been transformed into policy by professional
and experienced State Department employees, puts further strain on an
already-weakened Europe. Above all, Trump's overt support for sordid,
Kremlin-backed actors who seek to undermine Europe's unity is
unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's interest, or in ours, for the
American president to lend the United States' prestige and support to
Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal Marxists, populists,
authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists, particularly since all of them
are ideologically hostile to the United States? The damage Trump has
deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability comes at a uniquely
dangerous time[. Democracy's so-called third wave---the global
blossoming of open political systems after the Cold War---has long since
receded. A threat to liberal democracy, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology---illiberal democracy---is ascendant. We see it today in Russia
and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and hollow form of
democracy that spreads and consolidates itself through the new
technologies of the 21st century. The global order the U.S. built was
based on the principle that only a world of liberal democracies can be
peaceful and prosperous. That principle is correct. Should the
unraveling of the order the U.S. built proceed at this pace, the world
will soon be neither peaceful nor prosperous. Nor will the effects be
confined to regions distant from the United States. America will feel
them gradually, and then, probably, overnight---in the form of a
devastating, sudden shock.]{.underline}

#### Abandonment/unilateralism Wrecks US hegemony -- removes *[network]{.underline}* of diplomatic and military capabilities and *[forecloses agenda-setting power]{.underline}* to new regional blocs

Scenarios for the future of transatlantic relations,"

The decline of American hegemony has been proclaimed many times, but the
US has continued to be the sole superpower on the block. [Yet the 2016
election might go down in history as the turning point -- if the new
administration follows through with its plan to put 'America First' and
withdraws from international responsibilities. This policy change puts
European collective action capacity to a test, leaving the EU to carry
on the torch of liberal values and democracy in the global world
order.]{.underline} Following the Brexit shock, EU leaders agree on a
communications and legitimacy offensive to fend off populist movements
in the wake of Brexit. Europe's foreign policy apparatus evolves. As the
EEAS gains experience and fine-tunes its working relationship with
member states and the EU Commission, the changes intended by the Lisbon
treaty begin to materialize in practical terms. [The center of gravity
for day-to-day foreign policy moves to the European level, not least
because EU mxembers are happy to consolidate expensive foreign
operations. At the same time, the United States decrease their footprint
in terms of both diplomatic and military capabilities abroad. US foreign
policy focuses on core regions and tasks, which means cutting back on
large-scale diplomatic initiatives, early warning and conflict
resolution, or intelligence analysis]{.underline}. These policy shifts
draw heavy criticism from European allies and the transatlantic
relationship suffers − also because the new US administration uses a
different tone and style towards the old allies. These organizational
and strategic changes are reflected in policy choices. [In United
Nations negotiations on climate change, the EU is the only actor that
comes close to China's willingness and capacity for leadership.
Participants in transatlantic working groups discover that their goals
are not aligned.]{.underline} In addition, US negotiators are much less
enthusiastic about investing political capital and resources in global
governance. UN operational budgets across the board are sharply reduced
reflecting a reduction in US contributions that cannot be compensated by
others. Thus, while the UN remains a forum for deliberation, its
agencies lose practical relevance in global governance. [At the same
time, the member states of the European Union come to terms with the
fact that their transatlantic partner seems less willing to assume a
leadership role. A number of governments and the foreign-policy
institutions in Brussels take on more responsibility in regional and
global affairs. As a result, EU policymakers focus more heavily on
inter-regional cooperation with organizations from Africa, Latin America
and Asia. A number of so-called 'intensive partnership' treaties with
regional blocs and individual emerging powers address cross-border
issues, such as migration and the fight against crime. In trade and
investment, regional arrangements increasingly replace the WTO, which is
in hibernation due to the United States' refusal to champion further
trade liberalization on a global scale. NATO suffers from funding cuts
and is strictly limited to its core mandate for territorial defense,
while the UN Security Council drops from gridlock to
paralysis]{.underline}. Military interventions still take place -- but
only based on ad-hoc coalitions. [For the EU this means creating a more
deeply integrated but still voluntary defense framework with a focus on
security in the near abroad and African countries of strategic interest.
A first indicator for this scenario is a shift in US foreign policy from
a global leadership role to a few selected initiatives. American
agenda-setting power on the global stage is reduced as foreign-policy
priorities change, but also because European allies in turn focus on
other partners and opportunities.]{.underline} EU-internal changes in
the institutional setup and practice of foreign policy are another
indicator to consider. The clearest sign of this scenario, however,
would be bolder and more controversial European actions on the global
arena -- both diplomatically and militarily.

[As the Trump era]{.underline} potentially [comes to an end,
many]{.underline} foreign-policy voices in the United States and abroad
**[relish]{.underline}** [the prospect of the country's **roaring
return**]{.underline} [to the global stage. But attempting a **full-on
comeback** would be a **mistake. If anything**]{.underline}, [the
**strategic pullback**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** [has initiated **needs to
continue**]{.underline}---albeit in a more coherent and judicious
manner. Much of the debate surrounding the next administration's foreign
policy has focused on boldly reasserting U.S. leadership in the world.
And it's true: Global interdependence and upheaval do require steady
U.S. leadership and engagement. [What's been]{.underline} largely
**[missing]{.underline}** from this debate, however, [are the challenges
facing the next president when it comes to **right-sizing U.S.
engagement abroad**]{.underline}---[especially **military
involvement**]{.underline}---[and bringing the nation's **strategic
commitments** back into line with it **means** and **purposes**. The
American electorate has turned **sharply inward**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [response to **military overreach** in the **Middle
East**]{.underline}, [the **economic dislocations**]{.underline}
[brought about by **innovation** and **globalization**]{.underline},
[and the **national calamity** caused by **COVID**]{.underline}-19. [The
nation's **next president** would]{.underline} be wise to take
note---and [craft a brand of global statecraft that is **effective** but
also]{.underline} politically **[sustainable]{.underline}**. [Otherwise,
the **strategic pullback** that needs to take place will occur **by
default rather than by design**]{.underline}, [risking]{.underline} that
**[U.S. overreach]{.underline}** could turn into even more dangerous
underreach. Indeed, that's what's been happening during Trump's
presidency. He seems to have understood the need to retrench. But his
troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Germany have been
haphazard, making a hash of the effort. Retrenchment cannot be done by
tweet, in unpredictable fits and starts, and couched in an abrasive
"America first" unilateralism that has alienated allies and set the
world on edge. Democratic candidate Joe [**Biden** is]{.underline} far
better [suited to restore an **equilibrium**]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} the nation's [**foreign policy** and]{.underline}
its **[political will]{.underline}**. [Throughout his career, he has
been a **pragmatic** and **prudent internationalist**]{.underline};
[looking forward, pragmatism and prudence will require a more
**selective** and **discriminating internationalism**]{.underline},
**[not]{.underline}** **[restoration of the s]{.underline}**tatus
**[quo]{.underline}** ante. Three-quarters of the American public want
U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan and Iraq---[it is time to downsize the
U.S. footprint in the Middle East. U.S. foreign policy has become
**over-militarized**]{.underline}---[the next administration should
**reallocate priorities** and **resources**]{.underline}, [putting more
emphasis on **diplomacy**]{.underline}, cybersecurity, global public
health, and climate change. Washington should also return to being a
team player if it is to lighten its load; [**retrenchment** and
**multilateral engagement** go hand in hand. Meeting the threat posed by
**China**]{.underline}, managing international **[trade]{.underline}**
and finance, [preventing]{.underline} nuclear
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [addressing]{.underline}
**[pandemics]{.underline}**---[these]{.underline} and other urgent
challenges [all require broad **international

[S]{.underline}tates **[pulls back]{.underline}** from its role as
global policeman, [it will want **like-minded partners** to help **fill
the gap**]{.underline}. These partnerships become stronger through
diplomacy and teamwork. [The **top priorities** of the next president
will be **at home**: **taming the pandemic**, **repairing the economy**,
and reviving **democratic institutions**]{.underline} and norms. Only if
the country's democratic lights come back on can it effectively deal
with the rest of the world. In the meantime, [the next
admin]{.underline}istration [needs to **continue Trump's effort** to
**downsize** the nation's foreign **entanglements**]{.underline}---but
[in a **smart** and **measured** way]{.underline}. The United States
needs to step back without stepping away. "Build back better" applies
abroad just as much as it does at home.

NEW YORK -- American foreign policy is at a crossroads. The United
States has been an expanding power since its start in 1789. It battled
its way across North America in the nineteenth century and gained global
dominance in the second half of the twentieth. But now, [facing China's
rise, India's dynamism, Africa's soaring populations and economic
stirrings, Russia's refusal to bend to its will, its own inability to
control events in the Middle East, and Latin America's determination to
be free of its de facto hegemony,]{.underline} **[US power has reached
its limits]{.underline}**. One path for the US is global cooperation.
The other is a burst of militarism in response to frustrated ambitions.
The future of the US, and of the world, hangs on this choice. [Global
coop]{.underline}eration [is doubly vital]{.underline}. [**Only**
**coop**]{.underline}eration [can deliver peace and the escape
from]{.underline} a useless, **[dangerous]{.underline}**, and ultimately
bankrupting **[new arms race]{.underline}**, [this time including
**cyber-weapons**, **space weapons**, and **next-gen**eration **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. And [only cooperation can enable humanity to
face up to urgent planetary challenges, including **the destruction of
biod**iversity, the poisoning of the **oceans**, and the threat posed by
**global warming**]{.underline} to the world's food supply, vast
drylands, and heavily populated coastal regions. [Yet **global
coop**eration means the willingness to reach **agreements**]{.underline}
with other countries, [not]{.underline} simply to [make]{.underline}
unilateral [demands]{.underline} of them. And **[the US is in the habit
of making demands]{.underline}**, not making compromises. When a state
feels destined to rule -- as with ancient Rome, the Chinese "Middle
Kingdom" centuries ago, the British Empire from 1750 to 1950, and the US
since World War II -- compromise is hardly a part of its political
vocabulary. As former US President George W. Bush succinctly put it,
"You're either with us or against us."

U.S. Grand Strategy," Foreign Affairs, July/August,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/case-offshore-balancing)

HEGEMONY\'S HOLLOW HOPES Defenders of liberal hegemony marshal a number
of unpersuasive arguments to make their case. One familiar claim is that
only vigorous U.S. leadership can keep order around the globe. But
[**global leadership is not an end in itself**; it is desirable only
insofar as it benefits the United States directly. One might further
argue]{.underline} that [U.S. leadership is necessary to overcome the
**collective-action** problem]{.underline} of local actors failing to
balance against a potential hegemon. Offshore balancing recognizes this
danger, however, and [calls for Washington to step in **if needed**. Nor
does it prohibit Washington from giving friendly states]{.underline} in
the key regions [advice or material aid]{.underline}. Other [defenders
of liberal hegemony argue]{.underline} that [U.S. leadership is
necessary to deal with new, transnational threats]{.underline} that
arise [from failed states, terrorism, criminal networks, refugee
flows]{.underline}, and the like. Not only do the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans offer inadequate protection against these dangers, they claim,
but modern military technology also makes it easier for the United
States to project power around the world and address them. Today\'s
\"global village,\" in short, is more dangerous yet easier to manage.
**[This]{.underline}** view exaggerates these threats and **[overstates
Washington\'s ability]{.underline}** to eliminate them. Crime,
terrorism, and similar problems can be a nuisance, but they are hardly
existential threats and rarely lend themselves to military solutions.
Indeed[, constant interference in the affairs of other states-and
especially repeated military interventions- generates local resentment
and fosters corruption]{.underline}, thereby **[making]{.underline}**
these **[transnational dangers worse]{.underline}**. [The long-term
solution to the problems can only be competent local governance, not
heavy-handed U.S. efforts to police the world]{.underline}.

### Offense -- Heg is Violent

#### The legacy of American hegemony is endless rivers of blood and feedback loops of sustained conflict **Morefield 19** (Jeanne Morefield, Professor of Politics at Whitman College, Professorial Fellow at the Institute for Social Justice at Australian Catholic University, PhD from Cornell University, January 8, 2019, "Trump's Foreign Policy Isn't the Problem," Boston Review, <https://bostonreview.net/politics/jeanne-morefield-trump%E2%80%99s-foreign-policy-isn%E2%80%99t-problem>) gz

After two years of [President Donald Trump]{.underline}, critics and
commentators are still struggling to make sense of his foreign policy.
Despite some hopes that he might mature into the role of commander in
chief, he has continued to thumb his nose at most mainstream academic
frameworks for analyzing and conducting foreign policy. Indeed, what
makes Trump's interactions with the rest of the world so confusing is
the way he flirts with, and then departs from, the script. He may issue
policies and give speeches that include words such as "sovereignty,"
"principled realism," and "peace through strength," but they frequently
appear cheek by jowl with racist rants, crass opportunism, nationalist
tirades, and unrestrained militarism. It is [this uncomfortable mixture
of familiar and jarring that has proven disconcerting for many
mainstream international relations scholars, particularly those
"intellectual middlemen" who straddle the realms of academia, policy
think tanks, and major news outlets. Yet rather than ask how U.S.
foreign policy might have contributed to the global environment that
made Trump's election possible, most have responded to the
inconsistencies of Trump's world vision by emphasizing its departure
from everything that came before and demanding a return to more familiar
times. International relations experts thus express nostalgia
for either the "U.S.-led liberal order"]{.underline} or the Cold War
while, in [outlets such as *Foreign Affairs* and the *New York
Times*, they offer selective retellings of the country's past foreign
policies that make them look both shinier and clearer than they
were]{.underline}. These responses do not offer much insight into Trump
himself, but they do have much to tell us about [the discourse of
international relations in the United
States]{.underline} today [and]{.underline} the way [its mainstream
public analysts---liberals and realists alike---continue to disavow U.S.
imperialism. ]{.underline}For example, [liberal internationalists such
as John Ikenberry argue that Trump is guilty of endangering the U.S.-led
global order. That system, according to Ikenberry and Daniel Deudney,
emerged after World War II, when the liberal democracies of the world
"joined together to create an international order that reflected their
shared interests," while simultaneously agreeing, as Ikenberry once put
it, to transfer "the reins of power to Washington]{.underline}, just as
Hobbes's individuals . . . voluntarily construct and hand over power to
the Leviathan." [The vision of cooperating nation-states may have
originated in values that first "emerged in the West," they argue, but
these values have since "become universal." In this accounting, Trump
threatens the stability of U.S. liberal hegemony in two ways: by
retreating from multilateral agreements such as the Iran nuclear deal,
and by refusing to participate in the narrative of enlightened U.S.
leadership. Future great threats to global stability, Ikenberry
grumbled, were supposed to come from "hostile revisionist powers seeking
to overturn the postwar order." Now a hostile revisionist power "sits in
the Oval Office." ]{.underline}By contrast, [when realists such as
Stephen Walt or John Mearsheimer criticize Trump, they start from the
position that the liberal world order is a delusion,
perpetuated]{.underline} most recently [by]{.underline} post--Cold War
members of [the "elite foreign policy establishment."]{.underline} Walt
and others rightly point to the baseline hypocrisy of a "liberal
Leviathan," noting that [the current fury over Russian election
tampering and cyber espionage rings hollow given the long U.S. reliance
on both strategies. This view accompanies a wistful longing for
the putatively gimlet-eyed realism of the Cold War, a time when U.S.
presidents understood that their role was to deter the Soviet Union,
prevent the emergence of dangerous regional hegemons, and preserve "a
global balance of power that enhanced American
security."]{.underline} Seen thus, [Trump's hyperbolic and embarrassing
nationalism is a symptom of the abandonment of great power politics,
while his fawning treatment of Vladimir Putin shatters any remaining
hope that his self-styled "principled realism" might take us back to a
more strategically realistic time. In the words of former Secretary of
Defense Ash Carter, watching the Trump--Putin news conference was like
"watching the destruction of a
cathedral."]{.underline} [But]{.underline} what is Trump actually doing
to destroy this cathedral? What makes Trump's words and behavior so
objectionable? Previous presidents have pulled out of multilateral
agreements, entered into disputes with allies, and engaged in
protectionism and trade wars. The majority of the Trump administration's
planned and ongoing military deployments are in regions where the
military was already deployed by previous administrations in the name of
the War on Terror. Moreover, [Trump's national security and national
policy statements are littered with the vocabulary of the very experts
who find him so terrifying. What]{.underline}, then, [makes Trump's
foreign policy such a singular threat? Trump's foreign policy is
disturbing because it is uncanny---both grotesque *and* deeply familiar.
Like a funhouse mirror, Trump's vision of the world reflects back a
twisted image of U.S. global politics that *is* and *is not* who we are
supposed to be. For instance, deterrence strategy may require the rest
of the world to believe that the U.S. president might use nuclear
weapons, but the president is *not* supposed to hint that he might
actually do so. The president is supposed to be concerned with
regulating the flow of immigrants but not reveal that race plays a role
in these calculations by blurting the phrase "shithole countries." The
president is supposed to believe that the United States is the most
blessed, exceptional country on Earth]{.underline}---as Barack Obama put
it, "I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my
being"---[but *not* engage in excessive nationalism by making "total
allegiance" the "bedrock" of his politics, or combine it with a
commitment to "make our Military so big, powerful & strong that no one
will mess with us."]{.underline} Sometimes Trump's utterances hit so
close to home that they surpass uncanniness. In an essay by Sigmund
Freud on the uncanny, Freud says dolls and mannequins unsettle precisely
because of the possibility that they might actually be alive, a
discomfort that has inspired nightmares, works of literature, and horror
movies. [Trump]{.underline}, by contrast, [is a living nightmare. He
opens his mouth and the things-which-must-never- be-said simply fall
out]{.underline}. Thus, [when Bill O'Reilly asked him why he supported
Putin even though he is a "killer," Trump shot back, "There are a lot of
killers. You think our country's so innocent?" Trump's willingness to
say such things has precipitated an existential crisis in the
international relations world. U.S. foreign policy, as an academic
discourse and political practice, is built on the delicate foundation
of]{.underline} what Robert Vitalis has called [the "norm against
noticing," This deflective move has long been the gold standard of
international relations; under its rules of play, IR experts act as if
the United States has never been an imperial power and that its foreign
policy is not, and has never been, intentionally racist. The norm
against noticing thus distinguishes between the idea of the United
States as a necessary world-historical actor and the reality of how the
United States acts.]{.underline} [In that reality, the United States has
long been an imperial power with white nationalist aspirations. Given
the racialized nature of U.S. imperial expansion, it makes sense
that]{.underline} Alexis de [Tocqueville predicted, in a chapter
entitled "The Three Races of the United States," that the United States
would one day govern "the destinies of half the globe."
In ]{.underline}its early days, [while still a slave-holding country,
the United States asserted its sovereignty through genocide on a
continental scale and annexed large portions of northern
Mexico. The country went on to overthrow the independent state
of Hawaii, occupied the Philippines and Haiti, exerted its regional
power throughout Latin America, expanded its international hegemony
after World War II, and became what it is today: the world's foremost
military and nuclear power with a \$716 billion "defense" budget that
exceeds the spending of all other major global powers
combined.]{.underline} "Taking over from the British Empire in the early
twentieth-century," argues James Tully, [the United States has used its
many military bases located "outside its own borders"---now nearly 800
in over 80 countries--- to force open-door economic policies and
antidemocratic regimes on states throughout the formerly colonized
world. An extremely partial list of sovereign governments that the
United States either overthrew or attempted to subvert through military
means, assassinations, or election tampering since 1949 includes Syria,
Iran, Guatemala, Lebanon, the Congo, Cuba, Chile, Afghanistan,
Nicaragua, Grenada, Cuba, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq, Yemen,
Australia, Greece, Bolivia, and Angola. Such interventionist policies
have contributed substantially to today's inegalitarian world in which
an estimated 783 million people live in profound poverty. In sum, for
untold millions of humans in the Global South, the seventy years of
worldwide order, security, and prosperity that Ikenberry and Deudney
associate with Pax Americana has been anything but ordered, secure, or
prosperous.]{.underline} And yet [the norm against noticing prevents
foreign policy analysis from even acknowledging---let alone grappling
with---the relationship between race and imperialism that has
characterized U.S. international relations from the country's earliest
days. This regime of politely un-seeing---of deflecting---connections
between U.S. foreign policy, race hierarchy, and colonial
administration]{.underline} was clearly not in effect when *Foreign
Affairs* was released under its original name: the *Journal of Race
Development*. This began to change, however, in the 1920s. Among other
contributing factors, World War I, the rise of anti-colonial
revolutions, and the emergence of liberal internationalism as a popular
ideology [helped convince foreign policy experts in the United States
and Europe to adopt a policy language oriented toward "development"
rather than imperialism or racial difference. Mainstream international
relations scholarship today remains committed to a narrative in which
the discipline itself and U.S. foreign policy has always been and
remains race blind, concerned solely with the relationship between
sovereign states who cooperate, deter, or compete with one another in a
global system in which the United States is]{.underline} simply, like
Caesar, [the "first citizen" (Ikenberry) or "the luckiest great power in
modern history" (Walt). For liberals, this involves a studied erasure of
the imperial origins of twentieth-century internationalism in the League
of Nations' Mandate system and the complicity of
Woodrow Wilson in preserving, ]{.underline}as Adom Getachew puts
it, ["white supremacy on a global scale." For realists, it requires both
forgetting the anti-Enlightenment origins of postwar realist thought and
reinserting the "security dilemma" back into history so
that]{.underline}, with the help of Thucydides, Machiavelli, and
Hobbes, [the world can]{.underline}---as Slavoj Žižek says---["become
what it always was." International relations experts will acknowledge
U.S. violence and overreach when necessary, but routinely read the
illiberalism of U.S. foreign policy as an exception that is not at all
representative]{.underline}, in Anne Marie Slaughter's words, of "the
idea that is America." Slaughter, with Ikenberry, can consider bad
behavior only briefly and only in the service of insisting that what
matters most is not what the United States actually does with its power
but what it intends to do. Yes, "imperialism, slavery, and racism have
marred Western history," Ikenberry and Deudney argue, but what matters
is that liberalism "has always been at the forefront of efforts---both
peaceful and militant---to reform and end these practices." Indeed, even
those public intellectuals such as Niall Ferguson and Michael Ignatieff
who, after September 11, called for the United States to embrace its
status as an imperial power, framed their arguments in deflective,
liberal terms. By contrast, [because realists project the security
dilemma retroactively into history (while also simultaneously excising
imperialism) they can only see the U.S. destabilization of Third World
economies, assassinations, and secret bombings as tragic
necessities (great powers, claims Mearsheimer, "have little choice but
to pursue power and to seek to dominate the other states in the system")
or as the result of liberals' ill-advised desire to force "our" values
on other nations. Both of these deflective strategies reinforce the
illusion that we live]{.underline}, in Nikhil Pal Singh's words, [in an
"American-centered, racially inclusive world, one organized around
formally equal and independent nation states" where some states just
happen to have more power than others, and where the
alternative---Russian or Chinese hegemony---is too frightening even to
contemplate. That deflection would play such an outsized role in
supporting the ideological edifice of international relations today is
hardly surprising]{.underline}. Turn-of-the-century British liberals who
supported their empire also drew upon a variety of different deflective
strategies to reconcile the violence and illiberalism of British
imperial expansion with the stated liberal goals of the Empire.
Such [deflection made it impossible for these
thinkers]{.underline}---many of whom would go on to work as some of the
first international relations scholars in Britain and help found The
Royal Institute of International Affairs---[to link the problems of
empire with the violence and disruption of
imperialism. ]{.underline}Similarly, [deflection within international
relations today obscures the U.S. role in maintaining the profoundly
hierarchical, racist, insecure, deeply unjust reality of the current
global order. It also makes it impossible to address how U.S. foreign
policy (covert and overt) has contributed to the destabilization of that
order by creating the circumstances that give rise to "failed
states," "rogue regimes," and "sponsors
of terrorism."]{.underline} Moreover, [it impedes any theorizing about
how the widespread appeal of Trump's xenophobia at home might, in
part, be the product of U.S. foreign policy abroad, the bitter fruit of
the War on Terror and its equally violent predecessors. In other words,
in the grand tradition of liberal empire, U.S. foreign policy deflection
actively disrupts the link between cause and effect that an entire
science of international relations was created to explain. What
makes Trump's attitude toward foreign policy so uniquely unhinging for
international relations experts, then, is the fact that it is
essentially undeflectable. When he explains to Theresa May that refugees
threaten European culture or calls Mexican immigrants killers, he lays
bare the meant-to-be unutterable fear of nonwhite migration that has
haunted British, U.S., and European imperialists and foreign policy
experts for over a century. When he summons the fires of nationalism to
demand an unprecedented increase in the military budget, and then gets
it with the overwhelming support of House and Senate Democrats, he
reveals that constitutional checks on the commander in chief are only as
good as the willingness of Congress to resist jingoism. When he calls
nations populated by brown and black people shitholes, he openly
advertises the unspoken white supremacist edge that has informed U.S.
economic, development, energy, and foreign policies since the late
nineteenth century. Trump's Muslim ban is simply the War on Terror on
steroids.]{.underline} In short, Trump's foreign policy is unprecedented
not because of what it does, but because Trump will openly say what it
does---and because of what that then says about us as a nation. [The
discomfort Trump provokes ought to prompt international
relations experts to reflect on the failings of their discipline to
reckon with the relationship between U.S. imperialism, U.S. foreign
policy, and the constellation of xenophobia, militarism, racism, and
nationalism that haunts our days. The fields of intellectual and legal
history and political theory are far ahead of international relations in
their critical interrogation of the ideologies that sustain empire at
home and abroad]{.underline}. In addition, Trump's election has
emboldened activists to make increasingly explicit the connections they
see between a racialized, anti-immigrant politics of domestic
dispossession and violence and the history of U.S. imperialism in the
world. Unfortunately the same does not appear to be true for the
majority of intellectual middlemen who set the public tone for U.S.
foreign policy. Trump is, finally, both the emperor with no clothes and
the pointing child, begging to hold a big military parade so we can
collectively acknowledge the naked imperialist power at the heart of
U.S. foreign policy. Trump practically screams at the United States to
look at itself. And yet, the more he screams, the more the intellectual
enablers avert their eyes. They are busy looking elsewhere---anywhere
really---except at that nakedness.

[IV. Growth of Regional Economy Although a significant share of East
Asia's trade is in intermediate manufactured goods for final destination
export to the USA, Europe and Japan, it has allowed for technology
transfers and has stimulated endogenous growth factors in East Asia
region.]{.underline} **[The other dimension is regionalisation and the
intensification of transnational trade and investment flows among the
developing countries. Regionalisation has been an important feature of
East Asian re-emergence. Initiated by the relocation of Japanese
manufacturing capacities in the 1980s, which generated a concatenated
division of labour in East Asia, regional economic integration has
deepened over the past decade and a half. Intra-regional trade as a
share of total trade has thus risen constantly over past decades by 20%
in 1970, 32% in the early 1980s, 47% in the early 1995, 54.8% in 2000
and nearly 60% in 2012.]{.underline}** The Chinese government appears to
be only focusing on building its economy and the living conditions of
its people. [China has become the world's largest economy, but it has a
population of 1.4 billion, which is more than four times larger than the
US.]{.underline} Having an economy the size of the US means that average
living standards are far lower than in the US and at present, per capita
income is one-fourth than of the US. It means that [China still has a
long way to go to become a rich country. **Chinese annual GDP growth
averaged over 9% between 1997 and 2019 and, in the aftermath of the East
Asian crisis, trade and investment flows between China and the rest of
Asia grew significantly. Since the late 1990s, regional trade with China
has been growing faster than with the US. For instance, Japan's imports
from China already exceed those from the US, and Japanese exports to
China have been steadily rising. This same trend is apparent in South
Korean, Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean trade flows**]{.underline}
(Amsden, 2001; Siddiqui, 2020a). Chinese leaders thus interpret the 1997
East Asian financial crisis as a turning point: '**[The process of the
East Asian cooperation has been consolidated day by day since then \[and
is now\] based on a multi-layered, multi-faceted
structure'.]{.underline}** [Recent moves to gradually internationalise
the Renminbi and use it in regional transactions, such as the June 2012
Japanese--Chinese accord to trade in their currencies rather than the
dollar, represent a further step in this direction.]{.underline}
(Siddiqui, 2020d) [Trade between China and all other developing
countries grew significantly over the past two decades. While the share
of South America, Africa and South Asia in China's total trade remains
relatively small, it is steadily growing]{.underline}, but **[China's
share in their total trade has become strategically
important.]{.underline}** [The space is not available for a
comprehensive review of the new transcontinental flows, but the pattern
is clear even when we look at the data. Over the past two decades Asia
has become Brazil's main trading partner, accounting for 30% of its
exports and 31% of its imports. Exports to China, as a share of total
exports, have risen from 0.9% in 1992 to over 17%. China has thus become
Brazil's second trading partner, just behind the European Union (21%)
but well ahead of the US (10%). Argentina's exports to China, as a share
of total exports, have likewise risen from 1.1% to 9.7%. Similar
patterns are apparent for Africa, where South Africa's export share to
China has risen from 1.8% in 1998 to over 12% in 2018, while imports
rose from 3% to 15%, and Nigeria's exports from 0.5% to 6.9%. In South
Asia the share of Indian exports to China has risen from 2.9% to over
10%, and imports from 2% to 12% during the same period.]{.underline} V.
Restructuring Global Capitalism **[It seems that the historic
pendulum,]{.underline}** which had swung to the 'West' i**[n the late
18th century, is swinging back to Asia, which is reclaiming the leading
economic role it held for a very long period before the Age of the
Western Empire. The movement towards a polycentric and plural world
system has indeed quickened over the past quarter century, as major
Asian regions have consolidated their position as a dynamic growth
region]{.underline}** of the world capitalist economy, **[developing
regional and transcontinental linkages that are reconfiguring global
trade, investment and financial flows.]{.underline}** First in the
1960s, economic changes began in the East Asian region and later on in
the 1990s, growth spread to other developing countries like Brazil,
China, India, South Africa and Turkey. **[The systemic restructuring has
primarily been driven by East Asia, which has experienced a process of
economic expansion, the duration of which have been remarkable by
historic standards. Beginning with Japan's rapid economic transformation
in the 1950s and 1960s, a regional development dynamic was set into
motion that spread successively, in wave-like formations, to the Newly
Industrialised Countries and moreover, over the last four decades, to
spectacular growth in China.]{.underline}** [Varying initial conditions,
historic pathways and a combination of both state and markets have
produced positive results in East Asia. There are uneven
country-to-country developmental outcomes, distinguishing first and
second wave industrialising from third and fourth wave countries that
are climbing the ladder but are not far from catching-up with the most
developed economies]{.underline}. (Siddiqui, 2020c) Growing financial
power derived from cumulative surpluses is another important feature of
the rebalancing of the world economy, which has been accentuated by the
deepening economic crisis in the European Union, Brexit and in the USA.
Nonetheless, [a coherent process has been at work, unfolding over time
and space to most of the region, with global effects. East Asia's
aggregate share of constantly increasing world GDP (in PPP), which was
negligible in the 1950s, has thus risen from around 10% in 1980 to 30%
in 2015. China's share has grown from 2% to over 18%. Over the same time
period PPP per capita GDP in current international dollars was
multiplied by 14 in South Korea, by over seven in Singapore and
Thailand, by six in Malaysia and Indonesia, and by 39 in China (from
US\$250 to US\$9380 in 2019)--a spectacular increase that reflects the
intensity of growth and its cumulative impact. By the end of 2020 East
Asia's share of world GDP (in PPP) is expected to reach 32%, with China
accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total. In South Asia, India's
world share has risen from 2.5% to 5.5%, and per-capita GDP has
increased by a factor of 14, from \$419 dollars to \$3800 dollars today
(in current US dollars). Asia's aggregate share of world GDP (in PPP) is
thus projected to approach 46% in a few years. When other major
re-emerging countries and world regions -- **Brazil, India, Turkey,
Mexico, and South Africa are taken into account, despite the Covid-19
setback, their world output share in 2020 is expected to exceed 55%.
Over the past two decades, East Asia region has thus been the main
source of world growth and has emerged as increasingly trade and
investment linkages. Growing financial power derived from cumulative
surpluses is another important feature of the rebalancing of the world
economy, which has been accentuated by the deepening economic crisis in
the European Union, Brexit and in the USA. We are witnessing the end of
the long historical cycle during which wealth and power were
concentrated in the hands of a small number of countries in Europe,
North America and Japan.**]{.underline} (Siddiqui, 2019a; also Siddiqui,
2012b) [The hierarchical international system constructed in the last
three hundred years, that was centred in Europe, and which instituted a
global division of labour dividing the world into dominant cores and
dependent peripheries, is giving way to a multi-polar
world.]{.underline} In fact, the USA's Cold War strategy required a few
regions of secure and prosperous states in Northeast Asia to contain the
Soviet Union and China, until the late 1960s Sino-Soviet border tension,
and to minimise any possibility of radical movement in the region.
(Siddiqui, 2017b) This is also true of China, which, because of its
scale, nonetheless constitutes a special case. Gradual integration into
the world capitalist economy and export-led industrialisation modelled
on the neo-mercantilist strategies of earlier East Asian developmental
states has generated intense growth and real GDP gains over long
periods. The capitalist transformation has simultaneously led to spatial
polarisation, large-scale continental mass migrations, sharp new social
stratifications and major problems of environmental sustainability
linked to energy use and urbanisation. Sustained growth, fuelled by
transnational investment flows, has been made possible by the
mobilisation and exploitation of a vast subordinate labour force,
notably women concentrated in low value-added activities, raising
crucial issues of gender and class. While they highlight the need for
vigorous corrective measures, without which a country's development is
likely to be compromised, these problems do not call into question the
fact that the strategy followed since 1978 has been broadly successful.
China's pathway bears some analogies to US economic expansion in the
19th century, which was fostered by transnational flows and relied on
the exploitation of slave labour until the mid-19th century, and of low
wage immigrant labour in the latter part of the century. This comparison
is not meant to justify disciplinary Chinese labour policies, although
there are currently some signs of relaxation, much less the
authoritarian regime that is engineering capitalist transformation. It
merely points to the fact that China, through the exploitation of its
rural and most backward regions, is following the path of earlier
successful European Capitalism. Soon after the communist revolution in
China in 1949, the country faced enormous challenges, seeking to
overcome severe underdevelopment, widespread malnutrition and
illiteracy, and the Western monopoly over technology. It promoted
reforms to encourage growth and economic development such as the
government's introduction of radical land reforms, compulsory primary
education, and the availability of primary health care for all its
citizens. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of the 'open policy towards
the West' expressed this as: "Our country must develop. If we do not
develop then we must be bullied. Development is the only hard truth."
China's political orientation has been shaped by its history of
subjugation by foreign powers since the mid-19th century, also known as
the "century of humiliation", and anti-imperialist struggles for
national liberation. In the 1950s and 1960s, China extended support to
developing countries due to the collective struggle of formerly
colonised and oppressed nations against global inequality brought by the
West. Four decades later, [the success of the Chinese economic reform is
undeniable, and it is even noted that such a rapid economic
transformation has never happened in human history in such a short
period. According to the World Bank, China has lifted nearly 800 million
people out of poverty, more than ever happened in human history, and
generated "the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in
history". China's GDP growth has averaged 10% annually for over forty
years, without crises, with the country becoming a world leader in
manufacturing, technology and innovation. In mater of just two life
spans, from being extremely poor to an international power, China is now
predicted to overtake the US in GDP terms in the next fifteen years.
Measured in terms of PPP, China's economy already surpassed the US in
2018.]{.underline} Since the last decade, **[the US-China trade
imbalance has been rising against the US as shown in Figure
1.]{.underline}** The US has blamed China and claimed it is due to the
Chinese policy of currency manipulation. (Siddiqui, 2020b) After Donald
Trump became President of the US in 2017, he initiated a rise in tariffs
against certain Chinese products and also threatened more trade
sanctions against China and Russia. However, a number of studies have
pointed out that the US trade deficit rose not only with China but with
Europe and Japan as well (see Figure 2). Therefore, the persistence of
trade imbalances trends must be seen as a US domestic policy, rather
than putting the blame on others. I argue that a disparity in real costs
is the root cause of the US-China trade imbalance. [Figure 1, which
shows the trade in goods between the US and China, indicates that the US
has had trade deficits in goods with China since the early 1990s, which
has grown substantially. For example, the deficit was only US\$10
billion in 1990, but by 2000 had reached US\$100 billion; by 2005 it had
risen further to US\$200 billion, by 2012 it was US\$ 315 billion, and
by 2017 it had reached US\$376 billion. The sharpest rise was since
2001, which also coincided with China joining the WTO. For example,
China's exports to the US increased from US\$125 billion to US\$505
billion, while US exports to China increased only US\$19 billion to
about US\$130 billion for the same period.]{.underline} ![Figure
1](media/image2.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.3944444444444444in"}
Figure 2 indicates that China is an important trading partner for the
US, but that **[China still has less than half of the US's overall trade
deficits]{.underline}**. For example, in 2017 the US's trade deficit
with China was US\$ 375 billion; however, its overall trade deficit was
US\$ 775 billion. This means that **[even if the US were to eliminate
its trade deficit with China, its trade imbalance problems would still
exist.]{.underline}** ![Figure 2](media/image3.jpeg){width="6.5in"
height="2.6381944444444443in"} The US trade deficit and also external
payments kept on rising as shown in Figure 3, and has grown remarkably
over the last two decades. This was coincident with the period when
China joined WTO, which appears to have given the US an excuse to blame
China for raising its trade deficits. The US trade deficit with China
and other countries are shown in Figure 2. Since 1990, the labour and
total factor productivity in the advanced economies has witnessed
negative growth, while in the emerging economies including China it has
grown steadily, as indicated in Figure 5. ![Figure
3](media/image4.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.8868055555555556in"} The
US-China trade war has facilitated the establishment of Russia as
China's top strategic partner. This also led Russian oil to be
redirected from European countries to China. Chinese President Xi
Jinping announced in Russia in 2019 the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
both countries signed to develop bilateral trade and cross-border
payments using the Rouble and Renminbi, bypassing the US dollar.
(Siddiqui, 2020d) ![Figure 4](media/image5.jpeg){width="6.5in"
height="4.257638888888889in"} As China overtook the US as the worlds'
largest economy, a multi-polar world could be a welcome development for
all, especially the developing countries. According to Fortune 2018,
[among global 500 top businesses, the China has moved into second
position only behind the US (see Figure 4). The IMF has said that in
2019 China displaced the US as the world's largest economy. The IMF's
estimation is made on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, meaning
that it takes into account the differing prices in both countries.
Therefore, if at present 1 US\$ is worth Chinese 6.1 Renminbi on the
foreign exchange market, it means that 6.1 Renminbi can buy much more in
China than one dollar can buy in the US market. Hence, the PPP
comparison makes adjustments for this, and this is why the Chinese
economy is much larger than the measure most commonly used by
international organisations and media, which simply converts China's GDP
to US dollars at the official exchange rate.]{.underline} ![Figure
5](media/image6.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="2.6486111111111112in"}
[China is playing a very assertive and leading role in global affairs.
It has launched the trillions of dollars on 'Belt and Road Initiative'
-- called "the largest single infrastructure programme in human
history]{.underline}." The BRI involves over 70 countries and 1700
developmental projects, connecting Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin
America (Siddiqui, 2019c), while the US is facing economic stagnation
and decline, and is losing international control. The US President
Donald Trump in 2019 increased military spending rapidly to US\$ 716
billion and has brought into his cabinet extreme hawks and anti-China
hardliners such as Mike Pompeo and Peter Navarro. For US policy makers
and elites, rather than accepting this new challenge, they see it as a
threat to their world domination, and have formulated a recent policy
known as the "containing China" policy. Similarly, three-quarters of a
century earlier, the US took over as the leader of the capitalist world,
declared the Soviet Union as its main enemy, and began an arms race with
the Soviet Union. However, at that time the Soviet economy was
one-quarter of the size of the US. But now the situation is very
different, the Chinese economy is currently bigger than the US and also
has huge amounts of trade and a current account surplus. Even [after the
Covid-19 set back, the Chinese economy has not only recovered, but began
growing into the fastest economy in the world. Moreover, China has
emerged as the top investor country in the world in recent years. China
is a rising power, but they do not seem to be interested in building an
empire. For example, China's billon US dollar investment commitment to
'one belt one road', and it becoming the largest investor in Africa,
while the West has still not recovered from the 2008 financial crisis
and the more recent Covid-19 epidemic.]{.underline} It seems that due to
the long-term consequences of the COVID crisis, public debt in most
developed economies will rise sharply. In fact, the 2008 financial
crisis increased government debt in the US and EU. (Siddiqui, 2020c;
also Siddiqui, 2019b) We think of the financial crisis as a temporary
shock that the developed economies barely recovered from, but as we look
at the current crisis, it will increase government debt greatly compared
to the GDP. This is a legacy that will remain for a long time and will
pose very pressing policy questions. As we think about the future of
developed economies, in the US and EU, we have to ask ourselves how we
will be dealing with a level of government debt that will exceed, as a
share of GDP, the amount we had at the end of World War II. The
management of this new massive debt through the policy response in the
aftermath of the crisis will shape Western society, determining the
economic balance between generations, the actual opportunities for
future generations, and the technological disruption and transformation
that was already in place before this outbreak. VI. Conclusion As we
have discussed, **[the new globalisation cycle that began in the late
20th century has led to an unexpectedly rapid, albeit still incomplete,
rebalancing between emerging and advanced economies. East Asia has been
the main driver of a systemic change that is leading to new
transnational linkages between Asia, Africa and Latin America. These new
patterns of interaction are part of a broad process of gradual
decentring and restructuring of the world economy that, at the political
level, is leading to a diffusion of power. Domestic or international
events, for instance a hypothetical but not unthinkable Chinese
overreach in the South China Sea leading to sustained inter-state
tensions, might slow but are unlikely to halt a transformation that is
embedded in globalisation and has become one of its driving
forces.]{.underline}** The rapid economic development in the emerging
economies has been dynamically restructuring world capitalism from
within. It conforms to one of the historic aims of generations of
anti-colonial leaders and thinkers, gaining upward mobility and
achieving sovereign equality, the way in which it is occurring
represents a rather sharp break with the past. But unlike the first
generation of postcolonial leaders, who aimed for revolution or sought
to invent a 'Third Way' between capitalism and communism, and the
framers of the NIEO who challenged the intellectual and material
foundations of the post-1945 world order, the actors of the current
shift in global power relations are claiming a central competitive place
in the world capitalist system that their predecessors had attempted to
either reform or supplant. (Dos Santos, 1970) The success of that claim,
and their consequent implications for current and future global system
management, has dampened and in some cases entirely submerged the
broader emancipatory or universalistic dimensions of the long struggle
for independence, equality and justice. The rapid economic development
in the emerging economies has been dynamically restructuring world
capitalism from within. It conforms to one of the historic aims of
generations of anti-colonial leaders and thinkers, gaining upward
mobility and achieving sovereign equality, the way in which it is
occurring represents a rather sharp break with the past. It has now been
sixty-five years since the historic Bandung Conference of 1955, rightly
regarded as a milestone in the formation of SSC as a global political
movement. The SSC as a movement intended to challenge the
Northern-dominated political and economic system and, from the 1950s to
the present, has been through a series of starts and stops, surges and
retreats. As expressed at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung
in 1955, the newly decolonised countries of the global South emphasised
economic and political cooperation, human rights, and the promotion of
world peace. This emergent movement of solidarity among the developing
countries thereby sought to challenge global power relations. The
'Bandung Spirit' henceforth came to encapsulate policies of
non-interference and developing economic cooperation among the former
colonies to end global inequality while lessening their economic and
political dependence on the West. While Bandung and the NAM embodied the
political dimensions, the Group of 77, named after the number of
countries present at the founding of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), called for the establishment of a NIEO.
The NIEO was to be achieved through tackling structural unequal
exchanges through 'a just and equitable relationship' between the goods
exported by developing countries and the goods imported, with an
emphasis on sovereignty over natural resources and the right to
nationalise key industries and to formulate their own domestic economic
policies as sovereign nations. By the 1980s, however, the developing
countries' debt crisis and the rise of neoliberalism had served to
eclipse the NIEO project. The retreat of developing countries'
solidarity was given no clearer indication than at the 1992 UNCTAD
summit, when UNCTAD dropped its demands for the adjustment of the
international patent system to the developmental needs of the global
South, and adopted a statement expressing the belief that the adoption
of adequate and effective International Patent Protections and related
efforts in the World Intellectual Property Organization and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would facilitate technological
transfers to developing countries. Henceforth, UNCTAD had been sidelined
by GATT, and its successor the WTO. **[The study finds that people have
nothing to fear from a multi-polar world. And today it seems that the
time is ripe for emerging economies to stand up and demand a greater
role in the international arena related to the formulation of politics
and economics, and in support of its historic promise to transform the
world order. There has been a historically significant global shift in
production and manufacturing from the advanced economies to the emerging
economies, altering the economic geography of the world. The tendency
over the past several decades to greatly intensify the globalisation of
production, trade and financial flows was advocated primarily as a
systemic solution to underlying structural problems in the international
political economy, including growth, terms of trade, and productivity.
But these same globalising tendencies have also enhanced the historical
potential of economic growth and industrialisation in the emerging
economies, although currently limited to only a few regions, but
expected to spread in the coming decades.]{.underline}**

capitalist economy, **[developing regional and transcontinental linkages
that are [reconfiguring global trade]{.mark}, investment [and financial
flows]{.mark}.]{.underline}** First in the 1960s, economic changes began
in the East Asian region and later on in the 1990s, growth spread to
other developing countries like Brazil, China, India, South Africa and
Turkey. **[The systemic restructuring has primarily been driven by East
Asia, which has experienced a process of economic expansion, the
duration of which have been remarkable by historic standards. Beginning
with Japan's rapid economic transformation in the 1950s and 1960s, a
regional development dynamic was set into motion that spread
successively, in wave-like formations, to the Newly Industrialised
Countries and moreover, over the last four decades, to spectacular
growth in China.]{.underline}** [Varying initial conditions, historic
pathways and a combination of both state and markets have produced
positive results in East Asia. There are uneven country-to-country
developmental outcomes, distinguishing first and second wave
industrialising from third and fourth wave countries that are climbing
the ladder but are not far from catching-up with the most developed
economies]{.underline}. (Siddiqui, 2020c) Growing financial power
derived from cumulative surpluses is another important feature of the
rebalancing of the world economy, which has been accentuated by the
deepening economic crisis in the European Union, Brexit and in the USA.
Nonetheless, [a coherent process has been at work, unfolding over time
and space to most of the region, with global effects. East Asia's
aggregate share of constantly increasing world GDP (in PPP), which was
negligible in the 1950s, has thus risen from around 10% in 1980 to 30%
in 2015. China's share has grown from 2% to over 18%. Over the same time
period PPP per capita GDP in current international dollars was
multiplied by 14 in South Korea, by over seven in Singapore and
Thailand, by six in Malaysia and Indonesia, and by 39 in China (from
US\$250 to US\$9380 in 2019)--a spectacular increase that reflects the
intensity of growth and its cumulative impact. By the end of 2020 East
Asia's share of world GDP (in PPP) is expected to reach 32%, with China
accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total. In South Asia, India's
world share has risen from 2.5% to 5.5%, and per-capita GDP has
increased by a factor of 14, from \$419 dollars to \$3800 dollars today
(in current US dollars). Asia's aggregate share of world GDP (in PPP) is
thus projected to approach 46% in a few years. When other major
re-emerging countries and world regions -- **[Brazil, India, Turkey,
Mexico, and South Africa are taken into account, despite]{.mark} the
[Covid-]{.mark}19 setback[, their]{.mark} world [output]{.mark} share in
2020 [is expected to exceed 55%.]{.mark} Over the past two decades, East
Asia region has thus been the main source of world growth and has
emerged as increasingly trade and investment linkages. Growing financial
power derived from cumulative surpluses is another important feature of
the rebalancing of the world economy, which has been accentuated by the
deepening economic crisis in the European Union, Brexit and in the USA.
[We are witnessing the end of the long historical cycle during which
wealth and power were concentrated in the hands of a small number of
countries]{.mark} in Europe, North America and Japan.**]{.underline}
(Siddiqui, 2019a; also Siddiqui, 2012b) [The hierarchical international
system constructed in the last three hundred years, that was centred in
Europe, and which instituted a global division of labour dividing the
world into dominant cores and dependent peripheries, [is giving way to a
multi-polar world.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, the USA's Cold War
strategy required a few regions of secure and prosperous states in
Northeast Asia to contain the Soviet Union and China, until the late
1960s Sino-Soviet border tension, and to minimise any possibility of
radical movement in the region. (Siddiqui, 2017b) This is also true of
China, which, because of its scale, nonetheless constitutes a special
case. Gradual integration into the world capitalist economy and
export-led industrialisation modelled on the neo-mercantilist strategies
of earlier East Asian developmental states has generated intense growth
and real GDP gains over long periods. The capitalist transformation has
simultaneously led to spatial polarisation, large-scale continental mass
migrations, sharp new social stratifications and major problems of
environmental sustainability linked to energy use and urbanisation.
Sustained growth, fuelled by transnational investment flows, has been
made possible by the mobilisation and exploitation of a vast subordinate
labour force, notably women concentrated in low value-added activities,
raising crucial issues of gender and class. While they highlight the
need for vigorous corrective measures, without which a country's
development is likely to be compromised, these problems do not call into
question the fact that the strategy followed since 1978 has been broadly
successful. China's pathway bears some analogies to US economic
expansion in the 19th century, which was fostered by transnational flows
and relied on the exploitation of slave labour until the mid-19th
century, and of low wage immigrant labour in the latter part of the
century. This comparison is not meant to justify disciplinary Chinese
labour policies, although there are currently some signs of relaxation,
much less the authoritarian regime that is engineering capitalist
transformation. It merely points to the fact that China, through the
exploitation of its rural and most backward regions, is following the
path of earlier successful European Capitalism. Soon after the communist
revolution in China in 1949, the country faced enormous challenges,
seeking to overcome severe underdevelopment, widespread malnutrition and
illiteracy, and the Western monopoly over technology. It promoted
reforms to encourage growth and economic development such as the
government's introduction of radical land reforms, compulsory primary
education, and the availability of primary health care for all its
citizens. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of the 'open policy towards
the West' expressed this as: "Our country must develop. If we do not
develop then we must be bullied. Development is the only hard truth."
China's political orientation has been shaped by its history of
subjugation by foreign powers since the mid-19th century, also known as
the "century of humiliation", and anti-imperialist struggles for
national liberation. In the 1950s and 1960s, China extended support to
developing countries due to the collective struggle of formerly
colonised and oppressed nations against global inequality brought by the
West. Four decades later, [the success of the Chinese economic reform is
undeniable, and it is even noted that such a rapid economic
transformation has never happened in human history in such a short
period. According to the World Bank, China has lifted nearly 800 million
people out of poverty, more than ever happened in human history, and
generated "the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in
history". China's GDP growth has averaged 10% annually for over forty
years, without crises, with the country becoming a world leader in
manufacturing, technology and innovation. In mater of just two life
spans, from being extremely poor to an international power, China is now
predicted to overtake the US in GDP terms in the next fifteen years.
Measured in terms of PPP, China's economy already surpassed the US in
2018.]{.underline} Since the last decade[, **[the US-China trade
imbalance has been rising against the US]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[as
shown in Figure 1.]{.underline}** The US has blamed China and claimed it
is due to the Chinese policy of currency manipulation. (Siddiqui, 2020b)
After Donald Trump became President of the US in 2017, he initiated a
rise in tariffs against certain Chinese products and also threatened
more trade sanctions against China and Russia. However, a number of
studies have pointed out that the US trade deficit rose not only with
China but with Europe and Japan as well (see Figure 2). Therefore, the
persistence of trade imbalances trends must be seen as a US domestic
policy, rather than putting the blame on others. I argue that a
disparity in real costs is the root cause of the US-China trade
imbalance. [Figure 1, which shows the trade in goods between the US and
China, indicates that the US has had trade deficits in goods with China
since the early 1990s, which has grown substantially. For example, the
deficit was only US\$10 billion in 1990, but by 2000 had reached US\$100
billion; by 2005 it had risen further to US\$200 billion, by 2012 it was
US\$ 315 billion, and by 2017 it had reached US\$376 billion. The
sharpest rise was since 2001, which also coincided with China joining
the WTO. For example, China's exports to the US increased from US\$125
billion to US\$505 billion, while US exports to China increased only
US\$19 billion to about US\$130 billion for the same
period.]{.underline} \[figure omitted\] Figure 2 indicates that China is
an important trading partner for the US, but that **[China still has
less than half of the US's overall trade deficits]{.underline}**. For
example, in 2017 the US's trade deficit with China was US\$ 375 billion;
however, its overall trade deficit was US\$ 775 billion. This means that
**[even if the US were to eliminate its trade deficit with China, its
trade imbalance problems would still exist.]{.underline}** \[figure
omitted\] The US trade deficit and also external payments kept on rising
as shown in Figure 3, and has grown remarkably over the last two
decades. This was coincident with the period when China joined WTO,
which appears to have given the US an excuse to blame China for raising
its trade deficits. The US trade deficit with China and other countries
are shown in Figure 2. Since 1990, the labour and total factor
productivity in the advanced economies has witnessed negative growth,
while in the emerging economies including China it has grown steadily,
as indicated in Figure 5. \[figure omitted\] The US-China trade war has
facilitated the establishment of Russia as China's top strategic
partner. This also led Russian oil to be redirected from European
countries to China. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced in Russia in
2019 the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), both countries signed to
develop bilateral trade and cross-border payments using the Rouble and
Renminbi, bypassing the US dollar. (Siddiqui, 2020d) \[Figure Omitted\]
As China overtook the US as the worlds' largest economy, a multi-polar
world could be a welcome development for all, especially the developing
countries. According to Fortune 2018, [among global 500 top businesses,
the China has moved into second position only behind the US (see Figure
4). The IMF has said that in 2019 China displaced the US as the world's
largest economy. The IMF's estimation is made on a purchasing power
parity (PPP) basis, meaning that it takes into account the differing
prices in both countries. Therefore, if at present 1 US\$ is worth
Chinese 6.1 Renminbi on the foreign exchange market, it means that 6.1
Renminbi can buy much more in China than one dollar can buy in the US
market. Hence, the PPP comparison makes adjustments for this, and this
is why the Chinese economy is much larger than the measure most commonly
used by international organisations and media, which simply converts
China's GDP to US dollars at the official exchange rate.]{.underline}
\[figure Omitted\] [China is playing a very assertive and leading role
in global affairs. It has launched the trillions of dollars on 'Belt and
Road Initiative' -- called "the largest single infrastructure programme
in human history]{.underline}." The BRI involves over 70 countries and
1700 developmental projects, connecting Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin
America (Siddiqui, 2019c), while the US is facing economic stagnation
and decline, and is losing international control. The US President
Donald Trump in 2019 increased military spending rapidly to US\$ 716
billion and has brought into his cabinet extreme hawks and anti-China
hardliners such as Mike Pompeo and Peter Navarro. For US policy makers
and elites, rather than accepting this new challenge, they see it as a
threat to their world domination, and have formulated a recent policy
known as the "containing China" policy. Similarly, three-quarters of a
century earlier, the US took over as the leader of the capitalist world,
declared the Soviet Union as its main enemy, and began an arms race with
the Soviet Union. However, at that time the Soviet economy was
one-quarter of the size of the US. But now the situation is very
different, the Chinese economy is currently bigger than the US and also
has huge amounts of trade and a current account surplus. Even [after the
Covid-19 set back, the Chinese economy has not only recovered, but began
growing into the fastest economy in the world. Moreover, China has
emerged as the top investor country in the world in recent years. China
is a rising power, but they do not seem to be interested in building an
empire. For example, China's billon US dollar investment commitment to
'one belt one road', and it becoming the largest investor in Africa,
while the West has still not recovered from the 2008 financial crisis
and the more recent Covid-19 epidemic.]{.underline} It seems that due to
the long-term consequences of the COVID crisis, public debt in most
developed economies will rise sharply. In fact, the 2008 financial
crisis increased government debt in the US and EU. (Siddiqui, 2020c;
also Siddiqui, 2019b) We think of the financial crisis as a temporary
shock that the developed economies barely recovered from, but as we look
at the current crisis, it will increase government debt greatly compared
to the GDP. This is a legacy that will remain for a long time and will
pose very pressing policy questions. As we think about the future of
developed economies, in the US and EU, we have to ask ourselves how we
will be dealing with a level of government debt that will exceed, as a
share of GDP, the amount we had at the end of World War II. The
management of this new massive debt through the policy response in the
aftermath of the crisis will shape Western society, determining the
economic balance between generations, the actual opportunities for
future generations, and the technological disruption and transformation
that was already in place before this outbreak. VI. Conclusion As we
have discussed, [**[the new globalisation cycle]{.mark} that began in
the late 20th century [has led to an unexpectedly rapid]{.mark}, albeit
still incomplete, [rebalancing]{.mark}** between emerging and advanced
economies. East Asia has been the main driver of a systemic change that
is leading to new transnational linkages between Asia, Africa and Latin
America. These new patterns of interaction are part of a broad process
of gradual decentring and restructuring of the world economy that, at
the political level, is leading to a diffusion of power. Domestic or
international events, for instance a hypothetical but not unthinkable
Chinese overreach in the South China Sea leading to sustained
inter-state tensions, might slow but are unlikely to halt a
transformation that is embedded in globalisation and has become one of
its driving forces.]{.underline} The rapid economic development in the
emerging economies has been dynamically restructuring world capitalism
from within. It conforms to one of the historic aims of generations of
anti-colonial leaders and thinkers, gaining upward mobility and
achieving sovereign equality, the way in which it is occurring
represents a rather sharp break with the past. But unlike the first
generation of postcolonial leaders, who aimed for revolution or sought
to invent a 'Third Way' between capitalism and communism, and the
framers of the NIEO who challenged the intellectual and material
foundations of the post-1945 world order, the actors of the current
shift in global power relations are claiming a central competitive place
in the world capitalist system that their predecessors had attempted to
either reform or supplant. (Dos Santos, 1970) The success of that claim,
and their consequent implications for current and future global system
management, has dampened and in some cases entirely submerged the
broader emancipatory or universalistic dimensions of the long struggle
for independence, equality and justice. The rapid economic development
in the emerging economies has been dynamically restructuring world
capitalism from within. It conforms to one of the historic aims of
generations of anti-colonial leaders and thinkers, gaining upward
mobility and achieving sovereign equality, the way in which it is
occurring represents a rather sharp break with the past. It has now been
sixty-five years since the historic Bandung Conference of 1955, rightly
regarded as a milestone in the formation of SSC as a global political
movement. The SSC as a movement intended to challenge the
Northern-dominated political and economic system and, from the 1950s to
the present, has been through a series of starts and stops, surges and
retreats. As expressed at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung
in 1955, the newly decolonised countries of the global South emphasised
economic and political cooperation, human rights, and the promotion of
world peace. This emergent movement of solidarity among the developing
countries thereby sought to challenge global power relations. The
'Bandung Spirit' henceforth came to encapsulate policies of
non-interference and developing economic cooperation among the former
colonies to end global inequality while lessening their economic and
political dependence on the West. While Bandung and the NAM embodied the
political dimensions, the Group of 77, named after the number of
countries present at the founding of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), called for the establishment of a NIEO.
The NIEO was to be achieved through tackling structural unequal
exchanges through 'a just and equitable relationship' between the goods
exported by developing countries and the goods imported, with an
emphasis on sovereignty over natural resources and the right to
nationalise key industries and to formulate their own domestic economic
policies as sovereign nations. By the 1980s, however, the developing
countries' debt crisis and the rise of neoliberalism had served to
eclipse the NIEO project. The retreat of developing countries'
solidarity was given no clearer indication than at the 1992 UNCTAD
summit, when UNCTAD dropped its demands for the adjustment of the
international patent system to the developmental needs of the global
South, and adopted a statement expressing the belief that the adoption
of adequate and effective International Patent Protections and related
efforts in the World Intellectual Property Organization and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would facilitate technological
transfers to developing countries. Henceforth, UNCTAD had been sidelined
by GATT, and its successor the WTO. **[The study finds that people have
nothing to fear from a multi-polar world. And today it seems that the

and demand a [[greater role in the international
arena]{.underline}]{.mark} related to the formulation of politics and
economics, and in support of its historic promise to transform the world

production and manufacturing from the advanced economies to the emerging

primarily as a systemic solution to underlying structural problems in
the international political economy, including growth, terms of trade,
and productivity. But these same globalising tendencies have also
enhanced the historical potential of economic growth and
industrialisation in the emerging economies, although currently limited
to only a few regions, but **[[expected to spread in the coming
