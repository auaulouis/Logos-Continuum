#### R&D solves pandemic preparedness

Washington, D.C., metro area where she has access to Capitol Hill

[Federal agencies, Congress and the White House must jointly foster
improved research and development for pandemic preparedness and
response]{.underline}, experts said during a recent webinar hosted by
the Capitol Hill Steering Committee on Pandemic Preparedness & Health
Security.

"Over the last two years, [the United States and the rest of the world
have]{.underline} really [seen the immense value of research and
development in terms of new tools technologies, drugs and vaccines to
combat infectious disease threats]{.underline}," said panel moderator
Anita Cicero, deputy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health
Security, which manages the steering committee. 

"[It's vital to examine how federal agencies, Congress and the White
House can reimagine how they work with each other and the private sector
to foster greate]{.underline}r agility, speed, inno[vation and
coordination in research and development for pandemic
readiness,"]{.underline} Cicero said during the Nov. 17 webinar,
"Modernizing Research & Development for Pandemic Readiness."

Former U.S. Rep. Susan Brooks (R-IN), an honorary founding member of the
steering committee, pointed out that [the United States is "completely
and rightly" considered a global leader in R&D and in technological
innovation. ]{.underline}

"Yet, during my tenure in Congress, it was clear that [the federal
bureaucracy was often not known for being nimble or for its transparency
or its ability to work outside]{.underline} the [rigid
guidelines]{.underline} and meet funding mechanisms with non-federal
partners," said Brooks. "However, what the COVID-19 pandemic did show us
is that t[he federal government is quite capable of harnessing
biomedical innovation with the private sector to deliver effective
vaccines]{.underline} and therapeutics [faster than we ever thought
possible."]{.underline}

In fact, [during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has
robustly funded public-private partnerships]{.underline}, which Brooks
said have the potential to improve the nation's ability to detect and
contain deadly pathogens.

"So, [in order to be better prepared for future threats and]{.underline}
potentially [prevent future pandemics, we have to modernize our research
and development,]{.underline} we have to [leverage new technologies and
incentivize collaboration]{.underline}," she said. "And we must
incorporate this reality across the many federal agencies that are
involved."

Toward that goal, said Brooks, the questions now are: [What structural
changes are needed; what funding is required; what strategies must be
institutionalized; and how can the government efficiently lead and
coordinate these efforts?]{.underline}

[One answer]{.underline}, according to Dr. Eric Lander, director of the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, [is the American
Pandemic Preparedness Plan,]{.underline} which the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [released]{.underline} in September [for transforming
U.S. capabilities to prepare for and respond rapidly and effectively to
future pandemics and other high-consequence biological
threats.]{.underline}

Lander said [the whole-of-government plan]{.underline}, which among
numerous goals authorizes \$65 billion over a decade, [aims to achieve
these capabilities by a systematic effort and shared vision for
biological preparedness across the federal government.]{.underline} 

For instance, [many agencies must be involved along with
Congress]{.underline}, which provides the legislative authority, [and
the White House, including the Department of Defense, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS]{.underline}), Lander said. Together, th[ey must coordinate on
getting out vaccines and therapeutics quicker; providing early warning
systems]{.underline} to identify earlier the appearances of viruses with
pandemic potential; [providing real-time monitoring]{.underline} on
where such viruses are headed; [and innovating on personal protective
equipment (PPE),]{.underline} for example.

Specifically, [several of the five key areas necessary to protect the
United States against biological threats]{.underline}, according to the
plan, [include dramatically improving and expanding the U.S. arsenal of
vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics; ensuring situational awareness
about infectious-disease threats, for both early warning and real-time
monitoring; and building core capabilities, including PPE, stockpiles
and supply chains, biosafety and biosecurity, and regulatory
improvement.]{.underline}

[Leading in biotechnology is crucial for many U.S. economic and
strategic goals]{.underline}; however, [the U.S. must balance these with
necessary regulation and oversight.]{.underline} Geopolitical events,
such as global pandemics or great power competition, can also influence
this balancing act. How can leaders strike the right balance to attain
maximal benefit and prosperity for the United States? It was also clear
that professionals in the biological sciences should play a role in
determining this balance, potentially through organizations such as the
National Academies that bridge the scientific and policy communities. 12
[Responsible leadership is a central factor in establishing the
necessary oversight starting at labs and extending to the
intergovernmental sphere. Biotechnology and biosecurity regimes call for
principled leadership that is responsive to scientists, policymakers,
and stakeholders across institutions. Engaged leaders devise whole of
enterprise solutions]{.underline}, an issue noticeably lacking with
COVID-19 and a theme which will certainly appear in the future.
Accordingly, oversight from knowledgeable leaders is a vital force in
crafting policy [that will spur innovation to build trust across
sectors. Leaders and bureaucrats setting the regulatory tone should be
mindful of striking the right balance:]{.underline} scientists who labor
under burdensome regulatory regimes may be stymied in their pursuit of
technological advancement. Leaders should avoid counterproductive
measures such as layers of oversight, redundant paperwork, or a
distrustful culture that hinder scientists' spirit of risk taking or
engagement beyond a stovepiped world. One troubling reality exists: much
of global oversight falls between seams of multinational organizations,
and cooperation from scientists and policymakers is essential to remedy
a dilemma brought further into relief by COVID-19. [There is no
ambiguity on the necessary role of scientific expertise in biosecurity
and biotechnology:]{.underline} to leverage cooperation to play an
outsized role in working beyond the sphere of geopolitical competition.
Panelists were unanimous in scientists' power to work effectively across
borders, to make friends via science. Forging relationships based on
like-minded scientific expertise creates the possibility for the
scientific community to harmonize interests that may sit uneasily
between sparring nations' heads of state. A basis for a Track 2 or 1.5
dialogue between different governments may run through the long-standing
friendships that were cultivated by scientists before the return of
great power competition. Scientist-to-scientist bonds offer policymakers
with a foundation to utilize not only for diplomatic ends, but also in
the possibility of a future global pandemic that necessitates
collaboration. [Scientific relationships will be the cornerstone for
future cooperation, even when the fires of geopolitical competition
flare up.]{.underline} Biotechnological competition with China
represents a rupture from the past and threatens American primacy in
this domain. Chinese policymakers identified biotechnology as a key
space for China to dominate. China's prioritization of biotechnology
meets multiple ends for a state poised to shape geopolitics: Chinese
biosecurity, the nation's economy, and the health of the Chinese people.
[China's strategic whole of nation investment in biotechnology aims to
unseat the United States from its place of historic control over the
material and intellectual production of biotechnology]{.underline}. In a
break from historic competitors, a rival nation-state is pouring
resources into technology development at levels that are comparable with
the United States' publicprivate funding streams. [With the arrival of a
near peer competitor in biotechnology, how should U.S. policymakers
strike the right policy balance?]{.underline} On the one hand,
stakeholders in government, philanthropy, and the private sector cannot
underestimate the magnitude of the challenge. The implications for the
United States extend beyond facing a competitor. China's military-civil
fusion, alongside torrents of state funding, aspires to fuse agents
across China into the mission of overtaking America's global position.
The stakes are clear, and the consequences of losing preeminence for
American biosecurity and economy should not be underestimated. 13 On the
other hand, engagement with Chinese scientists and policymakers should
not be dismissed out of hand. The experts agreed that China should be
encouraged to take up a partnership role in the global biosecurity and
biotechnology architecture. Evidence of Chinese willingness to
participate exist at the institutional and personal level, and the
voices on both sides of the Pacific urging cooperation should not be
squelched. An American whole of enterprise solution to compete with
China can exist in parallel with outreach efforts to prevent future
pandemics. Striking the right balance between engaging and competing
with China will not be easily executed, yet it is a policy solution that
leaders in Beijing and Washington must embrace[. A whole of sector push
to facilitate developing nations' biotechnology and biosecurity
development can garner influence for the United States]{.underline}.
[Developed countries no longer hold a monopoly over biotechnologies.
Developing countries are increasing investments in biotechnology, and
this represents an opportunity for the United States to assert global
leadership.]{.underline} [Leveraging the United States' scientific
expertise to compete against China, shape norms, and usher in a global
regulatory regime is not only a positive series of outcomes. It gestures
to a policy agenda for the America's role in the world's biotechnology
and biosecurity frontier]{.underline}. Nation-state competition is not
the only challenge facing the United States. [A pattern of panic and
neglect historically led policymakers and the public to abandon
investments in biosecurity of the order required to overcome COVID-19
and future pandemics]{.underline}. Institutions that preserve focus on
biosecurity and biotechnology must be built that strike the right
balance between encouraging oversight, elevating scientific expertise,
competing with China, and cooperating internationally. [The United
States' security, health, and economy are tethered to a biotechnological
future that demands attention, not neglect.]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Data Collaboration

#### Using data science solves

In a global crisis involving a highly transmissible novel pathogen, some
heterogeneity in national responses is to be expected. Yet the current
pandemic demonstrates that [an international framework for pandemic
detection and response that relies so heavily on the transparency,
judgment, and discretion of individual national governments leaves too
many opportunities for failure. The Task Force recommends the following
measures to improve the availability and reliability of early epidemic
threat surveillance]{.underline} and to enable rapid identification,
characterization, and tracking of emerging infectious diseases. First,
[the United States should work with other governments and civil society
partners to build and integrate national and global epidemic
surveillance systems, which would detect, share, and publicize early
signs of an outbreak in near real time.]{.underline} [This framework
should establish a voluntary, international sentinel surveillance
network]{.underline}, founded on health-care facilities around the world
that regularly share hospitalization data, using anonymized patient
information, to identify unusual trends. National voluntary sentinel
surveillance systems could target vulnerable communities---such as
nursing homes or low-income neighborhoods---which could allow for the
detection of new, dangerous outbreaks within these groups before they
became unstoppable. Participation in these international and national
sentinel networks should be incentivized with grants and technology
transfers. [Other surveillance methods being used in this and previous
outbreaks are worth expanding.]{.underline} [Wastewater surveillance to
detect the presence of certain viruses was pioneered in polio
eradication and is now being harnessed in some settings to track
coronavirus trends.]{.underline} Kinsa, which uses internet-connected
thermometers to predict the spread of the flu, has been used to identify
anomalous fever spikes that could be COVID-19 related. [These and
similar methods, known as syndromic surveillance, could be used more
broadly to identify presence of pathogens with outbreak potential, even
before people start becoming sick.]{.underline} Just as national
security agencies have expanded their activities to include and rely on
data surveillance expertise, so should public health communities. Since
2013, the CDC has fostered an open collaboration, called FluSight, to
improve the science and usability of epidemic forecasts of influenza for
public health decision-making. Proposals to create similar systems for
sharing data on epidemic threats are worthy of
support.[125](https://www.cfr.org/report/pandemic-preparedness-lessons-COVID-19/recommendations/#_edn125)
[This data should feed into an integrated global disease surveillance
data platform, created under the auspices of the Health Security
Coordination Committee. This platform should enlist participating
government agencies and relevant nongovernmental agencies to standardize
assessment of data and characterization of threats]{.underline}. It
should share the results of those assessments and raise the alarm over
any unusual trends with the UN coordinator, WHO Emergency Program, and
the general public. [This global surveillance architecture should be
linked to public health agencies in participating nations, including the
CDC, so that the data can be used to directly inform preparedness and
response activities to both global and domestic threats.]{.underline}

[Biological threats are]{.underline} inherently [difficult to
calibrate]{.underline}. In the natural environment, [emerging and
re-emerging pathogens are constantly evolving and spread
opportunistically]{.underline}. [The intentions and capabilities of
human actors]{.underline} to exploit biological agents for purposes of
terrorism and war [are also in flux]{.underline} as advancing
biotechnologies enable both state and nonstate actors to develop new
threats. Thus, bio surprise is inevitable, even when the risk is
generally acknowledged. Following the initial surprise, [rapid detection
and assessment are critical to staying ahead of the threat]{.underline}.
a. [Looking ahead]{.underline} a decade, [emerging infectious diseases
will likely intensify]{.underline}. A combination of factors, including
increased human encroachment into remote habitats and the effects of
global warming, can be expected to increase the frequency of epidemics
and pandemics. Participants agreed that the United States does not have
the luxury of preparing for one or the other (naturally-occurring or
man-made); it must be prepared for both. b. [Early warning can make a
huge difference in mitigating]{.underline} human and other
[consequences]{.underline}. [This requires broad surveillance, reliable
information, and broad information sharin]{.underline}g. The United
States and the international community have multiple capabilities in
place to look for early warning signs of an emerging public health
crisis, but these depend on a high degree of scientific competence and
credibility. Both have diminished in recent years or have failed to
adapt in the face of growing political and societal challenges to
authority and expertise. Divestment, disinformation, and outright
attacks have all been contributing factors. c. With early indicators in
hand, the role of the scientific community is to out-race the unfolding
public health crisis by rapidly characterizing the biological source,
openly sharing epidemiological data, [implementing public health
measures (such as maskwearing, contact tracing, and isolating the sick),
and developing medical therapeutics]{.underline}. [The ability to do
these has greatly advanced]{.underline} in recent years, with improved
international cooperation within the scientific community a contributing
factor. The potential pathways to medical solutions have also increased
significantly (e.g., there are currently 44 vaccines for COVID-19 in
clinical evaluation and another 154 in preclinical stages). 3. [Looking
to the future, specific actions should be in place to enable an
effective crisis response. This includes steps to enable the rapid
production and deployment of diagnostic tests, monoclonal antibodies,
antivirals, and anti-inflammatory drugs]{.underline}. [It also includes
steps to maintain a capacity for large-scale development and production
of vaccines and new therapeutic drugs.]{.underline} In addition, better
predictive models would improve the analysis of alternative
interventions; however, [these models require access to well curated and
prepositioned data sets]{.underline}. [A key challenge in accelerating
responses by the medical research community is the improved use of
research]{.underline} that has not yet been peer reviewed; some
innovative mechanisms to rapidly review, assess, and make available
worthy research are now up and running. 4. In addition, many of the
global and regional partnerships needed to respond effectively have not
worked as desired during COVID-19 and are in need of repair. These
partnerships include the following: public-private, public
health-national security, medical-law enforcement, U.S.- allies,
international organizations-member states, government-news media,
elements of the supply chain, etc. 3 5. To a significant extent,
[further revisions to national strategy will be driven by lessons
learned from the COVID-19 epidemic]{.underline}. As the pandemic tapers
off, [governmental attention and funding are likely to remain
high]{.underline}---for a while. If the past is any guide, however,
other demands will emerge, and both attention and funding will decline.
G[iven the expectation of an increased frequency of public health crises
in the future, specific actions should be taken now while there is
increased funding and public attention]{.underline} on the problem. a.
[Successful management of a health crisis requires a whole of government
response]{.underline}. Essential capabilities include the ability to
rapidly get all stakeholders to the table, generate reliable data,
quickly define required decisions and make them, rapidly identify and
cope with unexpected facets of the problem, coordinate the distribution
of limited resources, and coordinate implementation activities across
state, federal, and local lines. They also include the ability to manage
the domestic and international political dimensions of a situation,
rather than try to pretend that a public health crisis is not a
political event. The opportunity to learn and practice these skills will
improve their efficacy during a crisis. b. [Communicating effectively in
crisis is an especially important skill.]{.underline} Past crises have
repeatedly taught a lesson about the importance of communicating with
empathy. This means telling the truth, providing hope, setting
expectations, and being explicit about "the ask" of the audience. c.
Much more can be done both nationally and internationally to strengthen
existing capacities and add new capabilities. Significant gaps remain in
the global architecture of institutions and processes for managing
biological risks, whether naturally occurring or man-made. d. [The
United States should also learn from the successes of its COVID-19
response, particularly those from Operation Warp speed]{.underline}.
Many panelists commented that the speed by which vaccine candidates have
advanced to clinical trials was amazing. This success story demonstrates
how the U.S. government can help underwrite cost and risk of new vaccine
development for pharmaceutical companies.

[The prevailing approach to managing pandemic risks is to quickly detect
and respond to infectious diseases as they arise.]{.underline} The tools
for doing so have steadily improved since the 1980s. Panelists cited two
in particular: first, in the mid-1990s, U.S. and Israeli support
developed the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network, a
unified online software platform for diagnosing diseases and identifying
potential treatments. With the twin advent of genomic science and
improved computing power, [U.S. universities and federally funded
research centers developed significant bioinformatics capabilities to
aid in the processing of emergent pandemic data and the identification
of responses.]{.underline} [The widespread use of relatively
inexpensive, high throughput genomic sequencing has aided bioinformatics
efforts]{.underline} and may aid in characterizing the risks of future
pandemics. The genomes of over 2000 viruses have been sequenced thus
far, although approximately 300,000 mammalian viruses remain
unsequenced. In contrast, [success in predicting the emergence of
harmful pathogens has proved more elusive]{.underline}. A stronger
worldwide surveillance system that monitors people with novel and
unusual diseases would provide additional early warning before pandemics
emerge. However, [there are domestic and geopolitical barriers to the
development of such a surveillance system.]{.underline} Governments are
hesitant to provide external researchers with the kind of access
necessary to conduct good disease surveillance, while sustained access
might require a degree of international cooperation that is unrealistic
in an era of renewed interstate competition. In addition[, all pathogens
are somewhat unique, and the emergence of a particularly virulent
infectious diseases can overwhelm the ability of public and private
sector actors]{.underline} to prevent spread of a contagion and rapidly
produce vaccines and treatments. These challenges affect both man-made
and natural pathogens. Man-made threats are further complicated by the
dual-uses of many emerging biotechnologies which lack effective means
for establishing norms to enforce their misuse. [Early warning and
response could also be significantly improved with a better
understanding of which pathogens might infect humans and cause adverse
effects. This could contribute to efforts to anticipate natural
pathogens as well as potential man-made threats. A framework for
understanding the movement of pathogens from animal to human hosts would
involve several aspects]{.underline}, including identifying whether
animals and humans share particular cell receptors that would allow for
infection, the intracellular components that would allow viruses to
replicate, and the mechanism of cross-species transmission. [Panelists
also identified the importance of studying single- and double-stranded
RNA and DNA viruses to better understand their replication]{.underline}.
[The U.S. government through DARPA and other funding has sponsored
several efforts to develop tools for anticipating future
pandemics]{.underline}. Nevertheless, such efforts must contend with the
unique attributes of otherwise related pathogens. For instance,
SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes [COVID-19, proved to be
more infectious and more harmful than other coronaviruses.]{.underline}
5 Nevertheless, panelists emphasized that it was too costly an effort to
study all identified viruses to understand potential risks. A more
fruitful approach was to invest in better global biosurveillance to
filter out "signals" from "noise"---that is, to leverage the
capabilities of the global health community to provide credible early
warning when potential pathogens first begin to spread. While there is
national interest in anticipating emerging threats, participants did not
identify a clear path forward for U.S. government efforts. [One
recommendation was that the U.S. Intelligence Community reassess its
standards for confidence when making judgments about potential pandemic
risks. Excessively high confidence requirements for community acceptance
of judgments could]{.underline}, the argument goes, [limit further study
of a potential threat. Another recommendation was to leverage artificial
intelligence and computing capabilities to better mine large data
sources for insight into emergent threats.]{.underline}

account for BARDA) for COVID-19 related R&D, including vaccine R&D. In
addition, over \$50 billion in PHSSEF funding has been made
available]{.underline} until September 24, 2024 [for a broad set of
medical countermeasures and surge capacity purposes, including for the
development, manufacture, and purchase of vaccines and related
supplies.]{.underline} Separately[, FDA has received broad supplemental
appropriations for its regulatory and other activities]{.underline}.
[ARPA (P.L. 117-2) further provides appropriations that can be used for
activities under this heading]{.underline} (all ARPA funds are mandatory
appropriations): • [Section 2303 provides \$6.05 billion to
HHS]{.underline}, available until expended, for research, development,
manufacturing, production, and the purchase of vaccines, therapeutics,
and ancillary medical products and supplies---available for COVID-19 (or
SARS-CoV-2), its variants, and any disease with potential for creating a
pandemic. • [Section 2304 provides \$500 million to FDA,]{.underline}
available until expended, for a broad set of activities, including for
its review of the performance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines;
inspection of vaccine manufacturing facilities; and oversight of the
vaccine supply chain. • [Section 3101 provides \$10
billion]{.underline}, available until September 30, 2025, [for
activities under the Defense Production Act with respect to medical
supplies and equipment for the pandemic]{.underline}, including for
vaccines and related supplies. Funds can support the purchase,
production, and distribution of such supplies. After September 30, 2022,

Moreover, [countries that receive U.S. military systems are not just
buying equipment off the shelf; they are entering into a longer-term
relationship]{.underline} with that country [for training, maintenance,
and sustainment.]{.underline} This is similar to when a consumer buys a
smart phone, as they are not simply buying a piece of hardware; they are
reliant on the company to access its broader ecosystem of apps and
software and trusting the company to safeguard important data. Over
time, a consumer becomes locked in and dependent on a particular
provider. Similarly, [when a state commits to expanding
military-to-military ties]{.underline}---often the most sensitive area

country]{.underline}. [As they base their military on U.S. equipment and

assistance]{.underline} provided to clear unexploded ordnance has

One of America's most important foreign policy tools is not fit for
purpose. [U.S. security sector assistance]{.underline} --- [the means by
which the United States strengthens alliances and partners --- is stuck
in the past]{.underline}. Crucially[, it is out of sync with U.S.
priorities when it comes to where resources are needed most and the
types of capabilities required]{.underline} by America's allied and
partners. Despite widespread agreement on the need to prioritize
strategic competition with Russia and China, the United States still
directs a disproportionate amount of assistance toward the Middle East.
An emphasis on counter-terrorism since 9/11 has also contributed to an
emphasis on building the wrong capabilities. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is not equipping allies]{.underline} and partners
[with the capabilities they need to deal with]{.underline} competitors

[prioritizes]{.underline}, plans, [and executes security sector
assistance]{.underline}, and that it become more adept at using
assistance for signaling purposes. This in turn will necessitate that
the executive and legislative branches work together to expand the
resources for security assistance or to slay the sacred cows that
account for the misuse of the resources currently available. In taking
these steps, [the U.S. government should ensure that
assistance]{.underline} is delivered in a way that [reinforces, rather
than neglects, its fundamental commitment to democracy and human
rights,]{.underline} for ignoring these values cedes valuable ground to
America's competitors. Signs of a Gradual Shift The United States
provides security sector assistance to foreign civilian and military
forces, agencies, and institutions ranging from local law enforcement
and judicial systems to standing militaries. [This assistance is
intended to strengthen U.S. access to key territories and facilities,
shape partners' national security decision-making and governance, and
build their capacity]{.underline} and capabilities for use [against
shared threats and adversaries]{.underline}. [It also promotes the U.S.
defense industry via arms transfers, supports the infrastructure and
operations of multilateral organizations such as NATO, and increases
military interoperability.]{.underline} [The State Department implements
assistance across the entire security sector,]{.underline} including
organizations responsible for defense, law enforcement, and security of
key assets like ports and borders. [The Department of Defense has a
narrower mandate, and provides assistance to partner militaries under
the umbrella of security cooperation]{.underline}. The Pentagon also
engages in a range of other activities --- combined exercises, staff
talks, port visits, and officer exchanges --- that fall under security
cooperation as well. We use the term security sector assistance for
simplicity, and distinguish where these additional security cooperation
activities are relevant. The U.S. government does not typically define
[Foreign Military
Sales](https://www.dsca.mil/programs/foreign-military-sales-fms) as
assistance, but we believe it should, and that it ought to factor Direct
Commercial Sales into its assistance planning as well. Both types of
sales can lead to sustained U.S. engagement with a partner in the form
of training, maintenance, and sustainment for the purchased items. Over
the last several years, [the national security enterprise]{.underline}
[has]{.underline}, with a great many fits and starts, [endeavored to
shift its broader focus --- from weapons systems to
diplomacy]{.underline} --- away from counter-terrorism and toward
strategic competition with state actors. As part of this shift,
[policymakers]{.underline} have [attempted to realign security
assistance to contribute more directly to strategic
competition,]{.underline} primarily [by creating new resources for
security assistance in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}.
[The [European Deterrence
Initiative](https://www.eucom.mil/document/39921/fy-2020-european-deterrence-initiative-fact-s)]{.underline},
launched in 2014, has [allocated around \$6 billion annually to enhance
America's deterrent posture vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline}. It has been
supplemented by the [Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative](https://securityassistance.org/content/%22ukraine%20security%20assistance%20initiative%22),
authorized by Congress in Fiscal Year 2016 to provide \$250 million in
security assistance to bolster Ukraine's security. Congress also created
[the [Southeast Asia Maritime Security
Initiative](https://www.defensenews.com/home/2015/05/30/carter-announces-425m-in-pacific-partnership-funding/)]{.underline}
in 2014, later re-designated as the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security
Initiative, and funded it as a five-year, \$425 million security
assistance effort, which it has since extended through FY2025. This
[program is intended to improve the ability of Southeast and East Asian
nations to address growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China
Sea.]{.underline} In the FY2021 defense bill currently being finalized,
Congress is set to authorize a [Pacific Deterrence
Initiative](https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/the-pacific-deterrence-initiative-peace-through-strength-in-the-indo-pacific/),
modeled on the European Deterrence Initiative, with as much as [\$6
billion
annually](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/06/11/senate-panel-oks-6-billion-military-fund-to-confront-china/)
to improve U.S. posture in the Asia-Pacific region, reportedly with a
significant security assistance component. [These efforts have been
laudable, but far from sufficient. The European Deterrence
Initiative]{.underline} has largely been used to [shift enduring
costs](https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688849.pdf) for U.S. military
presence in Europe into the Overseas Contingency Operations portion of
the defense budget. It has also [dedicated]{.underline} the vast
majority of funds to posture and equipment pre-positioning, with [little
attention to security assistance beyond combined exercises --- a
significant missed opportunity]{.underline}. The Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative has been managed insularly by the U.S. Europe
Command, which has bypassed synchronization with other Defense
Department and U.S. government stakeholders, leading to a
[focus](https://www.ponarseurasia.org/memo/washington-security-assistance-kyiv-improving-long-term-returns-military-investments-ukraine)
on the provision of "training and equipment at the expense of developing
a long-term strategic vision and implementation of meaningful defense
reform." [In the Asia-Pacific, the Maritime Security Initiative has
shown promise, but its relatively limited funding has failed to
significantly contribute to a rebalance of assistance toward the
region]{.underline}, and it has largely funded projects with little
deterrent value. Incoming U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Philip
Davidson
[declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/world/asia/south-china-sea-navy.html),
"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all
scenarios short of war with the United States." Moreover[, none of these
initiatives have prioritized partner security sector governance --- a
vital element of any strategy]{.underline} that seeks to shape the
behavior of U.S. allies and partners. [As Congress considers the Pacific
Deterrence Initiative, it is essential that these mistakes --- failure
to integrate security assistance]{.underline} with other instruments of
national power, [overemphasis on posture at the expense of cooperation,
and too little ambition]{.underline} for assistance initiatives --- [are
not repeated.]{.underline} Even avoiding them, however, will go only so
far in terms of optimizing security sector assistance for the challenges
ahead. The U.S. government should also address broader challenges with
the way security sector assistance is prioritized and executed.

### Solvency -- Science Diplomacy

#### DoS solves science diplomacy

[Science diplomacy (SD), a transformative tool of soft power that
combines knowledge-based, technologically enabled problem-solving with
international political agency, is underutilized but
indispensable]{.underline}.  In the face of the negative attributes of
globalization -- including polarization and the tendency to socialize
the costs while privatizing benefits -- [SD alone offers the prospect of
engaging shared interests to overcome political constraints and enlarge
international cooperation.]{.underline}  Notwithstanding conventional
convictions and the present spike in the incidence of armed conflict,
there are no military solutions to the world's most pressing problems --
security is much more than a martial art.  Accordingly[, sustaining
broadly based development, bridging digital divides and responding to
the needs of the poor must become priorities for both diplomacy and
international policy.]{.underline} Unfortunately, they are not.

[The]{.underline} [situation is not entirely bleak. Some specialized
agencies]{.underline} (UN, EU) and governments (US,
UK, [Switzerland](http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2014/swiss-science-diplomacy),
Spain, Japan and NZ) [have demonstrated a number of best practices in
SD]{.underline}. New Zealand's Chief Science Advisor, Peter Gluckman,
has worked tirelessly to establish an International Network of
Government Science Advice ([INGSA](http://www.ingsa.org/)). [Vaughan
Turekian, the Science and Technology Advisor at the US State Department,
has launched a raft of
innovative [initiatives](http://www.state.gov/e/stas/c51577.htm).]{.underline}
The SESAME

Jordan is co-managed by a group of countries not known for their habits
of cooperation -- Palestine, Israel, Turkey and Cyprus, among others.
Iran is no longer pursuing nuclear weapons development, and Syria's
chemical weapons program has been wound down. Still, these examples
represent the exceptions rather than the rule.

[It is long past time that science diplomacy, and international S&T more
generally, became the preoccupation of both foreign ministries and
international organizations, with priorities and resources reallocated
accordingly.]{.underline}

#### The DoS is comparatively better for international diplomacy

In most circumstances, [the Department of Defense (DoD) should not serve
as the most visible face of the United States overseas.]{.underline}
This is particularly true in areas where the public feels threatened by
American power.

[The Middle East is one area where polls show distrust of American
motives]{.underline} and concern that America seeks to dominate the
region militarily. Indeed, according to a Pew Global Attitudes Project
survey taken last year, 64 percent of Turks -- citizens of a NATO ally
-- see the United States as the greatest threat to their country in the
future[. Civilians, including those who do not work for government
agencies, are the best conduits for building trust with wary
publics.]{.underline}

[Civilians should not just be the public face of
communications]{.underline}. [They should also set strategy and tactics
that advance American foreign policy interests,]{.underline} in close
cooperation with defense officials and military commanders. [This is
officially the role of the State Department, our nation's lead agency in
making and implementing foreign policy]{.underline}. [Yet, informally,
resources drive outcomes, and the Pentagon has most of the
money.]{.underline}

Consider this: The \$100 million annual price tag of the initiative
described above is just one element of the Pentagon's communication
efforts in one country. Yet, it is equivalent to roughly one-eighth of
the State Department's entire public diplomacy budget for the entire
world.

Perhaps the DoD's new Iraq activities deserve this level of prominence
-- but it is unlikely that a government-wide discussion of priorities
ever took place. Whereas \$100 million per year is big money for public
diplomats, it is small change for the military, which spends \$434
million per day in Iraq.

[The State Department, meanwhile, must meet a host of pressing concerns
ranging from short-term communication needs to long-term educational
exchanges with about \$800 million per year.]{.underline}

[Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department of Defense (DOD) has
made major contributions, both domestically and internationally, to
civilian-led preparedness and response, particularly in logistics and
planning, and numerous biomedical arenas including research, direct
clinical care, and all aspects of public health]{.underline}
[including]{.underline} a [worldwide]{.underline} network of infectious
disease research [laboratories]{.underline}. Certainly, DOD will be
called upon to augment civil authorities for future similar crises both
at home and abroad as it has been so often in the past with Ebola, SARS,
MERS, and numerous other outbreaks. Often, however, [these contributions
arise amid sudden emergency demands]{.underline}, in an ad hoc fashion,
[without adequate forward mission planning and budgeting, and without
clear backing]{.underline} in U.S. national security doctrine. And often
DOD actions have deliberately low visibility---they are soon out of
sight, out of mind---and are neither appropriately acknowledged nor well
understood. At the recent [second Global Covid-19
Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/12/2nd-global-covid-19-summit-commitments/),
organized by the White House in collaboration with heads of state
representing the G7, G20, African Union, and Caribbean Community
(CARICOM), there was no mention of DOD's special assets and recent
performance, no DOD presence among participants, and no consideration of
DOD's current and future contributions to the global response. At some
level, that omission is no surprise: the summit is first and foremost
about the civilian response. At another, it is a sign of an enduring
problem. Multiple factors account for why the DOD role is so often
obscured: [DOD is typically called upon, at short notice, to play a
temporary role addressing critical, often embarrassing
gaps,]{.underline} indeed failures, in the civilian sphere. [DOD is
itself hesitant and ambivalent]{.underline}: many within DOD do not
regard its support of pandemic response as part of its core mission,
even though its special expertise in intentional or accidental
biological events is well recognized. [Medical and public health
capabilities overwhelmed by a pandemic are fundamentally no different
from other disasters]{.underline} for which militaries routinely prepare
and respond, both domestically and internationally, when civilian
capabilities are insufficient. Yet [significant preparation and planning
are regularly exercised for many likely scenarios, such as wildfires,
tropical storms, and earthquakes, while the same is not true for
biological events.]{.underline} Certain live sensitivities are always at
play. [DOD commitments cannot be open-ended, otherwise they will
compromise DOD's core readiness and operational missions.]{.underline}
The commitments cannot be seen, either at home or abroad, as
militarizing and dominating the pandemic response. To answer these
concerns, it is critically important to clarify early what the likely
required capabilities are and how they will be resourced. When that step
has not been taken ahead of a sudden emergency, hesitation can follow.
These many important considerations notwithstanding, [DOD remaining in
relative obscurity also carries a price.]{.underline} [Often DOD's
capacities are allowed to wither after the emergency has faded,
particularly if DOD is not at the interagency table---before, during,
and after the crisis---to contribute in a sustained way to strategic
planning for future pandemics, with adequate forward
budgeting]{.underline}. If DOD's special assets are not operationally
integrated with other agencies, well in advance, into overall U.S.
health security strategies, both at home and abroad, hesitation,
ambivalence, and ad hoc decisionmaking will follow. [This all
contributes to high inefficiency and confusion, impeding an effective
DOD role.]{.underline}

#### **Approaching disease through military planning leads to militarized disease response and turns the case**

**Ticktin** 20**17** -- Miriam Ticktin is Associate Professor of
Anthropology at The New School for Social Research ("Invasive
Pathogens?: Rethinking Notions of Otherness," Social Research: An
International Quarterly, Volume 84, Number 1, Spring 2017, pp. 55-58)

Over the past 10 years, [the global north has been increasingly
bombarded by news of impending epidemics: SARS]{.underline} in 2003,
[avian flu]{.underline} in 2005, [Ebol]{.underline}a in 2013, and
[Zika]{.underline} in 2015. [One thing that has helped to stoke the fear
is]{.underline} that these are not simply viruses, but
[zoonoses]{.underline}---infectious diseases that are transmitted
between species, or more specifically, from nonhuman animals or birds to
humans. Although zoonoses are clearly not unknown phenomena---an earlier
example is HIV/ AIDS---transformations associated with the scope and
speed of human mobility and with climate change have led these
infections to [spread more quickly and widely, leading to a
fear]{.underline} not simply of epidemics, but [of **global
pandemics**]{.underline}.

Stated differently, [a threat of invasion is perceived on multiple
fronts: the rapid movement of infections across political
borders]{.underline}, but also, the movement of viruses across species
borders. In this sense, it [seems like threat is
everywhere]{.underline}, and no bodies or borders could ever be safe.
The field of biosecurity developed in response to this fear. Joseph
Masco writes that as early as 2001, after the September 11 attacks,
which were quickly followed by anthrax attacks (via letters that
contained anthrax spores), public health started to be spoken of in the
language of war, blurring the two realms: all vectors, from people to
microbes, represented future danger. Biosecurity---initially a term used
in New Zealand in the 1990s for animal and agricultural safety, to
protect livestock and crops from disease---was incorporated into the
counterterror state after 2001, and the logic of disease merged with
those of weapons of mass destruction, becoming one unified problem
(Masco 2014). That is, invasion by people and pathogens became spoken of
in the same language and framed as the same problem.

The response to this problem was the [practice of
"preparedness]{.underline}," a series of anticipatory protocols for
crisis management, with the goal of being able to respond well to
emergencies, [from pandemics to terrorist attacks to natural
disasters---all of which come to **resemble one another in the mind of
the planners**]{.underline} (Lakoff 2008).

Yet, as many scholars have argued, [regimes of biosecurity]{.underline}
and preparedness [have not]{.underline} simply [responded to terror;
they]{.underline} have actually created and [propagated it. They extend
the horizon of crisis, and manufacture an affective apparatus that works
to incite a feeling of existential threat**. Intentionally or not, they
have constructed and legitimized a militarized response to questions of
health and disease.**]{.underline} In Nathaniel Hupert's terms, it has
created an "us versus them" that anticipates foreign-born infections,
and a fear of global contagion by way of people crossing borders. This
has resulted in the closure of borders and the quarantining of certain
kinds of people. In the case of Ebola, for instance, several countries
closed their borders with Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, despite
this being deemed medically unnecessary and even counterproductive. In
the popular American press, in the face of Ebola, there were calls for a
closure of the USMexican border, demonstrating the conflation of
understandings of racial "otherness" with pathology.

Is the best way to tackle the spread of pathogens to fight them with
militarized technologies and weaponized regimes of health? Both papers
in this section respond negatively to this framing and take on the
metaphor of invasion by revisiting the medical science associated with
it. In "Who's Invading Whom? Zika and Intergenerational Public Health,"
Hupert turns our understanding of the language of invasion on its head
by rethinking epidemiological research and public health practice. He
argues that [the models we currently draw on are misguided]{.underline}.
For example, in its approach to Zika, Brazil marshaled military troops
for mass spraying of mosquito larvae, but this was not successful,
[because we now live in a connected world, and not all countries
sign]{.underline}ed [on to the "total war" approach.]{.underline} Hupert
makes a compelling argument that this framework misdiagnoses the
problem: [rather than seeing the virus as the enemy, he expands the
frame to demonstrate that Zika is the result of global
warming]{.underline} and the creation of a petroleum-based,
plastic-filled environment in which the Aedes mosquitoes (those that
carry Zika) flourish. In this sense, [the "them" in the equation of "us
versus them" is in fact us]{.underline}. We are our own worst enemy, and
[the only way to actually address the spread of such viruses is to think
more broadly, to include our own continuing damage to the
environment.]{.underline} Hupert suggests that we are invading the
health of generations to come by not addressing these longer-term,
structural issues.

David Napier also takes on the metaphor of invasion that biosecurity and
preparedness are built upon; in his paper "Epidemics and Xenophobia, or,
Why Xenophilia Matters," Napier draws on new understandings of
epigenetics, regenerative medicine, and immunology, correcting the idea
that the job of the immune system is to attack and fight against
invading pathogens, ie, to eliminate the "non-self." This was a model
that grew out of scientific findings in the 1960s and developed in the
context of the Cold War, with its associated metaphors of secret
invasion. [New findings]{.underline} challenge this model,
[show]{.underline}ing that, in fact, [the immune system goes out to
explore]{.underline}, to familiarize itself with its environment; it
specifically works [as a "search engine of difference," looking for the
unfamiliar in order to assimilate new information.]{.underline} But
Napier not only corrects our scientific understandings; he also proposes
that we use this updated science to revise our political approaches.
[Rather than assuming we should be afraid of the Other, that we are
constantly at war with difference,]{.underline} this [medical
science]{.underline} actually [shows the opposite: we require difference
in order to survive]{.underline}. Indeed, he argues, [it behooves us to
revise our politics, in line with this fact]{.underline}.

#### Securitizing [biological risks]{.underline} ties [health]{.underline} to the protection of [global capitalism]{.underline}.

Mohan J. **DUTTA, 15**. Professor and Head of the Department of
Communications and New Media at the National University of Singapore,
Adjunct Professor of Communication at the Brian Lamb School of
Communication at Purdue University. Neoliberal Health Organizing, 2015,
p. 167-169.

The [globalization]{.underline} of economies [has produced
accelerated]{.underline} patterns of [movements of capital,
goods]{.underline}, services, materials, [and labor]{.underline},
simultaneously [resulting in]{.underline} the [accelerated]{.underline}
production and [circulation of anxieties constituted around these
movements. Neoliberal organizing of health manifests itself in
the]{.underline} development and deployment of [surveillance,
management, and coordination networks that see health primarily in the
**realm of threats** posed by]{.underline} diseases dispersed through
global networks, [networks of bioterror, emerging **infectious
diseases**, and **biowarfare**]{.underline} (Salinsky, 2002). [The
response of health systems therefore is formulated in the form of
network structures of biodefense and homeland security]{.underline},
performing functions of [surveillance, information gathering,
and]{.underline} information [dissemination, constituted around the
**economic logics** of growth and efficiency]{.underline}. The
[protection of]{.underline} the economic opportunities of [globalization
becomes the function of public health systems formulated in the
**narrative of geosecurity** and implemented in the form of programs
controlled by the **police-military complex** within structures
of]{.underline} biodefense, [biosecurity]{.underline} and geosecurity.
[With this emphasis on security, the mandate for health depicts
**continuity with colonial**]{.underline} implementations of [public
health administration to manage]{.underline} erstwhile
[colonies]{.underline}, increasingly being set within the military
metaphor of health, [turning health into a geosecurity threat for the
new configurations of **empire**, and]{.underline} therefore, [deploying
**military interventions** to address health issues]{.underline}.
Consider the following depiction in a report issued by the U.S. National
Intelligence Council (NIC) that offers a picture of the global health
threats posed by infectious diseases: New and reemerging infectious
diseases will pose a rising global health threat and will complicate
U.S. and global security over the next twenty years. These diseases will
endanger U.S. citizens at home and abroad, threaten U.S. armed forces
deployed overseas, and exacerbate social and political instability in
key countries and regions in which the United States has significant
interests. (Gordon, 2000) \[END PAGE 167\] [The protection of human
health is seen as a **function of the military**, tied to the goals of
**defending global capitalism** against the threats to health and
reflecting the colonial undertones of health containment measures
deployed by]{.underline} the instruments of [empire]{.underline}. In
this instance of the report published by the NIC, [knowledge about
health is constituted in the realm of intelligence gathering to protect
the]{.underline} interests of [national security of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Framed as threats
to]{.underline} the [health]{.underline} of citizens at home and abroad
and to the health of the armed forces deployed overseas, [infectious
diseases are seen as contributors to social and political instability in
key strategic regions of]{.underline} significant [value to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. International relations are
understood in the language of security, casting interpenetrating
networks as targets of surveillance and management. The [portrayal of
infectious diseases as threats]{.underline} to geosecurity
[deploys]{.underline} valuable [health resources into the hands of the
military, placing the power of disease management under military
structures and framing the responses to disease in military
interpretations]{.underline}. Moreover, the juxtaposition of epidemic
narratives amid narratives of war and bioterror heighten the concerns
for geosecurity, foregrounding and necessitating a variety of military
response strategies (Aaltola, 2012). The interpenetrating relationship
between health and the military constitute one element of the
consolidation of power in the hands of the global elite achieved through
neoliberal transformations. [The military emerges as a global
organizational structure for the management of health]{.underline},
simultaneously [justifying the deployment of resources to the military
and the deployment of military strategies to address health issues.
This]{.underline} emphasis on the military framed within the realm of
protecting geostrategic interests [constructs health in the realm of
threats]{.underline}, simultaneously [**erasing** questions of
fundamental human rights to health]{.underline}. Similarly, in the
president\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a significant proportion of
resources are housed in the military in order to deploy
military-to-military interventions within the broader umbrella of
protecting the geostrategic interests of the United States. Consider,
for instance, the workings of the U.S. Africa Command to address HIV/
AIDS prevention as a security threat in Africa. The U.S. Africa Command
(AFRICOM) is the result of an internal reorganization of the U.S.
military command structure, creating one administrative headquarters
that answers to the Secretary of Defense and is responsible for U.S.
military relations with 53 African countries. AFRICOM recognizes that
HIV/AIDS has an enormous impact on economic and political stability
across the continent, and, by degrading military medical readiness,
weakens the national security of individual countries. HIV/ AIDS
programming will be a key component of AFRICOM\'s security cooperation
and humanitarian assistance activities. (www.pepfar.gov/about/agencies/
cl 9397.htm) \[END PAGE 168\] [Critical to the deployment
of]{.underline} a [militarized]{.underline} form of [governance in
addressing health is the consolidation of power within elite structures,
working through militarized systems]{.underline} of governance to
control disease [to protect the economic interests of the status quo.
The military]{.underline}, as an instrument of power and control,
[functions within the narratives of security cooperation and
humanitarian assistance activities to assert its **power and
control**]{.underline} in global governance. [Intelligence gathering
emerges as an instrument for the generation of data to
secure]{.underline} and protect [**zones of economic function**. This
gathering of]{.underline} targeted [intelligence and the deployment
of]{.underline} targeted [interventions becomes]{.underline}
particularly [critical within the context of maintaining open zones of
communication and economic exchange within]{.underline} the
[neoliberal]{.underline} structuring of [economic
relationships]{.underline}. Knowledge and technical interventions in
this sense are constituted amid the paradoxical agenda of needing to
protect boundaries and at the same time ensuring transnational spaces of
movement of capital, labor, services, materials, and markets. In this
chapter, we closely interrogate the meanings that circulate around the
militarization of health, and attend to the communicative processes
through which the militarization of health is achieved. The
[surveillance of spaces and the militarization of
responses]{.underline}, I argue, [are continuous with colonial logics of
controlling spaces in distant locales of imperial governance, and are
discontinuous from the colonial forms of governance because of the
paradoxes of networked flows in neoliberal governance]{.underline}.

[During the COVID pandemic, the current role of MMCC/EMC has been to use
lessons identified for its future work to support military medical
collaboration and coordination across our participating nations, NATO
and the EU.]{.underline} Our Telehealth Workshop in May 2021 is an
excellent example[. Telehealth has been a game-changer during the COVID
pandemic, and the use of telehealth has increased in different areas of
medical support]{.underline}. [Telehealth provides significant means to
measure the health of our soldiers and to improve the outcome of their
medical treatment. COVID has been a trigger for transformation in
telemedicine and telehealth.]{.underline} A follow-on Biosensor and
Telehealth Workshop is planned in June 2022 [We have just finalised an
overview of COVID vaccination policies]{.underline}. The most notable
finding is that most nations have not made COVID vaccination compulsory
for members of the armed forces (as of Sep 2021). This may be hampering
the success of vaccination programmes and reducing benefits for this
population of risk. However, the vaccines' success in preventing COVID
infection and their limited side effects may change the situation, until
a new variant of the virus appears. [MMCC/EMC is increasing its work in
civil-military cooperation for the evacuation of patients in large-scale
emergencies and in crises, including a higher number of infectious
patients.]{.underline} [We are working in close cooperation with the
NATO Joint Healthcare Working Group and other participating
nations]{.underline} on this issue[. A workshop on this topic with
participants of the responsible civilian and military stakeholders is
planned in June 2022. The MMCC/EMC was able to gain initial experience
in stockpiling concepts in April 2020, when it was asked by the
Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre
(EADRCC)]{.underline} of NATO [to develop a medical stockpiling concept
for the NATO COVID Trust Fund.]{.underline} An important part of the
concept is a calculator that can be used to compute costs, storage
space, and required personnel for each module. [The NATO COVID Trust
Fund has provided many donations based on this concept.]{.underline}
Based on these experiences, [the MMCC/EMC has extended this medical
stockpiling concept to the Military Modular Multipurpose
Epidemic/Pandemic Stockpiling (M3-EPS) Concept,]{.underline} which can
be used by EU and NATO nations and medical stakeholders[. As a surge
capacity, rapidly deployable and modular standard packages of medical
materiel have been identified and defined for stockpiling.]{.underline}
The seven modular standard packages, such as support for intensive care
units, can be used to support both military and civilian medical
facilities. For example, the bilateral support that the Bundeswehr
Medical Service provided to Portugal was based on the principles of
M3-EPS and included an ICU capability to enhance a civilian hospital.
The French medical services use a similar approach. [We hope to bring
these results into NATO standardisation work and into national
developments. We also aim to increase our preparedness with regard to
the stockpiling of CBRN chemical and radiation antidotes. If the
MMCC/EMC has the time and resources, it will develop technical
guidelines - based on existing NATO STANAGS - for deployed outbreak
investigation team, which can be used for both infectious diseases and
CBRN agents.]{.underline} We would like to combine deployable medical
CBRN capabilities and public health capabilities. [Civil-military
collaboration regarding reachback laboratories with their sophisticated
diagnostic capabilities has to be included in this concept.]{.underline}

### AT Disease

#### Disease can't cause extinction

Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity, Hachette Books,

Are we safe now from events like this? Or are we more vulnerable? [Could
a pandemic threaten **humanity**'s future?]{.underline}10

The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. In 541 CE the
Plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine Empire. Over three years it
took the lives of roughly 3 percent of the world's people.11

When Europeans reached the Americas in 1492, the two populations exposed
each other to completely novel diseases. Over thousands of years each
population had built up resistance to their own set of diseases, but
were extremely susceptible to the others. The American peoples got by
far the worse end of exchange, through diseases such as measles,
influenza and especially smallpox.

During the next hundred years a combination of invasion and disease took
an immense toll---one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90 percent of the population of the Americas
during that century, though the number could also be much lower.12 And
it is very difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed
to war and occupation, rather than disease. As a rough upper bound, the
Columbian exchange may have killed as many as 10 percent of the world's
people.13

Centuries later, [the world had become so interconnected that a truly
global pandemic was possible]{.underline}. Near the end of the First
World War, a devastating strain of influenza (known as the 1918 flu or
Spanish Flu) spread to six continents, and even remote Pacific islands.
At least a third of the world's population were infected and 3 to 6
percent were killed.14 This death toll outstripped that of the First
World War, and possibly both World Wars combined.

[Yet even events like these **fall short** of being a threat to
**humanity**'s longterm potential]{.underline}.15

\[FOONOTE\]

[In addition to]{.underline} this [**historical** evidence, there are
some **deep**er **biological** observations and theories **suggest**ing
that **pathogens are unlikely to lead to the extinction** of their
hosts. These include the **empirical anti-correlation** between
**infectiousness** and **lethality**, the **extreme rarity** of diseases
that kill more than 75% of those infected, the observed **tendency** of
pandemics to **become less virulent** as they progress and the theory of
**optimal virulence**]{.underline}. However, there is no watertight case
against pathogens leading to the extinction of their hosts.

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

[In the great bubonic plagues we saw civilization in the affected areas
falter, but **recover**. The regional]{.underline} 25 to [**50 percent**
death rate was **not enough** to **precipitate a continent-wide
collapse** of civilization]{.underline}. It changed the relative
fortunes of empires, and may have altered the course of history
substantially, but [if anything, it gives us reason to believe that
human civilization is **likely to make it through** future events with
similar death rates, **even if**]{.underline} they were
**[global]{.underline}** in scale.

The 1918 flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little apparent
effect on the world's development despite its global reach. It looks
like it was lost in the wake of the First World War, which despite a
smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the course
of history.16

It is less clear what lesson to draw from the Columbian exchange due to
our lack of good records and its mix of causes. Pandemics were clearly a
part of what led to a regional collapse of civilization, but we don't
know whether this would have occurred had it not been for the
accompanying violence and imperial rule. [The strongest case against
existential risk from natural pandemics is the **fossil
record**]{.underline} argument from Chapter 3. [Extinction risk from
natural causes above **0.1 percent per century** is **incompatible**
with the **evidence** of **how long** humanity and similar species have
lasted]{.underline}. But this argument only works where the risk to
humanity now is similar or lower than the longterm levels. For most
risks this is clearly true, but not for pandemics. We have done many
things to exacerbate the risk: some that could make pandemics more
likely to occur, and some that could increase their damage. Thus even
"natural" pandemics should be seen as a partly anthropogenic risk.

#### Disease doesn't cause extinction.

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause human extinction]{.underline}.
Firstly, [Homo sapiens have been around for **200,000
years**]{.underline} and the Homo genus for around six million years
[without being exterminated by an infectious disease, which is
evidence]{.underline} that **[the base rate of extinction-risk natural
pathogens is low]{.underline}**.82 Indeed, past disease [outbreaks have
not **come close**]{.underline} [to rendering humans
extinct]{.underline}. Although bodies were piled high in the streets
across Europe during the Black Death,83 human extinction was never a
serious possibility, and some [economists even argue]{.underline} that
it was [a boon for the]{.underline} European [economy]{.underline}.84
Secondly, [infectious disease]{.underline} has [only contributed to the
extinction of a **small minority of animal species**]{.underline}.85
[The only confirmed case of a mammalian species extinction]{.underline}
being caused by an infectious disease [is **a type of rat** native
**only to Christmas Island**]{.underline}. Having said that, the context
may be importantly different for modern day humans, so it is unclear
whether the risk is increasing or decreasing. On the one hand, due to
globalisation, the world is more interconnected making it easier for
pathogens to spread. On the other hand, [interconnectedness
could]{.underline} also [**increase immunity** by **increasing
exposure** to **lower virulence strains between
subpopulations**]{.underline}.87 Moreover, [advancements in **medicine**
and **sanitation** limit the]{.underline} potential [damage]{.underline}
an outbreak might do.

#### Selective pressures and UN reports mean risk is low.

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, there are some reasons to
believe that [natural pandemics are **very unlikely** to
cause]{.underline} human [extinction]{.underline}. Analysis of [the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list database
has shown that of]{.underline} the [833 recorded plant and animal
species extinctions]{.underline} known to have occurred [since 1500,
less than 4%]{.underline} (31 species) [were ascribed to]{.underline}
infectious [disease]{.underline}.38 [No]{.underline}ne of the
[mammals]{.underline} and amphibians on this list [were globally
dispersed]{.underline}, and [other factors]{.underline} aside
[from]{.underline} infectious [disease]{.underline} also [contributed to
their extinction]{.underline}. It therefore seems that [our own species,
which is **very numerous**, **globally dispersed**, and **capable of a
rational response**]{.underline} to problems, [is **very unlikely** to
be killed off by a natural pandemic.]{.underline} One underlying
explanation for this is that [highly lethal pathogens]{.underline} can
[kill]{.underline} their [hosts before they]{.underline} have a chance
to [spread, so there is]{.underline} a [**selective pressure for
pathogens** not to be]{.underline} highly [lethal]{.underline}.
Therefore, [pathogens]{.underline} are likely to [co-evolve
with]{.underline} their [hosts rather than kill]{.underline} all
possible hosts.39

#### No extinction -- their impacts are all media fear-mongering -- ebola proves

**Dean 14** \[Alex, \"Fear Not, Ebola Won\'t Wipe Us Out\", Spiked,
8/6/14,

// SKY

[Whenever a disease breaks out, we are bombarded with doomsday
predictions. Coverage of ebola has conformed to this
pattern]{.underline}. Major newspapers have bombarded us with page after
page of pharmaceutical puffery; some journalists speak as though we are
headed for an apocalypse. Commentary has been speculative, pessimistic
and quick to apportion blame. The Guardian's West Africa correspondent
says that 'new hotspots have flared up, fuelled by cross-border trade',
while US Republican politician Phil Gingrey has been making
unsubstantiated rants about 'illegal immigrants carrying deadly
diseases'. The head of the World Health Organisation stoked panic with
his statement that the virus 'is moving faster than efforts to control
it'. [We must compare this reportage, all these 'the end is nigh'
performances, with the reality. A quick look at hard science shows there
is a dramatic mismatch and that commentators have wildly exaggerated the
threat ebola poses.]{.underline} [We are not headed for extinction. John
Oxford, a virologist at the University of London, has explained that the
hysteria surrounding ebola is disproportionate to the threat. He points
out that ebola 'doesn't spread very easily', and that the virus's
reproductive number - how many people are infected by each carrier - is
very low. Where measles has a reproductive number of 12, ebola's number
is 1.]{.underline} Moreover, virologists have been quick to point out
that ebola is very easily destroyed, for a virus. A quick wash of the
hands and it's gone. Ebola can devastate families and communities, yes,
but when you consider that it has a low death toll compared with other
viruses in Africa, we must conclude that reports have been hyperbolic
and scaremongering. Yet this disproportionate panic over ebola was to be
expected. [We saw similar responses when swine flu broke out and the
UK's chief medical officer predicted 65,000 deaths and the media
swallowed it up, and again when the House of Lords told us that 65,000
Britons would die from bird flu. Perhaps political and medical bodies
have a duty to err on the side of caution -- to over-prepare and
over-predict -- but the media and some of the public also gobbled up
these doomsday predictions with relish.]{.underline} What's the
explanation for this? Why do some observers seem to be ravenously
awaiting the next big pandemic? Why do we want these viruses to be worse
than they are? I think some people long for doomsday predictions because
they want their anti-progress attitudes to be validated. [Ours is an era
in which we are told to fear other people for their unpredictability and
to see our fellow humans as a threat.]{.underline} Relationships are
sometimes described as 'toxic' - such is our misanthropy that we now
even describe our ultimate forms of intimacy in the language of disease.
[Today's anti-human scaremongers are desperate for their attitudes to be
affirmed, and so they exaggerate viruses which are spread through human
contact and movement]{.underline}. People convince themselves that ebola
is the result of immigration and human contact and modern forms of
travel because then their regressive attitudes feel truer, more real.
They don't see the hectic globalised world as exciting; they see it as
unnerving and are thrilled when a virus gives them reason to complain
about it. [These ridiculous attitudes have found no real affirmation,
though. Humankind will deal with ebola, and a disease spread through
contact should never serve as a reason to despise that contact: intimacy
makes life worth living and immigration and trade are the seeds of
social and economic progress. We must not allow the fearmongers to
undermine our rational convictions. Pay no attention to the
miserablists. Fear not, humankind -- we are doing okay.]{.underline}

### AT Bioterror

#### Bioterrror fails

**Pinker 18** -- Steven Arthur Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive
psychologist, Professor at Harvard University. \[Enlightenment Now: The
Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Viking, Penguin
Group\]//BPS

[Biological agents are **particularly ill-suited** to terrorists, whose
goal]{.underline}, recall, [is]{.underline} not damage but
**[theater]{.underline}** (chapter 13).58 The biologist Paul Ewald notes
that [natural selection among pathogens **works against**]{.underline}
the terrorist's goal of [sudden and spectacular
devastation]{.underline}. 59 Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person
contagion, like the common-cold virus, are selected to keep their hosts
alive and ambulatory so they can shake hands with and sneeze on as many
people as possible. Germs get greedy and kill their hosts only if they
have some other way of getting from body to body, like mosquitoes (for
malaria), a contaminable water supply (for cholera), or trenches packed
with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish flu). Sexually transmitted
pathogens, like HIV and syphilis, are somewhere in between, needing a
long and symptomless incubation period during which hosts can infect
their partners, after which the germs do their damage. [**Virulence**
and **contagion**]{.underline} thus **[trade off]{.underline}**, and
[the **evolution of germs** will **frustrate the terrorist's
aspiration** to launch a headline-worthy epidemic that is]{.underline}
both [swift and lethal]{.underline}. Theoretically, a bioterrorist could
try to bend the curve with a pathogen that is virulent, contagious, and
durable enough to survive outside bodies. But [breeding]{.underline}
such [a **fine-tuned germ** would require **Nazi-like experiments on
living humans** that even terrorists]{.underline} (to say nothing of
teenagers) [are unlikely to carry off]{.underline}. It may be more than
just luck that [the world]{.underline} so far [has seen just **one
successful bioterror attack**]{.underline} (the 1984 tainting of salad
with salmonella in an Oregon town by the Rajneeshee religious cult,
**[which killed no one]{.underline}**) and one spree killing (the 2001
anthrax mailings, which killed five).60 To be sure, advances in
synthetic biology, such as the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, make
it easier to tinker with organisms, including pathogens. But [it's
difficult to re-engineer a complex evolved trait by inserting **a gene
or two**]{.underline}, since the effects of any gene are intertwined
with the rest of the organism's genome. [Ewald notes, "**I don't think
that we are close** to understanding how to insert combinations of
genetic variants in any given pathogen that act in concert to generate
high transmissibility and stably high virulence for
humans."]{.underline}61 The biotech expert Robert Carlson adds that "one
of the problems with building any flu virus is that you need to keep
your production system (cells or eggs) alive long enough to make a
useful quantity of something that is trying to kill that production
system. . . . Booting up the resulting virus is still very, very
difficult. . . . I would not dismiss this threat completely, but frankly
I am much more worried about what Mother Nature is throwing at us all
the time."62 And crucially, [advances in biology work the other way as
well: they]{.underline} also [make it easier for the good guys \[public
protectors\]]{.underline} (and there are many more of them) [to identify
pathogens, invent antibiotics that overcome **a**nti**b**iotic
**r**esistance, and **rapidly develop vaccines**]{.underline}.63 [An
example is]{.underline} the [Ebola]{.underline} vaccine, developed in
the waning days of the 2014--15 emergency, after public health efforts
had capped the toll at twelve thousand deaths rather than the millions
that the media had foreseen. Ebola thus joined a list of other falsely
predicted pandemics such as Lassa fever, hantavirus, SARS, mad cow
disease, bird flu, and swine flu.64 Some of them never had the potential
to go pandemic in the first place because they are contracted from
animals or food rather than in an exponential tree of person-to-person
infections. Others were nipped by medical and public health
interventions. Of course no one knows for sure whether an evil genius
will someday overcome the world's defenses and loose a plague upon the
world for fun, vengeance, or a sacred cause. But [journalistic habits
and the Availability and Negativity biases **inflate the
odds**]{.underline}, which is why I have taken Sir Martin up on his bet.
By the time you read this you may know who has won.65

Challenges to Myth 5 [There are two dimensions to Myth 5. The first is
about the intention of would-be terrorists]{.underline}, [and the
assumption is that terrorists would seek to produce mass casualty
weapons and pursue capabilities on the scale of twentieth century
state-level bioweapons programs.]{.underline} While [most leading
biological disarmament and non-proliferation experts
believe]{.underline} that the risk of a small-scale bioterrorism attack
is very real and very present, they consider **[the risk of
sophisticated large-scale bioterrorism attacks to be very
small]{.underline}** (65). [This is **backed up by historical
evidence**.]{.underline} [The three confirmed attempts to use biological
agents against humans in terrorist attacks in the past were
small-scale]{.underline}, [low casualty events aimed at causing panic,
and disruption rather than]{.underline} [excessive death
tolls]{.underline}: (i) the Rajneesh cult's use of Salmonella on salad
bars in local restaurants to sicken potential voters and make them stay
away from the polls during Oregon elections in 1984; (ii) the 1990--95
attempted use of botulinum toxin and anthrax by the Japanese Aum
Shinrikyo cult; (iii) and the "anthrax letters" sent to media outlets
and members of US Congress in 2001 resulting in at least 22 cases of
anthrax, five of which were fatal (66, 67). [The second dimension to
Myth 5 is the implicit assumption that producing a pathogenic organism
equates producing a weapon of mass destruction.]{.underline} **[It does
not]{.underline}**. [Considerable knowledge and resources are necessary
for the processes of scaling up, storage, and developing a suitable
dissemination method]{.underline}. [These processes present
**significant technical and logistical barriers**. Drawing from her
in-depth study of the Iraqi, Soviet, and US bioweapons
programs]{.underline} (3, 4), Ben Ouagrham-[Gormley explains: Scaling up
fragile microorganisms]{.underline} that are sensitive to environmental
conditions and susceptible to change --- and viruses are more sensitive
than bacteria --- [has been one of the stiffest challenges for past
bioweapons programs to overcome, even with appropriate expertise at
hand.]{.underline} [Scaling-up requires a gradual approach]{.underline},
moving from laboratory sample, to a larger laboratory quantity, to
pilot-scale production, and then to even larger-scale production. During
each stage, the production parameters need to be tested and often
modified to maintain the lethal qualities of the agent; the entire
scaling-up process can take several years (68). [The dissemination of
biological agents also poses difficult technical
challenges.]{.underline} Whereas persistent chemical agents such as
sulfur mustard and VX nerve gas are readily absorbed through the intact
skin, no bacteria and viruses can enter the body via that route unless
the skin has already been broken. Biological agents must either be
ingested or inhaled to cause infection. [To expose large numbers of
people]{.underline} through the gastrointestinal tract, [possible means
of delivery are contamination of food and drinking water, yet neither of
these scenarios would be easy to accomplish.]{.underline} [Large urban
reservoirs are usually unguarded, but unless terrorists added massive
quantities of biological agent, the dilution effect would be so great
that no healthy person drinking the water would receive an infectious
dose]{.underline} (66). Moreover, [modern sanitary techniques such as
chlorination and filtration are designed to kill pathogens from natural
sources and would probably be equally effective against a deliberately
released agent.]{.underline} [Bacterial contamination of the food supply
is also unlikely to inflict mass casualties.]{.underline} Cooking,
boiling, pasteurization, and other routine safety precautions are
generally sufficient to kill pathogenic bacteria. The most likely way to
inflict mass casualties with a biological agent is by disseminating it
as a respirable aerosol: an invisible cloud of infectious droplets or
particles so tiny that they remain suspended in the air for long periods
and can be inhaled by large numbers of people. A high-concentration
aerosol of B. anthracis or some other pathogen, released into the air in
a densely populated urban area, could potentially infect thousands of
victims simultaneously. After an incubation period of a few days,
depending on the type of agent and the inhaled dose, the exposed
population would experience an outbreak of an incapacitating or fatal
illness. [Although aerosol delivery is potentially the most lethal way
of delivering a biological attack, **it involves major technical hurdles
that most terrorists would be unlikely to overcome**]{.underline}. To
infect through the lungs, infectious particles must be microscopic in
size -- between 1 and 5 μm in diameter. [Terrorists would]{.underline}
therefore [have to develop or acquire a sophisticated delivery system
capable of generating an aerosol cloud]{.underline} with the necessary
particle size range and a high enough agent concentration to cover a
broad area. Overall, an important trade-off exists between ease of
production and effectiveness of dissemination. The easiest way to
produce microbial agents is in a liquid form, yet when such a "slurry"
is sprayed into the air, it forms heavy droplets that fall to the ground
so that only a small percentage of the agent is aerosolized. In
contrast, if the bacteria are first dried to a solid cake and then
milled into a fine powder, they become far easier to aerosolize, yet the
drying and milling process is technically difficult. The Aum Shinrikyo
cult struggled with dissemination (67, 69, 70). In one of its anthrax
dissemination attempts, it sprayed unknown, but probably very large,
quantities of a liquid aerosol (most likely crude culture, unprocessed
in any way) of B. anthracis from the roof of the Aum's headquarters
building in Tokyo. For the dissemination, the Aum set up two sprayers on
the roof of the eight-story building, each within a large round cooling
tower. Pipes were extended from the cooling towers to tanks below, which
were filled with a liquid suspension of B. anthracis. The device worked
poorly, producing large droplets rather than the very fine aerosol
needed for effective transmission of anthrax. It also appears the spore
concentration was very low (at least five orders of magnitude below that
necessary for a highly infectious wet aerosol). In another dissemination
attempt, targeting the area around the Kanagawa prefectural office and
the Imperial Palace, the Aum equipped vehicles with spraying devices,
but according to prosecutors' statements, the nozzle of the sprayer
clogged and the operation failed. Despite its 200 m2 laboratory
containing, amongst other equipment, a glove box, incubator, centrifuge,
drier, DNA/RNA synthesizer, electron microscope, two fermenters each
having about a 2,000 litre capacity, and an extensive scientific
library, and despite its repeated attempts at dissemination, the Aum was
unsuccessful in causing any disease, and in retrospect it is clear that
the cult did not even make the first substantive step toward an
effective bioweapon. [If, despite the odds, aerosolization was achieved,
the effective delivery of biological agents in the open air is highly
dependent on atmospheric and wind conditions, creating additional
uncertainties.]{.underline} [Only under highly stable atmospheric
conditions would the aerosol cloud remain close to the ground where it
can be inhaled, rather than being rapidly dispersed]{.underline}.
Moreover, most [microorganisms are **sensitive to
u**]{.underline}ltra**[v]{.underline}**iolet [radiation and cannot
survive]{.underline} more than 30 min [in]{.underline} bright
[sunlight]{.underline}, limiting their use to night-time attacks. One
major exception is anthrax, which can be induced to form spores with
tough outer coats that enable them to survive for several hours in
sunlight. Terrorists could, of course, stage a biological attack inside
an enclosed space such as a building, a subway station, a shopping mall,
or a sports arena. Such an attack, if it involved a respiratory aerosol,
might infect thousands of people, but even here the technical hurdles
would by no means be trivial. [Finally, even if a biological weapon had
been disseminated successfully, the outcome of an attack would be
affected by factors like the health of the people who are exposed to the
agent]{.underline}, [and the speed and manner with which public health
authorities and medical professionals detected and were able to respond
to the resulting outbreak.]{.underline} [A prompt response with
effective medical countermeasures, such as antibodies and
vaccination]{.underline}, **[can significantly blunt the impact of an
attack]{.underline}**. [Simple, proven ways to curtail epidemics, such
as wearing face masks, hand washing, and avoiding hospitals where
transmission rates might soar, can also prove effective in stemming the
spread of a disease]{.underline}. Indeed, this aspect of a bioterrorism
attack is often underplayed in scenarios like Tara O'Toole's "Dark
Winter" and "Atlantic Storm," where the rates of contagion used are
often significantly higher than those in historical cases of natural
outbreaks (71).

Any more than diplomatic initiatives necessarily lead to good science.
[These seem to have been the broad conclusions to emerge from a
three-day meeting at Wilton Park in Sussex, UK, organised by the British
Foreign Office and the Royal Society, and attended by scientists,
government officials and politicians from 17 countries around the
world.]{.underline} The definition of science diplomacy varied widely
among participants. Some saw it as a subcategory of "public diplomacy",
or what US diplomats have recently been promoting as "soft power" ("the
carrot rather than the stick approach", as a participant described it).
Others preferred to see it as a core element of the broader concept of
"innovation diplomacy", covering the politics of engagement in the
familiar fields of international scientific exchange and technology
transfer, but raising these to a higher level as a diplomatic objective.
Whatever definition is used, three particular aspects of the debate
became the focus of attention during the Wilton Park meeting: how
science can inform the diplomatic process; how diplomacy can assist
science in achieving its objectives; and, finally, how science can
provide a channel for quasi-diplomatic exchanges by forming an
apparently neutral bridge between countries. There was little
disagreement on the first of these. Indeed for many, given the
increasing number of international issues with a scientific dimension
that politicians have to deal with, this is essentially what the core of
science diplomacy should be about. Chris Whitty, for example, chief
scientist at the UK's Department for International Development,
described how knowledge about the threat raised by the spread of the
highly damaging plant disease stem rust had been an important input by
researchers into discussions by politicians and diplomats over
strategies for persuading Afghan farmers to shift from the production of
opium to wheat. Others pointed out that the scientific community had
played a major role in drawing attention to issues such as the links
between chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere and the growth of the
ozone hole, or between carbon dioxide emissions and climate change. Each
has made essential contributions to policy decisions. Acknowledging this
role for science has some important implications. No-one dissented when
Rohinton Medhora, from Canada's International Development Research
Centre, complained of the lack of adequate scientific expertise in the
embassies of many countries of the developed and developing world alike.
Nor -- perhaps predictably -- was there any major disagreement that
diplomatic initiatives can both help and occasionally hinder the process
of science. On the positive side, such diplomacy can play a significant
role in facilitating science exchange and the launch of international
science projects, both essential for the development of modern science.
Europe's framework programme of research programmes was quoted as a
successful advantage of the first of these. Examples of the second range
from the establishment of the European Organisation of Nuclear Research
(usually known as CERN) in Switzerland after the Second World War, to
current efforts to build a large new nuclear fusion facility (ITER).
[Less positively, increasing restrictions on entry to certain countries,
and in particular the United States after the 9/11 attacks in New York
and elsewhere, have significantly impeded scientific exchange
programmes. Here the challenge for diplomats was seen as helping to find
ways to ease the burdens of such restrictions.]{.underline} The
[broadest gaps in understanding the potential of scientific diplomacy
lay in]{.underline} the third category, namely the [use of science as a
channel of international diplomacy]{.underline}, either [as a way of
helping to forge consensus on contentious issues, or as a catalyst for
peace in situations of conflict.]{.underline} On the first of these,
some pointed to recent climate change negotiations, and in particular
the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as a good
example, of the way that the scientific community can provide a strong
rationale for joint international action. But [others referred to the
failure of the Copenhagen climate summit]{.underline} last December [to
come up with a meaningful agreement on action]{.underline} as a
demonstration of the limitations of this way of thinking. It was argued
that [this failure had been]{.underline} partly [due to a misplaced
belief]{.underline} that [scientific consensus would be sufficient to
generate]{.underline} a [commitment to collective action]{.underline},
[without taking into account the political impact]{.underline} that
scientific ideas would have. Another example that received considerable
attention was the current construction of a synchrotron facility SESAME
in Jordan, a project that is already is bringing together researchers in
a range of scientific disciplines from various countries in the Middle
East (including Israel, Egypt and Palestine, as well as both Greece and
Turkey). The promoters of SESAME hope that -- as with the building of
CERN 60 years ago, and its operation as a research centre involving, for
example, physicists from both Russia and the United States -- SESAME
will become a symbol of what regional collaboration can achieve. In that
sense, it would become what one participant described as a "beacon of
hope" for the region. But others cautioned that, however successful
SESAME may turn out to be in purely scientific terms, its potential
impact on the Middle East peace process should not be exaggerated[.
Political conflicts have deep roots that cannot easily be papered over,
however open-minded scientists may be to professional colleagues coming
from other political contexts.]{.underline} Indeed, there was even a
warning that in the developing world, [high profile scientific
projects]{.underline}, particular those with explicit political backing,
[could end up doing damage by inadvertently favouring one social
group]{.underline} over another. Scientists should be wary of having
their prestige used in this way; those who did so could come over as
patronising, appearing unaware of political realities. Similarly, [those
who hold science in esteem as a practice committed to promoting the
causes of peace]{.underline} and development [were reminded of the need
to take into account how advances in science]{.underline} -- whether
nuclear physics or genetic technology -- [have also led to new types of
weaponry]{.underline}. Nor did science automatically lead to the
reduction of global inequalities. "Science for diplomacy" therefore
ended up with a highly mixed review. The consensus seemed to be that
science can prepare the ground for diplomatic initiatives -- and benefit
from diplomatic agreements -- but cannot provide the solutions to
either.

### AT Data Collaboration

#### Data collaboration fails -- effective surveillance is too hard to achieve

**Shah and Steinhardt 20**- associate professor of Medicine (Biomedical
Informatics) at Stanford University and Associate CIO for Data Science
at Stanford Healthcare AND\*\* assistant professor of Statistics at
University of California, Berkeley (Nigam and Jacob, "How data science
can ease the COVID-19 pandemic," Brookings, 4-27-20, Accessed Online at

Accessed Online on 7-4-22)

Social distancing and stay-at-home orders in the United States have
slowed the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes
COVID-19. This has halted the immediate threat to the U.S. healthcare
system, but consensus on a long-term plan or solution to the crisis
remains unclear. As the reality settles in that there are no quick fixes
and that therapies and vaccines will take several months if not years to
invent, validate, and mass produce, this is a good time to consider
another question: How can [data science and technology help us endure
the pandemic while we develop therapies and vaccines]{.underline}?
[Before policymakers reopen their economies, they must be sure
that]{.underline} the resulting [new COVID-19 cases will not force local
healthcare systems to resort to crisis]{.underline} standards of care.
[Doing so requires not just prevention and suppression]{.underline} of
the virus, [but ongoing measurement of virus activity, assessment of the
efficacy of suppression measures, and forecasting of near-term demand on
local health systems.]{.underline} This demand is highly variable given
community demographics, the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, and
population density and socioeconomics. [Data science can already provide
ongoing, accurate estimates of health system demand, which is a
requirement in almost all reopening plans. We need to go]{.underline}
beyond that [to a dynamic approach of data collection, analysis, and
forecasting to inform policy decisions in real time and]{.underline}
iteratively [optimize public health recommendations]{.underline} for
re-opening. While most reopening plans propose extensive testing,
contact tracing, and monitoring of population mobility, almost none
consider setting up such a dynamic feedback loop. Having such feedback
could determine what level of virus activity can be tolerated in an
area, given regional health system capacity, and adjust population
distancing accordingly. We propose that [by using existing technology
and some nifty data science, it is possible]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} set up that feedback loop, which would [maintain
healthcare demand under the threshold of what is available]{.underline}
in a region. Just as the maker community stepped up to cover for the
failures of the government to provide adequate protective gear to health
workers, [this is an opportunity for the data and tech community to
partner with healthcare experts and provide a measure of public health
planning that governments are unable to do.]{.underline} Therefore, the
question we invite the data science community to focus on is: How can
data science help forecast regional health system resource needs given
measurements of virus activity and suppression measures such as
population distancing? For the data science effort to work, first and
foremost, [we need to fix delays in data collection and access
introduced by existing reporting processes.]{.underline} Currently, most
departments of public health are collecting and reporting metrics that
are not helpful, and are reporting them with 48 hour delays, and often
with errors. [Although there are examples of regional excellence in such
reporting, by and large, the recommendations from the health IT
community around accurate and fast public health reporting remain
ignored.]{.underline} For instance, consider the number of COVID-19
hospitalizations, which is the best indicator of the disease's burden on
the regional health system. At the present time, [due to time lags in
confirming and reporting cases and a failure to distinguish between
current and cumulative hospitalizations, even regions that report
hospitalization data often provide only a blurry picture of the burden
on the regional health system]{.underline}. Regions should ideally
report both suspected and confirmed hospital cases and indicate the date
of admission, in addition to the date of report or confirmation. [Even
with perfect reporting, there are fundamental delays in what such data
can tell us. For example, new admissions to a hospital today reflect
virus activity as of 9 to 13 days ago]{.underline} (which depends, in
turn, on social distancing interventions from up to 17 days prior). Not
factoring in such considerations have led to significant over-estimation
of hospitalization needs nationwide. We therefore need to measure virus
activity via proxy measures that are indicative early in the lifecycle
of the virus. We must benchmark these against the number of new and
total COVID-19 hospitalizations as well as ideally the number of new
infections, assuming it is accurately measured through large scale
testing. [Available proxy measures include test positivity rates in
health systems, case counts, deaths and perhaps seropositivity rates.
Ongoing symptom tracking via smartphone apps, daily web or phone
surveys]{.underline}, or cough sounds [can identify potential hotspots
where virus transmission rates are high]{.underline}. Contact tracing,
which currently requires significant human effort, can also help
tracking of potential cases if it can be scaled using technology under
development by major American tech companies. [With reliable tracking
and benchmarking in place, we can calculate infection prevalence as well
as daily growth and transmission rates,]{.underline} which is essential
for determining if policies are working. [This is a problem not only of
data collection but also data analysis. Issues of sensitivity, daily
variability, time lags, and confounding need to be studied before such
data can be used reliably. For instance, symptom tracking is nonspecific
and may have difficulty tracking virus activity at low
prevalence]{.underline}. [Other emerging data sources such as wastewater
and smart thermometer data hold similar promise]{.underline} but will
have to grapple with these same issues. We then need to estimate the
regional effects of policy interventions such as shelter-in-place orders
(via mobility reduction) and contact tracing (via reductions in new
cases), first as simple forecasts and eventually maturing to what-if
analyses. Several efforts have quantified the impact of mobility on
virus transmission and some have suggested "safe" forms of mobility.
While there are many potential ways to quantify population mobility ---
such as via traffic patterns, internet bandwidth usage by address, and
location of credit card swipes --- the most scalable mechanism to
measure mobility appears to be via tracking of smartphones. Groups such
as the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network provide such data daily in
anonymized, aggregated reports. [Once the ability to project from
mobility to transmission to health system burden is constructed, we can
"close the loop" by predicting how much mobility we can afford given
measured virus activity and anticipated health system
resources]{.underline} in the next two weeks. Researchers have already
attempted to calculate "tolerable transmission" in the form of maximum
infection prevalence in a given geography that would not overload health
systems. Coupling such tolerable transmission estimates with daily
assessments of a valid sample of the population (via testing, via daily
surveys, via electronic health record-based surveillance) would allow
monitoring of changes in transmission which can alert us to the need to
intervene, such as by reducing mobility. As new measures such as contact
tracing cut transmission rates, these same monitoring systems can tell
us that it is safe to increase mobility further. Continuously analyzing
current mobility as well as virus activity and projected health system
capacity can allow us to set up "keep the distance" alerts that trade
off tolerable transmission against allowed mobility. Doing so will allow
us to intelligently balance public health and economic needs in real
time. Concretely, [then, the crucial "data science" task is to learn the
counterfactual function linking last week's population mobility and
today's transmission rates to project hospital demand two weeks
later.]{.underline} Imagine taking past measurements of mobility around
April 10 in a region (such as the Santa Clara County's report from
COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports), the April 20 virus transmission
rate estimate for the region (such as from http://rt.live), and the
April 25 burden on the health system (such as from the Santa Clara
County Hospitalization dashboard), to learn a function that uses today's
mobility and transmission rates to anticipate needed hospital resources
two weeks later. It is unclear how many days of data of each proxy
measurement we need to reliably learn such a function, what mathematical
form this function might take, and how we do this correctly with the
observational data on hand and avoid the trap of mere function-fitting.
However, [this is the data science problem that needs to be tackled as a
priority.]{.underline} Adopting such technology and data science to keep
anticipated healthcare needs under the threshold of availability in a
region requires multiple privacy trade-offs, which will require
thoughtful legislation so that the solutions invented for enduring the
current pandemic do not lead to loss of privacy in perpetuity. However,
given the immense economic as well as hidden medical toll of the
shutdown, [we urgently need to construct an early warning system that
tells us to enhance suppression measures if the next COVID-19 outbreak
peak might overwhelm our regional healthcare system. It is imperative
that we focus our attention on using data science to anticipate, and
manage, regional health system resource needs based on local
measurements of virus activity and effects of population
distancing.]{.underline}

Doesn't Cause Wars,
<http://www.globalwarming.org/2011/11/28/steven-pinker-resource-scarcity-doesnt-cause-wars/>

Once again it seems to me that the appropriate response is "maybe, but
maybe not." [Though climate change can cause plenty of
misery]{.underline}... [it will not necessarily **lead to armed
conflict**.]{.underline} The **[political scientists]{.underline}** who
track war and peace, [such as]{.underline} Halvard
**[Buhaug]{.underline}**, Idean **[Salehyan]{.underline}**, Ole
**[Theisen]{.underline}**, and Nils **[Gleditsch]{.underline}**, [are
skeptical of the popular idea that people **fight wars** over **scarce
resources**]{.underline}. **[Hunger and resource
shortages]{.underline}** [are tragically common in sub-Saharan countries
such as]{.underline} **[Malawi]{.underline}**, **[Zambia]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[Tanzania]{.underline}**, **[but wars involving them
are not. Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and tsunamis]{.underline}** (such
as the disastrous one in the Indian Ocean in 2004) [do not generally
lead to conflict.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} American [dust bowl
in]{.underline} the 1930s, to take another example, [caused plenty of
deprivation **but no civil war**]{.underline}. And [while temperatures
have been rising steadily in Africa during **the past fifteen
years**]{.underline}, [**civil wars and war deaths have been falling.**
Pressures on access to land]{.underline} and water [can certainly cause
local skirmishes, but a genuine war requires that hostile forces be
**organized** and **armed**]{.underline}, [and that depends more on the
influence of **bad governments**,]{.underline} **[closed
economies]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[militant
ideologies]{.underline}** [than on the sheer
**availability**]{.underline} of land and water. Certainly any
connection to terrorism is in the imagination of the terror warriors:
terrorists tend to be underemployed lower-middle-class men, not
subsistence farmers. As for genocide, the Sudanese government finds it
convenient to blame violence in Darfur on desertification, distracting
the world from its own role in tolerating or encouraging the ethnic
cleansing. [In a regression analysis on armed conflicts from 1980 to
1992]{.underline}, [Theisen found that conflict was more likely if a
country was **poor**]{.underline}, **[populous]{.underline}**,
politically unstable, **[and abundant in oil]{.underline}**, [but not if
it had suffered **from droughts**]{.underline}, **[water
shortages]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} mild **[land
degradation]{.underline}**. (Severe land degradation did have a small
effect.) [Reviewing analyses that examined a **large**

## Solvency

### Multilat Fails

#### Multilateralism fails -- countries won't cooperate, causing fragmentation.

**Young et al 13** (Kevin Young, Assistant Professor in the University
of Massachusetts Amherst's Department of Political Science, Thomas Hale,
Postdoctoral research fellow at the Blavatnik School of Government,
Oxford University, David Held, Professor of politics and international
relations at Durham University, "Global Cooperation Buckling Under Past
Successes," The Globalist, Global Cooperation Buckling Under Past
Successes, *\*fc*)

A Systemic Crisis [**While the need for global cooperation continues to
grow, the ability of multilateral institutions to deliver the policy
coordination we need has not kept pace.** The provision of effective
global governance isn't just lacking in one area --- like, say, climate
change. It is systematically underperforming across a range of issues.
These include the management of the global economy to human security and
environmental problems.]{.underline} While many have pondered the many
pressing global dilemmas facing the world today, [there is a paradox
accompanying the global situation as a whole. We are failing under the
weight of our own success. Decades of multilateral agreements, new
institutions and an increasingly robust system of international law have
enabled a radical increase in economic globalization]{.underline}, with
substantial benefits for a wide range of countries. **[But our ability
to manage all this complexity of progress has not kept pace. Our more
integrated global economy demands more, and more effective, collective
management.]{.underline}** The problems that confront us now are
challenges we never would have encountered without the progress made by
the existing network of institutions. [The various committees based in
Basel, the IMF, the G20, and beyond facilitated a sharp deepening of
financial interdependence. When the crisis arrived, they proved adequate
--- albeit just adequate --- to coordinate a minimally sufficient series
of policy responses to avoid another Great Depression.]{.underline}
Instead of an unmitigated disaster we got a mitigated one. **[They were
of course unable to prevent the crisis from occurring in the first place
and have not been able to take the measures needed to prevent the next
one.]{.underline}** Moreover, [just as existing international
institutions are useful vehicles for cooperation, **they can also come
to hinder it.**]{.underline} [International institutions like the
IMF,]{.underline} for example, contain a vast array of resources and
expertise for addressing global problems. Yet [because of their past
behavior and the lock-in of US dominance that was secured over six
decades ago, many countries **do not trust the IMF as a global
governor.**]{.underline} Newer institutions like the G20 are a testament
to successful development of countries like Brazil, India and China, who
have been able to strategically engage with economic globalization in
recent years. Yet, **[with a greater plurality of voices at the
negotiation table, cooperation becomes more difficult.]{.underline}**
Fragmentation From Cooperation [When institutions proliferate, **the
overall system may slide toward dysfunctional
fragmentation.**]{.underline} Our current set of institutions arose from
ad hoc crisis management over the postwar period. Each crisis saw the
addition of a new committee, a new joint task force or some other
institutional addition. But the sum is not greater than the parts.
Indeed, [the lack of coherence in global economic governance is directly
responsible for a number of the challenges we now face.]{.underline} For
example, [the reform efforts surrounding complex financial instruments
like derivatives are as complex as the instruments
themselves.]{.underline} There is not one international institution
handling the reform process. Rather, there are five different
organizations all handling different pieces, separate initiatives at the
EU level and a panoply of different countries all acting simultaneously.
Some claim that global economic governance has utterly failed, pointing
to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and a sluggish
recovery. Others regard global economic governance as "good enough."
They point out that we averted an even worse disaster and --- despite a
global recession --- didn't collapse. In fact, both views are correct:
[global economic cooperation is failing under the weight of its own
success. Across a range of issue areas, the remarkable success of global
cooperation in the last several decades has made human
interconnectedness weigh much more heavily on politics and the economy
than it did in the past. But that process of growing cooperation has now
stalled, unable to manage the deep interdependence it has
created.]{.underline}

#### Multilateralism empirically fails

**Naim '9** (Moises; 6/21/09; Distinguished Fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace; "MISSING LINKS Minilateralism The
magic number to get real international action," accessed 6/26/16,
http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/06/21/minilateralism/)

Never say never. Because of the global economic crisis, habits that
seemed unalterable are suddenly being altered. Americans are now saving
more and consuming less. Financial institutions are no longer betting
the house on risky investments they do not understand. Wealthy
oil-exporting countries are tightening their belts. At least some
emerging markets long prone to financial accidents are behaving with
uncharacteristic prudence. Everywhere, change is in the air.
[Everywhere, that is, except in the way humanity responds to its most
menacing threats. You know the list: climate change]{.underline},
nuclear proliferation, terrorism, pandemics, trade protectionism, and
more. [Not one can be solved, or even effectively contained, without
more successful international collaboration. And that is not happening.
When was the last time you heard that a large number of countries agreed
to a major international accord on a pressing issue? Not in more than a
decade]{.underline}. **[The last successful multilateral trade agreement
dates back to 1994]{.underline}**, when 123 countries gathered to
negotiate the creation of the World Trade Organization and agreed on a
new set of rules for international trade. [Since then, all other
attempts to reach a global trade deal have crashed.]{.underline} The
same is true with multilateral efforts to curb nuclear proliferation;
the last significant international nonproliferation agreement was in
1995, when 185 countries agreed to extend an existing nonproliferation
treaty. In the decade and a half since, multilateral initiatives have
not only failed, but India, Pakistan, and North Korea have demonstrated
their certain status as nuclear powers. [On the environment, the Kyoto
Protocol, a global deal aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, has
been ratified by 184 countries since it was adopted in 1997, but the
United States, the world's second-largest air polluter after China, has
not done so, and many of the signatories have missed their
targets.]{.underline} The most recent multilateral initiative
successfully endorsed by a large number of countries was in 2000, when
192 nations signed the United Nations Millennium Declaration, an
ambitious set of eight goals ranging from halving the world's extreme
poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal
primary education---all by 2015. Although some progress toward achieving
these goals has been made---mostly thanks to Asia's spectacular economic
performance---the failure of rich countries to fully fund these efforts,
execution problems in poor countries, and the global economic downturn
make the achievement of the goals by 2015 unlikely. [The pattern is
clear:]{.underline} Since the early 1990s, the need for effective
multicountry collaboration has soared, but at the same time
**[multilateral talks have inevitably failed; deadlines have been
missed; financial commitments and promises have not been honored;
execution has stalled; and international collective action has fallen
far short]{.underline}** of what was offered and, more importantly,
needed. These failures represent not only the perpetual lack of
international consensus, but also a flawed obsession with
multilateralism as the panacea for all the world's ills. So what is to
be done? To start, let's forget about trying to get the planet's nearly
200 countries to agree. We need to abandon that fool's errand in favor
of a new idea: minilateralism. By minilateralism, I mean a smarter, more
targeted approach: We should bring to the table the smallest possible
number of countries needed to have the largest possible impact on
solving a particular problem. Think of this as minilateralism's magic
number. The magic number, of course, will vary greatly depending on the
problem. Take trade, for example. The Group of Twenty (G-20), which
includes both rich and poor countries from six continents, accounts for
85 percent of the world's economy. The members of the G-20 could reach a
major trade deal among themselves and make it of even greater
significance by allowing any other country to join if it wishes to do
so. Presumably, many would. Same with climate change. There, too, the
magic number is about 20: The world's 20 top polluters account for 75
percent of the planet's greenhouse gas emissions. The number for nuclear
proliferation is 21---enough to include both recognized and de facto
nuclear countries, and several other powers who care about them. African
poverty? About a dozen, including all the major donor countries and the
sub-Saharan countries most in need. As for HIV/AIDS, 19 countries
account for nearly two thirds of the world's AIDS-related deaths. Of
course, countries not invited to the table will denounce this approach
as undemocratic and exclusionary. But the magic number will break the
world's untenable gridlock, and agreements reached by the small number
of countries whose actions are needed to generate real solutions can
provide the foundation on which more-inclusive deals can be subsequently
built. Minilateral deals can and should be open to any other country
willing to play by the rules agreed upon by the original group. The
defects of minilateralism pale in comparison with the stalemate that
characterizes 21st-century multilateralism. **[It has become far too
dangerous to continue to rely on large-scale multilateral negotiations
that stopped yielding results almost two decades ago]{.underline}**. The
minilateralism of magic numbers is not a magic solution. But it's a far
better bet at this point than the multilateralism of wishful thinking.
