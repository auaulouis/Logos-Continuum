International technical standards define the technological frontier.
Those who determine the standards are those who shape the competition.
[Technical standard-setting in critical and emerging technologies also
have direct bearing on key U.S. and EU foreign policy goals, such as the
protection of human rights and democracy, and on their foreign economic
and trade policies.]{.underline}2 In the past, [the United States and
Europe have largely been the world's standard-makers]{.underline}.
However, in a new world of disruptive innovation and diffuse power, they
could quickly become standard-takers -- unless they can leverage their
mutual strengths to set the global regulatory framework for the
standards of the future. [In this context, the U.S.-EU Trade and
Technology Council (TTC) takes on strategic importance.]{.underline}

Global technical standards are established in various ways. A de facto
standard can be developed by a first- mover company and then accepted
more broadly. Size also matters; users tend to flock to the biggest
providers and use the standards they create.3 Formal standards are
adopted through industrial consortia and global standard development
organizations (SDOs), such as the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC), and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Once
standards are locked-in, they tend to remain rather durable, since
changing them can be very costly.4

[The United States and Europe are accustomed to being global
standard-setters]{.underline}. [Each boasts innovative companies that
define many of the world's technical standards. Through mutual
investment and R&D links, those companies' operations are deeply
integrated across the transatlantic space. The \$6.3 trillion
transatlantic economy is also massive; aligned or interoperable
standards across this vast market would generate economies of scale in
some critical sectors that could largely determine global
standards.]{.underline} [European and U.S. firms remain the most
influential participants in SDOs due to their leadership and their
technical expertise, in-depth knowledge of standards-setting processes
and rules, the quality of their contributions, and their continuous
participation over time]{.underline}.5 Traditionally, both parties have
been strongly represented in global standardization organizations,
although U.S. participation has lagged of late[. Both agree that
international standards for emerging technologies should be developed in
accordance with core principles established by the WTO, and as affirmed
by the G7 and the G20. If the United States and the EU can use the TTC
to harness these complementarities, they are in a good position to
define the technological frontier.]{.underline}

These passages confirm that [maintaining and furthering the principles
on which the Alliance is based --- democracy, individual liberty and the
rule of law]{.underline} --- [forms part of the object and purpose of
the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}. This, in turn, suggests that a
[failure to comply with these principles may amount to a material breach
of the treaty within the meaning of Article 60 of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties. Pursuant to Article 60, a material breach
consists of]{.underline}:

\(a\) a repudiation of the treaty not sanctioned by the present
Convention; or

\(b\) [the violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of
the object or purpose of the treaty]{.underline}.

To constitute a material breach pursuant to sub-paragraph (a), the
violation of the principles underlying the treaty would have to be so
extensive in scope, so severe and so persistent as to effectively
"disavow" or repudiate the treaty (cf. Namibia Advisory Opinion, para.
95). Turning to sub-paragraph (b), there can be little doubt that
continued [compliance with the values set out in the preamble and
Article 2 is essential for the accomplishment of the object and purpose
of the treaty]{.underline}.

[Official statements issued by the member states, including at the
Brussels Summit in 2018]{.underline} and more recently on the occasion
of NATO's 70th Anniversary, [repeatedly affirm these
principles]{.underline}. [A member nation that violated them in a
systematic and egregious manner would thus cast **doubt** on the very
**resolve** of the allies **to** **"unite their efforts for collective
defence** and for the preservation of peace and security"]{.underline}
(preamble, North Atlantic Treaty).

[Should the conditions for the existence of a material breach be
satisfied, NATO's member states would be entitled, by unanimous
agreement, to suspend the operation of the treaty in whole or in part or
to terminate it either in their relations with the defaulting state or
among them all]{.underline} (Article 60(2) of the Vienna Convention).
For these purposes, a unanimous decision of the North Atlantic Council,
excluding the defaulting state, would suffice. No further procedural
requirements apply, including those laid down in Article 65 of the
Vienna Convention.

[Whether or not Turkey is in material breach]{.underline} of its
commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty is [therefore a question to
be determined]{.underline} by the other members of the Council. As Klaus
Kress has observed, [there is a "very serious possibility that Operation
'Peace Spring' could constitute a manifest violation of the prohibition
of the use of force]{.underline}." [Coupled with President Erdoğan's
threat to "open the gates" for Syrian refugees to migrate to
Europe]{.underline}, [a threat fundamentally at odds with the unity and
solidarity of the Alliance,]{.underline} [characterizing these
developments as a material breach is not entirely
far-fetched]{.underline}.

In any event, [they **entitle** other **NATO nations to suspend** or
scale back their **military cooperation with Turkey**, **even without
declaring Turkey to be in material breach**]{.underline}. [Although
Article 3]{.underline} of the North Atlantic Treaty [commits the parties
to maintain and develop]{.underline} their individual and [collective
capacity]{.underline} to resist armed attack, [this obligation is meant
to pursue the objectives of the treaty]{.underline}. [The duty to
develop military capabilities and to cooperate to this end therefore
does not override the commitment to further the principles of
democracy,]{.underline} individual liberty and the rule of law. [A
number of **Allies**, including France, Germany and Norway, as well as
official NATO partner Finland, **are** reported to have **suspended**
the **sale of military equipment to Turkey.**]{.underline}

Overall, [the absence of a suspension and expulsion mechanism in the
North Atlantic Treaty does not prevent the North Atlantic Council from
suspending or terminating the membership of an ally found to be in
material breach of the treaty]{.underline}. However, with the 70th
anniversary of the treaty just past, this is a sorry position for the
Council to be in by any measure. Suspending, let alone terminating, a
nation's membership of NATO would be an extreme measure to be
contemplated only once other attempts to restore unity and respect for
the Alliance's founding principles have been exhausted.

Ousting Turkey: The Benefits

These [multiple divergences between Turkey and its Western allies cast
doubt on the validity of Ankara's ongoing membership in
NATO]{.underline}. Despite its official stance, [Ankara has proven
resistant when called to intervene in defense of the Organization's
common interest]{.underline}; however, it has not hesitated to pursue
its own objectives, even when this meant contravening the NATO line.
[Turkey]{.underline} often [behaves like an unreliable and ambivalent
partner, and its participation in the Alliance creates more problems
than benefits]{.underline}:

First, [any attack on Turkish territory would be considered an attack
against all members]{.underline}, which would leave the Alliance facing
the dilemma of either being involved in a war or losing the credibility
of its collective security guarantee. While an attack from Russia is a
calculated risk since NATO mainly exists to deter this scenario, it is
also true that [[Turkey's]{.mark} occasional
[recklessness]{.mark}]{.underline} -- such as the downing of a Russian
military aircraft in 2015 -- **[[could lead to]{.mark} an
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}** with unforeseeable consequences. [Yet
[Ankara can pursue]{.mark} its [assertive policy]{.mark} **largely
[because]{.mark} [it is part of the Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[meaning that [it exposes]{.mark} the collectivity to [useless risks for
its own benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, Russia is not the
only potential antagonist: [any standoff between Turkey and Iran could
produce the same effects.]{.underline} At present, Turkey's improving
relations with both powers would seem to exclude the possibility, but it
cannot be ruled out in the future.

[Protecting Europe from any further expansion of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}'s sphere of influence and interference was the main
argument for expanding NATO membership, to include Turkey in 1952.
Turkey, in turn, sought to be part of the European club and approached
the West. [That is why the US military presence in Turkey with
conventional and nuclear forces was against the Soviet threat as well as
against the potential effects of instability and conflicts in the Middle
East]{.underline}. Where the strategic interests of the allies always
dominate relations between Turkey and NATO, during and after the Cold
War. That is why Turkey was under the protection of NATO and its supply
of advanced weapons. [Turkey is an important member of NATO because of
its strategic location between East and West]{.underline}, and its
control of the Bosporus and Dardanelles to prevent Russia from reaching
the Mediterranean Sea. [Also hosting the Turkish Incirlik
base]{.underline} for the American forces and the Patriot missiles,
Turkey's contribution to NATO with its soldiers in Kosovo and
Afghanistan and supporting NATO's military and financial tasks. [That is
why Erdogan takes advantage of all this to use him in his despotic
policies and practices that are angering NATO countries and increasing
their division]{.underline}. The preamble to the 1949 NATO Treaty states
that NATO members are "determined to protect the freedom, shared
heritage, and civilization of their people, based on the principles of
democracy, individual freedom, and the rule of law." That is why the
member states of NATO are very concerned about the changes taking place
in Turkey, but nonetheless [[NATO seeks to preserve]{.mark} the
relationship with [Turkey]{.mark} and not leave the
alliance.]{.underline} **[[This]{.mark} policy towards Turkey tarnishes
the alliance's image and mission, [weakens democracy]{.mark} and the

a "frenemy" and adopt the term that has been applied to Pakistan. As a
[result, [if NATO remains silent]{.mark} toward Erdogan's authoritarian

[his]{.mark} [cooperation with]{.mark} Iran and [Russia]{.mark}, we

#### Treating Turkey as a normal ally is bad

Rethinking Turkish-U.S. Relations after S-400 Debacle, German Marshall
Fund of the United States, 2019, Pg. 1-5

[Turkey's determination to move ahead with the procurement of the
Russian S-400 missile-defense system at the risk of sanctions by the
United States has revived the debate on the future of its relations with
its long-term ally.]{.underline} There has been a flourishing array of
views on how things got to this point and where they might be heading.
[While much responsibility is put on Turkey's unyielding strategic
choices, the United States is also complicit for its inability to handle
the relationship.]{.underline} Moving beyond the blame game, Nicholas
Danforth identifies two broad narratives to explain Turkish conduct:
"frustration" with an insensitive ally and "fear" from the threatening
actions of an adversarial power. These two narratives correlate with the
levels-of- analysis framework academics use to explain state behavior.
In it, different factors at the individual, state, or systemic levels
account for why states act the way they do, including forming alliances.
Danforth's "frustration" narrative is grounded in a state or systemic
level of analysis, whereas the "fear" one relates mainly to the
individual level of analysis. Until the recent delivery of components of
the Russian weapons platform in Turkey, system- and state-level analyses
prevailed in evaluations of the unfolding crisis. Many in Turkey and
abroad had assumed that by opening new channels of communication the
United States would convince, if not pressure, Turkish decision-makers
to make a last-minute deal and change course. In addition to various
mutual visits by official delegations, for instance, Senator Lindsay
Graham and other lawmakers met President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to discuss
issues affecting the Turkish-U.S. relationship. But this did not suffice
to affect the outcome. President Erdoğan, having emphasized on many
occasions his promises to his Russian counterpart, showed his strong
conviction to go ahead with a "done deal" despite pressure to change
course. Moreover, he stressed his unease with Turkey's Western partners
especially after failed coup attempt of 2016. In that respect, taking
delivery of the S-400s turned out to be a counterintuitive move by
Turkey, reflecting how individual-level considerations can shape state
behavior and override systemic imperatives. Perhaps what enabled the
individual-level---or "fear"--- factor to carry the day in Turkish
decision-making is its coalescence with the system-level---or
"frustration"--- factor. [Systemic transformations weakened the
fundamentals of the Turkish-U.S. alliance and created an environment
within which a new thinking came to dominate Turkey's external
conduct.]{.underline} Since the structural causes of divergence were
already there, it is no surprise to see the "frustration" argument being
widely embraced in Turkey to justify the S-400 decision. What is
striking, however, is that it is not only adopted by the bureaucracy at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by moderate commentators, as
suggested by Danforth, but also by the major opposition parties. For
instance, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party,
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, reacted to the pressure by the U.S. Congress on
President Donald Trump to impose sanctions by arguing that the risks
posed by Turkey's geography justified the S-400 purchase. What Went
Wrong? The root causes of the divergence between Turkey and the United
States long predate the S-400 saga. They foreshadowed the fracturing of
the relationship throughout the Syrian crisis, which many analysts
mistakenly treated as the main trigger for the strategic decoupling by
the two allies. [At least for a decade now, the Turkish-U.S.
relationship has required a proper redefinition, if not a new guiding
framework. There was no scarcity of calls for this to happen either. For
example, I argued in 2010 that "**It might be time for the United States
to abandon the search for redefining the relationship \[with Turkey\] on
'partnership' models.**"]{.underline} The sea change in the relationship
is the product of various factors. Harboring a regionally driven
understanding of international relations in the post- Cold War era,
Turkey has opted to base its external conduct on the quest for strategic
autonomy. Likewise, a desire to adjust to global power transitions has
lurked in the background. In its strategic thinking, especially with the
AK Party at the helm, Turkey already lives in a world of multipolarity
and seeks flexibility when it comes to alliance choices. Moreover, a
deliberate attempt to challenge the power asymmetry inherent in the
relationship with the United States shapes the worldview of Turkey's
current leadership. Consequently, every foreign policy issue has been
framed as yet another battleground for correcting the "unequal" and
"unfair" treatment by the United States and for breaking the dependence
on Turkey's senior partner. Furthermore, the cycle of insecurity
following the Arab Spring of 2011 overwhelmed Turkey's strategic
thinking to such an extent that concerns for state and regime survival
came to the forefront. The fragmentation of states and collapse of
central authority in the region posed direct challenges to Turkey, and a
concern to prevent spillover effects came to dominate its thinking. Last
but not the least, the reconfiguration of Turkey's domestic political
scene---in terms of governance model and body politic---under the
pressures of the post-Arab Spring regional turmoil brought about a new
political culture, altering the normative fabric and personal dimensions
of the relationship with the United States. In particular, the redesign
of the domestic political system into a presidential one and the
reconfiguration of the governing bloc with the alliance between the AK
Party and the Nationalist Action Party to cater to the needs of the
ruling elite precipitated a search for new external allies and weakened
the traditional domestic pillars and constituencies of the alliance with
the United States. Uncertainty, Leadership, and Alliances in a Post-U.S.
World Largely ignored in the debate in the United States on "who lost
Turkey" is the question of how the S-400 crisis relates to the wider
debate on the role of " What allies such as Turkey see is a deep
structural uncertainty about the grand strategy of the United States and
its inability to make credible commitments. alliances in today's
international system. What has been fundamentally altered in the
post-Cold War era is not just the foundations of the Turkish-U.S.
relationship, but the very meaning and mechanics of alliance behavior.
Amid the endless arguments about retrenchment, rebalancing, offshore
balancing, the decline of U.S. primacy, liberal internationalism, and
patriotism, what U.S. allies such as Turkey see is a deep structural
uncertainty about the grand strategy of the United States and its
inability to make credible commitments. [It is no secret that the United
States had no easy ride in building or maintaining alliances in the
unipolar era. Likewise, it has been far from perfect in exercising
constructive and cooperative leadership that satisfies the needs of its
allies. These two problems have been aggravated as the United States had
to find ingenious ways to deal with allies that are less willing to
abide a top-down partnership model. Perhaps equally problematic has been
Washington's handling of adversaries. It has failed to exercise its
power to change the behavior of these through a mix of rewards or
punishment. As has been demonstrated repeatedly, U.S. power has not
automatically yielded the outcomes desired. For example, the inability
of the United States to counter Russia's assertiveness since the war in
Georgia in 2008]{.underline}, despite threats and sanctions, and to
build a coalition to contain it has been noted by its allies and
adversaries alike. Reacting to U.S Power There have been at least two
distinct reactions by second-tier powers like Turkey to the travails of
U.S. preponderance. First, uncertainty has bred frustration as many
still expect the United States to exercise leadership of some sort. Its
failure to offer a shared vision to allies, let alone signaling its
strategic priorities in a post-U.S. world, forces many of them to look
for ways to guard their interests through unilateral action or
strategies of hedging. Second, many countries still view the United
States as too powerful despite the erosion of unipolarity. At least
since the 2003 Iraq War, scholars like Stephen Walt have warned about
the potential dangers involved in untamed exercise of U.S. power. Since
then the United States' allies and adversaries alike have engaged in
acts of "soft balancing"---that is, actions "that use nonmilitary tools
to delay, frustrate, and undermine aggressive unilateral U.S. military
policies". The accumulation of such practices arguably precipitates
counterbalancing behavior on the part of second-tier powers, including
building alliances with like-minded countries. Turkey's S-400 decision
has elements of both factors, which is nicely captured in the "fear and
frustration" analogy. Its developing strategic relationship with Russia
serves as a hedge against "the United States as an unreliable ally" and
as a counterbalancing tool against "the United States as a threatening
adversary." It further illustrates how alignment behavior is driven by
leaders' attributes, including their worldviews and survival
calculations as much as national strategic considerations. Turkey's
decision to forge closer ties with Russia cannot be fully explained
without taking into account how perceptions of threat at the individual
level can come to dominate decision- making. As for the United States,
it has watched---if not allowed---the sea change in Turkey happen
without undertaking preemptive steps to address the root causes of the
flourishing Turkish-Russian relationship. Instead, in Washington's
lexicon, Turkey has gone from being an "intrinsically strategically
important ally" to "too strategically important to be lost to the other
side." But even the latter view, which has kept many frictions from
escalating, no longer holds as Turkey increasingly has become the
subject of punitive language and sanctions. The country's slide further
toward the status of "dispensable ally" raises intriguing questions.
Going beyond the political turmoil surrounding the Trump administration
in Washington, there probably is a systemic logic behind the ease with
which the United States has downgraded Turkey's status. It may be part
of a deliberate policy of rebalancing global U.S. commitments, rather
than the mishandling of the relationship. The Way Forward [There seems
to be a deep belief in Turkey that the onus of mending ties lies with
the United States. Just as the country's leadership has insistently
advocated in the S-400 crisis, it expects the United States to
understand Turkey's concerns and to act accordingly]{.underline}. In
moving beyond the crisis, the thinking in Ankara will continue to
challenge the inequality inherent in the very nature of the
transatlantic alliance and remain bent on reconfiguring the relationship
on a new notion of alliance. [It is far from certain, however, the
United States is ready to revise its cognitive map to accommodate
Turkish concerns in a new structured partnership model. As I have argued
before, this would "connote long-term commitments and cooperative
behavior on the part of Turkey that might prove impossible to sustain.
**Instead, both parties might consider letting the relationship evolve
on an ad hoc basis involving**]{.underline} The United States has to
find ways to address the structural uncertainty about its grand
strategy, which, if unattended, may breed more distrust in Turkey.
[**different degrees of cooperation and competition** as interests
overlap or diverge." Moreover, at this stage, the problem may not lie so
much in the lack of dialogue as much as in the incompatibility of
strategic visions. Perhaps it would be better for both countries to
brace themselves for a continued volatile period in their relations.
Nonetheless, the United States still has to find ways to address the
structural uncertainty about its grand strategy, which, if unattended,
may breed more distrust in Turkey. **It has to continue looking for ways
to exercise its power more judiciously**, as this remains a major prism
for how others define their relations with it. Otherwise, the United
States risks not only the decades-old alliance relationship with Turkey
but also alliance solidarity in NATO.]{.underline}

The Black Sea region is one of the re- gions in which Turkey has lost
its influ- ence to Russia. **[NATO and the EU have no influence on
relations between Rus- sia and Turkey]{.underline}**, as the Presidents
of both countries either ignore the EU\'s efforts or, as in the case of
Erdogan, despise their at- tempts to appease him. In addition, [NATO has
no mechanism for excluding Turkey as a member state. Although the EU has
implicitly suspended negotiations on Tur- key\'s possible EU membership,
it is not prepared to make a clear statement that Turkey will not join
the Union in the fore- seeable future. The leaders of both organ-
izations continue to hope that Erdogan will change the authoritarian
course of the country and return to a European way and reconsider the
comfortable relations with Putin. Erdogan has other plans, and as a
result the leaders of NATO and the EU are likely to wait in
vain.]{.underline} It must be emphasised that Erdogan was and is not an
equal partner in the Turkish-- Russian relationship, although both
Presi- dent Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Er- dogan have a similarly
authoritarian style of government. [Erdogan called Putin \"my dear
friend Vladimir\"]{.underline} at a press confer- ence in St. Petersburg
on 9 August 2016, shortly after the restoration of bilateral relations,
which were damaged by a Turk- ish F-16 fighter plane on 24 November 2015
after the launch of a Russian Su-24 bomber. But Putin did not call
Erdogan \"my dear friend\" Tayyip. There is a saying that Russia has no
friends. As the Russian Tsar Alexander III previously said: has only two
allies -- the army and the navy.\" And in the 21st century, Russia also
has nuclear deterrence and the right of veto in the UN Security Council.
It can therefore be said that Putin does not regard Erdogan as a friend,
but as an unequal counterpart. In addition, Murat Bilhan, former head of
the Turkish Foreign Ministry\'s Strategic Re- search Centre, said:
\"Behind Putin\'s smile, Russia remains a great state and can show its
talons whenever it suits him. Turkey could never compete with Russia.
Russia is a superpower, while Turkey is a regional power.\" Turkey
should not be under any illusions about its role in relations, namely
that of the second fiddle. While Erdogan\'s authoritarian rule has
alienated allies in Europe and the United States, it has strengthened
Putin\'s control over Turkey and embarrassed Erdogan. Pu- tin\'s
economic sanctions against Turkey in November 2015 caused serious damage
to the Turkish economy when Russian tour- ists stayed away from Turkey.
Putin can im- pose these economic sanctions and travel Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met with
representatives of the Russian Defence Ministry to discuss Russian
"counter-terrorism operations" in Syria. On 13 November 2017, Vladimir
Putin met with President of Turkey Re- cep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi to
discuss bilateral relations and current issues on the international
agenda. 28 European Security & Defence · March 2018 Photo: Kremlin.ru
Photo: Kremlin.ru have received unconditional support from Russia. The
cost of unconditional support from Russia remains high and has a long-
term impact. In addition, the renewed co- operation between Ankara and
Moscow is to take place on Russian terms, and Turkey reluctantly accepts
this reality.\" [The never-ending story of **Erdogan\'s deci- sion to
buy the S-400 air defence system from Russia** is an example of Putin\'s
view of Moscow\'s support for Turkey. Turkey buys a system **that is not
compatible with NATO standards** and cannot be integrated into NATO\'s
air defence system.]{.underline} That is why Turkey must confine itself
to its own archi- tecture. Even if Russia is ready to carry out
maintenance work, maintenance is carried out by Russian and not by
Turkish workers. At the same time, Russia is not prepared to supply
software codes, IFF systems, joint production with Turkey and certainly
no technology transfer to Turkey. And this de- spite the Turkish side\'s
persistence to gain access to the software codes and the IFF system. In
addition, the system cannot be delivered to Turkey before 2020. This is
a high price paid by Turkey for unconditional support from Russia. The
statement by Ca- SECURITY POLICY  restrictions on Turkey if he feels
that Er- dogan is not listening to him. In addition, Putin can impose
sanctions at any time and without warning, which he can promise.
Therefore, the relationship is one of senior and junior partners, even
though Erdogan does not see this reality. But as Atilla Yesi- lada of
Global Source Partners, a consul- tancy firm based in Istanbul, said in
January 2017: \"The Turkish government has com- pletely decoupled itself
from reality. This is not the case with Putin, who is playing a tough,
well-calculated and manipulative game against Erdogan and at the same
time knows how to deal with the volatile Erdogan correctly, compared to
the rather timid attitude of Turkey\'s Western allies.\" There is no
doubt that Turkey did not only push itself into Russian orbit in 2015,
but al- ready in 2008, because Turkey was already dependent on 60
percent of gas supplies from Russia at that time. Today, the figure is
55 percent. Turkey has no choice but to rely on Russia\'s good will, and
Turkey pays in hard currency. The idea that Turkey must diversify its
gas imports away from Russia and become a gas hub has remained an idea.
In 2014, according to Turkey\'s foreign trade statistics, exports to
Russia amount- ed to US\$5.9Bn, while imports from Rus- sia amounted to
US\$25.2Bn. The first six months of 2016 were Turkey\'s worst export
result since 2004, and the most striking as- pect of trade with Russia
is that it has been in favour of Russia from the outset. Russia sells
more to Turkey than Turkey sells to Russia. Turkey\'s dependence on
Russian gas and oil (10 percent of oil comes from Russia) is a major
factor in this imbalance. The current situation is unlikely to change,
as Turkey\'s energy requirements will dou- ble in the next decade.
Another factor in this imbalance is the increasing number of Russian
tourists in Turkey. In addition to Turkey\'s dependence on Rus- sian gas
and Russian tourists, the Russian- Georgian war in August 2008 sent a
clear message to Ankara, namely that Ankara can only increase its
influence in its imme- diate neighbourhood, namely in the Black Sea
region, by coordinating with Moscow and not with its NATO allies. And
that is exactly what has happened since then. Turkey\'s failed coup
d\'état on 15 July 2016 has further consolidated relations between
Russia and Turkey. In a telephone call with Erdogan on 17 July 2016,
Putin stressed the \"categorical inadmissibility of anti-consti-
tutional acts and violence in state life\" and reaffirmed his intention
to meet Erdogan in Russia. Putin\'s reaction was in stark con- trast to
that of the Western allies. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu
said on 25 July 2016: \"Unlike other countries, we A Russian S-400 Air

F-16 fighter aircraft shot down a Rus- sian Su-24 aircraft near the
Syrian-Turkish border. The Turkish Air Force claimed that the Russian
aircraft violated Turkish airspace. The Russian pilot Capt. Konstantin
Murakhtin said on Russian TV there was \"no way\" the jet could have
violated Turkish airspace. Turkey says the pilots were warned 10 times
before the plane was shot down. Capt. Murakhtin was rescued from
rebel-held territory in Syria in a 12-hour operation involving Russian
Special Forces. The incident strained Russian-Turkish relations. March

CC Photo: Vitaly Kuzmin, Wikipedia CC vusoglu that \"Ankara can refuse
to buy the S-400 if Moscow refuses to stop joint production in Turkey on
9 October 2017\" should be taken with a grain of salt. Cavusoglu is not
the one who decided to buy the S-400. Cavusoglu\'s attempt to put the
Russians under pressure is not taken seriously by Moscow and the
Russians laugh behind Cavusoglu\'s back. After all, the Turkish cash
deposit of around US\$100M for the purchase of the S-400 will not be
repaid. Finally, General Petr Pavel, Chairman of the Military Committee,
said on 25 October 2017: \"Although the principle of sovereignty
obviously consists in the procurement of defence equipment, as the
nations are sovereign in decision-making, they are also sovereign in
coping with the consequences of this decision." It remains to be seen
whether Pavel\'s statement can be interpreted as an explicit warning to
Erdogan, but it is obvious that NATO is not satisfied with Erdogan\'s
decision to buy the S-400. [The]{.underline} unequal bilateral
[relations are a major headache for NATO and the EU, as relations
between Turkey and its Western allies have deteriorated since the failed
coup d\'état in Turkey. Let us recall the state of bilateral relations
between Germany and Tur- key, and in particular the USA and Turkey, as
well as the bitter relations between Austria and The Netherlands and
Turkey. It is obvious that relations between Turkey and its Western
allies will not change as long as Erdogan remains president. **Although
Turkey remains an ally of NATO, Turkey has become a difficult ally.**
Erdogan is fully aware of this fact and will not change his behaviour,
making the NATO and EU response difficult.]{.underline} NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg\'s polite statement that Turk- ish officials
told him that \"Ankara remains a strong NATO ally\" is without
substance. [Erdogan is acting in bad faith, knowing that Western allies
cannot punish Turkey in the present circumstances]{.underline}. On the
other hand, Putin behaves like a spectator and enjoys the confusion
without moving a finger. [As long as NATO does not succeed in including
an article on the right of expulsion and penalties for misconduct of a
member of NATO in the North Atlantic Treaty, Erdogan will continue to
be- have boldly. As long as the EU heads of state and government dis-
agree on the fate of Turkey\'s possible membership and therefore do not
take a unanimous decision, Erdogan will treat these heads of state and
government with contempt. It is an opportunity for Putin to bind the
Turkish Gulliver to the land of the Lilliputians, to continue his policy
of changing the military balance in the Black Sea region (with intensive
militarisation of the Crimean peninsula) in his favour and to scorn the
NATO alliance.NATO and the EU are in an unprofitable position because of
consensus and compromise, while Putin and Erdogan continue to behave
with impunity, knowing the internal weaknesses of the EU, which is
unable to make a final decision on Turkey\'s EU membership. As long as
NATO\'s language remains vague and ambiguous, Erdogan will not do
anything to shake NATO\'s boat, but will enjoy the protection of NATO
and Russia\'s embrace.]{.underline} Whether the Turkish formula of NATO
protection and Russian embrace can also apply to other NATO member
states goes beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, it can be
said that other NATO members are carefully evaluating the Turkish
experience. Putin will continue to draw Turkey into its sphere of
influence by offering smaller trade, energy and tourism concessions and
with the unresolved conflict in Syria, as Erdogan is also in an
unprofitable position. The author can only repeat what Bilhan said
above: \"Behind Putin\'s smile Russia remains a great state and can show
its claws whenever it suits it.\" And this is something that Erdogan and
his government should remember well.

Last but not least, [the Alliance could also make some significant
efforts to increase the credibility of its strategy of
deterrence.]{.underline} For example, [it is obvious that Russia is not
underestimating the role of explicit strategic communication in
determining the outcome of the conflict]{.underline}. The tactic of the
Kremlin is to mobilize people using emotional arguments (more or less
"we are under attack and everybody wants to destroy us"). The same
approach would most likely not work in the case of the Alliance, because
[NATO is highly unlikely to be able and willing to emotionally mobilise
and oppose itself to Russia. This is **due to the differences among the
NATO member states in the way they see** **Rus- sia**'s ambitions and
actions in the current security environment.]{.underline} An alternative
option for NATO to increase the credibility of its political statements
-- which would also mean an increase to the credibility of the
Alliance's deterrence stra- tegy -- would be to rely on rational
arguments whereby it explains, in a simple manner, why it would be
easier and cheaper for NATO to defend the Baltic countries in comparison
to what it would take to liberate them.

-- ED

[Nearly every major aspect of the European economy is to be re-evaluated
in light of the imperatives of the climate and ecological emergency,
according to sweeping new plans set out by the European commission on
Wednesday]{.underline}. The comprehensive nature of the European Green
Deal -- which encompasses the air we breathe to how food is grown, from
how we travel to the buildings we inhabit -- was set out in a flurry of
documents as Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president, made
her appeal to member states and parliamentarians in Brussels to back the
proposals, which would represent the biggest overhaul of policy since
the foundation of the modern EU. Von der Leyen said [the package was
aimed at economic growth and increasing prosperity. "\[This\] is our new
growth strategy, for a growth that gives back more than it takes away,"
she said. "It shows how to transform our way of living and working, of
producing and consuming, so that we live healthier \[lives\] and make
our businesses innovate. We will help our economy to be a global leader
by moving first and moving fast." Europe must lead on the climate
crisis. The European Green Deal]{.underline} shows how Ursula von der
Leyen Read more As well as [**bidding to lead the world on climate
action with a proposed target of net-zero carbon by 2050 and halving
emissions by 2030**, the EU will delve far more deeply into the root
problems that contribute to carbon emissions and pollution. For
instance]{.underline}, in manufacturing: in previous decades, the EU was
content to set targets for recycling rates; under the European Green
Deal, [regulators would set specific standards on the manufacturing of
goods to create a circular economy and phase out unnecessary plastic and
other waste before it is created]{.underline}. From 2021, at least 40%
of the budget for the common agricultural policy and 30% of fisheries
subsidies would be devoted to tackling climate change and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, instead of contributing to higher emissions
and environmental degradation, as many of these subsidies do at present.
[Toxic air and its health impacts would be tackled through tougher air
quality requirements, and energy targets would be raised to generate
more energy from renewable sources, up to 100% by 2050. More freight
would be transported by rail and water, and greenhouse gas emissions
from air travel would be reduced]{.underline}. The emissions reduction
target for 2030 was proposed at a level of 50-55%, with a new law
enshrining the commitment to net zero carbon for 2050. As an inducement
to the member states reluctant to sign up to the 2030 and 2050 targets
-- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- Von der Leyen
promised€100bn (£84bn) to help finance the transition to a low-carbon
economy, along with the potential for a carbon border tax to be levied
on imports to the EU from countries without sufficiently stringent
carbon targets of their own. Leaders will discuss the emissions goals
when they meet in Brussels at a summit on Thursday, [but **agreement
still appears some way off.**]{.underline} [Failure to agree a second
time, following a previous attempt in June, would be a blow to the EU's
standing at the UN climate talks, now reaching their final days in
Madrid. One senior EU official said: "One of the elements that the heads
of state and government will have to take into account is the pressure
outside the room on this. This is climate week, right. So there might be
a deal, there might not be a deal." The commission will also face a
difficult task in gaining full backing for the rest of the package among
all member states.]{.underline} As well as those concerned about the
carbon targets, there are the powerful agricultural and fishing lobbies
in several states with concerns over reforms to the subsidy regime, and
industries such as car manufacturing and chemicals that will face new
regulations In one indication of the troubles yet to come, the UK on
Wednesday joined the Czech Republic and France in blocking a deal on a
set of rules governing which financial products can be labelled "green"
and "sustainable". France was concerned that its nuclear industry would
lose out from the "taxonomy for sustainable finance". Negotiations among
member states and the European parliament on the green financing
proposals are expected to resume on Monday. EU\'s soaring climate
rhetoric not always matched by action Green campaigners welcomed the
aims of the European Green Deal but called for more detail and higher
ambition, including a strengthening of the emissions target to a 65% cut
by 2030. Franziska Achterberg, EU spokesperson for Greenpeace, said:
"The climate targets \[the commission is\] proposing would be too little
too late. On protecting nature, much is aspirational and needs to be
fleshed out. The detailed measures that will follow must tackle the
production and consumption patterns that have brought us to the brink."
Some campaigners at the UN climate talks in Madrid also called for the
EU to bring forward its international proposals faster, to give more
momentum to the push for tougher carbon targets under the Paris
agreement. Under the commission's proposals, the plans could not be
formally adopted until next summer, giving only a few months before the
crunch 2020 climate conference in Glasgow. Wendel Trio of the Climate
Action Network said: "Timing is everything. Now EU member states have a
big responsibility to agree on a much higher 2030 climate target at the
European Council in June 2020." "The proposed package is comprehensive,
identifying the right areas for action -- from biodiversity and nature
restoration to climate change and stopping deforestation," said Ester
Asin, director of the European policy office at WWF. "However, by
emphasising continued economic growth as a key objective, the commission
has missed an opportunity to challenge the traditional growth paradigm
in favour of an approach that would respect planetary boundaries."

[Turkey has long since abandoned the West]{.underline}. Its president,
Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline}, [has aligned his country with an
axis of powers openly hostile to Western interests: China, Russia and
Iran]{.underline}. This is his prerogative as a popular, elected leader.
But Erdogan also craves the protection of the West's military
partnerships and membership in its economic associations. He wants
Turkey to remain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization even as
he buys weapons systems that undermine the alliance's security and hurls
insults at heads of member states. And he seeks "mutual trust" with the
European Union even as he threatens to flood it with millions of
migrants. [The West should respond by demonstrating that its tolerance
for Turkish truculence is **at an end**]{.underline}. **[The best forum
to do so is NATO]{.underline}**, [where patience for Erdogan is already
wearing thin.]{.underline} The alliance's first summit since President
Joe Biden's swearing-in takes place next week, and he is scheduled to
meet Erdogan on June 14. Erdogan has deployed especially bellicose
oratory against the U.S. Such hostility was met with amused tolerance by
President Donald Trump, who showed little interest in American
leadership. Now that Biden has said he will resume that responsibility,
he should make it clear to Erdogan that Turkey can't have it both ways.
Biden has had plenty of opportunities to size Erdogan up over the years,
and he has clearly concluded that the Turkish leader is an autocrat.
Turkey, he has said, has "got to understand that we're not going to
continue to play with them the way we have." Turkey is already testing
this assertion by ratcheting up the rhetoric. Interior Minister Suleyman
Soylu has openly accused the U.S. of ordering a failed 2016 coup attempt
against Erdogan, and claimed Europe was enthusiastic in its support.
This goes well beyond previous accusations, some aired by Erdogan
himself, that the U.S. had sided with the coup plotters. In fact, Biden
was vice president at the time of the coup attempt, and flew to Turkey
to assure Erdogan of American support. Although Ankara has conducted
exhaustive investigations into the events, and arrested thousands of
people, it has not provided a shred of evidence that the U.S. or Europe
were in any way involved. Yet Erdogan hasn't thought to correct his
minister's charges, much less chastise him. As for NATO, [Turkey has
brushed aside its repeated warnings against acquiring Russian
missile-defense systems]{.underline}, and is in fact proposing to buy
even more. [It has ratcheted up disputes with alliance members
Greece]{.underline} (over hydrocarbon exploration) [and
France]{.underline} (over the Libyan civil war). More recently, [it used
its membership to further Moscow's agenda by insisting that NATO water
down its criticism of Belarus for the forced landing of an airliner and
seizure of a dissident on board]{.underline}. [NATO's founding charter
doesn't allow for members to be expelled, but **Turkey can be
told**]{.underline} [in **various ways** that]{.underline} **[it's no
longer wanted as a member]{.underline}**. A good start would be to
reduce the alliance's footprint on Turkish soil, starting with the
withdrawal of nuclear weapons and other strategic assets. [The group
can]{.underline} also [coordinate punitive measures against
Turkey]{.underline}, **[including the suspension of arms]{.underline}**
sales and economic sanctions. The European Union should underline the
message by confirming it has no intention of reviving the long-stalled
talks over Turkey's accession. **[Biden could back NATO with unilateral
American measures]{.underline}**. His administration has already
indicated it may extend sanctions on Turkey's defense industry and will
uphold the country's suspension from the F-35 fighter program. Secretary
of State Antony Blinken has said even tougher penalties would be
considered. This would be welcomed by Congress, where a bipartisan
consensus on punishing Turkey had been frustrated by Trump's tendency to
cut Erdogan ever more slack. The site where Alexander ran his sword
through the Gordian knot is an hour's drive from modern Ankara.
[**Cutting Turkey loose** from the West should be a]{.underline} more
[straightforward undertaking]{.underline}.

Partnerships, among people and nations, have a wide range of possible
meanings and scope. But [alliances are]{.underline} formal agreements
that indicate a specific kind of commitment, such as
[marriage]{.underline}. [An alliance is a promise between nations to
support and defend each other, in good times and bad, sickness and
health, or more specifically, peace time or war]{.underline}.

Alliances shouldn't be entered into casually, **[but]{.underline}** they
shouldn't be unalterable either. [If an alliance becomes an obstacle to
a nation's ability to secure its needs, the standards and path for
getting out should be clear and reasonable]{.underline}. [This brings me
to Turkey]{.underline}. As any real friend to **[NATO]{.underline}**
would, I have to ask: is Turkey today really the Turkey you were drawn
to as a partner 70 years ago? I fear you **[and Turkey have grown
apart]{.underline}**, [most recently with its]{.underline} threat to
**[block]{.underline}** NATO membership **[for Sweden and
Finland]{.underline}**. I worry the growing **[differences
are]{.underline}** becoming **[irreconcilable]{.underline}**. In the
early NATO days, Turkey was sitting on the border of the Soviet Union.
When stopping Soviet expansion was NATO's primary purpose, Turkey's
geography might have been compelling enough to overcome other
shortcomings. This was easy to do, too, given Turkey's potential at the
time. It seemed to be moving firmly toward a Western identity and
embracing liberal, democratic values that NATO saw within itself. As
often happens in relationships, that promise didn't turn out, and Turkey
saw coups and unrest in the coming decades. In 2002, the West thought
this time could be different, with the democratic election of Recep
Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP), but the commitment
to democracy still wasn't real, and Turkey took a hard turn toward
illiberal, authoritarian rule. [Turkey's antidemocratic nature isn't
just a **bad look** for an alliance that claims to be grounded in
democratic principles. It also **undermines NATO's
security**]{.underline}. [Turkey wields its veto]{.underline} within the
alliance like a cudgel, [slamming its allies **on unrelated
issues**]{.underline} to punish it for not validating Erdogan's
obsession with punishing the Kurds. Erdogan is in it for [what Erdogan
wants]{.underline} --- and that frequently [doesn't align with the
alliance's interest and security]{.underline}. While they clash on
several issues, Erdogan is still close to Putin, as he tries to play
both sides. Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defense systems in 2019
was a slap in NATO's face and direct violation of U.S. sanctions. Can
Turkey still be trusted with NATO's weapons systems, or does Turkey's
snug relationship with Russia risk the compromise of classified NATO
weapons system information? [NATO, you can do better. Finland and Sweden
are courting you, after all]{.underline}. [Like Turkey, they have
capable, professional militaries and strategic geography, but they also
share]{.underline} your values, such as **[democracy and the rule of
law]{.underline}**. [You're not likely to catch Finland or Sweden
imprisoning political opponents or threatening journalists]{.underline}.
And [Erdogan's objection to]{.underline} the [accession of Finland and
Sweden raises the question of whose side Erdogan is on at]{.underline}
all. Other [NATO members have **long tired** of Turkey's duplicity and
games. This isn't the first time booting Turkey out of the alliance has
been a topic of debate]{.underline}. The possibility was raised after
Erdogan's harsh crackdown in 2016 following a failed coup attempt, as
well after Turkey invaded northeastern Syria in 2019. But since NATO has
no mechanism for suspending or expelling an ally, a path out isn't
clear. **[If the]{.underline}** rest of the **[alliance finds that
Turkey has consistently violated NATO principles]{.underline}**, [they
can]{.underline} unanimously agree to withdraw Article 5 protections
from Turkey, effectively **[suspend]{.underline}**ing its participation
and any **[assistance it receives from NATO]{.underline}**. **[This
is]{.underline}** probably **[the closest to divorce it can
get]{.underline}**, but even this determination would require a
clear-eyed assessment of the benefits Turkey brings to the table and the
risks too. Perhaps **[Turkey would]{.underline}** agree to a no-fault
divorce --- it can always **[choose to withdraw]{.underline}**. If not,
marriage counseling might be in order. No ally is the perfect ally, and
no spouse the perfect spouse. Some manner of compromise and
understanding is always necessary. It's ultimately up to
[NATO]{.underline} to decide whether Turkey is worth the formal defense
commitment, but it's a decision they [should **feel
empowered**]{.underline} to make [rather than accept the alliance as
is]{.underline}. Periodically reconsidering the value and legitimacy of
these commitments isn't unreasonable. In fact, it's one marker of a
healthy relationship.

increasing vigor and openness.]{.underline} The West once hoped ---
naively, as it turns out --- that [[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark} would
carry the banners of secularism, democracy, and liberty for the Turkish
people, but he [has [led Turkey]{.mark} in the opposite direction:
[toward]{.mark} Islamist politics, [authoritarianism, and
tyranny]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**It is time to expel Turkey from
NATO**.]{.underline} This is a possibility that has been considered
before. Erdogan's brutal suppression of dissent beginning in 2016 and
his cooperation with Moscow in acquiring Russian air-defense technology
both led to calls for NATO to sever ties with Turkey. Booting Turkey out
of NATO will be tricky on both the legal and political fronts, not least
because the North Atlantic Treaty does not contain an explicit mechanism
for expelling a member. The lawyers will no doubt dice it pretty fine if
NATO members argue that Turkey is in material breach of its treaty
obligations, but as a matter of fact **[[Turkey is undermining
NATO]{.mark} in the service of Erdogan's domestic political
needs.]{.underline}** [Turkey is advancing the interests of Moscow and
Beijing and making it more difficult for NATO members to engage in
collective self-defense]{.underline}, which is the point of NATO. And
morally, [Turkey does not deserve to be in NATO. NATO's job is to defend
its members against police states, not to provide a snug harbor in which
authoritarianism may be cultivated.]{.underline} NATO's neighboring
bureaucracy in Brussels should also do Erdogan the courtesy of being
frank and formally ending all consideration of Turkey as a candidate for
membership in the European Union. Turkey was not a very good fit for the
European Union at its best, and it is far from at its best today. Beyond
its backsliding into soft dictatorship, Turkey is an economic basket
case with 70 percent inflation and increasingly irresponsible economic
policies. The European Union had a hard enough time with Greece's
financial shenanigans, and Greece is Denmark compared to Turkey.
Geopolitics is not a matter of friendship. As Lord Palmerston put it
(and here the full quotation is more illuminating than the apocryphal
proverb attributed to Charles de Gaulle), "We have no eternal allies,
and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and
perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow." There was a
time when it seemed that Turkey was fitted to NATO's permanent
interests. Turkey joined NATO in 1952, when the organization was not yet
a decade old and Joseph Stalin was still extant, if only barely that.
NATO's optimism was perhaps excessive, but, at the time, Turkey
identified itself very strongly with the West and looked westward toward
its future. [Today's Turkey looks eastward]{.underline}, and that fact
should be acknowledged. Things did not have to go this way, but Turkey
has made its choices --- not only the autocratic junta of Recep Tayyip
Erdogan but the Turkish people, too. Perhaps that looks like a tragedy
when seen from Brussels and like something else when seen from Ankara.
But however we feel about them, [the facts on the ground are what they
are, and it is time for NATO to recognize this and act
accordingly]{.underline}.

### NATO-Turkey Relations -- Brink -- UQ

#### The US-Turkey partnership has reached its climax and tensions are high

**Beyoghlow 20,** Kamal Beyoghlow, Adjunct Associate Professor of
Government at American University, "Turkey and the United States on the
Brink: Implications for NATO and US-Turkish Strategic and Military
Partnership", USAWC Press, January 18^th^ 2020, pg 1-5,
<https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/63534> // GD

[The US-Turkish strategic partnership]{.underline} established at the
end of World War II [reached its climax in the late eighties,
and]{.underline} is at a dangerous crossroad. Such an outcome [has had a
devastating effect on Turkey's relationship with other Western partners,
especially NATO, which has been the backbone of America's defense
alliance]{.underline} since the start of the Cold War. This situation,
if it continues, is likely to force the unraveling of NATO as a cohesive
organization at a time when it is facing a myriad of collective global
security challenges, particularly in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan---far
beyond its traditional defensive posture on the European continent. All
is not lost, however, and with more diligent diplomatic and
military-to-military dialogue and compromises, US-Turkish relations can
be salvaged.

States with long and deep commitments to one another seldom experience
the kind of political and military distrust and uncertainties
characterizing the current state of affairs between Turkey and its
traditional Western allies, including the United States[. Much of the
ongoing tensions can be traced to the American-led interventions in Iraq
and Syria]{.underline}, as well as to other fundamental strategic
disagreements over how best to shape the future of the Greater Middle
East and North Africa. Although some agencies within the US government
have had differences with Turkey over the latter's increasingly
authoritarian bent, not all elements within the US government are in
agreement with the reasons or path forward. No one factor can be
attributed to the new authoritarian trend in Turkey. After all, the
majority of the Turkish public, through elections and referendums, has
given President Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party
(AKP) the mandate they need to rule and change the political rules of
the game in Turkey. Moreover, [Turkey's deeply fragmented political
system and its weak political parties have played a role in the changes
in the nature and the character of Turkey's political system from a
military authoritarian one to a civilian authoritarian one.]{.underline}

From Turkey's perspective, the United States and NATO have turned upside
down the game plans of others in the region, chief among them Turkey's
ruling AKP and its leader, President Erdogan. Using some imagination,
one can foresee the adverse impacts American operational and tactical
moves have had on Turkey since the invasion of Iraq in 2003; and more
recently, since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. America's
sponsorship, training, and military support of the Kurd-dominated Arab
democratic force in Syria---a compilation of predominantly Kurdish
fighters and supporters affiliated with the Syrian Kurdish Democratic
Union Party (PYD); its military wing, the People's Protection Units
(YPG); and the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), fighters which Turkey
considers its most dangerous political and military nemeses---have
strained US-Turkish relations and impacted Turkish public opinion of the
United States in a negative way. Turkey views Western military and
logistical support for Kurds in Syria and Iraq as inimical to its
broader regional interest of containing Kurdish nationalism in Turkey
and beyond and preventing the emergence of Syrian Kurdish enclaves close
to its southeast borders, where the bulk of Turkish Kurds reside.
Turkey's long-term position on any autonomous or federated Kurdish
enclaves in surrounding regional states could invite calls by Turkish
Kurds for similar calls and encourage the PKK---a US designated terror
organization---to continue carrying out cross-border attacks on Turkish
institutions and territory.

Although there has been no indication so far that rules of engagement
involving US military trainees and special forces units have changed as
far as Turkey's security along its southeastern frontier is concerned,
the potential for serious clashes between the Turkish military and the
Syrian Kurds has been growing following the fall of Raqqa, the seat of
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's (ISIS's) caliphate in Syria and
Iraq. Since the summer of 2012, the Turkish media has frequently
reported incidents of Turkish fighter jets and ground forces taking off
from their bases to chase off Syrian Kurdish units operating too close 4
to Turkey's border.1 Ankara-backed Syrian groups fighting Syrian
President Bashar Assad's regime have emerged as the main beneficiary of
these rules of engagement, which have effectively served as a Turkish
cover for the country's military and logistical operations in border
regions, especially since the fall of the Syrian town of Afrin and the
expulsion of Kurdish fighters from there by Turkish troops and their
Muslim Syrian Sunni fighter allies, including the Free Syrian Army, on
March 18, 2018.

[Anti-Americanism in Turkey appears to be increasing]{.underline} as the
war in Syria continues unabated. [These attitudes, if they persist, are
likely to adversely affect the resiliency of the traditional partnership
among the United States, Turkey, and NATO]{.underline}---especially the
military-to-military relationship---including basing rights and other
defense commitments enshrined in NATO's declaration of principles.
Turkey is already moving toward an uneasy strategic alliance with Russia
and Iran to address the future of Syria and to diversify its logistical
and military weapon purchases and ultimate dependency beyond NATO. The
proposed Turkish purchase of the S-400 air defense system from Russia to
compensate for Turkey's gap in air defense capability and the
consummation of a long-standing nuclear power deal following years of
delicate negotiations between Russia and Turkey will most certainly have
profound security implications for the United States, NATO, and the
Middle Eastern and North African states. [The S-400 acquisition by
Turkey poses two problems for NATO: (1) a lack of interoperability with
existing NATO platforms and (2) fear that increased military cooperation
between Russia and Turkey could expose NATO platforms to Russian
espionage activities, ultimately undermine Turkey's resolve and
commitment to NATO, and weaken the organization.]{.underline} [Russian
President Vladimir Putin has long sought to weaken NATO, which he
considers an existential threat to his state.]{.underline}

#### Turkey disagrees with and disrupts NATO cooperation and decision-making

**Ebrahim & Lawati 6/29** (Ebrahim and Lawai, both journalists and
reporters for CNN, specializing in Middle East reporting, "How Erdogan's
Turkey became NATO's wild card", CNN, 6/30/22,

**[Erdogan has disagreed with NATO allies on a number of
issues]{.underline}**, including Syria and Libya, and [has used his
country\'s strategic location to extract concessions from his European
neighbors by threatening [to open the
floodgates](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/syria-turkey-offensive-displaced-intl-hnk/index.html) of
refugees from neighboring conflict zones]{.underline}.

In 2009, Turkey [opposed the
appointment](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/04/03/nato.rasmussen/index.html) of
Denmark\'s Anders Fogh Rasmussen as head of NATO until then-US
President[ Barack Obama
pledged](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4594859) that one of
Rasmussen\'s deputies would be a Turk. Turkey had argued that
Rasmussen\'s [handling of the
offenses](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/02/06/denmark.cartoons/index.html) to
Prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2006 were problematic. In
perhaps its boldest and most [controversial
move](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/13/europe/turkey-russia-missiles-nato-analysis-intl/index.html),
[**Turkey in 2019 bought the Russian S-400 missile defense system,
calling into question a decades-long alliance with both the US and
NATO.** The S-400 missiles were designed to shoot down NATO
planes.]{.underline} [Sinan
Ulgen](https://carnegieendowment.org/experts/547), a former Turkish
diplomat and chairman of Istanbul-based think-tank EDAM, said
**[Erdogan\'s]{.underline}** \"hyper-centralized decision-making\" and
his \"[combative, more
aggressive](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/11/europe/turkey-analysis-erdogan-intl/index.html),
\[and\] less consensus-driven\" **[leadership style has caused
difficulties for NATO.]{.underline}** \"[This is also a reflection of
the increased unpredictability of [Turkish foreign
policy](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/30/europe/turkey-politics-commentary-hakura/index.html),\"]{.underline}
he said. But experts say that it\'s only natural that a member of an
alliance will prioritize national interests where it can. **[The problem
arises when those interests diverge from NATO\'s agenda.]{.underline}**
\"**[The Turks complicate NATO\'s consensus-based
decision-making]{.underline}** [because they refuse to go with the flow
until national interests are satisfied,]{.underline}\" said [Rich
Outzen](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/richard-outzen/), a
senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC and former US
military officer and State Department official. \"This is not bad
alliance behavior; it is typical alliance behavior for states with the
weight to pull it off,\" he added.

While Turkey understands its value to NATO, it also sees its own benefit
in its membership, analysts say. [Ankara has gone to NATO more than once
for strategic security support, said Ulgen.]{.underline} \"It is a
security and political relationship that is mutually beneficial.
\"Ultimately Turkiye and NATO do need each other,\" he said, using the
[country\'s new
name](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/middleeast/turkey-name-change-mime-intl/index.html).

#### Turkey has been making controversial decisions even in the NATO

**Crowley and Erlanger, 22** (Michael Crowley and Steven Erlanger-
Diplomatic correspondent, Chief diplomatic correspondent, "For NATO,
Turkey is a Disruptive Ally", The New York Times, May 30, 2022
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/us/politics/turkey-nato-russia.html)//IW

[When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatened this month to
block NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, Western officials were
exasperated --- but not shocked. **After a rupture in relations between
Turkey and Israel the next year, Mr. Erdogan prevented the alliance from
working with the Jewish state for six years. A few years later, Mr.
Erdogan delayed for months a NATO plan to fortify Eastern European
countries against Russia, again citing Kurdish militants and demanding
that the alliance declare ones operating in Syria to be terrorists. In
2020, Mr. Erdogan sent a gas-exploration ship backed by fighter jets
close to Greek waters, causing France to send ships in support of
Greece, also a NATO member.**]{.underline} Now the Turkish leader is
back in the role of obstructionist, and is once again invoking the
Kurds, as he charges that Sweden and Finland sympathize with the Kurdish
militants he has made his main enemy. "These countries have almost
become guesthouses for terrorist organizations," he said this month. "It
is not possible for us to be in favor." It is a situation that **[plays
to the advantage of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has grown
friendlier with Mr. Erdogan in recent years]{.underline}**. For the
Russian leader, the rejection of Swedish and Finnish admission into NATO
would be a significant victory. **[The quandary would be simpler were it
not for Turkey's importance to the alliance]{.underline}**. The country
joined NATO in 1952 after aligning with the West against the Soviet
Union; Turkey gives the alliance a crucial strategic position at the
intersection of Europe and Asia, astride both the Middle East and the
Black Sea. It hosts a major U.S. air base where American nuclear weapons
are stored, and Mr. Erdogan has blocked Russian warships headed toward
Ukraine. But under **[Mr. Erdogan]{.underline}**, Turkey has
increasingly become a problem to be managed. As prime minister and then
as president, he **[has tilted his country away from
Europe]{.underline}** while practicing an authoritarian and populist
brand of Islamist politics, especially since a failed coup attempt in
2016. **[He has purchased an advanced missile system from Russia that
NATO officials call a threat to their integrated defense systems, and in
2019 he mounted a military incursion to battle Kurds in northern Syria
who were aiding the fight against the Islamic State with U.S.
support.]{.underline}** An [opinion
essay](https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-erdogans-turkey-belong-in-nato-sweden-finland-join-veto-weapons-peace-broker-11652882743?mod=hp_trending_now_opn_pos3)
this month that was co-written by Joseph I. Lieberman, a former
independent U.S. senator from Connecticut, argued that Mr. Erdogan's
Turkey would flunk the alliance's standards for democratic governance in
prospective new member states. The essay, published by The Wall Street
Journal, warned that Ankara's policies, including **[a coziness with Mr.
Putin, had undermined NATO's interests and that the alliance should
explore ways of ejecting Turkey.]{.underline}** Some members of Congress
have said as much. "**[Turkey under Erdogan should not and cannot be
seen as an ally,]{.underline}**" Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the
top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after
Turkey's 2019 incursion into Syria. "**[Turkey has undermined its own
image]{.underline}**," said Alper Coskun, a former Turkish diplomat who
is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. But, he added, "it is still a critical member of the alliance."
Some American analysts are skeptical. Eric S. Edelman, a former U.S.
ambassador to Turkey and Finland, warned that **[Mr. Erdogan could be
seeking to curry favor with Mr. Putin --- or at least ease the anger in
Moscow over the sale of lethal drones to Ukraine's military by a private
Turkish company.]{.underline}** Others believe the Turkish leader wants
a payoff from Washington. **[Mr. Erdogan is angry that the United States
denied Turkey access to the F-35 stealth fighter after his 2017 purchase
of the Russian S-400 missile system]{.underline}**. Turkey is now
lobbying instead to buy enhanced F-16 fighters but has met stiff
resistance in Congress from the likes of Mr. Menendez. **[Mr. Erdogan
may also be seeking presidential attention]{.underline}**. He had a
friendly rapport with President Donald J. Trump, but Mr. Biden has kept
his distance. Mr. Peker believes that an agreement can be negotiated
between Turkey and the Nordic countries before a NATO summit in Madrid
next month, which would allow for the accession protocols to be signed
there. At [a talk hosted by the Council on Foreign
Relations](https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-adam-smith-0) last
week, Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee, suggested that the stakes of
Swedish and Finnish membership were great enough to warrant direct U.S.
involvement.

[Turkey has sought to expand its strategic autonomy by forming
intergovernmental, military, and economic links with autocratic powers,
such as Russia, China, Iran and]{.underline} [Qatar]{.underline}, which
provided incumbents alternative sources of political and economic
support. The earlier attempts to build alternative intergovernmental
linkages out of NATO had occurred in 2010 when the Chinese-Turkish joint
military drills, known as Peace Mission 2010 and sponsored by the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), took place in Turkey. Two years
later, Turkey became a dialogue partner with the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization and has expressed an interest in obtaining observer status
or even joining as a full member. Turkey's contract with the blacklisted
Chinese company, China Precision Machinery Export-Import Corporation for
a T-LORAMIDS air missile program in 2013, had eventually backfired in
November 2015 under the intense pressure of the NATO and its members.
[In his visit to Beijing in 2019, President Erdoğan stressed that Turkey
and China share a "common future vision" and re-mentioned Turkey's
desire to join SCO, which he first discussed with Russian leader
Vladimir Putin back in January 2013.]{.underline}

Turkey's estrangement from the West following the abortive military coup
attempt on 15 July 2016 changed the external opportunity structure in
favor of China and Russia. Several high-level Chinese delegations to
Turkey and the strategic coordination between China's Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) and Turkey's Middle Corridor Initiative (MCI) ---
stretching through the Caucasus and Central Asia, all accelerated and
promoted strategic cooperation between two countries that have started
back in 2010.In November 2016, Turkey and China signed an agreement to
align China's BRI with Turkey's MCI. Turkey's geostrategic location with
trade access to Europe, Iran and Russia gave Turkey primary position
within the framework of the BRI, and as a result the volume of China's
FDI in Turkey has, since then, increased more than threefold. The trade
volume between China and Turkey has also improved significantly reaching
to 24 billion US dollars as of 2020, as Beijing became Ankara's
second-largest trading partner. Turkey and China have also engaged in
developing alternative connectivity and information linkages. [In 2017,
Turkey signed The Belt and Road Digital Economy International
Cooperation Initiative to build an interconnected Digital Silk Road. In
the same year, Turkey's leading GSM operator Turkcell and Chinese
technology giant Huawei signed an agreement in 2018 to collaborate on
smart cities.]{.underline} In 2019, Turk Telekom partnered with Huawei
to build the country's 5G Network and claimed to set world record for
single user 5G smartphone speed. In May 2021, two countries agreed
during State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visit to Ankara to
further promote the synergy between China's BRI and Turkey's MCI, to
strengthen strategic cooperation in various fields including
connectivity, infrastructure construction and investment and to deepen
communication and coordination for achieving the security and stability
in the Middle East. Russia has also skillfully exploited the new
external opportunity structure after the failed coup for its own
benefit. [Russia's full-throated support for President Erdoğan during
and after the coup has deepened bilateral security cooperation
culminating into the arrival of the Russian S-400 air-defense system in
Turkey on the date of the third anniversary of the abortive
coup.]{.underline} While economic linkages in the areas of trade,
investment, energy, and tourism have asymmetrically strengthened Russian
leverage, intergovernmental linkages between two countries are also
expanded thanks to several high-level state visits and formal bilateral
agreements, such as the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council.

//nehahahah

Lately, [Ankara has looked more actively to the East for alternatives to
Euroatlantic integration, focusing in on the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO).]{.underline} [Observers often point to the recent
Turkish--Russian strategic rapprochement]{.underline} as an important
indicator of the viability of Ankara's SCO ambitions. [While Russia has
doubtlessly been a key player within the SCO since its creation in 2001,
it will be China that sets the tone for Turkey's future relations with
the SCO and the transatlantic community**. Turkish suggestions that
closer ties with the SCO might be traded in for NATO membership threaten
to further erode transatlantic security cooperation.**]{.underline} The
United States and Europe should therefore clearly signal to Beijing that
[Turkey's relationship with the SCO could increase tensions between
China and transatlantic partners.]{.underline} At the same time,
devising a convincing approach to managing [Turkey's strategic
realignment will be critical to ongoing U.S. and European efforts to
shape China's increasingly visible global security
ambitions]{.underline} in a way that is conducive to transatlantic
strategic interests. [Ankara Turns to the SCO]{.underline} The SCO
serves China, Russia, and Central and South Asian member states as a
forum [for security cooperation]{.underline}, especially related to
border management and counterterrorism, with training and exchanges on
the latter being coordinated within the framework of an SCO Regional
Anti-Terrorist Structure. [SCO members also regularly conduct joint
military exercises, and **they cooperate on cybersecurity
matters**]{.underline}. Though Turkey has been an SCO dialogue partner
since 2012, which constitutes the most basic form of association with
the SCO, Ankara has used various high-profile opportunities to express
interest in obtaining SCO observer status or joining the organization as
a full member since 2013. President Erdoğan made his latest public
reference to the idea of full SCO membership in November 2016.[3 Western
security analysts tend to refute the geostrategic significance of the
SCO and rightly downplay its potential as a direct military competitor
to NATO.]{.underline} Nevertheless, Turkey's cozying up to the SCO and
implicit suggestions of a trade-in for NATO membership and European
integration [should ring some alarm bells in Europe and the United
States.]{.underline} Ankara might feel less inclined to please Brussels
institutions as the EU membership option crumbles away and
disappointment with NATO Allies grows. There can be little doubt,
though, that Turkey continues to hold significant strategic value for
the West when it comes to tackling regional security challenges. For EU
member states, it is paramount that the refugee deal struck with Turkey
in March 2016 holds firm. Turkey hosts a range of important NATO
military facilities that are of vital strategic importance to the
Alliance's ability to project force in the Middle East. Turkey also
remains one of the few remaining conduits the West has for communicating
with Russia about strategy in Syria --- even though the extent to which
Turkish and wider transatlantic strategic interests on this issue align
is increasingly questionable.

#### Turkey has had history of helping both sides

**Wilkinson, 22** (Tracy Wilkinson, She is an experienced journalist for
crisis and wars, "So, why is Turkey in NATO, anyway? A look at the
country's complex history with the alliance", Los Angeles Times, June
29, 2022,
https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-29/so-why-is-turkey-in-nato-anyway)//IW

Emerging from World War II, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was
established by 10 European countries, the United States and Canada to
form a bulwark against the communist-ruled Soviet Union. It was a pillar
in the new world order that was to last for the rest of the century and
into this one.

[In the years following World War II, Turkey found itself in a unique
geopolitical position, at the crossroads of numerous civilizations, many
of them at odds]{.underline}: [Europe, Asia, the Middle East, the
Caucasus.]{.underline} And sandwiched between the Black Sea to the north
and the Mediterranean to the south.

It was eager for protection and status. [In 1950, Turkey dispatched its
troops to support U.S. and United Nations forces repelling North Korea's
attempted invasion of the southern part of the peninsula, an action that
won enduring praise from the West.]{.underline}

And so in 1952, Turkey joined NATO, hoping to bolster its aspiration to
a Western identity and to ensure its security, especially against an
ascending Soviet Union. It was the first expansion of NATO after its
founding in 1949.

That makes the problems NATO is having today with Turkey all the more
curious. [Once fearing the Soviet Union, Turkey now is out of step with
NATO policies in its friendliness with Moscow, buying Russia's weapons
and refusing to join U.S.-led sanctions against the Russian
government.]{.underline}

[Most of these shifts can be traced to Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, who was elected prime minister in 2003 and has not left power
since.]{.underline}

Concessions were the real goal, several analysts said --- from NATO and
especially the United States. [The Biden administration has kept Erdogan
at arm's length over his human rights record, arrests of thousands of
dissidents and journalists, and his intervention in Syria that
slaughtered U.S.-supported Kurds and backed Russia and, ultimately, the
government of Bashar Assad.]{.underline}

A Biden administration official said Tuesday that no concessions were
granted.

"What Erdogan is trying to do is engage Biden," said Bulent Aliriza, a
founding director of the Turkey project at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a think tank in Washington.

[Erdogan had close relations with former President Trump]{.underline},
who declared himself a "big fan" of the Turkish president when he
welcomed him to the White House in 2019. By contrast, President Biden
has had a couple of telephone conversations with the Turkish leader ---
including one on Tuesday --- and met him only on the margins of
international conferences, as will happen at this week's NATO meeting in
Madrid.

[Turkey has also sought to parlay the Russian war in Ukraine to its
favor by showing NATO how it can be a valuable partner, despite its
friendliness with Moscow.]{.underline} Members of the Erdogan family
build and sell drones to the Ukrainian military. Erdogan has hosted
peace talks, which have so far been unproductive, between the
governments of Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, and is reportedly
attempting to open Black Sea ports blockaded by Russia to free up
Ukrainian grain exports.

"[The invasion has been a window of opportunity]{.underline}" for
Erdogan, said Gonul Tol, who heads the Turkey program at the Middle East
Institute in Washington. "It has allowed him to attempt to rebuild the
image of Turkey as a key NATO ally \... a valued partner, as opposed to
a year ago when Turkey was portrayed as a Trojan horse in NATO."

But, she warned, Erdogan could easily overplay his hand.

"Maximalist demands could undermine the goodwill," Tol said.

Though a religious government also goes against the grain in NATO, [it
is Turkey's military ties with Russia that have most concerned the U.S.
government and lawmakers in Washington, who demanded sanctions against
Ankara.]{.underline}

Despite repeated warnings from Washington and NATO, [Erdogan in 2019
purchased a large number of Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile
systems.]{.underline} They are not compatible with NATO weaponry, and
Western officials were worried that the purchases would give Russia
access to NATO intelligence and equipment specs.

Turkey, with one of the largest militaries in all of Europe, has also
sent troops to Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo to back up
U.S. and U.N. peacekeeping forces.

But, Ciddi said, Erdogan "can turn the tables on the United States and

Earlier this month, Erdogan welcomed the disgraced crown prince of Saudi
Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, to Ankara less than four years after
journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in
Istanbul, an act that U.S. intelligence says was ordered by Mohammed.

The killing provoked outrage throughout NATO, the U.S. and even Turkey
at the time. [But now Erdogan, facing dire economic conditions
domestically and a potentially difficult election next year, must look
for friends where he can]{.underline}, analysts say.

[Erdogan's relationship with Russia is complex]{.underline}, said Henri
Barkey, a Turkey-born former State Department official who is now a
professor at Lehigh University and adjunct senior fellow at the Council
on Foreign Relations. For example: showing support for Ukraine but also
needing Moscow to fight Kurds in Syria.

But in the end, "like Putin, [Erdogan is his own worst
enemy]{.underline}," Barkey said, noting that [his actions "undermine
his credibility and they don't trust him."]{.underline}

**[NATO's most important challenge]{.underline}** today
**[may]{.underline}** not **[come]{.underline}** from Russia, but
**[from within]{.underline}**. With the number of disputes between
Turkey and several European allies yet again on the rise, the two
parties' souring relations have begun undermining the organization's
cohesion and ability to make timely collective decisions. If left
unaddressed, these tensions could cause serious damage to the world's
most powerful alliance. The latest flashpoint came from Turkey's open
backing of Azerbaijan's war effort in the small landlocked enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended abruptly in early November thanks to a
Russian-brokered deal. Reports of [military
assistance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sebastienroblin/2020/09/28/turkish-drones-over-nagorno-karabakh-and-other-updates-from-a-day-old-war/#35529d9770da) and
alleged [Syrian
mercenaries](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/10/05/nagorno-karabakh-syrians-turkey-armenia-azerbaijan/) sent
by Turkey placed Ankara at loggerheads with its [NATO allies'
calls](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178333.htm) for a
peaceful, negotiated resolution to the conflict. The deal, which
foresees Baku reacquiring sizeable portions of the disputed enclave, has
made Turkey one of the [obvious
winners](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54903869) of the recent
flare-up, while its Western allies [remain on the
sidelines](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-win-eu-loss-in-nagorno-karabakh/).
For some, this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, adding
to a long list of complaints they have recently leveled against their
NATO ally.

Last month, Greece and Turkey came dangerously close to a [head-on naval
confrontation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53497741) in
disputed Eastern Mediterranean waters over Turkey's gas exploration
activities near the Greek island of Kastellorizo, just a few hundred
meters away from the Turkish coast. [**Though Turkey later withdrew its
ship, tensions between the two NATO allies spiked** again
following [Turkey's
announcement](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20201112-turkey-extends-research-ships-mission-in-eastern-mediterranean/) that
it would send the ship back for a 10-day seismic research mission in the
area, renewing Greek calls for sanctions.]{.underline} What makes this a
particularly explosive situation, of course, is the two Eastern
Mediterranean powers' lingering dispute over the post-1974 division of
Cyprus and the discovery of energy resources in the area. A similar
confrontational encounter occurred in June when France and Turkey
nearly [came to blows](https://euobserver.com/foreign/148704) after a
French warship, the Courbet, tried to inspect a Turkish vessel for
allegedly breaching a U.N. arms embargo on Libya --- a claim

as well as over Turkey's territorial claims in the Mediterranean. [The
latest spat followed President Emmanuel Macron's [defense of a

Erdoğan responded by [calling for a

**[Within NATO, the escalation in tensions and growing
entanglement]{.underline}** of the two camps' now numerous disputes
**[reflects European allies' mounting frustration over what they
perceive as Turkey's self-serving and aggressive regional
posturing]{.underline}**, and [its unwillingness to consult allies
before acting.]{.underline} A NATO member since 1952, Turkey has always
occupied a somewhat unique role in the alliance. Its size, military
resources, and key position at the doorstep of Asia --- in other words,
as NATO's southern flank --- give it important strategic relevance
within the context of renewed interest in the Middle East. Though
relations have often been fragile, especially since the [2016 coup
attempt](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2016)589776),
the current rift marks a new low in the recent history of the alliance,
with potentially damaging consequences. Given this backdrop, NATO should
take advantage of its own resources to try to address its members'
deteriorating relations, and work to reconcile their diverging security
interests. This is a lot easier said than done, but it may be the only
option to prevent a more fundamental rupture in the relationship.
**[Divided We Stand]{.underline}** As tensions grow, a key risk for NATO
relates to the crisis' potential to hamper its cohesion and ability to
act decisively, as the alliance relies on the [principle of
consensus](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49178.htm) to
successfully operate. Every major NATO decision embodies the collective
will of all allies and results, therefore, from a complex but fragile
process of negotiation wherein nations are invited to compromise on
matters of mutual interest. The inevitable drawback to this is that
every ally possesses a de facto right to veto any NATO issue if its
demands are not met, which they may be incentivized to use as leverage
to pursue national interests. The same can be said of the European
Union, which operates on unanimity and where Cyprus recently made
headlines for [blocking
sanctions](https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/cyprus-blocks-eus-belarus-sanctions-plan/) on
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's regime, insisting on the
imposition of E.U. measures on Turkey for its energy exploration in
Mediterranean waters. The European Union
was [criticized](https://www.politico.eu/article/borrell-admits-eu-credibility-is-at-stake-in-failure-to-sanction-belarus/) for
failing to agree on timely sanctions.

Unlike the European Union, NATO consultations are held behind closed
doors, and disagreements largely avoid public scrutiny. In principle,
however, any nation's objections could stall key alliance policy or
business. **[Last year, leaks revealed that Turkey had [threatened on
the eve of a NATO summit to
block](https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/news/turkey-continues-to-block-natos-eastern-defence-plans/) a
key defense plan to protect the Baltic states and Poland against Russian
aggression unless NATO backed its own recognition of the Kurdish
People's Protection Units militia as terrorists.]{.underline}**
Likewise, for years, Turkey had vetoed NATO cooperation with neutral
Austria under its partnership program in response to Vienna's calls for
the European Union to halt membership talks with Ankara. Though in both
cases deals were eventually reached to break the deadlock, and though
such negotiation tactics are not uncommon, **[these incidents highlight
a mounting climate of uncooperativeness and unwillingness to compromise
between allies, making interaction increasingly
difficult.]{.underline}** As Ankara grows more defiant, NATO members are
indeed finding it difficult to reign in their southeastern ally. With
the 2011 Arab Spring and its aftermath, the rapid deterioration of
Turkey's regional and domestic security environments has coincided with
a growing perception that its Western allies are not giving enough
credence to its core security interests. The stalled European
Union [membership
project](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/turkeys-eu-membership-bid-evaporating-commission-says/),
together with America's disengagement from the Middle East, support for
the [Kurdish People's Protection Units
militia](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/10/09/the-us-played-down-turkeys-concerns-about-syrian-kurdish-forces-that-couldnt-last/),
and persistent [refusal to
extradite](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-khashoggi-usa-gulen-idUSKCN1NL2FJ) cleric
Fethullah Gülen, the presumed mastermind of the failed 2016 coup
attempt, have all contributed to strengthening the conviction that
Turkish security interests are likely best served through autonomous
action --- and not by relying on a suspicious and divided West. This
impression is reinforced by Europe's [vocal
criticism](https://www.dw.com/en/turkish-democracy-backsliding-eu-says-in-membership-report/a-48965952) of
Erdoğan's concentration of executive power, and by the country's
worsening economic and social woes.

Overall, **[these factors have eroded NATO's credibility and
influence]{.underline}** over Ankara, just as the latter has become more
conscious of its own considerable leverage over Europe due to its key
role in Syria, which NATO sees as the defense of its southern frontier,
and in easing the pressure to accommodate large arrivals of refugees on
European shores. The former is linked to Turkey's vetoing of NATO's
defense plan for Poland and the Baltics, which aimed at compelling NATO
to provide greater support in Turkey's defense of the alliance's
southern flank --- something Ankara has demanded for years. Likewise,
Turkey's handling of its [four million-strong refugee
population](https://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Turkey%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20September%202020_1.pdf),
the largest in the world, has contributed to Ankara's influence over
Brussels through its instrumentalization of fears that it would "open
the gates" to Europe for migrants and refugees, which Erdoğan announced
earlier this year in violation of a 2016 E.U.-Turkish agreement. Given
its shrewd sense that the tables have turned, Ankara has lost many
incentives to cooperate. Of course, one key risk is that Turkey's bold
strategy backfires and leads to a fresh round of retaliatory measures
such as [collective
sanctions](https://www.euronews.com/2020/10/15/calls-growing-for-eu-sanctions-against-turkey-over-actions-in-eastern-mediterranean-and-cy) or
cutbacks in E.U. funds, with damaging effects on Turkey's weakening
economy.

For NATO, another conceivable consequence lays in the reinforcement of
calls for greater European "[strategic
autonomy](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/09/28/l-autonomie-strategique-europeenne-est-l-objectif-de-notre-generation-discours-du-president-charles-michel-au-groupe-de-reflexion-bruegel/)"
in the realms of defense and security, with potentially harmful
repercussions on the future of the transatlantic community. Against a
backdrop of deteriorating Euro-Atlantic relations, several leaders have
begun to publicly question the relevance and effectiveness of NATO as an
organization. A staunch advocate of the "strategic autonomy" concept,
**[Macron reacted to the clash with Turkey over the arms embargo on
Libya by reiterating his assertion that NATO was "[brain
dead](https://www.euronews.com/2020/06/23/emmanuel-macron-turkey-is-playing-a-dangerous-game-in-libya)"
for being unable to temper Turkish adventurism]{.underline}**. In a
recent [interview](https://www.politico.eu/article/armenia-president-armen-sarkissian-nato-turkey-involvement-nagorno-karabakh/),
**[Armenian President Armen Sarkissian echoed these remarks by putting
at stake NATO's credibility over the organization's seeming inability to
influence its member's involvement in the Caucasus]{.underline}**.
**[Were NATO to become increasingly paralyzed by souring internal
relations, doubts about the effectiveness and reliability of the
organization could further incentivize E.U. countries into acting beyond
the NATO framework.]{.underline}** Regrettably, this could result in
accelerating E.U. states' ostracizing of Ankara, while persuading some
allies into seeking additional bilateral arrangements as more reliable
forms of security guarantees.

The Black Sea region is one of the re- gions in which Turkey has lost
its influ- ence to Russia. **[NATO and the EU have no influence on
relations between Rus- sia and Turkey]{.underline}**, as the Presidents
of both countries either ignore the EU\'s efforts or, as in the case of
Erdogan, despise their at- tempts to appease him. In addition, [NATO has
no mechanism for excluding Turkey as a member state. Although the EU has
implicitly suspended negotiations on Tur- key\'s possible EU membership,
it is not prepared to make a clear statement that Turkey will not join
the Union in the fore- seeable future. The leaders of both organ-
izations continue to hope that Erdogan will change the authoritarian
course of the country and return to a European way and reconsider the
comfortable relations with Putin. Erdogan has other plans, and as a
result the leaders of NATO and the EU are likely to wait in
vain.]{.underline} It must be emphasised that Erdogan was and is not an
equal partner in the Turkish-- Russian relationship, although both
Presi- dent Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Er- dogan have a similarly
authoritarian style of government. [Erdogan called Putin \"my dear
friend Vladimir\"]{.underline} at a press confer- ence in St. Petersburg
on 9 August 2016, shortly after the restoration of bilateral relations,
which were damaged by a Turk- ish F-16 fighter plane on 24 November 2015
after the launch of a Russian Su-24 bomber. But Putin did not call
Erdogan \"my dear friend\" Tayyip. There is a saying that Russia has no
friends. As the Russian Tsar Alexander III previously said: has only two
allies -- the army and the navy.\" And in the 21st century, Russia also
has nuclear deterrence and the right of veto in the UN Security Council.
It can therefore be said that Putin does not regard Erdogan as a friend,
but as an unequal counterpart. In addition, Murat Bilhan, former head of
the Turkish Foreign Ministry\'s Strategic Re- search Centre, said:
\"Behind Putin\'s smile, Russia remains a great state and can show its
talons whenever it suits him. Turkey could never compete with Russia.
Russia is a superpower, while Turkey is a regional power.\" Turkey
should not be under any illusions about its role in relations, namely
that of the second fiddle. While Erdogan\'s authoritarian rule has
alienated allies in Europe and the United States, it has strengthened
Putin\'s control over Turkey and embarrassed Erdogan. Pu- tin\'s
economic sanctions against Turkey in November 2015 caused serious damage
to the Turkish economy when Russian tour- ists stayed away from Turkey.
Putin can im- pose these economic sanctions and travel Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met with
representatives of the Russian Defence Ministry to discuss Russian
"counter-terrorism operations" in Syria. On 13 November 2017, Vladimir
Putin met with President of Turkey Re- cep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi to
discuss bilateral relations and current issues on the international
agenda. 28 European Security & Defence · March 2018 Photo: Kremlin.ru
Photo: Kremlin.ru have received unconditional support from Russia. The
cost of unconditional support from Russia remains high and has a long-
term impact. In addition, the renewed co- operation between Ankara and
Moscow is to take place on Russian terms, and Turkey reluctantly accepts
this reality.\" [The never-ending story of **Erdogan\'s deci- sion to
buy the S-400 air defence system from Russia** is an example of Putin\'s
view of Moscow\'s support for Turkey. Turkey buys a system **that is not
compatible with NATO standards** and cannot be integrated into NATO\'s
air defence system.]{.underline} That is why Turkey must confine itself
to its own archi- tecture. Even if Russia is ready to carry out
maintenance work, maintenance is carried out by Russian and not by
Turkish workers. At the same time, Russia is not prepared to supply
software codes, IFF systems, joint production with Turkey and certainly
no technology transfer to Turkey. And this de- spite the Turkish side\'s
persistence to gain access to the software codes and the IFF system. In
addition, the system cannot be delivered to Turkey before 2020. This is
a high price paid by Turkey for unconditional support from Russia. The
statement by Ca- SECURITY POLICY  restrictions on Turkey if he feels
that Er- dogan is not listening to him. In addition, Putin can impose
sanctions at any time and without warning, which he can promise.
Therefore, the relationship is one of senior and junior partners, even
though Erdogan does not see this reality. But as Atilla Yesi- lada of
Global Source Partners, a consul- tancy firm based in Istanbul, said in
January 2017: \"The Turkish government has com- pletely decoupled itself
from reality. This is not the case with Putin, who is playing a tough,
well-calculated and manipulative game against Erdogan and at the same
time knows how to deal with the volatile Erdogan correctly, compared to
the rather timid attitude of Turkey\'s Western allies.\" There is no
doubt that Turkey did not only push itself into Russian orbit in 2015,
but al- ready in 2008, because Turkey was already dependent on 60
percent of gas supplies from Russia at that time. Today, the figure is
55 percent. Turkey has no choice but to rely on Russia\'s good will, and
Turkey pays in hard currency. The idea that Turkey must diversify its
gas imports away from Russia and become a gas hub has remained an idea.
In 2014, according to Turkey\'s foreign trade statistics, exports to
Russia amount- ed to US\$5.9Bn, while imports from Rus- sia amounted to
US\$25.2Bn. The first six months of 2016 were Turkey\'s worst export
result since 2004, and the most striking as- pect of trade with Russia
is that it has been in favour of Russia from the outset. Russia sells
more to Turkey than Turkey sells to Russia. Turkey\'s dependence on
Russian gas and oil (10 percent of oil comes from Russia) is a major
factor in this imbalance. The current situation is unlikely to change,
as Turkey\'s energy requirements will dou- ble in the next decade.
Another factor in this imbalance is the increasing number of Russian
tourists in Turkey. In addition to Turkey\'s dependence on Rus- sian gas
and Russian tourists, the Russian- Georgian war in August 2008 sent a
clear message to Ankara, namely that Ankara can only increase its
influence in its imme- diate neighbourhood, namely in the Black Sea
region, by coordinating with Moscow and not with its NATO allies. And
that is exactly what has happened since then. Turkey\'s failed coup
d\'état on 15 July 2016 has further consolidated relations between
Russia and Turkey. In a telephone call with Erdogan on 17 July 2016,
Putin stressed the \"categorical inadmissibility of anti-consti-
tutional acts and violence in state life\" and reaffirmed his intention
to meet Erdogan in Russia. Putin\'s reaction was in stark con- trast to
that of the Western allies. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu
said on 25 July 2016: \"Unlike other countries, we A Russian S-400 Air

F-16 fighter aircraft shot down a Rus- sian Su-24 aircraft near the
Syrian-Turkish border. The Turkish Air Force claimed that the Russian
aircraft violated Turkish airspace. The Russian pilot Capt. Konstantin
Murakhtin said on Russian TV there was \"no way\" the jet could have
violated Turkish airspace. Turkey says the pilots were warned 10 times
before the plane was shot down. Capt. Murakhtin was rescued from
rebel-held territory in Syria in a 12-hour operation involving Russian
Special Forces. The incident strained Russian-Turkish relations. March

CC Photo: Vitaly Kuzmin, Wikipedia CC vusoglu that \"Ankara can refuse
to buy the S-400 if Moscow refuses to stop joint production in Turkey on
9 October 2017\" should be taken with a grain of salt. Cavusoglu is not
the one who decided to buy the S-400. Cavusoglu\'s attempt to put the
Russians under pressure is not taken seriously by Moscow and the
Russians laugh behind Cavusoglu\'s back. After all, the Turkish cash
deposit of around US\$100M for the purchase of the S-400 will not be
repaid. Finally, General Petr Pavel, Chairman of the Military Committee,
said on 25 October 2017: \"Although the principle of sovereignty
obviously consists in the procurement of defence equipment, as the
nations are sovereign in decision-making, they are also sovereign in
coping with the consequences of this decision." It remains to be seen
whether Pavel\'s statement can be interpreted as an explicit warning to
Erdogan, but it is obvious that NATO is not satisfied with Erdogan\'s
decision to buy the S-400. [The]{.underline} unequal bilateral
[relations are a major headache for NATO and the EU, as relations
between Turkey and its Western allies have deteriorated since the failed
coup d\'état in Turkey. Let us recall the state of bilateral relations
between Germany and Tur- key, and in particular the USA and Turkey, as
well as the bitter relations between Austria and The Netherlands and
Turkey. It is obvious that relations between Turkey and its Western
allies will not change as long as Erdogan remains president. **Although
Turkey remains an ally of NATO, Turkey has become a difficult ally.**
Erdogan is fully aware of this fact and will not change his behaviour,
making the NATO and EU response difficult.]{.underline} NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg\'s polite statement that Turk- ish officials
told him that \"Ankara remains a strong NATO ally\" is without
substance. [Erdogan is acting in bad faith, knowing that Western allies
cannot punish Turkey in the present circumstances]{.underline}. On the
other hand, Putin behaves like a spectator and enjoys the confusion
without moving a finger. [As long as NATO does not succeed in including
an article on the right of expulsion and penalties for misconduct of a
member of NATO in the North Atlantic Treaty, Erdogan will continue to
be- have boldly. As long as the EU heads of state and government dis-
agree on the fate of Turkey\'s possible membership and therefore do not
take a unanimous decision, Erdogan will treat these heads of state and
government with contempt. It is an opportunity for Putin to bind the
Turkish Gulliver to the land of the Lilliputians, to continue his policy
of changing the military balance in the Black Sea region (with intensive
militarisation of the Crimean peninsula) in his favour and to scorn the
NATO alliance.NATO and the EU are in an unprofitable position because of
consensus and compromise, while Putin and Erdogan continue to behave
with impunity, knowing the internal weaknesses of the EU, which is
unable to make a final decision on Turkey\'s EU membership. As long as
NATO\'s language remains vague and ambiguous, Erdogan will not do
anything to shake NATO\'s boat, but will enjoy the protection of NATO
and Russia\'s embrace.]{.underline} Whether the Turkish formula of NATO
protection and Russian embrace can also apply to other NATO member
states goes beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, it can be
said that other NATO members are carefully evaluating the Turkish
experience. Putin will continue to draw Turkey into its sphere of
influence by offering smaller trade, energy and tourism concessions and
with the unresolved conflict in Syria, as Erdogan is also in an
unprofitable position. The author can only repeat what Bilhan said
above: \"Behind Putin\'s smile Russia remains a great state and can show
its claws whenever it suits it.\" And this is something that Erdogan and
his government should remember well.

#### Turkey's partnership with Russia threatens NATO/EU Cred

**Mehta 19** (Arnav Mehta, deputy editor and senior Pentagon
correspondent for Defense News, covering policy, strategy and
acquisition at the highest levels of the Defense Department and its
international partners, "Turkey officially kicked out of F-35 program,
costing US half a billion dollars," DefenseNews, 7/17/19,
<https://www.defensenews.com/air/2019/07/17/turkey-officially-kicked-out-of-f-35-program/>/eo

WASHINGTON --- [The U.S. has removed Turkey from the F-35 joint strike
fighter program]{.underline}, and Turkey will lose its production work
on the jet by March 2020, [following its acceptance of the S-400
Russian-made air defense system last Friday.]{.underline} However, a top
Pentagon official would not close the door on Turkey rejoining the
program in some form, should it reverse the decision to buy the S-400.
The White House issued a statement Wednesday confirming the move, which
Washington had threatened for months. "[Turkey's decision to purchase
Russian S-400 air defense systems renders its continued involvement with
the F-35 impossible]{.underline}," the White House statement read. "[The
F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that
will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities." "Turkey has been
a longstanding and trusted partner and NATO Ally for over 65 years, but
accepting the S-400 undermines the commitments all NATO Allies made to
each other to move away from Russian systems]{.underline},\" the
statement continued. Shortly after the statement was released, the
Pentagon held a rare on-camera press conference to explain the process
moving forward, with Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Ellen
Lord and Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy David Trachtenberg.
"Turkey cannot field a Russian intelligence collection platform in
proximity to where the F-35 program makes repairs, and houses the F-35,"
Lord said. "[Much of the F-35′s strength lies in its stealth
capabilities, so the ability to detect those capabilities would
jeopardize the long term security of the F-35 program. We seek only to
protect the long term security of the F-35 program."]{.underline}
Turkey, a partner in the F-35 program that helped fund the development
of the jet, planned to buy 100 F-35As. Its first jet was rolled out in
June 2018 in a festive "delivery ceremony.\" Though Turkey formally owns
its jets, the U.S. has said it has the power to keep the planes from
moving to Turkish soil and intends to keep all four existing Turkish
jets from leaving the U.S. Lord avoided saying that [the door was shut
on Turkey returning to the program]{.underline} should the S-400 be
removed from its soil and repeatedly used the term "suspension" to
characterize Turkey's status in the F-35 program. When asked twice
whether Turkey could be welcomed back if the situation changes, Lord did
not give a direct answer one way or the other. "[At this point, the
Turks have made a decision. We have said the F-35 and S-400 are
incompatible. We will work forward at this point to unwind the
relationship]{.underline},\" she said. All Turkish F-35 personnel have
been informed they must leave the U.S. by July 31, including 20
individuals assigned to the Joint Program Office. Neither official would
comment on if any of those individuals have requested asylum. [By March
2020, Turkey's industrial participation in the F-35 program, which
includes production on about 900 parts for the stealthy fighter, will be
"unwound]{.underline}.\" Lord said the projection is this will cost
Turkey's economy around \$9 billion over the life of the program.
American suppliers will initially fill those production roles, but the
goal is to eventually farm some of it out to other partners. Lord said
the process will have "minimal" impacts on the larger F-35 program
because of the planning that has already gone on for several months. To
[move the production from Turkey to the U.S. will require between
\$500-\$600 million in nonrecurring engineering cost]{.underline}s, Lord
said. Which partners, if any, would be willing to buy the F-35s already
in production for Turkey was still being worked out. Trachtenberg
consistently delivered the same message over and over: that this
situation is not one that should impact the broader NATO alliance. That
includes Turkey's participation in NATO exercises, particularly upcoming
events in Georgia, Germany and Ukraine. Asked several times how Turkey
having an air-defense system that cannot be linked to other NATO systems
and could be used to spy on NATO jets would not harm alliance cohesion,
Trachtenberg repeatedly said the relationship between Turkey, the U.S.
and NATO will be able to continue. In a statement, Lockheed Martin, the
prime contractor on the F-35 program, said, "This is a
government-to-government matter, and as always, we are following
official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to delivery of the F-35
to Turkey and the export of goods from the Turkish supply chain." "Over
the last several months we've been working to establish alternative
sources of supply in the United States to quickly accommodate Turkey's
current contributions to the program. These actions will limit any
future production or sustainment impact and we remain on track to meet
our commitment of delivering 131 F-35s this year," the statement added.

After Turkey intervened in Cyprus in July 1974, [Greece left the
military wing of NATO, claiming that NATO did not prevent Turkey\'s
intervention in Cyprus.]{.underline} This event undoubtedly affected
Turkey-Greece relations deeply; moreover, it worried the Western
imperial powers sensitive to the control of the Aegean-Mediterranean.
Western powers intensified their attempts to bring together their two
allies, whose presence and cooperation they needed in the Aegean-
Mediterranean, once again, under the umbrella of NATO. They advised
Greece to return to NATO and Turkey not to take a negative stance.

[Shortly after the intervention, Turkey declared NOTAM 714 in July 1974
and made flights in a 50-mile area over the Aegean subject to its
permission]{.underline}. [Greece, which was in a difficult situation and
lost its command and control authority in the Aegean,]{.underline}
announced in 1976, two years later, that it wanted to return to the
military wing of NATO. Still, Turkey stipulated the redefinition of the
command-control areas in the Aegean for this. NATO European
Commander-in-Chief Alexander Haig and then Gen. Rogers attempted with
Bülent Ecevit and Süleyman Demirel, but they could not get results.

[The disagreement between the parties continued]{.underline}. In the
second half of the 70s, as the Soviet Union\'s influence in the
Mediterranean increased, especially after the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan and the collapse of the pro-US Shah regime in Iran, [Western
powers increased the pressure on Greece to return to the military wing
of NATO.]{.underline}

[Turkey spent the second half of the 1970s struggling against the US
embargo abroad and trying to suppress the right-left conflict at
home.]{.underline}

#### Turkey is becoming an unreliable ally in NATO and seems to be getting closer with Russia

**Randall 17**, Ryan Randall, commander of 104th Aircraft Maintenance
Squadron, attended Air Command and Staff College and Air War College,
"Turkey and NATO -- (Un) Happy Together", 1/1/17,
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1054982.pdf //AB

In 1952 both Turkey and Greece joined NATO, decided largely out of Cold
War strategies against the Soviet Union. While some question why Turkey,
a country nearly 2,000 miles from the north Atlantic, was offered
membership into the Alliance, the reason was two- fold: its strategic
location within Europe and the underlying principle of the Truman
Doctrine -- "extending military and economic aid to states vulnerable to
Soviet threat / expansion."1 Membership in NATO guaranteed that Turkey
would not become a Soviet ally and expanded NATO's reach eastward
toward, what was then, the Soviet Union. With firmly anti-Communist
governments, "Greece and Turkey were viewed by the West as bulwarks
against Moscow and the spread of communism in Europe."2 With the Korean
War on the horizon, "fears of China and Russia expanding their influence
into other parts of the world were realized. (Both Greece and Turkey
contributed troops to fight in Korea)."3 [While Turkey can be viewed as
an important member of the Alliance and a reliable ally for nearly six
decades, Turkey's relationship with NATO and the West has been both
complicated and tumultuous]{.underline}. Turkish President Recep [Tayyip
Erdogan's continual defiance of the democratic principles that form the
bedrock of the United Nations Charter has pinned the Alliance against
one of its own members. Last year's failed coup attempt to overthrow
President Erdogan was a watershed moment that has further strained
Turkey-NATO relations, jeopardizing Turkey's close ties with the
Alliance, while pushing it toward warming relations with
Russia]{.underline}. NATO must not stand by and watch the erosion of
democracy take place from within Turkey. The Alliance must come together
and develop new protocols for dealing with a [member that continually
defies the fundamental principles shared by all Allies: freedom,
democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.]{.underline} The
Organization must reaffirm their clear commitment to the democratic
values that form the cornerstone of the Alliance and oppose any and all
actions that deter from their mission to establish peace and stability
around the world.

#### Turkey continually damages NATO's democracy and it's credibility in political and millitary alliances

**Conley 18** (Heather Conley, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR EUROPE,
EURASIA, AND THE ARCTIC AND DIRECTOR OF THE EUROPE PROGRAM AT CSIS,
"Judy Asks: Is Turkey Damaging NATO?," Carnegie Europe, 1-24-18,
https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/75345) //nehahaha

Any [NATO member that purposefully diminishes its democratic principles
and institutions damages the alliance]{.underline}. Every NATO member is
a signatory to the alliance's founding document, the 1949 Washington
Treaty, and its preamble states that all members are "... determined to
safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their
peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and
the rule of law." Although we associate NATO solely with its military
operations, [NATO is a political-military alliance with democratic
principles at its core.]{.underline} **[Turkey has so greatly diminished
its democracy over the past several years that an independent U.S.
organization, Freedom House, has recently declared the country "not
free."]{.underline}** Unfortunately, Turkey is not a NATO outlier in
this regard [but is part of a growing trend]{.underline}. Poland,
Hungary, and Romania [are also actively diminishing judicial
independence, institutional transparency, and the ability to express
political opposition; the very essence of democracy.]{.underline}
**[These countries also damage the credibility of this crucial political
alliance.]{.underline}** But as a critical NATO member, Turkey's
military interventions in the Middle East---whether it is the shooting
down of a Russian military aircraft or repeated unilateral military
interventions in Iraq and Syria---[increasingly place Turkey's national
security at risk, which places NATO at risk of becoming involved in the
broader regional conflict.]{.underline} Thus, **[Turkey inflicts ongoing
damage to NATO politically and militarily.]{.underline}**

#### **Turkey has historically acted upon its own interests, rather than those of NATO**

**Brown 22** (Ethan Brown, 11-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force as a
Special Operations Joint Terminal Attack controller, currently the
senior fellow for Defense Studies at the Center for the Study of the

Turkey," The Hill, 7/1/22,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3543770-nato-must-push-for-full-accountability-from-turkey//eo)

[All eyes this week were on the Madrid summit, where NATO leaders were
expected to announce new military postures, security cooperation, and
future planning for collective defense in light of the ongoing Ukraine
crisis.]{.underline} The biggest thing to come out of the summit was
Turkey's ultimate reversal of its block on Finland and Sweden from
becoming new members --- new member admittance requires a unanimous vote
to pass. [This issue loomed largely and reiterated Ankara's
confrontational and often complicating role in the alliance to date. As
a great many changes in Europe's security organization are expected to
evolve in the near future, now is an ideal time to address issues with
Turkey's actions as a NATO member, for the sake of future accountability
and legitimacy within the alliance.]{.underline} With Russia
backpedaling from global pressure, to say nothing of its flagging
efforts in Eastern Ukraine, [Turkey's most significant geopolitical
clout outside of NATO is at its weakest point in years. Historically,
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has played both sides of the
alliance.]{.underline} The Turkish president has courted Moscow's favor
(purchasing S-400 air defense systems) while enjoying benefits of mutual
security and military aid, such as F-16s and other aviation equipment
expected later this year in a "make or break" moment in the U.S.-Turkey
relationship. [Turkey has never hesitated to exploit unrest in Europe to
further Erdogan's personal agenda. In 2019 it crossed the Syrian border
to butcher formerly American-allied Kurds]{.underline}, while also
throwing its considerable military weight behind Azerbaijan in the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to bolster its regional influence[. More
recently, Ankara has simultaneously closed off the Bosporus to Russian
warships and offered to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv --- mere months
after meeting with President Vladimir Putin hat in hand to bargain for
economic and military concessions and aid.]{.underline} President
Erdogan's bid to block Finland and Sweden from joining NATO was due to
their alleged support of Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) members, whom
Turkey has labeled a terrorist organization, a point of contention ---
though not accountability --- between Ankara and the West. Turkey has
been able to conduct itself thusly because of the unique importance of
its geography. Its close proximity to the Levant served as a waystation
(Incirlik Air Base) for nearly two decades of the global war on terror,
where tens of thousands of U.S. and coalition service members passed
through on their way to Iraq and Afghanistan --- meaning Ankara's
actions were often ignored when addressing global policy, so long as the
bases and airspace allowed for the use in the ongoing war efforts
elsewhere. Assertions that "there is a strongman holding NATO hostage,
and it's not Putin" are both accurate and compelling and require NATO to
rethink what it demands of its member states. Like much else regarding
European security, the war in Ukraine upset existing norms of state
conduct and geopolitics, or at least simplified them[. NATO member
states have all increased defense spending, vowed to take more
pronounced roles in ensuring the continents' stability and have
universally condemned the conduct of authoritarians like Vladimir
Putin]{.underline} --- all signs that the alleged 'brain death' of NATO
is now in recovery. [Yet for Turkey's part, hamstringing the needs of
the alliance over its own regional power brokerages, even if it has
reversed course on the matter of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, has
been a regular and consistent means of undermining the
alliance]{.underline}. NATO has excelled at unifying against
unacceptable behaviors since Feb. 24, when Russian troops first crossed
into Ukraine. It has thus far achieved tremendous success in finding
means to counter Moscow while not directly engaging in the conflict in
Eastern Europe, demonstrating resolve and fortitude in preparing for
further aggression. [But much of legitimizing the alliance in the future
hangs on member states acting in common purpose on all accounts --- and
Ankara's actions to date demand a higher level of accountability. The
reversal by President Erdogan to confer Finland and Sweden is a positive
sign, one that should be seized upon by NATO leaders to demand greater
accountability for one of its oldest and foremost member
states]{.underline}. The alliance's own purpose statement, chiefly
asserting collective trans-Atlantic security, also provides that the
institution "engages where possible and when necessary to project its
values further afield, prevent and manage crises, stabilize
post-conflict situations and support reconstruction." [Any claim that
Turkey has prevented or managed crises, stabilized conflict situations,
or upheld the collective values of the Alliance is sorely misplaced.
NATO must demand the highest conduct of its member states, both as a
means to discredit authoritarian tyrants and to ensure its future
cooperative security efficacy. This includes incentivizing Turkey's
responsibility in NATO membership and retracting from Russian
cooperation. Permitting new NATO members should only be the beginning of
Turkey's return to credible alliance membership.]{.underline}

[Today]{.underline}, by any number of measures, [the EU and the U.S. are
drifting apart]{.underline}. [Support for the transatlantic alliance
is]{.underline} at a post-World War II [low]{.underline}. [There are
many manifestations of what has been termed "continental
drift"]{.underline}: inwards turns [by both the U.S. and the EU after
the economic crisis]{.underline}, an America increasingly focused on the
Pacific, tensions over the Snowden revelations, the absence of U.S.
leadership on Syria and Ukraine, and lastly, divergent views within
Europe of the critical importance of the U.S. [The potential future
effectiveness of the alliance has been put into question by weakening
European defense capabilities and a U.S. President determined to shrink
America's footprint abroad.]{.underline} In short, [the Atlantic
Alliance is in crisis]{.underline}. Presidents Clinton and Bush
undertook historic efforts to bring critical parts of post-Communist
Eastern Europe into the Alliance. By contrast, President Obama's lack of
engagement in European affairs seems to signal to Europe that it is no
longer a major American strategic concern after the end of the Cold War.
This crisis notwithstanding, [the U.S. needs closer engagement with
Europe on crucial defense and foreign policy matters. The U.S. under
President Obama may be turning inward; but the fact remains: Europe is
vital and irreplaceable to us]{.underline}. History and culture bind the
U.S. and Europe together; Europe discovered us, shaped our thinking, and
forms of government. But there is more than just cultural affinity that
unites us. There is a deep moral scope to the alliance. It was, after
all, in the West that concepts such as limited government, individual
rights, freedom of worship, free markets, and equal rights for women
arose. [The moral basis of our alliance embodied in these concepts was
critical to our heroic joint efforts leading the fierce external
opposition to totalitarianism]{.underline} that helped bring down the
Iron Curtain. [The common defense threats we face in the 21st
century---almost all on the periphery of the U.S. or the EU---are
different in scope and kind: conventional challenges such as Russia bent
on dominating its near abroad or China's increasing assertiveness in
territorial matters and growing military prowess;]{.underline} others
are unconventional, including the spread of radical Islam and terrorism
in the Middle East and beyond, and t[he proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction to countries such as Iran and North Korea. In an age of
extremist ideologies, non-state actors with increasingly widespread
technological capacities could pose the greatest threats of all to
international order]{.underline}. Other challenges that arise from the
"arc of instability" to the south of Europe---including migration and
unruly political transitions in the Arab world---require a mix of hard
and soft power. [The diplomatic flexibility]{.underline} [that
approaches by a]{.underline} [multiplicity of states in
Europe]{.underline} can afford--- [combined with the potential threat of
hard power when necessary---offers the most diverse set of tools to
handle such crises]{.underline}. Our moral message and policy
prescriptions are much stronger when unified; we are able to achieve far
more together than alone. But [to achieve unity]{.underline}, as the
last decade has shown, [we really have to work at it]{.underline}. [This
means more than occasional consultations]{.underline}, [after the
fact]{.underline}, as has often been the case during the Obama
administration. [Strong U.S.-European relations require regular
consultations,]{.underline} give and take, even blunt conversations---
not just lectures from Washington or from Brussels or European
capitals---to give Europeans a stake of ownership in policies. [This
ownership will allow them and us to make the case for shared sacrifice
to their and our polities]{.underline}---a case that needs to be made in
politics since the choices officials face in security policy are often
less than optimal. The failure of American leadership since 2009 to make
such arguments at home has weakened our ability to expect our allies to
make the same kinds of cases to their publics, thereby harming the
alliance. [Americans cannot "go it alone." Europe offers America an
invaluable tool: a key multilateral dimension to policy]{.underline}.
[With it, comes greater credibility in the international arena and a
greater capacity to undertake complex missions]{.underline}. America has
to lead, but Europe has to be our partner, willing to be vocal when we
are unwilling to meet out responsibilities. Without it comes the
excessive swings of American foreign and defense policy that have led
us, in recent years, to shirk our global responsibilities. Europeans
contributed in crucial ways to the US-led interventions in Iraq and
Afghanistan and were absolutely central to the intervention in Libya.
France's willingness to intervene in Mali and the Central African
Republic with assistance from the U.S. and the E.U. at a time when the
U.S. is less willing on new anti-terror interventions is a very positive
sign. But French interventionism, as welcome as it is, cannot make up
for shrinking defense budgets and reluctant leadership from both Germany
and the U.K. The U.S. needs to encourage its allies to assume their
responsibilities. Although Europe's armed forces are less strong and
less well equipped than desirable, European armed forces are, in fact,
well-trained, technologically sophisticated and also geographically
closer to the regions that are likely to be critical in the 21st
century---North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa. [The manpower and cost efficiencies from potential joint
operations cannot be overstated. Europeans can bring unmatched
sensibilities in their own backyard,]{.underline} but need to assume
their responsibilities. Their knowledge of history and culture is
essential. [This knowledge and willingness to use "soft power" has to be
joined to a sense of the importance of burden sharing, especially as
American forces are overstretched in a time of declining American
defense budgets]{.underline}. Increasing isolationism in both American
political parties should serve as a wakeup call to Europe that we might
not always be there to help police Europe's periphery as in Kosovo or
Libya. The greater distance we are assuming from Europe should make us
all the more sympathetic to European defense initiatives. Given the
deeper challenges we face, it is time to leave aside "theological"
debates over whether NATO or the EU should be the prime focus for the
future of European defense. Instead, we need to focus on how best to
meet common strategic challenges with the array of resources, diplomatic
and military, that we can muster. [When Europeans and Americans work
together for shared purpose, the partnership enhances us both and makes
our complex and simultaneous missions much easier to
accomplish.]{.underline}

### EU Cred -- Brink -- ! -- 2NC

#### EU cred is at stake.

**Lahodynsky 20** (Otmar Lahodynsky, former president of the Association
of European journalists. The EU's credibility is at stake, New Europe,
11/20/20,

JL

In July, after a four-day marathon summit in Brussels, there was
agreement on the EU budget for 2021-2027 and a recovery fund for the
EU's 27 members following the COVID-19 crisis. Together, almost €2
trillion have been reserved for this purpose. The €750 billion corona
aid package is intended to help those countries that have been the most
affected by the disease, including as Italy, Spain and France, but also
the other Member States as they will need to rebuild their economies. At
the EU summit, a typical Brussels-style compromise was reached -- each
head of government presented themself as a winner at home if they will
receive a lot of money for economic recovery. It was then that the
so-called "frugal four" -- Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden
(plus Finland) -- forced a reduction in the number of grants in exchange
for an increase in the share of loans and a cut in their membership
fees. The heads of Poland and Hungary also celebrated at home after the
successfully de-linked their access to EU funding from their records on
the rule of law. Subsequently, however, the other EU states introduced
this clause by a clear majority. The Poles and Hungarians felt pressured
and they vetoed the seven-year EU budget, which requires unanimity
despite the fact that they were not bothered that they had previously
approved it. In his explanatory statement, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz
Morawiecki railed against an "attack on Polish sovereignty" and adding
that the EU was no longer the same as when Poland had joined the bloc in
2004, a generation after the end of Communism. Morawiecki said the
Polish economy was so strong that it no longer needed any subsidies from
Brussels (more than €12 billion each year). Morawiecki said that Poles
were even considering an EU withdrawal along the lines of Brexit.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Brussels' bête noire, went even
further. In his view, the EU is acting like the Soviet Union once did.
It wants to blackmail Hungary and force it to accept Middle Eastern
refugees. In the future, Orban added, the European Commission would have
the power to meddle in the internal politics of all of the Member
States, as it sees fit. Orban also emphasized that the EU's previous
accusations against Hungary were all unfounded and that the concept of
the rule of law was not precisely or universally defined. The reality is
that these core concepts of the bloc were long-ago enshrined in the EU
treaties and in Europe's charter of fundamental rights. Conditions for
EU accession were already laid down in the 1993 Copenhagen criteria and
include the stability of institutions, democracy, the rule of law,
respect for human rights and respect and protection of minorities. The
Commission has, for too long, turned a blind eye to the transgressions
of the nationalistic populists in Poland, Hungary and other Eastern
European countries. The isolated attempts to bring about punitive
proceedings under Article 7 of the EU Treaty did not act as a deterrent,
because sanctions were not imposed. For this reason, the governments of
Hungary and Poland mutually helped each other. But now the basic
principles of the EU, above all the rule of law, are being put to the
test. When Brussels collectively raises billions of euros for emergency
aid against the pandemic for the first time through common debts, it
must be ensured that this money is spent correctly. The EU also owes
this to its taxpayers. In Hungary, Orban's confidants and his family
have collected a lot more than €5 billion in subsidies from Brussels
every year, mainly through agricultural subsidies. The European Council
in a new report this week criticized Hungary for not fighting against
corruption. In an ironic echo of Hungary's totalitarian Communist past,
nearly all of Hungary's independent or critical media have been brought
into line or closed down and the scientific community and cultural
institutions are also under Orban's control. In Poland, the independence
of the judiciary was dangerously undermined on several occasions. Some
cities have established their own "LGTB-free zones" and, with the
support of Poland's notoriously arch-conservative branch of the Catholic
Church, a ban on abortion was imposed recently with only a few
exceptions. The EU must protect the rule of law and fundamental European
values more strongly than before for another reason. If these are
violated without consequences, how can Europe require new candidate
countries to respect these values? A way out of the stalemate seems
difficult. The European Parliament has made it clear that it will not
accept any amendments to the draft. "These nationalistic, populist
positions and unanimity are the grave-diggers of the EU," said Othmar
Karas, the Vice-President of the European Parliament who asked for the
exclusion of Orban's Fidesz-party from the European People's Party.
Fortunately, the budget for 2021 has already been adopted. It contains
innovations, including more money for future areas such as
digitalization and climate protection. If Poland and Hungary retain
their veto, this budget could be prolonged annually. The €750 billion
COVID aid package could possibly be decoupled from the EU budget. In
that case, such support through joint borrowing could only be decided
for 24 countries -- without Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. It is a more
laborious path, but possibly the only one, as the EU's credibility as a
global player is at stake.

Also, the reluctance of some Western European Alliance members to
recognize the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) as a terrorist organization
and to push for the PKK to end its activities in Turkish territory has
worried Ankara. As long as a majority of Turks believes that the PKK
owes its existence in part to support coming from European countries,
[[Turkey's commitment to NATO is bound to decrease]{.mark} in the years
to come]{.underline}.5 In contrast, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, the leading member of the Alliance, [has]{.mark}
gradually [adopted a non-European strategic outlook]{.mark} by
considering developments [outside the continent]{.mark} as more vital to
its national security interests.]{.underline} Yet, [[Washington has
begun to value Turkey's security cooperation in more bilateral rather
than multilateral platforms]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, even
though Washington's need to secure Turkey's strategic cooperation has
dramatically increased, [[the Americans have generally tried to achieve
this bilaterally, outside of NATO platforms]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Another important factor contributing to the rise of Turkish skepticism
toward NATO has been the changing nature of global politics. As the
world has become more multipolar, or even nonpolar, and [as interstate
relations have increasingly taken shape in more multilateral and
interdependent settings, [NATO-like collective defense organizations
have become outdated]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, changing [[power
configurations]{.mark} within the international system seem to [have
increased Turkey's capability to pursue a multi-dimensional]{.mark} and
multi-directional [foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally,
[[Turkey's relations with Russia]{.mark} on one hand, [and Middle
Eastern]{.mark} countries on the other, will likely [also shape Turkey's
future view of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 Turkey is not an exception to
the idea that, as the world has increasingly become post-Western, many
states have revised their foreignand security-policy strategies to adapt
to the new security environment.

NATO currently suffers from a legitimacy crisis in the eyes of the
Turks, and in recent years [Turkey has ceased to define its membership
in NATO through nonnegotiable identity-related lenses]{.underline}.
**[As [Alliance members have been at odds with each
other]{.mark}]{.underline}** about how to define NATO's purpose moving
forward, and as NATO has become a more global and less European
organization, [Turkish [decision-makers are finding it difficult to
believe]{.mark} that membership in [NATO supports Turkey's Western
European identity]{.mark} anymore]{.underline}. In a radical turnabout,
Turkey has embarked on a process to build its relations with NATO on the
basis of more pragmatic, and less enduring, common interests and
concerns. How long those binding common interests endure, however,
remains to be seen. [**[The need for European allies to rely on Turkey's
security cooperation has decreased since the Cold War]{.mark}**, while
Turkey's security has simultaneously become increasingly exposed to
challenges from the Middle East.]{.underline} Ankara had perceived its
security in the context of conventional threats and valued NATO mainly
for its Article V commitments (Article V states that an armed attack
against one or more NATO members is considered an attack on them all),
[but European members of the Alliance have tried their best not to get
involved in non-European contingencies]{.underline}. The majority of the
European allies have continued to focus their attention on
intra-European affairs, and prioritized the European Union as the most
appropriate organizational platform for dealing with them. [[Europeans
have increasingly considered Turkey as part of the Middle Eastern
security]{.mark} architecture]{.underline}.4 Two occasions in the recent
past have led Turkish decision-makers to doubt whether European members
of the Alliance would continue to see Turkey's territorial defense as
part of their responsibilities. Both took place because of Turkey's
proximity to Iraq. In both 1991 and 2003, [Turkey asked NATO to deploy
early warning systems and Patriot missiles to its territory to guard
against the possibility of any Iraqi attack. Both times, some [European
members of the Alliance hesitated to respond positively to Turkey's
appeals]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although it is true that those European
allies were generally against the possibility of NATO-ization of the
2003 U.S.-led war in Iraq, their resistance to calls to strengthen
Turkey's defense capabilities vis-a\`-vis Iraq's ballistic missiles
suggest that they did not recognize Turkey's security perceptions.

"Turkey is Becoming a Problem for NATO---the U.S. Should Pay Attention,"
Newsweek, 10/8/21,

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan recently met in Sochi to discuss military operations in
northwestern Syria. While on opposing sides in Syria, before the talks,
[Erdogan nevertheless described Turkish military cooperation with Russia
as \"of utmost importance,\" alluding to what the U.S. already knows:
Turkey does not feel constrained by its NATO responsibilities. It will
not hesitate to pursue the path most closely aligned with its own
interests, no matter where it lies: in the West or Russia]{.underline}.
The U.S. can learn something from this shrewd and unashamed realpolitik.
In 2019, after years of toeing the line [between cozy relations with
Russia and the West, Turkey appeared to put the death knell in its NATO
credibility, purchasing Russian-made S-400 defense systems, booting
Turkey from the F-35 joint strike fighter program.]{.underline} The
White House released a statement on the decision claiming that Turkey\'s
purchase rendered \"continued involvement with the F-35 impossible\" as
\"the F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection
platform.\" However, officials such as Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) were
far more candid about the purchase\'s implications. [\"This is not some
minor dustup with this country,\" he said. \"They\'ve thumbed their nose
at us, and they\'ve thumbed their nose at their other NATO allies.\" The
U.S. has sanctioned Turkey and urged Erdogan to reverse the decision.
Erdogan doubled down before the Sochi meetings: \"It is not possible for
us to turn back from the steps we took. \... It is of great importance
for us to continue by strengthening Turkey-Russia relations every day.\"
Turkey has chosen its trajectory. The U.S. should adjust its behavior
accordingly and stop treating its NATO alliances as sacrosanct when
Turkey clearly does not view the relationship similarl]{.underline}y.
Turkey, despite having the second-largest standing military force in
NATO[, is inching toward a point where it becomes a possible liability,
instead of an asset.]{.underline} While not discounting the points of
tension in Syria and Libya, the most glaring flashpoint for possible
conflict is Turkey\'s enduring commitment to the defense of Azerbaijan
against Armenia, through training Azerbaijani officers and supplying
military equipment. Should a conflict erupt once more, it would be
between Turkish-backed Azerbaijan and Russian-backed Armenia, presenting
the potential for Turkey to, once again, be at odds with the Russian
military and call for NATO aid or assistance[. Even among NATO allies
themselves, Turkey has fanned the flames of conflict, with Erdogan
becoming more and more aggressive in the Mediterranean. In 2020, Turkey
disregarded a U.N.-enforced arms embargo around Libya and responded with
hostility when confronted by French patrols.]{.underline} Greco-Turkish
tensions in the Aegean almost erupted into war in the same year after
Greek and Turkish frigates nearly collided over drilling disputes,
forcing the U.S. to step in and push for de-escalation and negotiations.
[Nevertheless, among these hostilities, Turkey has been left relatively
unscathed by its NATO allies. As Turkey continues to stoke the fires of
ongoing tensions, the U.S. must make clear that it will not fight
Erdogan\'s wars under the obligation of NATO defense if these disputes
erupt beyond Erdogan\'s control. Continued concessions and aid to U.S.
partners, for simply being allies, are why American allies like Turkey
have abused and taken advantage of these leniencies and strayed away
from American interests.]{.underline} Alliances are not meant to be
treated as sacred bonds of a covenant. They are formed to recognize
parallel interests and commit to jointly serving those interests[. NATO
was formed to support European nations who wanted to counter the
influence and might of Moscow and provide a unified defense against the
now dissolved Soviet Union. If these same NATO allies are now flirting
with Putin unapologetically, the U.S. should adjust the extent of its
obligation to those whose interests lie opposite of American interests.
The U.S. should rethink its responsibility of perpetual European defense
and stop serving allies like Turkey their cake on a platter so that they
can both have it and eat it too.]{.underline}

#### NATO needs to create policies that exclude Turkey to ensure that Turkey does not continue gathering support from the West

**Ghosh 22** (Bobby Ghosh, Bloomberg columnist covering foreign affairs
and previous international editor at Time, "US Should Brace for More
Pushback From Erdogan," The Washington Post, 6/20/22,

President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan has kicked off Turkey's campaign season
by confirming that]{.underline} elections will be held next June --- and
that [he will seek to extend his rule into a third decade. "Now, I am
saying that I am the candidate of the People's Alliance]{.underline},"
he told supporters in the Aegean port city of Izmir last week. He was
referring to the ruling coalition of his AK Party and the nationalist
MHP[. Turkey's allies and rivals, along with Turks themselves, might
want to buckle up for 12 months of turbulence. The US and Europe should
brace themselves for even more mudslinging and contrariness from Erdogan
at a time when they need his cooperation in containing Russian
adventurism.]{.underline} Ornery in the best of times, [Erdogan has
grown even more quarrelsome with the West as he has become politically
vulnerable at home]{.underline}. His fortunes are now at their lowest
ebb since he first took the reins in Ankara in 2003. He and his party
have slipped in opinion polls over the past couple of years, as Turkey's
economy has been hammered by a combination of the pandemic and the
president's economic policies. Although the lira has tanked and
inflation has soared, Erdogan has stubbornly resisted calls to raise
interest rates. ["Turkey is again stuck in a vicious cycle. High
inflation causes the lira to weaken, which results in even higher
inflation"]{.underline} said Ziad Daoud, chief emerging markets
economist at Bloomberg Economics. ["Lifting interest rates would break
this cycle, but that's unlikely to happen." With little prospect of an
economic turnaround in time for the vote, the president must find other
ways to make his case for re-election.]{.underline} All the early signs
are that he will dip into the old populist's playbook, appealing to
ethno-nationalism at home and raising alarms about foreign enemies ---
real and imagined. Some of his favorite bogeymen are now out of bounds:
Turkey's economic troubles have forced Erdogan to make nice with the
Gulf Arab states he used to pillory, to popular acclaim. He can't very
well portray the ruling families of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates as perfidious reactionaries while pleading with them for
investment and trade deals. Erdogan has also softened his rhetoric
against Israel, thanks in no small part to a friendship he has struck
with President Isaac Herzog. [This leaves him with one familiar fall
guy: the West. He has already begun to ratchet up his rhetoric against
the US and Europe. In a carefully choreographed meeting with young Turks
last week, he denounced the West as mendacious and
untrustworthy.]{.underline} He has lashed out at another old bugbear,
demanding that Greece demilitarize islands in the Aegean Sea, adding
that he was "not joking." [In the months ahead, expect Erdogan to build
on the general themes of Western duplicitousness and to double down on
his conspiracy theory that Turkey's woes are the result of a deliberate
campaign by "global barons of politics and money."]{.underline} Turks
groaning under the twin burdens of inflation and currency depreciation
will be encouraged to blame the US and the Europe rather than their
president[. In addition to using progressively more astringent rhetoric,
the president will be less cooperative in his dealings with the West.
We're already seeing this in his refusal to budge on NATO expansion: By
framing his objection to Sweden and Finland as a matter of national
security (he accuses them of harboring Kurdish terrorists) Erdogan is
exaggerating the threat as well as portraying his recalcitrance as
patriotic resistance in the face of foreign bullying]{.underline}. There
is no point in expecting reasonableness from any politician who has
their back to the wall, and certainly not from one who has decided
intransigence is in his best interest. [As frustrating as it will be for
President Biden and European leaders, they should recognize where
Erdogan is coming from, and act accordingly. Threats won't work since
they will only play into his narrative of heroic defiance. Their best
bet might be to signal to him that if Turkey won't join the consensus,
they will devise workarounds.]{.underline} This may require the NATO
powers to build a separate security architecture for Sweden and Finland
outside the alliance --- at least until next summer, when they will
either be dealing with a new Turkish president or with a victorious
Erdogan who no longer needs them as bogeymen.

### AT: Turkey K2 NATO Co-op -- Solvency -- 2NC

#### Turkey is the biggest roadblock to NATO cooperation and advancement

**Crowler & Erlanger** (Crowley, diplomatic correspondent in the
Washington bureau, writer for the NYTimes; Erlanger, chief diplomatic
correspondent in Europe for the NYTimes, "For NATO, Turkey Is a
Disruptive Ally", New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/us/politics/turkey-nato-russia.html)

Within an alliance that operates by consensus, [the Turkish strongman
has come to be seen as something of a stickup artist.]{.underline} In
2009, he **[blocked the appointment of a new NATO chief]{.underline}**
from Denmark, complaining that the country was too tolerant of cartoons
of the Prophet Muhammad and too sympathetic to "Kurdish terrorists"
based in Turkey. [It took hours of cajoling by Western
leader]{.underline}s, and a face-to-face promise from President Barack
Obama that NATO would appoint a Turk to a leadership position, to
satisfy Mr. Erdogan.

After a rupture in relations between Turkey and Israel the next year,
Mr. Erdogan prevented the alliance from working with the Jewish state
for six years. A few years later, Mr. **[Erdogan delayed for months a
NATO plan to fortify Eastern European countries against
Russia]{.underline}**, again citing Kurdish militants and demanding that
the alliance declare ones operating in Syria to be terrorists. In 2020,
Mr. [Erdogan sent a gas-exploration ship]{.underline} backed by fighter
jets [close to Greek waters, causing France to send ships in support of
Greece, also a NATO member]{.underline}. Now the Turkish leader is back
in the role of obstructionist, and is once again invoking the Kurds, as
he charges that Sweden and Finland sympathize with the Kurdish militants
he has made his main enemy. "**[These countries have almost become
guesthouses for terrorist organizations]{.underline}**," he said this
month. "It is not possible for us to be in favor."

Mr. Erdogan's stance is a reminder of a long-festering problem for NATO,
which currently has 30 members. Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have
given the alliance a new sense of mission, but **[NATO must still
contend with an authoritarian leader willing to use his leverage to gain
political points at home by blocking consensus]{.underline}** --- at
least for a time. It is a situation that plays to the advantage of
President Vladimir V. **[Putin of Russia, who has grown friendlier with
Mr. Erdogan in recent years]{.underline}**. For the Russian leader, [the
rejection of Swedish and Finnish admission into NATO would be a
significant victory.]{.underline} The quandary would be simpler were it
not for Turkey's importance to the alliance. The country joined NATO in
1952 after aligning with the West against the Soviet Union; Turkey gives
the alliance a crucial strategic position at the intersection of Europe
and Asia, astride both the Middle East and the Black Sea. It hosts a
major U.S. air base where American nuclear weapons are stored, and Mr.
Erdogan has blocked Russian warships headed toward Ukraine. But under
Mr. Erdogan, **[Turkey has increasingly become a problem to be
managed]{.underline}**. As prime minister and then as president, [he has
tilted his country away from Europe while practicing an authoritarian
and populist brand of Islamist politics]{.underline}, especially since a
failed coup attempt in 2016. **[He has purchased an advanced missile
system from Russia that NATO officials call a threat]{.underline}** to
their integrated defense systems, and in 2019 [he mounted a military
incursion to battle Kurds in northern Syria who were aiding the fight
against the Islamic State with U.S. support.]{.underline} "In my four
years there, **[it was quite often 27 against one,"]{.underline}** said
Ivo H. Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama
administration, when the alliance had 28 members. Mr. Erdogan's
objections to the membership of Sweden and Finland have [even renewed
questions about whether NATO might be better off without
Turkey.]{.underline}

#### Turkey is far from aligned with NATO and its allies

[Following the accession of Turkey to Nato in 1952, the newly elected
Turkish leader at the time, Adnan Menderes, expressed his desire for his
government to be the western military alliance's "backbone". Nearly 70
years later, Turkey has changed fundamentally]{.underline}. [Out of the
30 members of Nato, Turkey is one of the oldest, but now the most
isolated. T]{.underline}he long-awaited meeting between Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Joe Biden at the latest
Nato summit this week was, in a nutshell, an anti-climax[. Turkey once
had unconditional loyalty to Nato, and used its strategic location to
prove its importance to the organisation.]{.underline} In 1955, it
joined the Baghdad Pact, a Nato-backed regional alliance with Britain,
Iraq, Iran and Pakistan, aimed at preventing a Soviet Union infiltration
of the Middle East. The [next year, Turkey stood by Britain against
Egypt during the Suez crisis. Simon]{.underline} Smith, in his book
Reassessing Suez 1956, wrote that [Menderes\'s government did not regard
the Suez Canal dispute as a bilateral problem between the UK and Egypt,
but one that concerned Nato\'s entire strategy.]{.underline} Menderes
argued: \"Turkey is convinced that the UK is acting as a guardian of one
of the key positions of the free world.\" [Under the leadership of Mr
Erdogan, however, Turkey has turned 180 degrees away from its unified
accord with its Nato allies. Turkey, like other non-western members of
the bygone Baghdad Pact, Iran and Pakistan, has adopted its own version
of Islamist nationalism, while demonstrating degrees of suspicion and
hostility towards the western world.]{.underline} It is no secret that
this year's Nato summit in Brussels was held against a backdrop of a
long list of flashpoints between Turkey and other Nato members, and
ambiguous relations with the alliance's chief competitors, Russia and
China. [In 2017, Turkey brokered a deal worth billions with Russian
President Putin for the S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile system. It
forced the administration of then US president Donald Trump, one of the
friendliest US administrations towards Erdogan's Turkey, to impose
sanctions on Ankara last year.]{.underline} The thorny dispute continued
as Mr Trump's presidency wound down, and has since forced Mr Biden's
administration to exclude Turkey from the new F35 consortium agreement.
Turkey has turned 180 degrees away from its unified accord with its Nato
[allies In addition to the S-400 and F35 disputes, the US and Turkey
disagree on a long list of issues, including US support for Kurdish
militias in Syria and the Biden administration's formal acknowledgment
of the Armenian genocide. On the human rights front, the White House
issued a strongly worded statement following Turkey's withdrawal from
the Istanbul Convention on preventing domestic violence against
women.]{.underline} Moreover, [Turkey has had tense relations with
Greece, France and Cyprus]{.underline}. Last year, Turkey came close to
a naval confrontation with Greece in disputed Eastern Mediterranean
waters over Turkey's gas exploration activities near the Greek island of
Kastellorizo. Relations with France are not any better. Last year, the
French frigate, the Courbet, tried to stop Turkish arms smuggling to
Libya, forcing Nato to investigate the incident. Furthermore, the [two
countries have been engaged in wars of words -- Mr Erdogan called for a
boycott of French products after French President Emmanuel Macron firmly
upheld the right of cartoonists to depict religious figures. As for
Cyprus, Turkey insists on the continued division of the country,
contradicting the stances taken by Europe and the US on the
issue.]{.underline} As if all the above is not bad enough for its
relations with its supposed allies, Turkey raised eyebrows when it
pushed Nato members into watering down its official reaction to
Belarus's recent forced landing of a passenger plane in order to detain
a dissident journalist. In face of all of those challenging
disagreements, Turkey approached this year's Nato summit with a
multifaceted strategy to engage in a charm offensive, defiance, and
spin. Ahead of the Brussels meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut
Cavusoglu made conciliatory statements to Paris, Athens and Washington.
Mr Cavusoglu subsequently visited both Greece and France, and insisted
that Turkey and France should maintain stable ties as \"allies\". In
Athens, a cheerful Mr Cavusoglu and his Greek counterpart, Nikos
Dendias, agreed to "continue co-operation on a positive agenda to
resolve pending bilateral issues". Furthermore, to prove its importance
to Nato, Turkey has offered to run the main airport in Kabul,
Afghanistan, despite the Taliban militant group condemning the proposal.
[Turkey has long-standing naval ties with European powers, but relations
have become strained. Reuters]{.underline} At the summit, there were, as
expected, no breakthroughs, with none of the big issues poisoning ties
between the Nato allies getting resolved. The meeting was not even
followed by a published read-out, but Mr Erdogan described it as
\"fruitful and sincere\". That description that may convince his fans at
home, but the Turkish lira was not impressed -- it fell against the
dollar after the talks. [Mr Erdogan's uncompromising stance on the S-400
front will undoubtedly serve as a major obstacle to any joint military
co-operation between the US and Turkey in the future.]{.underline} There
is a saying that one who rides two horses at once will split asunder.
That sums up the current affairs of Mr Erdogan's Turkey, which rides the
horse of Ottoman Islamist revisionism, but still clings to the Nato club
and its prestigious advantages. That dualism has dispossessed Turkey of
the trust of many fellow Nato members as well as anti-extremist regimes
in the Arab world. It is rather ironic that the Mr Erdogan, who claims
to consider former Prime Minister Adnan Menderes a hero, has deviated so
much from Menderes's policies. [Menderes went out of his way, even
supporting a colonial Britain, to cement Turkey firmly within Nato. Mr
Erdogan appears to have gone out of his way to set Turkey adrift in the
opposite direction.]{.underline} Mr Erdogan's supporters in Turkey,
however, should consider themselves lucky. Analysts and observers who
hoped for a firm handling of Turkey's troubled policies have been
disappointed by the outcome of this year's Nato summit. [Calls for
cutting the Gordian knot with Turkey are widely vocalised]{.underline},
but Mr Biden, who is trying his best to disengage from the Middle East
and focus on his country's pressing domestic issues, appears to think
that doing so would be a drastic move -- particularly amid a challenging
pandemic and strong appetite in his administration to maintain
transatlantic unity. In Brussels, Mr Biden and Mr Erdogan have
maintained the veneer of unity, but the door for healing the rifts
between Turkey and Nato also seems to be firmly closed. [Sooner or
later, all of the thorny issues will resurface again.]{.underline}
Nonetheless, solving the Turkish conundrum may be postponed until
another Nato summit.

**Turkey may be kicked out of NATO or not get assistance from NATO**

Ankara\'s objection could prove a real challenge towards a possible
Finland and Sweden entry into the alliance,
as [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato) [requires unanimous
approval](https://www.newsweek.com/turkey-will-block-sweden-finland-joining-nato-1708108) from
all its members to accept new members. So how\'s NATO going to respond
to a member state that once again is proving an inconvenient, uneasy
ally?

[Turkey has blocked the start of talks over Finland and Sweden\'s NATO
membership]{.underline}. Above, Turkey\'s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan

National Assembly (TGNA) in Ankara, on May 18, 2022. GETTY

[It\'s not the first time there\'s talks of kicking Turkey out of the
alliance.]{.underline}

[The idea was first suggested in 2016 when Turkish president [Recep
Tayyip
Erdoğan](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/recep-tayyip-erdogan)cracked
down on the opposition after a failed coup. It was then brought up again
in 2019 when Turkey invaded northeastern Syria.]{.underline} NATO allies
reacted with horror and concern at the humanitarian crisis unfolding in
the country, with Sweden and Finland imposing sanctions on Ankara that
are still in place.

[At the time, U.S. Senator [Lindsey
Graham](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/lindsey-graham) suggested
Turkey\'s membership in NATO should have been suspended]{.underline}, if
Turkish troops attacked the Kurdish forces who had helped the U.S.
destroy the [ISIS](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/isis) Caliphate.

But the North Atlantic Treaty regulating NATO does not have an option to
suspend or even expel members. But there\'s the possibility to do
something to the same effect when a member state persistently violates
the principles contained in the pact---by failing to safeguard the
freedom of its people, the country\'s democracy and the rule of law. In
that case, [NATO members can unanimously decide to stop assisting that
ally.]{.underline}

But would NATO go as far in response to Turkey\'s refusal to approve
Finland and Sweden\'s bid for membership?

The Black Sea region is one of the re- gions in which Turkey has lost
its influ- ence to Russia. **[NATO and the EU have no influence on
relations between Rus- sia and Turkey]{.underline}**, as the Presidents
of both countries either ignore the EU\'s efforts or, as in the case of
Erdogan, despise their at- tempts to appease him. In addition, [NATO has
no mechanism for excluding Turkey as a member state. Although the EU has
implicitly suspended negotiations on Tur- key\'s possible EU membership,
it is not prepared to make a clear statement that Turkey will not join
the Union in the fore- seeable future. The leaders of both organ-
izations continue to hope that Erdogan will change the authoritarian
course of the country and return to a European way and reconsider the
comfortable relations with Putin. Erdogan has other plans, and as a
result the leaders of NATO and the EU are likely to wait in
vain.]{.underline} It must be emphasised that Erdogan was and is not an
equal partner in the Turkish-- Russian relationship, although both
Presi- dent Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Er- dogan have a similarly
authoritarian style of government. [Erdogan called Putin \"my dear

friends. As the Russian Tsar Alexander III previously said: has only two
allies -- the army and the navy.\" And in the 21st century, Russia also
has nuclear deterrence and the right of veto in the UN Security Council.
It can therefore be said that Putin does not regard Erdogan as a friend,
but as an unequal counterpart. In addition, Murat Bilhan, former head of
the Turkish Foreign Ministry\'s Strategic Re- search Centre, said:
\"Behind Putin\'s smile, Russia remains a great state and can show its
talons whenever it suits him. Turkey could never compete with Russia.
Russia is a superpower, while Turkey is a regional power.\" Turkey
should not be under any illusions about its role in relations, namely
that of the second fiddle. While Erdogan\'s authoritarian rule has
alienated allies in Europe and the United States, it has strengthened
Putin\'s control over Turkey and embarrassed Erdogan. Pu- tin\'s
economic sanctions against Turkey in November 2015 caused serious damage
to the Turkish economy when Russian tour- ists stayed away from Turkey.

Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met with
representatives of the Russian Defence Ministry to discuss Russian
"counter-terrorism operations" in Syria. On 13 November 2017, Vladimir
Putin met with President of Turkey Re- cep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi to
discuss bilateral relations and current issues on the international
agenda. 28 European Security & Defence · March 2018 Photo: Kremlin.ru

cost of unconditional support from Russia remains high and has a long-
term impact. In addition, the renewed co- operation between Ankara and
Moscow is to take place on Russian terms, and Turkey reluctantly accepts
this reality.\" [The never-ending story of **Erdogan\'s deci- sion to
buy the S-400 air defence system from Russia** is an example of Putin\'s
view of Moscow\'s support for Turkey. Turkey buys a system **that is not
compatible with NATO standards** and cannot be integrated into NATO\'s
air defence system.]{.underline} That is why Turkey must confine itself
to its own archi- tecture. Even if Russia is ready to carry out
maintenance work, maintenance is carried out by Russian and not by
Turkish workers. At the same time, Russia is not prepared to supply
software codes, IFF systems, joint production with Turkey and certainly
no technology transfer to Turkey. And this de- spite the Turkish side\'s
persistence to gain access to the software codes and the IFF system. In
addition, the system cannot be delivered to Turkey before 2020. This is
a high price paid by Turkey for unconditional support from Russia. The
statement by Ca- SECURITY POLICY  restrictions on Turkey if he feels
that Er- dogan is not listening to him. In addition, Putin can impose
sanctions at any time and without warning, which he can promise.
Therefore, the relationship is one of senior and junior partners, even
though Erdogan does not see this reality. But as Atilla Yesi- lada of
Global Source Partners, a consul- tancy firm based in Istanbul, said in
January 2017: \"The Turkish government has com- pletely decoupled itself
from reality. This is not the case with Putin, who is playing a tough,
well-calculated and manipulative game against Erdogan and at the same
time knows how to deal with the volatile Erdogan correctly, compared to
the rather timid attitude of Turkey\'s Western allies.\" There is no
doubt that Turkey did not only push itself into Russian orbit in 2015,
but al- ready in 2008, because Turkey was already dependent on 60
percent of gas supplies from Russia at that time. Today, the figure is
55 percent. Turkey has no choice but to rely on Russia\'s good will, and
Turkey pays in hard currency. The idea that Turkey must diversify its
gas imports away from Russia and become a gas hub has remained an idea.
In 2014, according to Turkey\'s foreign trade statistics, exports to
Russia amount- ed to US\$5.9Bn, while imports from Rus- sia amounted to
US\$25.2Bn. The first six months of 2016 were Turkey\'s worst export
result since 2004, and the most striking as- pect of trade with Russia
is that it has been in favour of Russia from the outset. Russia sells
more to Turkey than Turkey sells to Russia. Turkey\'s dependence on
Russian gas and oil (10 percent of oil comes from Russia) is a major
factor in this imbalance. The current situation is unlikely to change,
as Turkey\'s energy requirements will dou- ble in the next decade.
Another factor in this imbalance is the increasing number of Russian
tourists in Turkey. In addition to Turkey\'s dependence on Rus- sian gas
and Russian tourists, the Russian- Georgian war in August 2008 sent a
clear message to Ankara, namely that Ankara can only increase its
influence in its imme- diate neighbourhood, namely in the Black Sea
region, by coordinating with Moscow and not with its NATO allies. And
that is exactly what has happened since then. Turkey\'s failed coup
d\'état on 15 July 2016 has further consolidated relations between
Russia and Turkey. In a telephone call with Erdogan on 17 July 2016,
Putin stressed the \"categorical inadmissibility of anti-consti-
tutional acts and violence in state life\" and reaffirmed his intention
to meet Erdogan in Russia. Putin\'s reaction was in stark con- trast to
that of the Western allies. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu
said on 25 July 2016: \"Unlike other countries, we A Russian S-400 Air

F-16 fighter aircraft shot down a Rus- sian Su-24 aircraft near the
Syrian-Turkish border. The Turkish Air Force claimed that the Russian
aircraft violated Turkish airspace. The Russian pilot Capt. Konstantin
Murakhtin said on Russian TV there was \"no way\" the jet could have
violated Turkish airspace. Turkey says the pilots were warned 10 times
before the plane was shot down. Capt. Murakhtin was rescued from
rebel-held territory in Syria in a 12-hour operation involving Russian
Special Forces. The incident strained Russian-Turkish relations. March

to buy the S-400 if Moscow refuses to stop joint production in Turkey on
9 October 2017\" should be taken with a grain of salt. Cavusoglu is not
the one who decided to buy the S-400. Cavusoglu\'s attempt to put the
Russians under pressure is not taken seriously by Moscow and the
Russians laugh behind Cavusoglu\'s back. After all, the Turkish cash
deposit of around US\$100M for the purchase of the S-400 will not be
repaid. Finally, General Petr Pavel, Chairman of the Military Committee,
said on 25 October 2017: \"Although the principle of sovereignty
obviously consists in the procurement of defence equipment, as the
nations are sovereign in decision-making, they are also sovereign in
coping with the consequences of this decision." It remains to be seen
whether Pavel\'s statement can be interpreted as an explicit warning to
Erdogan, but it is obvious that NATO is not satisfied with Erdogan\'s
decision to buy the S-400. [The]{.underline} unequal bilateral
[relations are a major headache for NATO and the EU, as relations
between Turkey and its Western allies have deteriorated since the failed
coup d\'état in Turkey. Let us recall the state of bilateral relations
between Germany and Tur- key, and in particular the USA and Turkey, as
well as the bitter relations between Austria and The Netherlands and
Turkey. It is obvious that relations between Turkey and its Western
allies will not change as long as Erdogan remains president. **Although
Turkey remains an ally of NATO, Turkey has become a difficult ally.**
Erdogan is fully aware of this fact and will not change his behaviour,
making the NATO and EU response difficult.]{.underline} NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg\'s polite statement that Turk- ish officials
told him that \"Ankara remains a strong NATO ally\" is without
substance. [Erdogan is acting in bad faith, knowing that Western allies
cannot punish Turkey in the present circumstances]{.underline}. On the
other hand, Putin behaves like a spectator and enjoys the confusion
without moving a finger. [As long as NATO does not succeed in including
an article on the right of expulsion and penalties for misconduct of a
member of NATO in the North Atlantic Treaty, Erdogan will continue to
be- have boldly. As long as the EU heads of state and government dis-
agree on the fate of Turkey\'s possible membership and therefore do not
take a unanimous decision, Erdogan will treat these heads of state and
government with contempt. It is an opportunity for Putin to bind the
Turkish Gulliver to the land of the Lilliputians, to continue his policy
of changing the military balance in the Black Sea region (with intensive
militarisation of the Crimean peninsula) in his favour and to scorn the
NATO alliance.NATO and the EU are in an unprofitable position because of
consensus and compromise, while Putin and Erdogan continue to behave
with impunity, knowing the internal weaknesses of the EU, which is
unable to make a final decision on Turkey\'s EU membership. As long as
NATO\'s language remains vague and ambiguous, Erdogan will not do
anything to shake NATO\'s boat, but will enjoy the protection of NATO
and Russia\'s embrace.]{.underline} Whether the Turkish formula of NATO
protection and Russian embrace can also apply to other NATO member
states goes beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, it can be
said that other NATO members are carefully evaluating the Turkish
experience. Putin will continue to draw Turkey into its sphere of
influence by offering smaller trade, energy and tourism concessions and
with the unresolved conflict in Syria, as Erdogan is also in an
unprofitable position. The author can only repeat what Bilhan said
above: \"Behind Putin\'s smile Russia remains a great state and can show
its claws whenever it suits it.\" And this is something that Erdogan and
his government should remember well.

### Russian Deterrence

#### Turkey can be cooperative and is key to deterring Russia

Special Envoy to the Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, "The NATO
Accession Crisis Risks Final Collapse of the Alliance-Turkey
Relationship," Wilson Center, 6/15/22,

[Turkey's rejection of NATO accession for Sweden and Finland, beyond
undercutting NATO's response to Russia's aggression, reflects a deeper
rift between the West and Turkey.]{.underline} This is further manifest
by Ankara's recent threat to expand into northern Syria and its
overflights of Greek territory. [For the sake of the Alliance, immediate
responses are vital, but the rift will worsen unless Washington and
European capitals work with Ankara to fundamentally shift their
relationship. While such a shift has long been advisable given Turkey's
importance, the existential threat of Russian aggression for both Turkey
and the Alliance make it urgent]{.underline}. Almost overnight Ankara
lashed out against Finland and Sweden, threatening to block their NATO
accession if they did not cut real and alleged ties to the PKK. A month
ago, Washington hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu and
signaled a new bilateral strategic dialogue. This included possible
sales of F-16's to Ankara, symbolically ending the bitter dispute over a
Turkish Russian missile purchase, and Washington's subsequent cutting
Turkey from the F-35 program. Turkey was also following analogous
rapprochement with Arab states, Israel, Greece, and Armenia, and now
plays a central role in the Ukrainian conflict providing weapons,
closing the Straits to Russian naval reinforcements and pressing on
various diplomatic exchanges. Then almost overnight Ankara lashed out
against Finland and Sweden, threatening to block their NATO accession if
they did not cut real and alleged ties to the PKK, and followed up with
the aforementioned threats in Syria and escalation in the Aegean.
Predictably, American commentators reacted vigorously, even suggesting
once again for Turkey to be thrown out of NATO. Shifting attitudes
toward Turkey Such dramatic flips in Turkish policy, gelding any
predictable diplomacy, have become a hallmark of both Turkish president
Erdogan and the convoluted internal political system with his party,
dependent on an extremist nationalist partner. Such flips also make
efforts to resolve issues such as those above (let alone the underlying
rift between Ankara and NATO allies), a high-risk endeavor which most
Western leaders avoid, writing Turkey off as a lost cause. [But as
Ukraine has demonstrated, Turkey is vital to containing Russia, as it
has been to NATO's nuclear deterrence, missile defense against Iran,
operations in the Balkans, and Afghanistan. It is just too big, too
important, and at times too problematic to ignore. While the Ukraine
conflict is now generating strife between Turkey and NATO over
Scandinavian accession, it also offers a chance to improve relations
between them.]{.underline} That conflict resembles nothing seen since
the late 1930s and immediate post-war period, with the very survival of
the world order at stake. [Winning this conflict, by maintaining
Ukraine's survival as an independent state and deterring new Russian
aggression, while avoiding escalation into the unknown, is a categorical
imperative not experienced since the Cold War.]{.underline} While this
is true of the Alliance as a whole, it is especially relevant for
Turkey, a front line state with a long history under Russian pressure.
Furthermore, [experience shows Turkey can be cooperative. The Bush
administration worked well with Turkey on counter-PKK operations, and
the Obama administration negotiated a NATO anti- Iranian ballistic
missile radar deployment. The 2019 Pence-Erdogan ceasefire in Northeast
Syria still holds despite Turkish threats, and the two capitals handled
well President Biden's acknowledgment of Armenian genocide]{.underline}.
And, ironically, despite deep geostrategic hostility and recent military
clashes, Russia and Turkey maintain productive presidential-level
relations, with Putin and especially Erdogan usually following a
'no-surprises' principle. [The Turks understand that accession of Sweden
and Finland to NATO is critically important for a positive Ukraine
outcome.]{.underline} The Turks understand that accession of Sweden and
Finland to NATO is critically important for a positive Ukraine outcome.
They know it would strengthen the West's long-term against Russian
aggression and underline the solidarity of the international front
against Moscow, without, as Putin admitted, directly threatening Russia.
But what Ankara may not get is that its penchant for dangerous haggling,
not only over accession but with its Aegean and northern Syria threats,
undercuts that solidarity and the whole Russia containment categorical
imperative. Turkey would then be blamed and likely ostracized
permanently within NATO. So, the question is, why does it keep running
such risks?

#### NATO requires Turkish support to deter Russian efforts in the Black Sea

**Tol and Isik 21** (Gönül Tol, professor at George Washington
University's Institute for Middle East Studies; Yörük Isik, geopolitical
analyst based in Instanbul; "Turkey-NATO ties are problematic, but there
is one bright spot", Middle East Institute,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/turkey-nato-ties-are-problematic-there-one-bright-spot)

When it comes to Turkey-NATO ties, Ankara is regarded as more of a
problem than an ally these days. Not only did it purchase a Russian
S-400 air defense system, but its gunboat diplomacy in the eastern
Mediterranean also raised the specter of military conflict between NATO
allies when Greek and Turkish naval flotillas steamed directly toward
each other this past summer. **[There is one region, however, where
Turkey can help NATO efforts: the Black Sea.]{.underline}**

Since its annexation in 2014, the **[Crimean Peninsula has become a
Russian military fortress.]{.underline}** Moscow has significantly
increased its military presence in a region that Russian President
Vladimir [Putin considers the centerpiece of Russia's power projection
into the Mediterranean]{.underline}. It has now enough assets,
reinforced with
new [ships](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1047869183768317952?s=20) and [submarines](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1110869857157943297?s=20) with
powerful Kalibr missile systems, to overwhelm any coalition in these
waters. **[But Moscow wants more.]{.underline}** In 2021, the Russian
army will receive almost 3,500 pieces of new equipment, and two-thirds
of the military budget will go toward purchases of armaments and
upgrades. This includes the Ministry of Defense's latest Strategiya
automatic surface surveillance system in the Black Sea.

**[A growing American presence and a new Turkish strategy]{.underline}**
In response, the [U.S. Navy has stepped up its own military presence in

bringing real firepower to the Black Sea theater. The U.S. Navy's

operate in a wide geography and without help from regional allies, if
necessary. America's presence in the Black Sea is important to check
Russian expansionism, but **[a more effective strategy calls for a
coordinated response from regional allies such as Turkey.]{.underline}**
Turkey's relationship with NATO and the U.S. in particular has been
rocky of late. Ignoring warnings from NATO and the threat of sanctions
from the U..S, Turkey went ahead with its purchase of the Russian S-400
air defense system, taking delivery of the first shipment in mid-2019.
But despite its growing defense partnership with Moscow, Ankara is
equally uneasy about the growing Russian military presence in a region
where Turkey once had the edge. In a 2016 plea to Turkey's NATO allies,
Turkish President Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan said the Black Sea had become
a "Russian lake" and called for a greater NATO presence, reversing a
decades-old Turkish policy of keeping the alliance out.]{.underline}**

**[Turkey has developed a multi-pronged strategy to counter Russian
influence in the Black Sea.]{.underline}** One important leg of that
strategy is on the home front, where Turkey is strengthening its navy.
[A project called MILGEM, a contraction of the Turkish for "national

views these countries as instrumental in its efforts to balance the
Russian military presence in the Black Sea and South Caucasus. Since
Russia's annexation of Crimea, Turkish-Ukrainian relations have expanded
significantly. Last year, Erdoğan unveiled a \$36 million military aid
package for Ukraine. The two countries agreed to cooperate on the design
and manufacture of aircraft engines, radar
units, [drones](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1108309446034423808?s=20),
and navigation systems and consider collaboration on advanced technology
projects, such as ballistic missile systems. Turkey also plans to sell
its ships to Ukraine as part of a much bigger defense deal, which, if it
comes to fruition, could change the balance of power in the Black Sea.
Besides cooperation in defense industries, **[the Ukrainian and Turkish
navies
also [conduct](https://www.newsweek.com/estranged-russia-turkey-and-ukraine-join-forces-447473) joint
training in the Black Sea to showcase their ability to operate \"in

cooperation with Azerbaijan has been growing as well, which was on full
display in the fighting in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh
late last year, when Ankara threw its full military support behind Baku.

which ended with Azerbaijan capturing significant swathes of territory
from Armenian forces. **[Turkey's military exports to Azerbaijan rose

Mediterranean, **[Turkey can play a coordinating role to bring in other
NATO allies willing to participate and provide support.]{.underline}**
Such a force would require NATO's coordination and political pressure
among non-Black Sea members to commit in advance to a regular and
rotational maritime presence in the Black Sea, in line with the 1936
Montreux Convention, which limits the presence of warships from
non-littoral states to a maximum of 21 days. Although the development of
such a multinational unit would require a sustained diplomatic effort,
**[once active, it would boost NATO's deterrence in a strategic region

significantly. Last year, Erdoğan unveiled a \$36 million military aid
package for Ukraine. The two countries agreed to cooperate on the design
and manufacture of aircraft engines, radar
units, [drones](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1108309446034423808?s=20),
and navigation systems and consider collaboration on advanced technology
projects, such as ballistic missile systems. Turkey also plans to sell
its ships to Ukraine as part of a much bigger defense deal, which, if it
comes to fruition, could change the balance of power in the Black Sea.
Besides cooperation in defense industries, **[the Ukrainian and Turkish
navies
also [conduct](https://www.newsweek.com/estranged-russia-turkey-and-ukraine-join-forces-447473) joint
training in the Black Sea to showcase their ability to operate \"in
accordance with NATO standards.\" Turkey has also invested in shoring up
the defenses of Georgia, another Black Sea country threatened by
Russia's growing influence in the region]{.underline}**. [Turkey
has [allocated](https://turkeyanalyst.org/publications/turkey-analyst-articles/item/652-turkey%E2%80%99s-commitment-to-azerbaijan%E2%80%99s-defense-shows-the-limits-of-ankara%E2%80%99s-tilt-to-moscow.html) millions
of dollars to the Georgian Ministry of Defense to reform the country's
military logistics and transfer defense capabilities to its northeastern
neighbor while advocating for the extension of NATO membership to
Georgia, a move Russia opposes.]{.underline} Turkey's defense
cooperation with Azerbaijan has been growing as well, which was on full
display in the fighting in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh
late last year, when Ankara threw its full military support behind Baku.
Turkish drones provided Azerbaijan a huge advantage in the conflict,
which ended with Azerbaijan capturing significant swathes of territory
from Armenian forces. **[Turkey's military exports to Azerbaijan rose
six-fold in 2020, with Azerbaijan jumping to the top of the list of
Turkish arms buyers in September]{.underline}**. NATO and the Black Sea
[**NATO should support these Turkish efforts**. It should also establish
a permanent "Black Sea Maritime Patrol" group modeled on the successful
Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean.]{.underline} Operation Sea
Guardian is a flexible effort that can potentially cover the full range
of NATO's maritime security needs. **[In accordance with NATO's
"framework nation" concept, Turkey can be assigned the leading nation
role in the Black Sea and smaller members can integrate their own, more
limited capabilities into an organizational structure provided by
Ankara.]{.underline}** Mirroring other NATO missions in the Baltic or
Mediterranean, **[Turkey can play a coordinating role to bring in other
NATO allies willing to participate and provide support.]{.underline}**
Such a force would require NATO's coordination and political pressure
among non-Black Sea members to commit in advance to a regular and
rotational maritime presence in the Black Sea, in line with the 1936
Montreux Convention, which limits the presence of warships from
non-littoral states to a maximum of 21 days. Although the development of
such a multinational unit would require a sustained diplomatic effort,
**[once active, it would boost NATO's deterrence in a strategic region
that has become a springboard for Russia to project power from Georgia
all the way to Syria and Libya.]{.underline}**

### International Co-op

#### Turkey is key in international cooperation with NATO for emerging technologies, AI, and biotechnology -- several benefits to keeping Turkey

[As technology continues to evolve, with the rise of autonomous
vehicles, the blockchain industry, and artificial intelligence, Turkey,
NATO and others continue to invest heavily in global technological
advancements]{.underline}. The global technological [developments allow
for various responses to geo-political issues, but also have the
potential to add more nuance to international issues.]{.underline}
**[The response to the rise in new and emerging technologies relies on
international coordination and cooperation.]{.underline}** [Domestic
advancement in Turkey, for instance, involves international issues and
stakeholders. **Turkey, the United States and NATO have continued to
develop and manufacture technological devices for space, communications
and vehicles**]{.underline}. In fact, NATO's Deputy Secretary General
Mircea Geoaña has [emphasized the increasing significance of
international cooperation on Artificial Intelligence (AI)]{.underline}
"as the most pervasive emerging and disruptive technology, especially
when combined with other technologies [such as big data, autonomy or
**biotechnologies**]{.underline}" (NATO, 2021). NATO uses the Science
and Technology Organization (STO) to maintain modern technology advances
for further development. The transatlantic collaboration amongst NATO
Member-states allows for these advancements to reach their full
potential in a world facing developing challenges.

[Start-up businesses also reap the benefits of Turkey's technological
advancements]{.underline}. Internet companies such as Trendyol and
Hepsiburada are becoming major players in the Turkish internet market,
and have attracted attention from Silicon Valley in the U.S. Along with
this, Turkey is the 20th largest market for eCommerce in 2020, and has
attracted the attention of several American companies. In 2020, the
centre joined the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C41R)
Network. In taking a more global approach, the goal of the center is to
research the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI),
autonomous vehicles, and blockchain technology. Each of these are issues
of focus for the U.S. as well.

[It is clear that Turkey is contouring its policies and posturing itself
to become a leading country in the field of digital revolution while the
United States uses its continued advancements and investments to combat
threats]{.underline}. Technological advancements made in **[Turkey
highlight the role of trans-atlantic and global partnerships while
international investments]{.underline}**, with the United States for
instance, enable a comprehensive understanding of the new and emerging
challenges. [Global cooperation is **paramount** in the sharing of new
technological advancements when crises arise and the most efficient
manner to respond to them.]{.underline} The universal elements of
technology allow geo-politics and foriegn policy to thrive in
efficiency; however, understanding the setbacks and stagnation in
regions is equally important.

### US-Turkey Partnership

#### Alliance and cooperation with Turkey is key for NATO and U.S. deterrence strategies that is neccessary to fighting Advantage 1's impacts

**Eldridge 11** (William Eldridge, U.S. air force colonel and commander,
former public policy scholar, "The Credibility of America's Extended
Nuclear Deterrence The Case of the Republic of Turkey," Air University

This **[research suggests that it is the strength of the US-Turkish
political-security relationship that is the most important factor for
ensuring the credibility of the United States' extended nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**. In fact, the credibility of the US nuclear
umbrella has little to do with the type of its nuclear weapons, the
number of warheads, or the negative image of US nuclear competency
generated from the Air Force's nuclear handling missteps. Instead, [US
credibility depends on Turkey's perception of its political, economic,
and military ties with the United States. It is the quality of that
broader relationship that will also have the greatest influence on
whether or not Turkish leaders pursue an independent nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline}. [Turkey generally measures the strength of its
security relationship with the United States through the lens of the
reliability of bilateral and multilateral security and partnership
agreements such as NATO]{.underline} and the European Union (EU).
Although there are many ways to measure the strength of these types of
relationships---domestic polls, media tone, treaties, and agreements---
the perception of national leadership is the most important. [It is the
highest level of Turkish decision makers that will decide the merits of
continued reliance on the US extended nuclear deterrent.]{.underline}
Undoubtedly, domestic influence and external security threats influence
those decision makers, but [for Turkey, it is the perception of alliance
strength that will have the most influence on its nuclear proliferation
decisions.]{.underline}

### EU-NATO Coop

#### EU-NATO coop requires a strong Turkish partnership.

**[Cyprus has been priority number one in Turkish foreign affairs for
many years]{.underline}**. The island has been a highly contentious
issue for both Greece and Turkey, as well as for the international
community. [The tensions between the two countries have slowed down the
strategic partnership between the EU and NATO in its fullest
sense]{.underline}. According to the North Atlantic Council decision of
2002 Cyprus and Malta are excluded from participating in EUNATO meetings
concerning 'strategic cooperation' between the two sides of the
Atlantic. However, the EU, based on the community solidarity principle,
does not want to leave Cyprus out of this security dialogue. [Turkey
insists on the validity of the North Atlantic Council decision of 2002
and blocks the participation of Cyprus in the NATO-EU strategic
cooperation]{.underline}, Cyprus blocks Turkish membership and
participation in the EU decision making mechanisms concerning security
in return. Given all these tensions, **[there is still no guarantee that
once the Cyprus problem is resolved, the EU and NATO will automatically
cooperate.]{.underline}** All the attention is now on this mutual
blockade and the Cyprus problem is often blamed for non-cooperation
(Buharalı, 2008). The Cyprus problem has transcended regional bickering
to become an international problem**[. It is a long lived debate and an
agreement does not seem to be reached soon.]{.underline}** One has to
acknowledge that even if the Cyprus problem were solved today, many
complications remain. [The EU and the United States have different
approaches to security that might make it difficult to work
together.]{.underline} Furthermore Turkey is still only a candidate
member, and would not be allowed in the EU decision making processes.
The [EU-NATO cooperation needs an active Turkish presence to be
effective in the region.]{.underline} The different approaches of the EU
and the US may be the biggest problem impeding the transatlantic
security alliance in the future. The EU as a soft power does not use the
same means as the hard power United States and vice-versa. The division
of tasks between the EU and NATO has created yet another problem. 6 It
would be much less costly and easier to overcome the problems in the
conflict zones if the two could decide on who is doing what. For now,
instead of waiting for the Cyprus problem to be solved, new grounds for
cooperation have to be found.
