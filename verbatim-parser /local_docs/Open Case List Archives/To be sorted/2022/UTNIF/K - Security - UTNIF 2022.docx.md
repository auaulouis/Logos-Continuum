#### Attempts to resolve insecurity inevitably fail and creates violent cycles pursuing security -- the elimination of one threat necessitates the production of other threats to manage generalized anxiety

On the other hand, however, [the Lacanian take allows us to
account]{.underline} also [for]{.underline} [the politics]{.underline}
that is [imminent in the failure of these anxiety-managing
attempts]{.underline}. As we have argued, [all narratives built around
particular objects of fear]{.underline}, including geopolitical ones,
[are eventually failing, as these objects are ultimately 'false
targets'.]{.underline} They are merely temporary discursive vessels
functioning as placeholders for expressing deeper ontological anxiety,
which is bound to strike back. Consequently, [attempts to make societies
(feel) more secure]{.underline}, habitually [end up making them (feel)
equally, or even more, insecure and anxious]{.underline}, regardless of
how much effort is invested into fighting this or that particular
threat. As Heath-Kelly (2015, 2018) and Jacobsen (2020) have shown,
[successful security discourses like counter-terrorism or cybersecurity
have actually managed to internalise this 'failure to
secure']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015) [by incorporating it into their
very structure]{.underline}. According to them, [counter-terrorism and
cybersecurity are constructed as dangers so slippery and multifaceted
that once we resolve one problem]{.underline} (by killing Osama bin
Laden, resolving a particular cyberthreat), [a whole new range of
terrorist groups or cyber issues emerges to occupy their
place.]{.underline}

Consequently, and in contrast to conventional ontological security
literature, [politics of anxiety is not only about managing and
repressing it through narratives, routines and relationships. It is also
about other ways of manipulating anxiety for political
purposes]{.underline}, [including reproducing, nurturing and spreading
it via the construction of threats so opaque and widespread]{.underline}
that [they]{.underline} [cannot be possibly resolved]{.underline}, [like
terrorism, cybersecurity -- or hybrid warfare.]{.underline} By its
repeated failure to secure, [such discourses hold societies in the
anxious 'state of constant and heightened alertness']{.underline}
(Davies, 2019, p. xii), [making them ready to accept a range of
pre-emptive security measures across all possible areas of social
life.]{.underline}

Bringing the argument together, by the notion of anxiety geopolitics we
conceptualise the politics of dealing with anxiety by linking it to
objects and issues spatialised through the means of geopolitical
imaginations. By references to geographical categories, such as states,
regions, continents or civilisations, this type of affective geopolitics
promises to transform the amorphous and ambiguous anxiety stemming from
range of different issues into tangible and manageable objects of fear
taking the form of geopolitical threats. Yet, [as all such narratives
and images are ultimately bound to fail to resolve the underlying
anxiety]{.underline}, the [analytical focus must be extended also to how
these failures are accounted for and how anxiety is being further
reproduced with the help of geopolitical imaginations]{.underline}.
Therefore, [anxiety geopolitics is ultimately about the oscillation
between repressing anxiety through]{.underline} the [geopoliticisation
of]{.underline} both [the 'threat' and the self, as much as it is about
dealing with the recurring failures to secure]{.underline} the [subjects
produced by such geopoliticisation]{.underline}, [which result in
reproduction of social anxiety.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is to reject the 1AC's securitized representations -- threat construction is [only possible]{.underline} in a world of discursive repetition -- voting negative endorses a discursive model that does not endorse securitization as a model of understanding the world

**Van Rythoven 14** (Eric Van Rythoven, PhD candidate at Carleton
University studying emotion, securitization, and world politics,
E-international Relations, December 21,

SW

The recent forum on emotions and world politics in the journal
International Theory is a welcome development for the field of
International Relations. The contributors helpfully remind us that
emotions research in IR remains hampered by a number of deeply embedded
assumptions, such as the belief that emotions are only private and
personal phenomena, or the belief there is a sharp dichotomy between
emotion and rationality. Critically assessing these assumptions is
important not only because it highlights what the discipline gets
'wrong' in its picture of world politics, but because it illuminates how
current theories help to propagate such distortions.

In this brief intervention I focus on an additional assumption
concerning emotion, one which permeates the subfield of security
studies.  Here I am referring to the widely shared belief in the
ubiquity of [fear in the politics of security]{.underline}.  While this
association is historically rooted in Hobbesian accounts of anarchy it
has a distinct contemporary form.  [Fear]{.underline}, we are told by a
variety of figures, [permeates the politics of security and is
consistently and successfully marshalled by political elites, security
professionals, and bureaucrats to sustain new images of threat which
lead to an ever broadening security agenda.]{.underline}  [Fear, whether
over predatory great powers, immigrant minorities, or infectious
diseases, facilitates securitization]{.underline}.  As a latent social
resource collective fears always appear to be waiting patiently in the
margins of discourse until they are easily and unproblematically
deployed in a security argument.

These kinds of arguments radically underplay the fragility and
contingency of political fears.  As forms of collective embodied
judgment political fears are produced and sustained only through social
interactions.  As I have argued elsewhere the memories, traumas,
practices, rituals, symbols, and other cultural resources which sustain
political fears are always open to contestation and destabilization (Van
Rythoven, forthcoming).  Yet in security studies the logic of fear as a
relatively settled and stable substance which can be drawn upon to serve
narrow, instrumental purposes enjoys wide appeal.  The consequence is a
particular form of dystopian theory, a distorting idealism which ignores
both the empirical fragility of fears, as well as the often dispersed
power struggles which shape this emotion in a multitude of differing
ways.

To appreciate the breadth of this assumption in the field it is useful
to begin by looking at two highly disparate figures: Stephen Walt and
Didier Bigo.  Walt has become the essential flag bearer for a
conventional neorealism that continues to define the mainstream of
security studies in America.  Bigo's contribution to [the]{.underline}
so-called 'Paris School' has made him a central figure in critical
security studies which has grown exponentially outside of the heartland
of American IR ([CASE,
2006](http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/37/4/443.short)).  While both hold
sharply divergent [understandings of security]{.underline}, method, [and
the purposes of its study they are surprisingly similar in their view of
the relationship between fear and threat construction.]{.underline} 
Nowhere is this more evident than in the close resemblance between their
respective figures of the 'threat monger' and 'the manager of unease'.

The figure of the threat monger is most evident in Walt's contemporary
work, especially his popular writings for [Foreign
Policy](http://foreignpolicy.com/author/stephen-walt/).  Here the
concern is not with the international system, anarchy, the balance of
power, nor any other of the concepts normally associated with neorealist
theory.  Instead the most pressing issue is the persistent and
pernicious practice of threat inflation.  The dangers facing the
national security apparatus in western states are vastly overblown. 
Everything from the safety of the Olympics, to the danger of
international terrorism, to the neologism of [cyber
security]{.underline}, to the [threat]{.underline} of global warming are
[vastly blown out of proportion]{.underline}, [especially relative to
the traditional danger of interstate conflict]{.underline}
(Walt, [2012](http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/13/what-terrorist-threat/#.UClvYIJhDFA.twitter), [2010](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/03/30/is-the-cyber-threat-overblown/), [2009b](http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/08/10/national-security-heats-up/)). 
[Instead of objectively discerning national security demands from the
material distribution of power, the United States' security agenda has
become bloated with a host of inflated threats.]{.underline}  In Walt's
view "\[o\]ne reason [Americans exaggerate security fears]{.underline}
is the existence of an extensive cottage industry of professional
threatmongers, [who deploy a well-honed array of arguments to convince
us that we are in fact in grave danger]{.underline}"
([2009a](http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/05/04/the-threatmongers-handbook/)). 
Through a variety of argumentative techniques threat mongers are able to
engender fear in the American public over the threat of some dangerous
'other'.  Such "tried-and-true methods do not work all of the time, of
course, but they are undeniably effective" (Ibid).  Here fear receives
little scrutiny.  It is simply a latent social resource activated by the
discursive performance of the monger which helps wins audience approval.

Bigo's ([2002](http://alt.sagepub.com/content/27/1_suppl/63.extract):66)
examination of the security profession, "with its ethos of secrecy and
concern for the management of fear or unease", bears more than a passing
resemblance to Walt's threat monger.  His concern with those who work in
the professional field of security, spanning from government
bureaucracies, police, intelligence agencies, militaries, and their
private partners, comes as a reaction to [earlier
approaches](https://books.google.ca/books?id=j4BGr-Elsp8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=security+a+new+framework+for+analysis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XtuRVMHnOYv9yQSi3oCABQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=security%20a%20new%20framework%20for%20analysis&f=false) narrowly
focused on highly publicized security speech acts.  The social
production of danger, [Bigo argues, is in part sustained by the "sense
of the routines, the day-to-day practices, of the bureaucracies" who
produces both insecurity over policy fields like migration and the
techniques of governance to respond (Ibid, 73).  Like Walt's monger
however, this task is only made possible through the deft generation and
management of fear.  Security professionals partake in a broader
discursive formation where "the word immigration becomes a term for
catalyzing fears or misgivings about the economic, social, and political
development of Western countries. It becomes a fixer of frights and
confusions about national cultural identities as well as of weaknesses
of solidarity mechanisms" (Ibid, 79 emphasis original).  It is through
this capacity to affix specific frights to distinct programs of
governance, especially through institutionalized routines, that the
securitization of issues like migration is possible.]{.underline}

The differences between Walt and Bigo cannot be underplayed.  For Walt
the polemical description of the monger is necessary because these
actors recklessly inflate threats above and beyond what is objectively
reasonable based upon the current international environment[.  Bigo
rejects the very framing of threat inflation as it presupposes some
mythical baseline from which 'true' assessments of threat can be
discerned.  Security issues in this view are always historically
situated reflections of particular interests and modes of
governance.]{.underline}

Yet this deep philosophical divide over threat construction is what
makes the convergence between the figure of the threat monger and the
manager of unease all the more striking.  Both Walt and Bigo envisage a
collection of actors whom, with predictable and institutionalized
regularity, engage in a series of discursive moves which couple latent
fears with a distinct security agenda.  These fears, which never seem to
be in short supply, are amplified, managed, and molded to the
instrumental purposes of these actors.  Both present an array of
techniques, such as the creation of categories of identity, which can be
used to circulate fear, or as Walt pithily puts it "\[h\]ow to scare
your fellow citizens for fun and profit" (2009a).  Though the nuances
surrounding these figures differ when it comes to their central role in
leveraging fear to produce a collectively shared image of threat they
are the same.  The manager of unease is the threat monger and vice
versa.

[This is a permissive view of threat construction.  Practices of
securitization are not simply relatively frequent occurrences, they also
achieve a high rate of success.  In the strongest form of this view the
deliberative, rule-driven, liberal order of world politics is constantly
abridged by the emergency politics of security.  This distinctly
dystopian view is sustained by both the assumed ubiquity of fear and its
unproblematic instrumentalization]{.underline}.

[The concept of dystopia employed here is best understood through its
resemblance to earlier critiques of utopianism in IR]{.underline}. 
These began with E.H. Carr's Twenty Years Crisis in which [he chastises
interwar liberals for a utopian view which grossly exaggerated the ease
and possibility of international peace.]{.underline}  More recently
Samuel Barkin has [revived the concept in his critique of contemporary
American constructivism whose progressive view of the spread of
humanitarian and democratic norms is eerily reminiscent of Carr's
utopian liberals
([2003](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1079-1760.2003.00503002.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false):332-336). 
The utopian label functions as a shorthand for highlighting two
fundamental defects in thinking about world politics.  The first is
empirical.  For Barkin the norms that are the locus of liberal
constructivism "are accepted largely uncritically as good ones, as are
the elements of international civil society involved in spreading these
norms" (Ibid, 335).  There is little empirical interest in 'bad' norms
or what might be considered malignant forms of international civil
society.  Carr explicitly positions empirical 'reality' as the opposite
to utopianism with the latter being "the product of not analysis, but of
aspiration"
([2001\[1981\]](https://books.google.ca/books?id=Gbz_EsWbioUC&dq=twenty+years+crisis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BOWRVPu4E6yxsATrkIKIDA&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA):7). 
The second feature of this critique concerns the absence of
power. ]{.underline} On this point Barkin repeats familiar criticisms of
liberal norms-centered research: that it fails to consider why certain
norms spread and others don't, or why some norms are actively resisted
(2003:335).  Carr argues the "\[f\]ailure to recognize that power is an
essential element of politics has hitherto vitiated all attempts to
establish international forms of government" (2001\[1981\]:100).

While utopia and reality are often presented as opposing mirror
images--especially by Carr--this ignores how political idealism comes in
different forms.  Dystopianism is a form of political idealism but
instead of exaggerating the prospect of liberal progressiveness it
exaggerates illiberal regression.  Security studies has become dystopian
insofar as it has come to fetishize the illiberal character of emergency
politics.  While utopianism envisions few substantive limits to the
expansion of liberal order, the dystopianism of security studies sees
few limits on the expansion of the concept of security.  Walt's threat
monger and Bigo's manager of unease face no limits on invoking emergency
politics because of their unparalleled ability to instrumentalize fear.

Yet because this position is fundamentally idealist it is also subject
to the same lines of critique as liberal idealism.  Empirically [there
is a wealth of evidence]{.underline} (and common sense) [to suggest
collective fears are fragile, fugitive, and fickle phenomenon rather
than the stable, steady, and settled social resources which can be
reliably deployed in a security argument]{.underline}.  Wendy Pearlman's
rich ethnographic account of the Arab Spring for example, is centered
precisely on the breakdown of collective fears over violent reprisal
from authoritarian governments.  Analogous to the figures discussed
above, [authoritarian "\[p\]owerholders]{.underline} \[in the Middle
East\] [wield]{.underline}ed [fear as a tool for survival, enforcing it
with security apparatuses and state discourses that warned that the
alternative to the regime was chaos]{.underline} or Islamic radicalism"
([Pearlman,
2013](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8923772&fileId=S1537592713001072):393). 
Pearlman's account of revolution in Tunisia and Egypt is peppered with
references to the overcoming or breaking down of fear, something
captured in the popular expression "inkasar hajez al-khawf" meaning "The
barrier of fear has broken" (Ibid, 388).

[Even in instances where a broadly-based collective fear does emerge it
may lack the historical durability to sustain any lasting vision of
emergency politics.  Anxiety]{.underline} within in western [countries
over the spread of Ebola]{.underline} from West Africa [reached a
fevered pitch in the Fall of 2014. ]{.underline} When asked in October
65% of Americans said they were concerned about the possibility of a
nationwide epidemic ([Washington Post-ABC News Poll,
2014](http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/14/National-Politics/Polling/release_366.xml)). 
Citing Ebola as "a potential threat to global security" the Obama
administration deployed 3,000 military personnel to West Africa ([Mason
and Harding Giahyue,
2014](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/16/us-health-ebola-obama-idUSKBN0HB08S20140916)). 
[Yet by November declining media coverage, eroding public interest, and
empty congressional meetings suggested **popular
anxieties**]{.underline} over the disease had largely
**[evaporated]{.underline}** ([Koren,
2014](http://www.nationaljournal.com/health-care/have-americans-stopped-caring-about-ebola-20141113); [Ferris,
2014](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/224758-as-ebola-attention-fades-lawmakers-beg-for-spotlight)). 
[By December]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} administration
[was]{.underline} left [struggling to revitalize anxieties over Ebola to
sustain a security response]{.underline}.  In a plea for a further a
further \$6 billion of emergency funding to maintain the response Obama
urged that the crisis "can't get caught up in normal politics" ([Hughes,
2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-presses-congress-on-ebola-funding/article/2556874)).

The fact that [political actors]{.underline} so often [struggle and
strain to preserve]{.underline} the [underlying sense of anxiety and
crisis surrounding a security issue points to a precarious set of power
relations surrounding emotions. ]{.underline} To be clear, scholars like
Walt and Bigo offer very rich conceptions of power within their
research.  [Walt's neorealism carries an explicit view of material state
power]{.underline} even if this view is difficult to square with his
popular writings focused on security discourses.  Bigo offers a much
richer conceptualization of power which draws on both the constitutive
force of speech acts as well as the positional authority of the security
profession (2002:73-74).  While [these forms of power]{.underline} are
important they do not necessarily shape collective emotions which **[can
be situated in a much more dispersed sets of cultural
practices]{.underline}**. Consider, for example, Stephen Hawking's
recent claim that the emergence of artificial intelligence could
threaten humanity.  This claim likely resonated well in societies such
as the United States where films and texts in popular culture have long
envisioned autonomous robots as dangerous ([Brasor,
2014](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/12/06/national/media-national/cultural-differences-shade-reactions-robots/#.VImzsTHF-Sq)). 
Contrast this with how "Japan's tendency to imbue machines with sentient
qualities reflects certain native religious precepts" (Ibid).  [Machines
which may be culturally identified as objects of fear in one society may
be objects of comfort, sentimentality, and even happiness in
another.]{.underline}  In certain cases **[pre-existing cultural
practices may sharply circumscribe the power of authoritative speech to
generate collective fears.]{.underline}**

[Characterizing security studies as dystopian for its disregard of the
power relations and empirics surrounding emotions may seem
questionable.  Such accusations]{.underline} of idealism often [come to
be understood as a form of insult]{.underline} (Barkin, 2003:332).  Yet
[given how these views of fear have such broad and longstanding status
within security studies a provocation]{.underline}, in a sense, [is
necessary.  There is]{.underline} however, an additional [value to this
framing of dystopia.  If any prolonged scrutiny of emotions finds the
dystopian view of security studies to be unsustainable, then it raises
questions over what kinds of worlds do collective emotions in world
politics actually contribute to]{.underline}?  The answers to this
question are bound to be more complex than simplistic utopias or
dystopias, but they also promise to be far more interesting.

[[China's]{.mark} expansion of national interests which followed by its
[military modernization alarms the other side of the
Pacific.]{.mark}]{.underline} An observation on U.S. official documents
reveals how [[U.S. is alarmed with rapid military modernization of
China.]{.mark}]{.underline} 10 As early as 2006, U.S. has been aware
that [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, among other countries, [[has the
greatest potential to compete]{.mark} militarily [with the U.S. In terms
of military technology]{.mark}, U.S. is also aware that [the gap with
China is closing]{.mark} and unless U.S. could formulate counter
strategies, its military advantages would soon be offset (U.S.
Department of Defense, 2006, p. 29).]{.underline} [The tone of anxiety
about China's military modernization has not much changed years
afterwards[. In latest edition of Quadrennial Defense Review
Report]{.mark} (2014, p. 6), [it is stated that "In the coming
years,]{.mark} countries such as [China will]{.mark} continue
[seek]{.mark}ing [to counter U.S. strengths]{.mark} using anti-access
and area-denial (A2/AD) approaches and [by employing other new cyber and
space control technologies.]{.mark} Similar notion is found in 2012
Department of Defense's document of strategic guidance in which stated
that "States such as China and Iran will continue to pursue asymmetric
means to counter our power projection capabilities" (Panneta & Obama,
2012).]{.underline} From these publications we can also get a sense on
how [[it is very difficult, if not entirely impossible, for states to
acquire complete information regarding their adversaries' current and
future intentions. This problem is worse in the case of
China]{.mark}]{.underline} whose authoritarian government is not really
familiar with the idea of transparency. [Thus, [U.S. seems to have no
other choice than just equate China's increasing military capabilities
with unfriendly intentions.]{.mark} In Quadrennial Defense Review Report
2006, [it is stated that "... the United States, its allies and partners
must also hedge against the possibility that a major or emerging power
could choose a hostile path in the future]{.mark} (U.S. Department of
Defense, 2006, p. 28)."]{.underline} It does not require a rocket
science to identify the region where there is an emerging power as well
as a number of U.S. allies. In Quadrennial Defense Review 2014, it is
stated that "... the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China's
military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of
transparency and openness from China's leaders regarding both military
capabilities and intentions (U.S. Department of Defense, 2014)." [The
general observations on some publications of U.S. government reveals how
[U.S. feels]{.mark}, at the very least, [alarmed by the rapid military
modernization of China.]{.mark} Once this hostile image attached,
China's further military modernization is regarded as a proof to that
hostile image.]{.underline} This can be shown, for example, on how U.S.
dubs China as developing what it calls as Anti-Access/Area Denial
capabilities which can be used, and believed is going to be used, to
deter and counter U.S. involvement in the events of conflict in China's
Global Jurnal Politik Internasional 18(2) 125 periphery. [[Applying our
theoretical framework of "spiral model,"]{.mark} this stage can be
regarded as one when [U.S.]{.mark} applying the first logic of
[overestimating the hostility of its rival, in this case, China.]{.mark}
Feeling threatened by the perceived-as-hostile strategic behaviour of
China, [U.S. starts to respond]{.mark}. In the midst of economic
struggle and defence budget cut, U.S. tries to check the rise of China
mainly through what it calls as "rebalancing" strategy which involves an
intensification of alliances and basing strategies.]{.underline} [The
strategy covers U.S. basing in Darwin and Guam, the provision of
advanced naval weapon systems such Patriot missiles and Aegis system to
its alliances, and also diplomatic and economic initiatives]{.underline}
such as Trans-Pacific Partnership which exclude China. Hillary Clinton's
"America's Pacific Century," (2011) one of the earliest record that lie
down U.S. strategic pivot to Asia-Pacific, provides the stated rationale
behind the strategy which is to uphold U.S. leadership commitment in the
key driver area of current global politics. Interesting to note here how
Clinton frames that U.S. rebalancing is not desired by U.S. only, but
also by the region itself, hence justifying U.S. continuing presence.
Another important note is how U.S. seems to truly believe that it has
been a Pacific state. This statement can be regarded as a way U.S. tries
to frame that its presence expansion in Asia-Pacific is for benign
purposes. [[U.S. "rebalancing" strategy]{.mark}, which was [initially
intended to preserve stability in the region, turns out generate the
very opposite outcome.]{.mark} China considers U.S., with its
"rebalancing" strategy as a revisionist power that seeks to curtail
China's political influence and harms China's interests; as China rises,
the U.S. will resist (Nathan & Scobell, 2012).]{.underline} This view
appears to be much influenced by China's understanding of U.S., as well
as China's view of the international system and how to behave in such
system.11 [[The sense of China being threatened by U.S]{.mark}.
strategic behaviour [can also be found in China's official
documents.]{.mark} In 2008 edition of China's National Defense (2009),
U.S. military deployment realignment and its strengthened military
alliances with countries like Japan are regarded as influencing the
complexity of the regional security environment. That U.S. continues to
sell advanced weapons systems to Taiwan is also regarded as an
infringement to the "one China" policy and U.S.-China joint
communiqes.]{.underline} These two issues have been persistently raised
afterwards (China\'s National Defense in 2010, 2011). 2014 Shangri-La
Dialogue perhaps is the perfect evidence that shows how China is feeling
threatened by U.S. strategic behaviour in Asia-Pacific, and vice versa.
Muhamad Arif 126 [Responding to U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that
criticized China for its "destabilizing, unilateral actions"
particularly in the South China Sea, Lieutenant [General Wang Guanzhong,
the Chinese military's deputy chief of general staff said that]{.mark}
Hagel's speech was designed to "create trouble and make
provocations"]{.underline} (Han, Barnes, & Page, 2014). Lt. Gen. [Wang
continued by saying that [Hagel's speech was "full of hegemony, full of
words of threat and intimidation,"]{.mark} and part of "a provocative
challenge against China." This speech was then backed by another Chinese
official, [Major General Zhu Chenghu]{.mark}, who [said]{.mark} in an
interview, ["If you take China as an enemy, China will absolutely become
the enemy of the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} (Han, Barnes, & Page, 2014)."
[From this exchanges of strong words by high ranking officials from both
China and U.S, we can get a sense of antagonistic, even hostility, in
the relations between the two. [The sense of being threatened by
U.S.]{.mark}' "rebalancing" [strategy leads China to intensify its
military]{.mark} modernization.]{.underline} [China continues to
increase its defence expenditures, until today. Moreover, [China
intensifies the development of advanced weapons systems]{.mark} that
provide it with capability to neutralize U.S. force in the
Pacific.]{.underline} [[These capabilities]{.mark},]{.underline} which
U.S. calls as A2/AD capabilities --which in itself is U.S.'
overestimation of China's hostility- [[ranges from]{.mark}
fifth-generation fighter aircrafts, advanced intermediate and
medium-range conventional ballistic [missiles]{.mark}, long-range
land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles, counter-space weapons
[to]{.mark} [offensive cyber capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline} [And as
[the "spiral model" postulates, U.S. has been investing considerable
amount of resources to develop strategy to counter China's
counter-strategy against U.S. presence in Asia-Pacific. In other words,
the conflict between U.S. and China is spiralling.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Through looking at previous research conducted on the geopolitics of AI
it was found that it is quite limited. As AI is still quite a nascent
area of study specifically relating to fields such as global politics,
not much research has been conducted so far. As a result, there exists
significant gaps within the research wherein this study can fit in,
particularly in studying and comparing specific countries and their
geopolitical polices in relation to AI. Moreover, the use of the
theoretical frameworks of realism and liberalism, as well as the WPR
methodology, have not been used to study AI and its geopolitical
aspects, all of which this study will apply. 3.2. [Chinese
Artificial]{.underline} Intelligence Policy As discussed in the
preceding section, [within the study of Artificial Intelligence [there
is a significant focus on China and its AI
policies.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[China]{.mark} is one of the countries
that [has come the furthest in]{.mark}]{.underline} regard to not only
implementing artificial intelligence technologies in various areas but
also [in [developing AI strategies and]{.mark} [governance surrounding
its implementation]{.mark} and impact both domestically and
internationally.]{.underline} As a result of this, much research has
been done on China and its approach towards AI and AI policy. Within the
research that has been done on the Chinese AI approach, little attention
has been placed on specifically studying the geopolitical aspect of
Chinese AI policy. One of the few studies conducted on AI in China from
a more geopolitical viewpoint is the article mentioned in the previous
section on the securitization of Artificial Intelligence in China by
Zeng (2021). In this article, Zeng applies
[[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[the]{.mark} analytical
[framework]{.mark} in order [to study how AI is becoming a]{.mark}
[security matter within Chinese AI discourse and being tied to its
national security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Zeng (ibid) further argues that
the [Chinese AI discourse being linked to [securitization is]{.mark} [a
result of it being embedded within the historical]{.mark}, geopolitical
and domestic [Chinese contexts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Specifically, [the
context of the "century of humiliation" [and]{.mark} its
[historical]{.mark} failures in competing technologically with other
countries.]{.underline} Moreover, Zeng (ibid, pp. 418-420) states that
[China's securitization of AI is fueled by its geopolitical [competition
with the US where]{.mark}in the [perception of each other's AI]{.mark}
capabilities and advancements [accelerate the process of
securitization]{.mark}.]{.underline} This understanding of Chinese AI
policy is shared by Alexander (2021). In his article on the 9
geopolitical implication of China's AI development Alexander (ibid)
agrees that [[global competition is a major]{.mark} [driver]{.mark} [in
China's approach to]{.mark} its national [AI
policy.]{.mark}]{.underline} He argues that [Chinas national policies
concerning AI are a response to external factors particularly those of
security as well as competition in economics and AI
development.]{.underline} Moreover, that through their AI policy, China
is attempting to create a distinct path in the geopolitical system and
become a new model for development globally. This is a point that is
also shared by Zeng (2021, pp. 418-420) who states that the key
objective of Chinese AI policy and development is to become a global
leader in AI. Even though there exist significant research on Chinas AI
policy and some in connection to geopolitics, most of it is solely
focused on the national context of China. If a comparison is made within
the research it is exclusively made with the United States. Moreover, as
with the research on the geopolitics of AI, none of the research
conducted on China utilizes the theoretical frameworks of Realism or
Liberalism to analyze the Chinese approach to AI policy.

#### Their securitization of China's AI development produces insecurity -- AI tech race framing creates a security dilemma

//KL

This trend has played out most prominently in techno- logy and
innovation, where since 2015[, [China has followed]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
ambitious [plan to become a world leader in key tech]{.mark}nologies
[like]{.mark} artificial intelligence [(AI),]{.mark} autonomous systems,
telecommunications and next-generation computing.]{.underline} This
policy quickly became a bone of contention with the US and other
developed countries. [The main [concerns were that unfair advantages
enjoyed by Chinese tech companies]{.mark} -- state subsidies, forced
intellectual property transfer, denial of market access to foreign
competitors in China, and even industrial espionage -- [would]{.mark},
if left unchecked, eventually [allow them to dominate these
fields]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Due to the dual-use potential of
such technologies in military as well as civilian applications, [[US
policy- makers]{.mark} have increasingly [view]{.mark}ed [this
competition through a national security lens]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 This
has been an especially big concern under the Trump administration, which
made it a strategic priority to shore up a domestic manufacturing base
and increasingly identified "economic security" as a fundamental
building block of national security. This view can be found in the most
recent US National Security Strategy (NSS) [the physical separation of
network infrastructure, the banning of platforms outside of Chinese
control, and widespread censorship and manipulation of the remaining
content.]{.underline}10 However, the previous principled opposition of
the US to such moves and its advancement of a different, much more open
vision for internet governance makes it striking that its current policy
seems to follow very similar premises. A similar point can be made over
the economic security concept at the heart of the 2017 NSS. In the late
1990s, Chinese scholars had begun to advance a very similar framework
that was named identically, explored many of the same concerns and
shared the overall view that strategic competition between states would
ultimately be settled through an economic-technological race.11
Specifically suggested policies, like building and protecting a national
innovation base, or developing independent world-class capabilities in
the IT sector, both inspired [[China's]{.mark} subsequent [innovation
strat]{.mark}egy and are [now being mirrored in US security
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[This]{.mark} bilateral [dynamic]{.mark}
is a particularly troubling aspect of securitization, since it [creates
an imperative to match the other side's policies or risk a competitive
disadvantage]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[By]{.mark} simultaneously
[embracing this line of thinking, the US and China have entered a
new]{.mark} kind of [security dilemma, marked by]{.mark} a
[tech]{.mark}nological rather than a military arms race.]{.underline}
Clashes over fundamentally incompatible political agendas and visions of
world orders may have contributed to the unfolding US-China
confrontation, but this is an aspect in which [[their increasing
similarity is the problem.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Automated Weapons (Drones)

#### The 1AC's call to integrate AI into military operations accelerates the efficiency of warfare while relying on racist stereotypes to construct and identify threats -- that increases instability and generates the justification for endless war -- voting neg challenges calls to militarize AI and invests instead in diplomacy to de-escalate tensions

**Suchman, 2020**

Lancaster University, "Algorithmic warfare and the reinvention of
accuracy," Critical Studies on Security, Vol. 8, Iss. 2, 2020, pp.

The [discourse surrounding Project Maven]{.underline} overwhelmingly
[begs the question of the criteria by which 'objects' are identified as
imminent threats.]{.underline} Just what constitutes the profile of an
'ISIS pickup truck' (Peniston 2017), and what were the 38 categories
used by those who hand-labelled 150,000 images to form the initial
training data set? Most pressingly, [what does it mean to be living
under drones, where the presence of what is seen by the US apparatus as
'abnormal activity']{.underline} (Weisgerberger 2017) [might at any
point trigger]{.underline} the [identification of a threat and attack
from weapons operating outside the range of one's own
perception]{.underline} (Cavallaro, Sonnenberg, and Knuckey 2012)? [The
project demands that we turn our attention to the highly problematic
systems of classification by which categories like 'Islamic State
militants']{.underline} operating in Iraq, Syria, Somalia and other
areas of US strategic interest [are constituted]{.underline}. Even [more
urgently, it calls on us to question the premise that those categories
are pre-existing and stable and that their members exist independently
of the classificatory schemes that identify them]{.underline}, or of
classification's violent consequences (see Bowker and Star 1999).

At some point down the road, according to Shanahan, the goal is to put
the Project Maven technology 'at the edge,' on the drones themselves
(Weisgerberger 2017). [Analyses of the use of remotely-controlled weapon
systems should begin to make clear,]{.underline} however, [the further
problems inherent in the project of untethering these systems from their
human controllers]{.underline}, which military technophiles take as the
next logical step in the automation of warfare. Inescapably, [the actual
situations in which weapons are used are fraught with
uncertainties]{.underline}. That these give rise to misrecognition on
the part of human combatants could be -- and has been -- cited as the
rationale for further automation of target identification. But if we
look carefully at the circumstances surrounding documented incidents, it
becomes clear that [however]{.underline} tragically [prone to misreading
actual situations of contemporary 'irregular warfare' might be, the
premise that they could be specified algorithmically is indefensible.
There is no technological solution to this problem.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Interrogating the Cold War logics of nuclear deterrence, Mackenzie
(1990) has effectively opened up for us the black box of weapons
targeting, and elucidated the contingent accomplishment of accuracy as a
fact. In the case of strategic nuclear missiles, accuracy involved
stabilising mathematical calculations of the trajectory that would be
followed by a missile once released from its silo. The [reinvention of
accuracy]{.underline} in the case of so-called counterterrorism
operations [has worked to elide the difference between the precision
with which a weapon]{.underline}, [once fired, will strike its target,
and the acts of identification of legitimate threats that targeting
presupposes.]{.underline}

[Insofar as the 'becoming weapon' of perception is tied to the
identification of an Other as threat, this process long predates modern
weaponry.]{.underline} A question for us to pursue, then, is just what
are the particular apparatuses of recognition that comprise contemporary
military discourses and technologies? How does the current 'threat'
become recognisable, as specifically situated persons, embodied and
emplaced? [As military perceptions become more deeply imbricated with
weaponry]{.underline}, it is also clear that [the elaboration of
weaponry is characterised]{.underline} not by a corresponding
sophistication in military visualities, but rather [by ever more
reliance on]{.underline} still [crude classificatory systems of
racial/ethnic stereotyping and profiling. The cross hair of the weapon
is deeply implicated in the objectification of its target.]{.underline}
Yet [as long as the 'accuracy' of the weapon is measured by the relation
of lethal force to its designated object, the most vital question is
left outside of the frame.]{.underline} Whether for a guided missile
system, or the final actions of a suicide bomber, the fundamental
question is how a target comes to be designated as such in the first
instance, and within what regimes of historic injury and future
accountability.

The [operational trope of 'situational awareness' is a core doctrine for
military command and control.]{.underline} [Taking a commitment to
situational awareness seriously opens generative lines of
critique]{.underline} -- critique [that needs to be taken
seriously]{.underline} as well [by those committed to military doctrine
and operations]{.underline} (see de Goede 2020; Austin, Bellanova, and
Kaufmann 2019). My aim in this paper has been to contribute to the wider
body of scholarship devoted to understanding more deeply how
technologies of militarism enrol their subjects and create their
objects. The circuits that connect the apparatuses that I have discussed
are the [fantasies of recognition and]{.underline} the [practices of
dehumanisation]{.underline} that [have shaped the politics of militarism
since the advent of modern war fighting]{.underline}. These become ever
more dangerous [in the contemporary moment]{.underline}, as [the figure
of the 'imminent threat' is expanded into a horizon of anywhere and of
endless war]{.underline}, and in that way [actions taken in the name of
defence by the US and its allies become a truly imminent threat to
others.]{.underline} [The promise of algorithmic warfare is a
technological solution to the infamous 'fog of war,]{.underline}' taking
the speed that automation enables as a proxy for the validity of the
analyses that result. [Rather than]{.underline} further [accelerate the
speed of warfighting, we need to challenge proclamations of an
inevitable AI arms race and redirect investment to innovations in
diplomacy and social justice that might truly de-escalate the current
threats]{.underline} -- both geopolitical and planetary -- to our
collective security.

### Disease -- COVID

#### The 1AC's approach to disease security is underpinned by a racialized politics of insecurity that fails to respond to future pandemics and naturalizes racist assumptions that inform Western pandemic responses

**Pan, 2021**

(Chengxin, Associate Professor of International Relations at the School
of Humanities and Social Sciences at Deakin University, "Racialised
politics of (in)security and the COVID-19 Westfailure," Critical Studies
on Security, Vol. 9, Iss. 1, 2021, pp. 40-45,
https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2021.1904195, accessed 7/2/2022, ZW)

[Mainstream security theory and practice]{.underline} (methodologies)
[consist in a highly racialised IR
epistemology-cum-ontology.]{.underline} These [three imbricated
layers]{.underline} together [provide]{.underline} a [crucial
context]{.underline} [within which the West's interpretations of and
responses to COVID]{.underline}-19 [need to be understood]{.underline}.
[First]{.underline}, the [racialised politics of
(in)security]{.underline} has [allowed many in the West to intuitively
associate the threat of coronavirus]{.underline} ontologically [with the
'zone of insecurity']{.underline}, particularly the 'yellow people'.
[Initially identified in China, COVID]{.underline}-19 [was quickly
ontologised]{.underline}, perhaps subconsciously by many, [as a disease
of non-whites, Asians, and particularly Chinese]{.underline}, possibly
due to their seemingly unhygienic and even inhumane practices such as
the 'wet market'. In a UC Berkeley's Health Services Center 'managing
fears and anxiety' informational post on Instagram in early 2020,
xenophobia towards Asian people was listed as a 'normal reaction'
(Hussain 2020).

Meanwhile, [locating the virus threat in the 'zone of insecurity' also
evokes a (false) sense of security and immunity among those who think
they safely reside in the 'zone of security']{.underline}. [At the
G20]{.underline} Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in
Riyadh [in]{.underline} late February [2020]{.underline}, the topic of
[COVID]{.underline}-19 [came up but European countries were not
interested]{.underline}. An indifferent Italian representative allegedly
said that 'We have nothing to do with it \[COVID-19\]. It is a yellow
people's disease, not ours' (Jiang 2020). Repeatedly calling the
coronavirus the 'China virus', US President Donald Trump wasn't
concerned either: 'you have 15 people \[in the US\], and the 15 within a
couple of days is going to be down to close to zero'. In other words,
such diseases would be unlikely to take hold in the 'zone of security'.
To be sure, [not all Western political and opinion leaders buy the
racist narrative on COVID]{.underline}-19 [and, while some did, it
happened mostly during the early stage of the pandemic.
However]{.underline}, in the fight [against a rapidly spreading
pandemic]{.underline}, such [initial ontological
misperceptions]{.underline} could and [have proven very
costly.]{.underline}

[Second, when the coronavirus]{.underline} inevitably [spread to the
'zone of security', many]{.underline} (certainly not all) [Western
measures in controlling the pandemic closely followed the predictable
script of]{.underline} some [racialised methodologies of security and
biopolitics]{.underline}. The [Trump administration was quick to seal
its southwestern border and deport thousands of migrants]{.underline} in
an attempt to prevent the 'import' of coronavirus from 'elsewhere',
[while]{.underline} in fact [its deportation policy contributed to
exporting cases to]{.underline} countries like [Mexico, Haiti and
Guatemala]{.underline}. Earlier, it also implemented a travel ban on the
entry of Chinese nationals. Australia and other Western countries
quickly followed suit. [Even as case numbers surged in Western
countries]{.underline} such as Italy, Spain, and the US, [there was a
strong reluctance to apply the travel ban within the Western 'zone of
security']{.underline}. Dr Norman Swan, presenter of the Australian
broadcaster ABC's Health Report, attributed the reluctance to the factor
of 'politics' (Zhou and Xiao 2020). Yet no ordinary politics, th[is is
racialised biopolitics informed by the aforementioned racialised
ontology of (in)security]{.underline}.

[A third important dimension of the]{.underline} COVID-19 [Westfailure
has to do with epistemic racism]{.underline}, [which defines the 'zone
of insecurity' in terms of its perceived inability to know]{.underline}
(or even count). [Those in such a zone are believed to have little to
offer in the way of credible expertise or knowledge]{.underline}. 'Can
we trust Chinese Covid-19 science?', reads the title of a Guardian
article that, while paying lip service to the merit of Chinese research
(on COVID-19), made sure to mention every possible reason to be
suspicious of 'Chinese' science: from its authoritarian regime,
censorship, human rights abuse, and ambition for global science
dominance to academic fraud, intellectual property theft, and lax
approaches to research ethics (Spinney 2020). The same concerns prompted
the Australian media to ask a similar question: 'Can we trust a Chinese
vaccine?'

The [mistrust of non-Western knowledge and experience]{.underline},
among other things, [saw strong Western resistance to wearing
face-masks]{.underline}, at least in the initial phase of the pandemic.
A common practice in Asia, [mask-wearing was seen as mostly associated
with diseases and reflective of Asians' 'herd mentality']{.underline}
that [is 'ingrained into their cultural psyche in a way it isn't
here']{.underline} (Elliott 2020). Western leaders and medical experts
only began to encourage mask-wearing after they eventually felt
satisfied that there was now enough accumulative scientific evidence
(McCabe 2020). Never mind much earlier evidence in Chinese research,
which helped shape China's national policy response to the COVID-19
(including mandatory use of face-masks in public areas) from the start
of February 2020. A later Cambridge-led study published in the journal
Nature Medicine arrived at similar findings, but it did not mention the
earlier Chinese discovery. The explanation of the lead researcher of the
Cambridge team is telling: the quality of the Chinese study 'was not at
the standards that we were comfortable to cite or rely on
scientifically' (Chen 2020).

Indeed, [while Western responses seemed to be based on scientific
evidence, Chinese responses were almost invariably labelled 'draconian',
'excessive', 'flat-out backward', and 'dystopian']{.underline} (Johnson
2020), [or simply referred to as 'Xi Jinping's tactics']{.underline}
(Birtles 2020). By definition, [such tactics would be anathema to
Western scientific and democratic sensibilities.]{.underline} In their
policy recommendations to the government, [British scientists initially
did not even consider a Wuhan-style lockdown an option, citing that it
'would never be acceptable in a democracy like the UK']{.underline}
(Grey and MacAskill 2020).

Conclusion

[Most studies of racism in international security have
focused]{.underline}, and [rightly]{.underline} so, o[n its violence and
injustice imposed on the racialised Others]{.underline} (see other
contributions in this Forum). [But]{.underline} as this piece has
illustrated, the [racialised politics of (in)security is a double-edged
sword, not only]{.underline} often [traumatising the weak and the
disadvantaged in the 'zone of insecurity', but also]{.underline} (albeit
less often, certainly less often acknowledged) [inflicting damage in the
'zone of security' itself]{.underline}, particularly in terms of the
necropolitical economic consequences for those racial and intersectional
Others within (Mbembe 2003; Scauso et al. 2020). [Thanks to the highly
racialised frameworks]{.underline} [and strategies]{.underline}, [many
Western countries have mistaken the racialised Others for the source of
the transnational threat of COVID]{.underline}-19, [adopted racist
half-measures that are ineffective]{.underline}, [and failed to learn
valuable lessons and experiences from the Others who have traditionally
been dismissed as civilisationally and scientifically inferior and
backward.]{.underline} Yet, the self-serving [racial
boundaries]{.underline} [between the imagined zones of security and
insecurity offer no defence against a virus]{.underline} that neither
recognises nor operates along colour lines. Various lessons could and
should be learned from the pandemic, but Western security experts and
policymakers would do well to critically reflect on the ontological,
epistemological, and methodological myths, blind spots, and dangers of
their racialised regime of truth. [If anything positive was to come out
of the disastrous failures, it would entail radically re-imagining
security/insecurity in a post-COVID and posthuman world.]{.underline}

### China -- Economic Competition

#### Threat construction unfairly justifies a [victim story]{.underline} that US policymakers use to justify radical and extreme policy action

**Yuan and Fu, 20** (Zhengqing Yuan, Senior Fellow at the Institute of
World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Qiang
Fu, Associate Professor at the School of Foreign Studies of Central
University of Finance and Economics, 10 July, 2020, Chinese Journal of
International Politics,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/13/3/419/5869540?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

However, it should be noted that, in the original Greek text, Thucydides
himself does not explain the war as a structural mindset. It is Allison
who inserts a structural frame when emplotting the war, one that
perfectly captures in people's minds the schema of a rising power and
the ruling power, thus contributing to its popularity.108 This
structural interpretation of Sino--US relations and the world arena is,
at best, just one of the possible ways of narrating the reality. Other
alternatives, like 'a new model of major-power relationship' or 'a
community of shared future for mankind', can also tell a coherent story
with the same facts. For example, through the lens of 'a community of
shared future for mankind', [[the AIIB and the B]{.mark}elt and
[R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative [can be seen as evidence of the public
goods China offers towards achieving with the world common
prosperity]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[whereas through the lens of the
Thucydides Trap]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they would be rendered
as]{.underline}]{.mark} evidence of [[China's move to replace American
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}. As is explained in the theoretical
section, threat stories can be self-fulfilling. Once the story of power
competition between a rising power and a ruling power is accepted,
people will depend on it to make sense of the world and take actions. In
other words, [[the focus of US policy towards China turns from engaging
with China to preparing for the worst.]{.mark} [China
is]{.mark}]{.underline} first and foremost [[perceived as an economic
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} that presents a global challenge.
[[Most]{.mark} of this [discourse falls under two]{.mark} kinds of
[narrative template: one where China challenges US economic
heg]{.mark}emony; [the other]{.mark} story [of victimhood in which the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has suffered huge job
loss]{.mark}es]{.underline}, a serious decline in its manufacturing
industries, and an enormous trade deficit due to China's unfair trade
practices and competition. These two modes of narration are two sides of
the same coin which differ only in their emphases. One the one hand,
China is an economic challenger. China's challenge in hightech sectors
is a salient node of the threat discourse network. Traditionally, the
United States has taken technological leadership to be an indispensable
feature of its hegemonic identity, as it signifies both cultural
superiority and a guarantee of US economic prosperity and military
superiority.109 But now [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
increasingly [believes that]{.mark}]{.underline} its economic
competitiveness is under serious threat from China's advance in
high-tech industries. What most alarms Americans is China's high-tech
initiatives, especially the 'Made in China 2025'. A 2019 senate
committee report chaired by Senator Marco Rubio articulates that
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}'s 'Made in China 2025' [[seeks to be 'the
global leader in innovation and manufacturing']{.underline}]{.mark}, and
that such a goal '[[would be an unacceptable outcome for American
workers']{.underline}]{.mark}.110 Another significant node of China's
economic challenge discourse network is that of China's challenge to the
world economic order dominated by the United States. According to
[[these stories]{.underline}]{.mark}, as China's economy continues to
grow, China will rewrite the existing rules of the world economy and
reshape the international political economy in a way that favours its
interests. For example, China's proposal to reform the current
international monetary system is perceived as challenging dollar
hegemony, and the newly established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
is interpreted as a move to replace the US-led World Bank and
International Monetary Fund. On the other hand, the discourse
[[tell]{.underline}]{.mark}s the story [[of US
victimhood]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similar to what the revisionists did in
1980s, [[proponents]{.mark} of China threats also [invoke a victim story
to make sense of China's economic rise and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tate[s' underperformance]{.mark} in competition with
China]{.underline}. President [Trump is a major advocate]{.underline} of
this story. In his State of the Union address in 2019, he said: 'We are
now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our
industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American
jobs and wealth has come to an end'.111 In crafting this story, many
negative images and memories of China, in American novels and movies,
have been cashed in on, and '[[China the thief']{.mark} [and]{.mark}
'China the [manipulator']{.mark} are now [two widely used narrative
templates]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Within the metaphorical frame of
'thief']{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Chinese]{.mark} government agencies and
[companies]{.mark} have proactively engaged in economic and industrial
espionage that has [cause]{.mark}d [huge]{.mark} economic [losses for
American corporations and]{.mark} great harm to [their economic
competitiveness]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, an investigation
report by the Office of the United States Trade Representative in 2018
states that China is the most active actor in economic espionage, having
gained 'unauthorised access to a wide range of commercially-valuable
business information'.112 Notably, [[cyber theft and intellectual
property theft are the most common memes in the
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the manipulator narrative, meanwhile,
China exercises unfair trade practices through manipulating exchange
rates, monetary policy, subsidies, etc. to promote exports and restrict
imports, resulting in the failure of American companies, an enormous
trade deficit, and immense job losses; and at the same time, China
manipulates its economy through such measures as industry policy, market
access restriction, forced technology transfers, and government
procurement, among others. A 2018 White House report states that, in
order to dominate high-tech industries, the Chinese government has
carried out industrial policy though state-sponsored theft, forced
technology transfers, economic coercion, information harvesting, and
statebacked investment in high technologies.113 As to the '[[thief' and
'manipulator' tales about China]{.underline}]{.mark}, such stories [[can
also blind people]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, the
[[allegations]{.underline}]{.mark} of China's currency manipulation and
forced technology transfers [[may to a large extent be apocryphal or at
least exaggerated]{.underline}]{.mark}, and rather than being made
victims, US companies benefit from China, as even certain hawks have
noticed that 'Americans are investing more in China' amid the trade war.

[This literature review illustrates how [China has been securitized
because of ideological and perceptional
differences.]{.mark}]{.underline} The literature demonstrates how the
BRI has been securitized but not explicitly because of ideological and
perceptional differences, rather there is more of a focus on the
economic impact of China's policy. [While Singh (2020) and Almén et al's
(2021) highlight the BRI's debt-trap issue, [there is substantial
controversy concerning the legitimacy of the debt-trap
threat.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, by using securitization theory
focused on post structural aspects as Song (2015) demonstrates, [we can
gain a deeper recognition of the performative aspect of [speech acts
and]{.mark} if [securitizing actors legitimize the]{.mark} debt trap
[narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Post structural 10
securitization theory, as noted by Hansen (2011: 358), 'may enable a
more critical engagement with the politics of security', for example,
the power-knowledge nexus and the ways in which discourses on security
construct the objects of which they speak. This thesis contends with the
reviewed literature that China has been securitized. However, the aim of
this thesis is to demonstrate the distinctiveness of poststructural
securitization theory in analyzing the perceptions and ideological
differences concerning the BRI. Scholarly analyses have mainly focused
on the economic and military sectors of security in relation to the
threat China presents, therefore examining the differences in ideology
and perceptions in relation to the BRI and American strategy aspects
outlined by Chengqiu (2020) will aid in determining what other security
sectors are affected. 3. [Theoretical Framework In order to answer the
research question "How do [speech acts contribute to the securitization
of China]{.mark}?",]{.underline} it is necessary to discuss
securitization theory developed by the Copenhagen School. This theory
has been widely used in previous research concerning China, and
therefore it is advantageous for this thesis to widen the understanding
of how discourse concerning the BRI has been connected to security
through the process of securitization. Additionally, Hansen expands
securitization theory by (re)adding elements of poststructuralism. This
part of the thesis has two purposes: first, laying the foundation for
this thesis' operational framework of poststructural securitization, and
secondly for the utilization of it in the analysis chapter. 3.1
Securitization Theory In Buzan, Wæver, and Jaap's (1998) revolutionary
book Security: A New Framework for Analysis, they address two conceptual
developments: sectoral analysis and Wæver's concept of securitization.
Securitization involves framing an issue as 'a special kind of politics
or as above politics' (Buzan et al, 1998: 23), therefore can be viewed
as a 'more extreme form of politicization' (ibid). One of the
distinguishing features of this theory is the framing of a subject as an
existential threat and a 'specific rhetorical structure' (ibid), as in
if the problem is not addressed quickly, it will be too late and we will
not be able to rectify it. Securitization places emphasis on speech acts
which assume that speeches are not only to express an idea or present
information but also to perform an action. [[Speech acts]{.mark} also
[illustrate the power knowledge nexus. 'We are subject to the production
of truth through power]{.mark} and we cannot 11 exercise power except
through the production of truth. [Thus the production of a truth, or the
creation of knowledge through a discourse, is an exercise of
power.']{.mark} (Ibrahim, 2005: 164). [Therefore, the]{.mark}
securitizing [actor performing a speech act is exercising power over the
intended audience.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, securitization theory
has been subject to many criticisms. It has been critiqued for being too
static and not being able to take on the developments in the security
field, Derrida criticized securitization for being too strict in
evaluating the success of the speech act, and Howell and
Richter-Montpetit (2019) have even criticized it for being Eurocentric
and racist. Hansen (2011) recognized the shortcomings of Buzan et al's
(1998) work and expanded on it by (re)adding elements of
poststructuralism. In a sense, it is re-adding poststructural elements
because securitization and speech act are rooted in poststructuralism.

### China -- Great Power Competition

#### The hegemonic position of the US in the squo and expansion of Chinese ideology has lead to securitization of the "Chinese Threat" 

Gilkey, **Qiana**, 20**22**, (Malmö University, Faculty of Culture and
Society (KS), Department of Global Political Studies (GPS).) \"How do
speech acts contribute to the securitization of China?: A critical
discourse analysis of perceptional and ideological differences in
American discourse vis-à-vis the Belt and Road Initiative.,\" DIVA,

[[The hegemonic position held by America]{.mark} and its position in the
international system as a dominant state [is central to its
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Fukuyama's (1989) article noted, the
collapse of the Soviet Union shaped American identity as a global
hegemon, an example of them as a leading Western liberal and democratic
state, and a state which aims to spread liberal and democratic values.
The US perceives its hegemonic position, therefore its core identity, as
being threatened by China. [[The]{.mark} previous subsections have
demonstrated how there has been a rise in [securitizing
discourse]{.mark} regarding the BRI which affects multiple sectors, not
solely the economic and military sectors. The analysis also demonstrates
the role that conflicting ideologies play in securitizing speech
acts.]{.underline} [While [explicitly stating that China is]{.mark}
[using the BRI to actively spread its authoritarian and communist
values]{.mark} in the economic sector, [the analysis shows how]{.mark}
the [perceived ideological expansion]{.mark} [and perceived
threats]{.mark} further [contribute to]{.mark} the
[securitization]{.mark} [of China and the construction of the 'China
threat']{.mark}]{.underline}. The securitization of China is in no way a
new and untouched subject of study, however, the use of
poststructuralism has been underutilized. The aim of this thesis was to
explore how securitization regarding the BRI also includes differences
in ideologies and perceptions, as ample research has mainly focused on
the economic, military, and strategic elements. The use of Fairclough's
three-dimensional model along with the theoretical framework developed
by Hansen has been used to highlight the perceptional and ideological
differences which play key roles in the securitization of China. [It
also reveals the latent power relations and how the discourse by US
elites reproduces these unequal power relationships.]{.underline} The
method and theoretical framework were chosen to explore how historical
context and social contexts at a specific period in time affect speech
acts. [The articles reviewed mainly focus on the economic and military
sectors, and while this is acknowledged to play a substantial role, the
ideological differences have shown to also securitize the political and
societal sectors as well]{.underline}. The inclusion of more sectors
provides a more robust and deeper understanding of the securitization
process and how it contributes to the further securitization of China.
The addition of poststructuralism contributes to the security field by
emphasizing different ontologies and epistemologies, which only serves
to deepen the understanding of the securitization process and if it will
be successful or not. It also allows us to understand why US-Sino
relations have been strained and how this can affect the current
international system dominated by Western liberal and democratic
concepts. [The guiding argument was that differences in ideologies and
perceptions contribute to the securitization of China]{.underline}. In
the analysis, we can clearly note the increase in securitizing language
being utilized by political elites over the years. This may be due to
the change in the presidency or the fact that the BRI was implemented
over a longer period, nonetheless, [there is a clear correlation in how
the discourse has framed China as a threat in a more obvious
way.]{.underline} The language has also reflected the rising inclusion
of the general public. [[The historical construction of]{.mark} the
[American identity]{.mark} in the international system [has]{.mark} been
[shown]{.mark} to contextualize [how their identity being
threatened]{.mark} [plays a]{.mark} more [considerable role]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} why there is an [escalation of securitizing
discourse]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Securitizing]{.mark} the BRI,
therefore further securitizing [China as a whole]{.mark}, [is
advantageous to the US as these efforts]{.mark} will [assist in
preserving the]{.mark} current [s]{.mark}tatus [quo,]{.mark} therefore
[retaining their unipolar and hegemonic identity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### US narrative and [threat construction]{.underline} justifies extreme policies, creates an "Self" vs "Others" scenario which is dangerous

**Yuan and Fu, 20** (Zhengqing Yuan, Senior Fellow at the Institute of
World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Qiang
Fu, Associate Professor at the School of Foreign Studies of Central
University of Finance and Economics, 10 July, 2020, Chinese Journal of
International Politics,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/13/3/419/5869540?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

Rather than the rationalist approach to national security, [[we adopt a
narrative approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to unravelling the narrative
process whereby national threats are constructed. Having encountered
three successive national rivals since WWII, [[the United States has
constructed]{.underline}]{.mark} three distinctive [[threat stories to
safeguard its hegemonic identity]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Soviet threat
consists in the story of two ideologically opposed rivals competing for
world domination; the Japan-bashing narrative tells a victimhood story
stemming from Japan's unfair competition. [[China threat
stories]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, are now more complex,
[[conflating a story of US victimhood at the hands of China's unfair
competition, advocated by]{.mark} President [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline},
with a widely embedded but malleable epic tale of power competition
between a rising power and the ruling power, and a new, 'deep state'
defence community-propagated Cold War script. All these threat stories
have framed what is perceived and what should be done, but they are
merely those from among other alternative narratives that eventually
gained a dominant position at critical junctures. These [[so called
national threats are hence no more than narrative constructs in a
self-other manner of articulation rather than one of objective
existence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Upon examining the narrative templates
of US threat stories, we find striking differences among them. The
Soviet threat spectrum ranges from the ideological to the political and
military domains, and economic challenge is the focus of the Japan
threat. But China represents the full spectrum of threats that
previously featured in both the Soviet threat story and the
Japan-bashing narrative. Upon zooming in, we further find that an
ideological conflict constitutes the main thread of the Soviet threat
storyline, but that the economic challenge of the China threat outweighs
the ideological and political ones. On the political front, the Soviet
Union's totalitarian dictatorship is the polar opposite of liberal
democracy, while China is often styled as an authoritarian state---a far
less antagonistic wording. As to military threats, the Soviet threat is
urgent and global, but the China threat is only a rising and regional
one. To counter the economic challenge emanating first from Japan and
then from China, the United States adopted different strategies to
construct its victimhood story, namely, coining new concepts for Japan,
and cashing in on stereotypes for China. In spite of the above-marked
differences, however, we can also clearly discern continuity in the
United States' national threat stories. This is reflected not only in
the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [consistently]{.mark} [resorting
to the victimhood narrative]{.mark}]{.underline} to counter economic
challenges from both Japan and China, and unremittingly [[cashing in
on]{.underline}]{.mark} its widely-shared mythologies and [[images
regarding the Self and Others]{.underline}]{.mark} to achieve resonance,
but also, more revealingly, in the underlying logic of US national
threat-making. The United States will invariably adopt a zero-sum
mindset in making a diametrical self-other story for any country---be it
a formidable power with an antagonistic ideology like the Soviet Union,
an ally like Japan, or a rising peer competitor like China---that might
threaten its hegemonic identity. According to this logic, the American
Self is always superior to Others, and articulating the threat confirms
its superiority. Not surprisingly, when Others, like Japan or China,
challenge its economic primacy, the United States, rather than examining
its own problems, will always blame such others for playing an 'unfair
game'. This paper also provides us with a vantage point to appreciate
the current debate on Sino--US relations. Clearly, we are in the second
half of the critical juncture wherein the question is not whether the
United States and China will compete with each other but in which way
the competition will unfold, for the bankruptcy of the liberal
international order discourse makes it unlikely to revert to
yesteryear's policy of engagement. As the three narrative threads of the
China threat stories all point to competition and conflict, and can be
self-fulfilling, we may witness increasing tensions between them.
Specifically, the Japan-bashing victimhood story can shed considerable
light on our understanding of Trump's China policy. We find that the
story President Trump advocates to a large extent matches the victimhood
story that the revisionists concocted to deal with Japan in the 1980s.
Trump's rhetoric regarding unfair trade and industry targeting, slapping
of trade tariffs amounting to blackmail on both China and US allies,
resultsoriented approach to trade negotiation, and the US high-tech
stranglehold that curbs or bars investment in the industry by US
competitors can all be found in the Japan threat story toolbox. Having
pivoted China policy towards conflict, however, there are few
indications that Trump wants to act out a Cold War script. In accordance
with the storytelling logic, should Trump retain his presidency in the
coming election, the trade war will probably not end in a 'fair' trade
agreement until such time as the US economy far outperforms China's,
because US superiority entails outperformance, failing which the blame
must go on unfair play. That is what happened to Japan, that is to say,
successive rounds of sanctions and negotiations until Japan drifted into
the Lost Decade. [[China may, moreover, face even greater US hostility
to its high-tech industry and investment]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
happened in 1980s. These are issues that China's political nature and
growing military may further complicate. But it should be noted that
China is not Japan and will neither give in easily as Japan did nor pose
a solely economic challenge to the United States. The Soviet threat
story also offers insight. Indeed, a new Cold War rhetoric is rising in
Sino--US relations narratives in the United States. Hawks in the US
defence community, among them congressman like Senators Rick Scott and
Marco [[Rubio]{.underline}]{.mark}, former officials like John
[[Bolton]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to some extent even Vice President
Mike [[Pence]{.underline}]{.mark} and Secretary of State Mike
[[Pompeo]{.underline}]{.mark}, have [[all contributed to the rise of a
Cold War mentality]{.underline}]{.mark}. The effect of this Cold War
rhetoric is apparent in government policy, such as the barring of visits
from certain Chinese scholars and treating Chinese news media as
'foreign missions'. Although this new Cold War script may sensationalise
and aggravate the already deteriorated Sino--US relations, unless major
events or crises occur, it seems unlikely to become a grand dominant
narrative in the near future. This is partly due to the fact that China,
unlike the Soviet Union, does not export Communism, so what [[Americans
are agonising]{.underline}]{.mark} most [[about]{.underline}]{.mark} now
is [[China's catching up]{.underline}]{.mark} and the United States'
relatively underperforming economy. Moreover, quite apart from China's
refusal to accept and act on such a script, China has become deeply
embedded in the world economy, and its trading partners have little
incentive to contain China. The future dominant threat story is hence
likely to be a hybrid one that allows cooperation while being open to
confrontation.

#### Threat construction portrays China as a political threat---justifying extreme policy action

**Yuan and Fu, 20** (Zhengqing Yuan, Senior Fellow at the Institute of
World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Qiang
Fu, Associate Professor at the School of Foreign Studies of Central
University of Finance and Economics, 10 July, 2020, Chinese Journal of
International Politics,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/13/3/419/5869540?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

[[American hawks]{.mark},]{.underline} especially those of the 'deep
state' intelligence and defence community, [[advocate a new Cold War
script where China constitutes a]{.mark} progressively serious
[political threat.]{.mark} This [rhetoric has been on the rise]{.mark}
over the last couple of years. In the first place, [an existential
threat is the ideologically and politically antithetical
Other]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[To American hawks, China is]{.mark} an
[authoritarian]{.mark} regime]{.underline} under Communist one-party
rule, [[which]{.mark} in itself [constitutes an existential threat
to]{.mark} the free [democracy]{.mark} of the United
States]{.underline}. For example, the 2017 US National Security Strategy
states that China 'spreads features of its authoritarian system'.115
This mindset is even more apparent in an open letter from former
military officials, scholars, and other conservative China watchers to
President Trump in 2019, in which they emphasise that China and its
Communist party are an existential threat to US values and the US-led
world order.116 Meanwhile, it should be noted that although there is a
rising rhetoric on ideological differences, it is more about China's
political system itself than the expansive nature of communism so often
promoted in the Soviet threat story. In the second place, there is the
China Model. In this frame, China represents an authoritarian
capitalism, and its great economic success offers other countries an
alternative model. This constitutes a challenge to the United States'
free democratic market economy model in the global order. The Worldwide
Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community released by the
Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats in 2019 bluntly points
out that China will more actively 'seek to assert China's model of
authoritarian capitalism as an alternative' for other countries to the
Washington Consensus, which may 'threaten international support for
democracy, human rights, and the rule of law'; also that China's Belt
and Road Initiative is a platform to expand China's 'global economic,
political, and military reach' and 'diminish US influence'.117 In the
third place is the whole-of-society threat. [[In this hawkish portrayal,
China is taking advantage of the United States']{.mark} open environment
and political loopholes to gain economic, political, and military
benefits, thus threatening US security from the inside.]{.underline}
Although this mode of thought has long existed in the China threat
discourse, the 'whole-of-society threat' concept was coined by FBI
Director Christopher Wray during a Senate hearing in February 2018. He
said that, in order to replace the United States' global leadership,
China employs not only state institutions but also non-traditional
collectors like students and professors to amass intelligence and steal
intellectual property rights, so this is 'not just a whole-of-government
threat, but a whole-of-society threat'.118 This narrative template was
reinforced in Vice President Pence's China policy speech in October
2018, in which he said China was attempting to 'shift American public
opinion and public policy', influence US elections, and fragment
domestic interest groups by 'rewarding or coercing' agents of influence,
such as students, scholars, journalists, and think tanks in the United
States.119 One month after the Pence speech, a report from the Hoover
Institution echoed this frame by detailing how China has employed agents
of influence to influence American domestic politics and policies
towards China.120 [[This narrative was rapidly transposed into
government policy]{.mark}. Over the last two years, [the visas of
certain Chinese scholars have been withdrawn]{.mark}, [a number of
Chinese Confucius Institutes closed]{.mark}, and the [enrolment of
Chinese students]{.mark} in certain key areas [has also clearly been
affected.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### China -- Military

#### Unjustified anti-China military rhetoric is overemphasized---fear of China only justifies extreme US policy

**Yuan and Fu, 20** (Zhengqing Yuan, Senior Fellow at the Institute of
World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Qiang
Fu, Associate Professor at the School of Foreign Studies of Central
University of Finance and Economics, 10 July, 2020, Chinese Journal of
International Politics,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/13/3/419/5869540?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

While [both [China and the Soviet Union are narrated as a military
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[China is largely framed as a regional
one]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than a global one. Admiral Philip. S.
Davidson, the Commander of US Indo-Pacific Command said in his statement
before the Senate Armed Services Committee on US Command Posture on 12
February, 2019: 'The PLA is the principal threat to US interests, US
citizens, and our allies inside the First Island Chain'.121 It should be
noted that [[China's **so-called** military threat]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[does not signify that China's forces have]{.mark} surpassed or
[actively challenged US military power]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but rather
that]{.underline}]{.mark} China's military threat arises as long as
[[China can potentially pose a challenge to US military
predominance]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this [[narrative
logic]{.underline}]{.mark}, China's increased military spending,
upgrading and expanding of weapons systems and technologies, and
overseas deployments to protect its commercial interests, or even the
limited access to information on China's military planning are taken as
evidence of China's rising military threat. [[This kind of **hawkish
rhetoric** is widespread in]{.mark} annual [D]{.mark}epartment
[o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense [reports]{.mark} to Congress on China's
military power [and in US Defense Intelligence Agency]{.mark}
[reports]{.mark} on China's Military Power]{.underline}. One notable
feature of the evolving discourse is the growing attention the United
States is paying to the PLA's cyber and nuclear warfare capabilities.

### Climate Change

#### The 1AC is part and parcel of a securitizing climate rhetoric that amplifies ongoing injustice and reinforces the third world as disposable. This contributes to an embedding of Black dispossession of material lands, resources, and demonization of climate refugees in US climate policy. Any attempt to sanitize this process fundamentally downplays a legacy of imperial violence in the name of climate change.

Maintaining the racial order in the green transition

Based on the above analysis, the paper contends that racialized workers
in the US and frontline communities that have historically been exposed
to climate hazards appear to rhetorically afforded certain benefit of
future jobs in the Green transition. However, [through planned and
ongoing US state interventionist and extractive corporatism, the US
continue to contribute to the reproduction of surplus populations in the
Caribbean. **Caribbean societies, tethered to US imperialism** and
hegemony, have become displaced through the latter's]{.underline}
historical actions and [**are seen as new spaces for accumulation and
debt.** Despite United States' patchy record and ambivalence on climate
issues]{.underline} (see Lewin, 2020), the **[Biden Plan indicates that
the US' national security and prosperity are at stake if climate change
envelopes communities and worsens large-scale migration from
abroad]{.underline}** (Biden, 2020). [**President Biden intends to put
an end to countries 'cheating' the United States and employ US financial
(and potentially military) power.** In the Biden Climate Plan, his
administration wishes to:]{.underline}

> [invest in the climate resilience of our military bases and critical
> security infrastructure across the US and the World, to deal with the
> risk of climate change effects, including, including extreme weather
> events that caused over \$8 billion in damage to Department of Defense
> bases in just the last year]{.underline} (Biden, 2020).

Further, like the CCAP, [Biden deems the climate threat]{.underline},
which already causes significant socio-economic and ecological
disruption in the global South, [an investment opportunity to expand
accumulation and 'facilitate commercialization of affordable carbon
capture retrofit technologies for export to the developing
world']{.underline} (House Select Committee on Climate Crisis, 2020:
244; Kerry et al., 2020: 5). These proposals envisage that domestic
investments 'will create jobs for blue-collar workers, including in
fence line communities, help decarbonize American industries, and create
valuable new exports to help mitigate climate change around the world'
(Kerry et al., 2020: 5). Green New Deal proposals equally join in on
this policy chorus. **[Aronoff et al]{.underline}**. (2019: 163) **[wish
to 'prioritize mechanisms to transfer funds and technologies to
countries in the global South to help them cut carbon
emissions]{.underline}**'. As Girvan (1978) has critically argued,
[**such transfers are not benevolent acts of global North players or
themselves costless,** particularly as state capital and transnational
corporations come to exact costs in terms of lost autonomy]{.underline},
inappropriate technology to production methods or on a society's
culture, as well as considerable costs associated with knowledge
acquisition and infrastructure. We can also notice the contradiction
especially on the immigration question related to environmental
calamities. Under the Obama Administration, **[actions towards Haitians
deemed them disposable, unequal racialized others.]{.underline}** In
2010, [after Haiti witnessed a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that killed as
many as 300,000 Haitians, the Obama administration granted temporary
protected status (TPS) to over 100,000 undocumented Haitians in the
United States (Wennersten and Robbins, 2017). They were refused entry as
refugees or asylum seekers which would have granted them a suite of
rights under international law in the United States6]{.underline} (see
Loyd and Mountz, 2018). There was no permanent solution from the Obama
Administration and Congress, even after multiple requests from Haitian
authorities.7 [After category 4 Hurricane Matthew in 2016 devastated the
southern part of the country, destroyed 300,000 homes and killed more
than 800 people in the process, Haitians were further denied protection
and legal recognition]{.underline} (Wennersten and Robbins, 2017).
[Barack Obama's policy was to not accept climate refugees. **Obama
expressed serious concern about a major exodus of immigrants due to
climate change that would constitute a 'serious threat to US national
security'** (Ahmed, 2018: 16). The US Congress Climate Agenda and the
recent climate proposals by Joe Biden continue to depict climate-induced
migration as a security threat:]{.underline} **['The climate crisis
amplifies geopolitical threats as resource scarcity and catastrophic
events fuel conflict, mass migration, and social and political
strife']{.underline}** (House Select Committee on Climate Crisis, 2020:
14). New migrant subjectivities of racialized and gendered groups are
created and must seek routes to boost their resilience (Agostino, 2015;
Baldwin, 2017) to which the homeland defence and national security
systems must respond and inform intelligence plans (House Select
Committee on Climate Crisis, 2020: 15, 507--509). **[The US climate
initiatives thus refer to 'security' and 'a geopolitical threat' at
least 188 and 37 times respectively]{.underline}** (House Select
Committee on Climate Crisis, 2020: 14; White House, 2021b). The cases of
Barbuda after Hurricane Irma and Maria also loom large. Barbuda (the
smaller island of the sovereign state of Antigua and Barbuda) was the
site of immense devastation after the passage of these category five
hurricanes that marooned over 1800 of Barbudans in shelters for several
months on the sister island of Antigua and prompted the Prime Minister
to request international aid (Baptiste and Devonish, 2019; Lightfoot,
2020). [The aftermath was a quagmire, where the Antiguan Prime Minister
Gaston Brown announced plans to offer valuable plots for sale to
billionaire US and Australian real estate moguls to erect a \$200
million-dollar tourist resort against the legal collective claims of
Barbudans to maintain ownership of their communal lands8]{.underline}
(Gould and Lewis, 2018). **[Black dispossession of material lands,
resources, and non-material cultures are thus an evident feature of
these ongoing climate injustices.]{.underline}** Again, category five
Hurricane Dorian in 2019 devastated the Bahamas islands Abaco and Grand
Bahama, resulting in over \$3.4 billion in damages, over 250 fatalities,
damage to over 70,000 homes and displaced 3000 Haitians residing in
informal settlements (Zegarra et al., 2020), not to mention the
uncounted undocumented Haitians whose lives were lost. The Trump
Administration refused protective status under its Temporary Protective
Status programme to newfound 'refugee' Bahamians and Haitians that would
have allowed those displaced by the crisis to seek shelter and support
from relatives in the US. [Trump depicted dispossessed Bahamians and
marginalized Haitian residents in the Bahamas as potentially 'very bad
people' and a country that has 'very bad drug dealers']{.underline}
(Reuters, 2019). Up to that time, Bahamians had been allowed under
regular visa rules to enter the US without a visa by sea or air once
they held a passport or no criminal record. [In the shadows of this
humanitarian crisis, undocumented Haitians residing in a makeshift,
flood prone community called the Mudd in Marsh Habour on Abaco, were
themselves treated poorly by the Bahamian government. As many as 340
undocumented Haitian were deported after accepting the Bahamian
government's vow to support Haitians displaced by the storm
there.]{.underline} **[This episode shows that colonialist and
anti-Black racism also pervades postcolonial states in the sphere of
US-maintained global white supremacy]{.underline}** (see definition of
racism in Gilmore, 2002a, b). [Haitians are persistent subjects to
racialized environmental marginalization characterized by a normative
white supremacy that do not recognize their 'alien' existence. In the
end, the effort to differentiate Caribbean peoples and render them
surplus populations can be seen within the US climate agenda
characterized by racial capitalism.]{.underline} [At one time, Caribbean
societies are considered fertile for 'green' capitalist accumulation by
US authorities, organizers and transnational corporations. The US cannot
deny its longstanding institutional structures and policy agenda are
rooted in anti-Blackness and privilege so-called white working-class
communities. US climate policy and interventions fail to acknowledge its
hegemonic role in maintaining political economic structures that fuel
climate catastrophe in the Caribbean. No interest exists in meaningfully
act on climate debt or reparations from liberal or 'progressive'
quarters]{.underline} (Sheller, 2018). [These contradictions within the
policy architecture and actions abroad may ultimately lead to more
dispossession, inequality, and undermine the needs, self-determination
and liberation of ordinary Caribbean peoples.]{.underline} [Under the
spectre of racial capitalism, US policy-making institutions have
weaponized climate policy for environmental racism abroad. This time,
specifically targeting the 'darker nations', the US' political
establishment has created policy imperatives to maintain the
politico-economic and cultural order by ensuring that immigrants fleeing
climate devastation or facing other form of socio-environmental
instabilities may be impeded from seeking refuge within its borders. The
Global South is in its sights.]{.underline} [The US has deflected from
its responsibility as the principal historical contributor to global
warming and deems it an opportunity for green accumulation.]{.underline}
[**Climate policy outcomes are embedded in a racial capitalist framework
and universally represents 'workers' as white and deserving of
opportunity, wealth and a secure future. In the process, the US has
attempted to downplay its continued imperial record and deny its history
of racial capitalism that is playing out in the context of climate
change.** As temperatures and sea levels rise, hurricanes unleash untold
disaster that differentially affect Caribbean island territories, these
populations may need to find new strategies of resistance and
solidarity. Environmental marginalization and dispossession guarantee
that Caribbean communities will continue their struggle against uneven
political ecologies that seek to undermine Black liberation, impose
additional debt, and comprise their self-determination.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's humanitarian appeal to climate change is not neutral, but permeated by a 'bunkerization' of the aid industry wherein humanitarianism is tied to security actors thus rendering the space of aid intervention a space of security. Their scholarship equivocates disaster with conflict -- the first step in the naturalization and depoliticization of warfare characterized by militarized humanitarianism.

[Military response is also mobilized domestically in response to crises,
often with respect to marginalized and alienated
populations]{.underline} as with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 where the
predominantly black population was targeted by state violence (Smith,
2006), or with Indigenous activism, whether the 1991 Oka crisis in
Canada or the ongoing Dakota pipeline protests in the US (Estes, 2019).
Yet militaries are also undertaking pre-emptive action. For example,
[this is evident in Operation Continuing Promise, launched in 2008 by US
Southern Command, to provide basic medical care to vulnerable
communities in Latin America and the Caribbean in anticipation of
potential future crisis,]{.underline} which Joe [Bryan (2015) has shown
renders humanitarianism as a means of waging war without
end.]{.underline} In this way, **[humanitarian practices and spaces form
a part of a larger geography of war, anticipating and pre-empting future
conflict by deploying militaries in the present.]{.underline}**
[Militaries are also involved in the securitization of channels of
global migration.]{.underline} [Geographers have underlined the ways
that borders,]{.underline} and the work they do, [are extended
internally and externally through appeals to humanitarian care and
control, which paradoxically serves to reinforce and securitize the very
national and regional borders that asylum seekers are trying to
cross]{.underline} (Islemen, 2018; Jones, 2016; Pallister-Wilkins,
2018). Of course, [the securitization and militarization of migration is
not new]{.underline}. [But the technologies of migration management --
and the forms of circumvention or resistance that are mobilized -- are
taking new shape and form.]{.underline} What begins as a 'humanitarian'
operation can quickly devolve into a more interventionist and
militarized operation of capture, containment and control. For example,
[both NATO and the EU have launched military operations in response to
the ongoing refugee crisis in the Mediterranean.]{.underline} Glenda
Garelli and Martina Tazzioli (2018) have argued that although their
stated aim is to protect migrants and disrupt smuggler's networks,
[these missions act to dissuade migration flows through the central and
eastern Mediterranean and disrupt the potential of certain populations
to move through space. Migrants are both the subjects to be saved, and
those who are prevented from travelling -- a phenomenon that is not
limited to Europe]{.underline} (Loyd et al., 2016; Mountz, 2020).
[Recent moves to militarize the response to refugees have been fuelled
by the conflicts and war in Middle East and Africa -- paradoxically, the
means of war are increasingly being used to regulate the consequences of
war --]{.underline} but **[discourses around militarization have also
proliferated with the anticipated rise of 'climate refugees' in response
to climate change]{.underline}** (Gilbert, 2012; Hartmann, 2010). In all
these examples, **[the nexus of militarized-humanitarianism is leading
to more violence, rather than its mitigation]{.underline}**. As Fassin
and Pandolfi (2010: 12) have argued, [disasters and conflict are
rendered equivalent behind the moral discourse of humanitarianism,
prompting military intervention or militarized responses, and leading to
the 'naturalization -- or depoliticization -- of war'.]{.underline}
**[Citizens are turned into 'passive beneficiaries']{.underline}** of
the responsibility to protect, transformed from rights-bearing agents to
'recipients of charity' (Mamdani, 2009: 264). Weizman (2011: 52) has
noted that [the blurring of roles of militaries and humanitarians has
led belligerents 'to construe aid workers as enemies, an integral part
of the occupying force', rendering them more vulnerable to attack and
violence]{.underline} (see also Foley, 2008). In turn, [this has
resulted in]{.underline} what Mark Duffield (2012) has termed a
[bunkerization of the aid industry, with the presence of humanitarian
organizations becoming increasingly fortified in conflict zones, further
tying them to security actors and rendering the space of aid
intervention also a space of security.]{.underline} [This reflects a
hardening of boundaries that characterizes militarized
humanitarianism]{.underline}, with specific spaces of security produced
that reinforce divides between those who save and those who will be
saved. However, as Jennifer Fluri has shown, [attempts to secure the
lives of international aid workers in conflict zones can also render
civilian bodies more vulnerable]{.underline}, for example, through the
disruptions arising from highly securitized compounds, to the violations
of private spaces (Fluri, 2011). Despite these vulnerabilities,
[military engagement in humanitarian response is used to legitimate it
as a force of good, **which obfuscates its lethal force**.]{.underline}
As new crises unfold, **[from disasters caused by climate
change]{.underline}** to health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic, **[geographers will need to continue to interrogate the
militarized responses that are marshalled in the name of
humanitarianism, as they take new shape and form.]{.underline}**

#### Their securitization of climate is a self-fulfilling prophecy

[[A securitizing move involves an existential, life-and-death
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} and its corollary: an extraordinary course
of action as the only way out. Both case studies discussed here ([Table
1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)) show
a dramatic [[securitising]{.underline}]{.mark} move, where [[climate
change was presented as the source of great potential
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} that will harm us all, unless we take urgent
action -- either for mitigation (the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions) or for adaptation (adjusting to climate impacts). In the UK
case, the FCO warned about the security implications of untamed global
warming -- such as climate conflict or mass climate migration -- [[to
persuade the international community]{.underline}]{.mark}, and in
particular the emerging economies, to mitigate their emissions to
prevent these potential security threats. In the Dutch case, [[the
security framing legitimized considerable
interventions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the form of dike reinforcement,
river rehabilitation and defence infrastructure, raising the level of
Lake IJssel in the Central Netherlands, digging a bypass, and moving
huge amounts of sand around ('Building with Nature'). A special Delta
Fund and Delta Commissioner added to the special pleading to counter the
climatic threat. By reducing the number of scenarios and options, and
successfully controlling the 'staging\' ([Hajer et al.,
2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018))
of its public launch, the Delta Commission almost seems a textbook
example of turning the logic of 'choice\' into one of 'necessity\'
([Verduijn et al.,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)).
In the end however the mandate of the Commissioner and the extent of
intervention was seriously curtailed. Our analysis helps us to further
explain discrepancies in climate securitization processes. [Once
successfully placed on the policy agenda]{.underline}, its effect has
been lacklustre in both cases. Whilst endorsing an exceptional
discourse, in both cases the securitizers ultimately sought to endorse
'a rather piecemeal and technocratic approach' ([Methmann and Rothe,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018):
324). [[The UK FCO's securitising move]{.underline}]{.mark} was
strategic and instrumental. Instead of purposefully endorsing,
exceptional measures such as military intervention and martial law, the
agency [[sent apocalyptic warnings to raise the urgency of mitigation
measures.]{.underline}]{.mark} Even its actions within the UN Security
Council seemed mundane, although clothed in alarmist discourse
considered excessive by India and other BRIC countries, risking the
further polarization of the climate debate in the international arena[.
The FCO primarily used the Council as a platform for raising further
awareness, rather than to actually institutionalize climate change
within the UN Security Council, which would have been a more exceptional
move. The Delta Commission did not call for drastic action either.
Instead, the Commission aimed to secure long-term year-on year funding
and legitimacy for infrastructural investments, and was successful in
that striving, if in a watered-down form. In many other countries, a
commitment to infrastructural funding up to 2200 would be considered
absurd. Attrition and erosion inevitably took their toll, but the plans
essentially still stand.]{.underline} Thus, in line with arguments
advanced by scholars such as [Trombetta
(2008)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018),
[Corry
(2012)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)
and [Methmann and Rothe
(2012)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018),
we note the urgent action promoted here is within the everyday realm of
climate policy: the mitigation of GHG emissions via carbon markets,
technological innovation without major implications for the world
economy and raising flood defences against potential sea-level extremes
Our cases furthermore demonstrate the instrumental nature of these
securitizing moves, as carefully planned and developed within policy
settings. As the interview quotes from the UK case in particular show,
the FCO employees promoting the narrative were instrumentally using its
argumentative value for their climate diplomacy efforts, making it
integral to their climate communication strategy. However, both cases
illustrate that security language can but does not necessarily help to
increase the urgency of climate action, particularly if it comes across
as strategic. In the words of one Indian interviewee, interviewed in
relation to India's position as audience to UK's efforts in the UN
Security Council: 'If you want policy to be changed you \[will\] have to
tell people: this is the challenge and this is the policy response for
it and it has to be
believable'.[14](javascript:popRef('fn14-2399654419834018')) Instead,
the FCO's securitising move fuelled further distrust amongst key target
audiences within the UN Security Council debates. It made emerging
countries more sceptical of the UK's intentions on climate change and
felt pressured through scare stories that were unfounded. The lesson
from this case, then, is that a framing has to be genuine and valid for
it to be convincing and successful amongst an already sceptical
audience. [[Furthermore, as the Dutch Delta case demonstrated,
apocalyptic discourses risk fuelling public disengagement with climate
change and promote a sense of fatalism or scepticism leading 'to denial
of the problem and disengagement with the whole issue in an attempt to
avoid the discomfort of contending with it]{.underline}]{.mark}'
([O'Neil and Nicholson-Cole,
2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018):
371). [[In this case, the dramatic imaging of climate change fuelled a
sense of anti-environmentalism and scepticism regarding the likelihood
of extreme weather impacts, such as severe and sudden storms and
sea-level rise]{.underline}]{.mark} (see also [Bettini,
2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018):
69; [Hulme,
2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018):
213; [Lowe et al.,
2006](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)[).
[Exaggerating the gravity of the crisis, the Delta's commission risked
losing its credibility]{.mark} and playing into the hands of hard-line
populist scepticism. In both cases, the security frame backfired like a
'policy boomerang' (]{.underline}[van Buuren and Warner,
2014a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)[).
To conclude, the analysis illustrates that particularly in the domain of
climate change, where the future remains uncertain and many of
discussions focus on issues of risks and potentialities
(]{.underline}[Corry,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)[),
successful securitization is complex. An audience is not easily
persuaded when hearing that something is an urgent threat -- such a
discourse needs to resonate with a context giving some indication that
the doom scenario might come true.]{.underline} The debate on climate
change and security is in many respects 'dominated by its futurology'
([Baldwin et al.,
2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018):
121), making it an easy target for politicians to play on but also a
difficult one to successfully securitize. When there are multiple
audiences, chances are that not all will accept the securitization,
which obtains for both cases. Given the lack of an immediate threat, the
time element inexorably works against climate securitizers. The 'affect'
of climate change ([Protevi,
2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018))
moreover was short-lived as climate change became out-securitized by
economic and immigration concerns in both countries. Climate issues
however have bounced back; these days it seems to have returned to the
global agenda again, as the plight of Syrian refugees has been framed by
some as the shape of things to come in a warmer world ([Le Page,
2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)).
Likewise, natural disasters are increasingly 'climatized' ([Grant et
al.,
2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018);
[Oels,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018)).
Climate security discourse, then, appears to be resilient, attaching
itself with the political 'mood' and state of the political game du
jour. For it to remain on national and international agendas however,
its advocates should be well aware of the danger of 'overselling'

#### The international community has securitized climate change, your evidence is the result of years of fearmongering.

Davoudi (2014) shows how [the social understanding of nature
moved]{.underline} [from]{.underline} nature-asclockwork (Enlightenment)
through [nature-as-finite]{.underline} (Club of Rome, 1970s), through
nature as risk (1990s) [to discourses of global danger and insecurity
caused by nature]{.underline}. The author traces the rise of
'[climate]{.underline} securitization' back to a conference, 'The
Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security' in Toronto in
1988, which [portrayed the consequences of climate change as only second
to nuclear war]{.underline}. Since the 1990s [climate change has often
been presented as a global crisis, an existential threat to human
civilization, a planetary catastrophe]{.underline} (Paglia, 2018). Yet,
unlike an aggressive force out to conquer foreign territory, climate
change is a special domain of emergency, that of 'threats without
enemies' (Prins, 1993). As argued by Methmann and Rothe (2012: 328),
[climate is depicted as an external threat, with impacts coming
suddenly, 'from the outside']{.underline}. [Issues of]{.underline} risk
and [security 'can provoke strong emotions, legitimise extraordinary
practices, and lead to practices that are otherwise
indefensible']{.underline} (Davoudi, 2014: 371--372). Environmental
securitization however is an uncertain domain for securitization (Buzan
et al., 1998; Trombetta, 2008). In climate change, the burden of proof
to legitimize securitization is especially tricky. While a clear
majority of the academic community considers anthropogenic climate
change sufficiently proven, its invisibility as a source of anticipated
catastrophes that have yet to happen, cannot easily compete with visible
weather events in the 'attention economy' (Hamblyn, 2009). Other
publics, then, are not convinced, as has become clear for instance under
the Trump administration. Moreover, there is no ready consensus within
the academic community on a clear and present nexus between climate
change, violent conflict and/or migration (Adams et al., 2018), and if
there is, that it can be successfully averted through a particular
course of action.

### Climate Migration

#### Securitizing rhetoric about climate migrants results in violence against minority group because of the increase in risky border crossing into the EU.

[For decades, we could observe two parallel but contrary processes --
debordering and rebordering -- a decreasing and at the same time
increasing impact of borders. Whereas the former was linked to the
process of political and economic European integration and
globalization, the latter was justified by security
measures.]{.underline} Borderlands studies have followed these
developments and analyzed the changes generated by Europeanization,
globalization and the recent revival of nationalism. [Increasingly, the
migration crises brought to the fore the question of the ethical
dimension of the bordering process]{.underline}. By taking into
consideration that borders do not only divide physical space but are
also used to sort people according to the degree of their belonging,
Laine (2021, p. 747) questions the state-centric thinking and emphasizes
that "[[borders carry considerable moral weight in determining ethical
responsibilities towards those who are not considered to
belong]{.underline}]{.mark}". However, since people live in networked
societies today, and not in isolated national communities, the
humanitarian principle is not the sole argument that borders should be
made more permeable. Hence, Laine proposes the ethics of unbounded
inclusiveness to move away from the nation state-centric form of
organization and the rigid borders and to consider alternative forms of
belongingness towards more inclusive societies.

Nevertheless, as the optimistic vision of a borderless world has already
vanished, and the idea of cosmopolitical citizenship (Balibar, 2010) has
not been implemented by nation states yet, we can rather observe border
securitization in Europe than debordering policies (cf. Prokkola, 2021;
Léonard & Kaunert, 2020). The [[tightening]{.underline}]{.mark} of
[[borders and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[adoption]{.underline}]{.mark}
of [[more restrictive migration policies]{.underline}
[results]{.underline}]{.mark} in the [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} of
clandestine journeys and [[more]{.underline}]{.mark} desperate and
[[risky attempts to enter EU member states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus,
[[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[leads]{.underline}]{.mark}
to [[violence, injustice and bad treatment of migrants,]{.mark} also
provokes humanitarian impulses on the side of public opinion, NGOs, and
migrant activists' groups. In effect, securitization and humanitarianism
at the border are two sides of the same coin: the former is supplemented
by the latter, and the latter is determined by the former. This
double-bind can be described as 'hostipitable']{.underline} (both
hostile and hospitable) [condition of EU border regimes
(Vaughan-Williams, 2015). What [migrants face]{.mark} when they approach
Europe is the [state of indifference between security measures and human
rights]{.mark}. The [policies]{.mark} which should help to differentiate
between unwelcomed invaders and deserving refugees [only]{.mark}
[contribute to arbitrary treatment of people on the
move.]{.mark}]{.underline} The role of states in having control over
national borders (and their permeability to different categories of
people), but also over boundaries, which relate to social exclusion and
inclusion (Donnan & Wilson, 2007) -- is strongly evident in current
events.

### Cybersecurity -- General

#### The 1AC's call for increased cybersecurity is another manifestation of the hysteric social relation that maintains an unrealizable need for improving cybersecurity through shifting the goals of cybersecurity or proposing unattainable standards

**Jacobsen, 2020**

(Jeppe Teglskov, researcher at the Royal Danish Defence College's
Institute for Military Technology, "From neurotic citizen to hysteric
security expert: a Lacanian reading fo the perpetual demand for US cyber
defence," Critical Studies on Security, Vol. 8, Iss. 1, 2020, pp. 46-58,
https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2020.1735830, accessed 7/2/2022, ZW)

[At the end of 2008]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} Center for Strategic
and International Studies ([CSIS]{.underline}) [brought]{.underline}
together [policy experts to develop cybersecurity recommendation for the
incoming president]{.underline}. Under the headline 'Military Doctrine
and Deterrence', [the]{.underline} commission [report emphasised the
importance of 'the need for a credible military presence in cyberspace
to provide a deterrent against potential attackers']{.underline} (CSIS
2008, 24). [The following quote]{.underline} [from the
report]{.underline}, however, [calls in to question the commission's own
recommendation]{.underline}:

[Deterrence in cyberspace is particularly complicated because of the
problems with attribution and identification. If a country does not know
who is attacking, it is difficult to create appropriate and
proportionate responses in ways that reduce the chance of
escalation]{.underline}. A signal that a country is contemplating a
response that goes to all potential attackers will not deter and could
actually create more conflict (ibid.: 26).

In short, [if the attacker is not attributable and hence does not fear
retaliation, then even the most potent cyber military is superfluous. To
make a policy recommendation and in the same breath call into question
the soundness of this policy is a hysteric communication par
excellence]{.underline}. [It avoids the anxiety that emerges when the
specific object of desire]{.underline} ([offensive military
capabilities]{.underline}) [is achieved by already introducing a new
object of desire]{.underline} ([better attribution]{.underline}).

Tellingly, [the]{.underline} Administration's [decision to establish the
US Cyber Command]{.underline}, the cyber branch of the US military, [was
immediately criticised as insufficient]{.underline}. CSIS director James
[Lewis]{.underline} [underlined]{.underline}, for example,
[that]{.underline} 'the U.S. is widely recognized to have pre-eminent
offensive cyber capabilities, but it obtains little or no deterrent
effect from this' (cited in Markoff, Sanger, and Shanker 2010). In other
words, [the government should do a better job defending against and
identifying the culprits in cyberspace.]{.underline}

Then Deputy Secretary of Defense, William J. [Lynn]{.underline} III [was
ready with a plan for improving cyber defence capacities]{.underline}.
Presenting the Department's cyber strategy, [Lynn underlined that '\[US
cyber\] deterrence will necessarily be based more on denying any benefit
to attackers than]{.underline} on [imposing costs through
retaliation']{.underline} (Lynn III 2010, 99--100). [The newfound
priority]{.underline} of cyber defence [did not]{.underline} appear to
[reassure the expert subject]{.underline}. As a case in point,
[the]{.underline} National Research Council ([NRC]{.underline})
[hosted]{.underline} a 2010 [workshop with policy experts on cyber
deterrence]{.underline}. And shortly after, [the]{.underline}
independent Defense Science Board ([DSB]{.underline}) [created a task
force]{.underline} on Resilient Military System and the Advanced Cyber
Threat [to provide recommendations on how to maintain deterrence in the
cyber era. Neither the]{.underline} NRC [workshop nor the]{.underline}
DSB [report found offensive cyber capabilities or cyber defence to be
the solution]{.underline} to the cyber deterrence problem. [Instead, the
desired object had drifted]{.underline} along: [Now, the Administration
needs to clearly articulate the willingness and the capacity to respond
to cyberattacks]{.underline} not only with cyber weapons but [with all
available tools -- ultimately nuclear weapons]{.underline} (DSB 2013:
15; Rosenzweig 2010, 247).

[Articulating the willingness to respond to cyberattacks with any means
was]{.underline} first [introduced by the Obama Administration
in]{.underline} the [2011]{.underline} International Strategy for
Cyberspace [and subsequently iterated in both the Department of Defense
(2015) Cyber Strategy]{.underline} as well as in a White House cyber
deterrence white paper of late 2015 (Obama 2011: 14; Department of
Defense 2015: 11; Otto 2015). [However, as is prototypical in a hysteric
social bond, getting close to the object of desire]{.underline} -- that
is, having more steadfast articulations about the willingness to
retaliate -- [causes anxiety that prompts a slide towards a new object
of desire. In this case]{.underline}, [manifesting]{.underline} in [a
redefinition of the meaning of cyber deterrence.]{.underline}

[Two subsequent commission reports on cyber deterrence]{.underline},
namely the CSIS cyber recommendations to President Trump and the 2017
DSB follow-up report on cyber deterrence (CSIS 2017a; DSB. 2017), [no
longer focused only on large-scale cyberattacks against the US critical
infrastructures as that which needed to be deterred.]{.underline} In
fact, [the government's cyber deterrence's efforts including the
articulation of a willingness to respond with all means necessary seemed
to have worked]{.underline}, as no serious, crippling cyberattacks
against US critical infrastructures had taken place --
[despite]{.underline} the [experts' continuous criticisms of US national
cyber insecurity]{.underline}. [What the US did not
prevent]{.underline}, however, [was economic cyber espionage and
minor]{.underline}, [non-destructive disturbances of public and private
networks.]{.underline} Thus, [in the new commission reports, the anxiety
over such malicious cyber activity was now included as that which needed
to be deterred]{.underline}. Once again, anxiety pushes desire along,
now in the form of a desire for better defining a proportional response
to cyberattacks on private entities and economic espionage. This drift
to better declaratory policy also offers an explanation as to why the
government -- when it finally delivered on the previous demand for
better attribution -- failed to satisfy the expert's desire for cyber
deterrence. In 2014, the US successfully attributed and indicted Chinese
government hackers for commercial cyber espionage, but as the expert's
desire for cyber deterrence now involved a desire for a strong national
security response to cyber espionage, the US government's attributions
only reinforced the demands for economic sanctions (Nakashima 2015).

In short, [as soon as the government delivers, the expert subject's
desire shifts, from offensive military capabilities in cyberspace to
better attribution, to an articulation of willingness to respond, and
most recently, to the need to define proportional responses to
non-military cyber activity.]{.underline} With the drift, the cyber
threat continues as a pertinent national security challenge -- to which
the solution remains always just out of reach.

Yet, [the]{.underline} constant [drift in the object of desire is only
one manifestation of a hysteric social bond]{.underline}. [Another is a
demand for the unachievable]{.underline}. [One of the]{.underline}
policy [recommendations that seems most persistent is cyber
resilience]{.underline}: The 2013 DSB report demanded investments in
resilient systems to ensure a 'survivable strike capability' (DSB 2013,
41), which was reinvented as the demand for resilient 'thin line strike
capabilities' in the 2017 DSB report (2017, 17--8). And both the 2008
and 2017 CSIS report (2008: 27; 2017a: 6), and the NRC workshop
proceedings (Rosenzweig 2010, 256) call for more cyber resilience
initiatives. As an element in a hysteric social bond, [the persistent
demand for resilience ties to the lack of clarity that accompanies this
policy recommendation]{.underline}. [The same reports that call upon the
Administration to implement resilience-building measures, call into
question the feasibility of resilience]{.underline}. The DSB. (2017: 4,
10) underlines that the Internet of Things 'will only exacerbate an
already tenuous posture and make defense even more challenging in the
coming years', and consequently that 'offensive cyber capabilities
continue to grow and are likely to outpace cyber defense and
resilience'. The CSIS (2017a, 6) is equally sceptical: 'While there have
been good advances in the network protections of leading defence
contractors, this has only encouraged opponents to become more inventive
and more persistent'.

The assessment that resilience in cyberspace is unfeasible is
understandable. Resilience is defined as 'the ability to provide
acceptable operations despite disruption: natural or man-made,
inadvertent or deliberate' (DSB 2013, 2). But when is something
'acceptable'? And, how do you determine whether resilience efforts are
deterring the adversary? These questions remind unanswered.

The [critical risk literature has explained how resilience, along with
precaution, premediation and imagination are styles of reasoning that
have come to dominate security governance]{.underline}, for example, in
the response to terrorism or natural disasters (Aradau and van Munster
2011). As the above has shown, [this also applies to
cyberspace]{.underline}; however, [reading]{.underline} the [expert
subject's call for cyber deterrence through the hysteric social bond
reveals the shortcomings of reducing the expert to the provider of
security techniques such as resilience.]{.underline} [Truly embracing
risk or uncertainty management would force expert subjects at least to
recognise the need to discuss what 'acceptable' levels of cyber risks
and 'resilient enough' look like.]{.underline} The [lack of attention
given to questions such as these suggests that the expert subject
occupies a social position not simply for managing cyber risks and
uncertainties but where identification takes place through making
demands that keep the space for criticism open.]{.underline} With
reference to uncertainty, [the expert subject can always insist that
current strategies do not sufficiently manage the cyber insecurities,
keep the confrontation with its desire at a distance, and ultimately
reproduce 'cyber' as a national insecurity.]{.underline}

### Democracy/Liberalism

#### Western security thinking premised on the promotion of liberal international norms is predicated on securitizing and imagined self-image against a racialized, illiberal, and irrational Other

of Humanities and Social Sciences at Deakin University, "Racialised
politics of (in)security and the COVID-19 Westfailure," Critical Studies
on Security, Vol. 9, Iss. 1, 2021, pp. 40-45,
https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2021.1904195, accessed 7/2/2022, ZW)

[Mainstream Western security thinking is predicated on]{.underline} a
self-gratifying [imaginative geography]{.underline}: the
[world]{.underline} is [divided]{.underline} roughly [into two
contrasting zones]{.underline}, o[ne marked by community, order, and
security and the other by disorder, insecurity, and threat.
These]{.underline} imagined [binaries]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
both [underpinned by and emblematic of]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
thinly disguised [Orientalist, Eurocentric, and]{.underline} ultimately
[racist idea, which equates the former zone]{.underline} more or less
[with whites and the West, and the latter with non-whites]{.underline}
(Barkawi and Laffey 2006; Howell and Richter-Montpetit 2019). The idea,
often passed off as fact (through the Western-dominated subfield of
security studies), has been constitutive of the highly racialised
realities in international relations (Bell 2013; Carrozza, Danewid, and
Pauls 2017; Ling 2017; Howell and Richter-Montpetit 2020).

Although by no means unique to the West, [racism is a key source code of
mainstream Western theory and practice of security.]{.underline}
[Security presupposes a subject]{.underline}, namely, what or [who needs
security or should feel secure, which]{.underline}, in turn, [implies
what or whom is to be secured from or against]{.underline}. Central to
security studies, therefore, is an implicit ontological bifurcation
between the subject of security and its threat. And [the security/threat
boundaries are often drawn along a 'colour line']{.underline} (Anievas,
Manchanda, and Shilliam 2015).

The racially-mediated binaries in security thinking and practice are
enabled above all by an epistemic hierarchy, which insists on 'the
inherent superiority of one's culture over all others' (Le Melle 2009,
77). Indeed, racism is first and foremost epistemic racism, which is
'the foundational form ... of racism' (Grosfoguel 2010, 29). The West's
self-representation as the quintessential modern knowing subject, who
has the rational capacity to know the objective world (Pan 2012), is
epistemic racism par excellence. Since '\[k\]nowing is then linked to
the possibility of control of the known' (Walker 1988, 51), [the knowing
Western subject can enjoy certainty, dominance, and security, hence the
self-image as a zone of security]{.underline}. [The West's epistemic
certainty]{.underline} thus [helps lay the groundwork for its sense of
moral, political, economic, civilisational, and geostrategic superiority
vis-à-vis other races and peoples]{.underline}, [whose 'epistemic
inadequacy' makes them irrational, ignorant, uncivilised, and
ontologically threatening]{.underline} (even if occasionally blissfully
innocent and/or exotically attractive).

Threats from 'zones of insecurity' have taken many forms: tribalism,
terrorism, crime, disease, overpopulation, unregulated migration,
espionage, unfair trade practice, anarchical, illiberal power politics,
or some combinations of the above (Kaplan 1994; Huntington 1996).
Intellectually sophisticated and racially agnostic as they are,
[many]{.underline} ([Western]{.underline}) [security concepts and
approaches are in effect about methodologies of eliminating, minimising,
or containing the (largely non-Western) 'zone of
insecurity']{.underline}, whether [through democracy promotion, norm
diffusion, free trade, transnational activism, emancipatory intervention
and developmental assistance]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} by ways of
[alliance building and expansion, forward defence, military deterrence,
containment, power balancing, and border control.]{.underline}

### Hybrid Warfare

#### The aff's securitization of hybrid warfare is *[anxiety-reproducing]{.underline}* -- oscillating descriptions between its knowability and unknowability as well as its undefined scope entrenches anxiety and primes audiences to accept strategies to manage anxiety produced by the threat of hybrid warfare

\*HW = hybrid warfare

Building on Heath-Kelly and Jacobsen, our final argument is that [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} works exactly like their examples, as HW, too, [is
a discourse that is simultaneously anxiety-repressing and
anxiety-reproducing]{.underline}. In fact, we argue that the
[linking]{.underline} of [HW and East/West geopolitics produces a
particularly strongly anxiety-ridden discourse]{.underline}. While
[hybrid warfare presents threats as invisible and omnipresent due to
their covert and networked nature]{.underline}, the [East/West
imagination]{.underline} further [raises]{.underline} the stakes and
[salience of]{.underline} such [threats by painting them as parts
of]{.underline} a titanic [civilisational struggle]{.underline}. The
[subjects produced by such discourse can never rest]{.underline}, as
what may be going on right behind their noses is not just one particular
cyber-attack, a single conspiracy theory that has gained traction on
Facebook, or merely one instance of information stolen by a spy.
Instead, [it is a battle for the future of 'the West']{.underline} and
the Czech belonging to it, one [where the alternative option
is]{.underline} the most tragic one: [a descent deep into the 'abyss' of
'the East']{.underline} (Cadier, 2019). We will now illustrate these
arguments by focusing on the unfathomability of HW, the shifting nature
of the threats it produces, and the anxieties inherent in the East/West
geopolitics that underpin it.

First, the ['failure to secure']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015) [is
pre-emptively incorporated in the HW discourse by its portrayal of the
looming dangers as insidious, invisible and]{.underline} even
[impossible to detect]{.underline}. As a key security document states,
'\[t\]he principal risk to which a subject attacked by a hybrid campaign
is exposed lies in the fact that they will not be able to identify the
hybrid campaign -- in time, in its full scale, or at all' (Ministry of
the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 129). According to the
deputy Helena Langˇsadlov ´ ´ a, what we are supposedly facing are
highly dangerous, yet 'creeping threats', which we 'cannot see on a day
by day basis' (in Chamber of Deputies, 2019). This leads some to claim
that 'at no point in history was it so extremely difficult to decide, if
we are at war, or not' (Taborský, ´ 2019, p. 164). While there may be
little drama on the surface, [no one can ever rest in this logic. An
attack may be already underway]{.underline}, one [that can even be
approximated to war]{.underline}, [literally]{.underline} [at any
minute]{.underline}. As the Special Forces general, Karel Rehka, ˇ put
it at a conference organised in the Czech parliament: 'In a way, we are
already at war, we just do not realise it or are not able to admit it.'
(Lang, 2015) [This]{.underline} is a mode of thinking that [produces
highly anxious subjects, in a constant sense of the 'expectant
dread']{.underline} that is anxiety (Hook, 2015, p. 117), one not yet
having a clear referent and directed towards all possible yet still
unknown dangers that may materialise at any time.

It is in these notions that an unspecified existential threat may be
hidden behind mundane events that the otherwise backgrounded
'postmodern' geopolitical imagination of HW suddenly kicks back in. [If
the]{.underline} 'modern' East[/West geopolitical imagination 'made
sense' and provided]{.underline} at least some [fleeting ontological
security by pointing to Russia]{.underline}, [this is frustrated
by]{.underline} the [surplus anxiety produced via]{.underline} this
['postmodern' imagination of insidious, hidden networks]{.underline}
operating in physical and cyberspace alike. [In fact]{.underline}, as
the discourse postulates[, we may not even know that it really is
Russia]{.underline} in the first place that is [behind a particular
incident]{.underline}, as hybrid attackers seek to create 'an
environment where responsibility for these activities cannot (at least
formally) be attributed to them, or at least only speculatively and with
great difficulty' (Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016,
p. 127). We may ultimately never know if this or that mundane event is
actually not a part of something much bigger, as it is the very aim of
the attacker to 'prevent a clear interpretation of events and the
discovery of their interconnectedness' (Ministry of the Interior of the
Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). Therefore, [while]{.underline} the
[prevalent 'modern' geopolitical reading of HW enables channelling
anxiety by constructing Russia an object of fear]{.underline},
[it]{.underline} still [remains far from]{.underline} the
[manageable]{.underline} fear of '[fight or flight']{.underline}
(Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 241). This is [because]{.underline} these
[supposedly known aspects of]{.underline} the [danger are constantly
being accompanied and disrupted by]{.underline} the [surplus anxiety of
the 'unknown unknowns']{.underline} stemming from the partial inclusion
of the 'postmodern' geopolitical reading. [This]{.underline} effectively
[pre-empts]{.underline} the [HW discourse from ever solving the problems
it]{.underline} [is supposedly designed to tackle]{.underline}, as it is
wholly unclear how to act upon threats that we are not yet aware of or
do not know how to make sense of.

Second, this [oscillation between]{.underline} the [known and the
unknown and between fear and anxiety]{.underline}
[manifests]{.underline} itself [in]{.underline} the [constantly shifting
construction of what is supposed to be the exact nature of the threat
coming from Russia]{.underline}. This is best illustrated in the wording
of the annual reports of the Czech counterintelligence agency
([SIS]{.underline}), which reinforce the notion that Russia is indeed a
severe threat, yet the precise character and shape of this threat
appears to be changing year after year. As already mentioned, in [first
annual public report reflecting on]{.underline} the situation after
[Russia's aggression against Ukraine]{.underline}, the SIS
[warned]{.underline} that their assessment showed the formation
[of]{.underline} what was spectacularly labelled as [the 'New
Reincarnation of the Comintern' -- a loose network of allied actors,
similar to the Cold War Soviet-controlled network of ideologically
affiliated political parties, agitators and agents]{.underline}. The
danger was portrayed as a new version of this tried and tested strategy,
which Russia supposedly employs to connect different groups dissatisfied
with the Western liberal democracy (Security Information Service, 2015,
pp. 11--12).

However, [the spectre of the Comintern was]{.underline} a one-off,
[never to appear again]{.underline}. Instead, [SIS later concluded that
the threat resided in a much looser combination of often uncoordinated
actions of Russian intelligence]{.underline}, authentic [Czech
individuals]{.underline} [not]{.underline} in any way [linked to Moscow
but]{.underline} 'only' [spreading their own 'pro-Russian'
worldviews]{.underline}, and finally, even in the lack of education
about modern history in schools (Security Information Service, 2018, pp.
6--8). This [trend of diffusing]{.underline} the [danger]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} a Kremlin[-coordinated network to seeing the threats
in mere ideological resonances further continued]{.underline}. The most
recent report notes that there is a 'transition from state-controlled or
directed activities to spontaneous actions' of like-minded actors. 'When
Russian state officials express what they desire to happen (for instance
by spreading manipulative information), proxy actors without any links
to the Russian state proceed to action on their own initiative and based
on what they think the officials might want' (Security Information
Service, 2020, p. 9).

Through this move, [the spectre of 'Russian hybrid warfare' can now
encompass virtually anything that can be somehow interpreted as matching
with the desires or interests of the Kremlin, without any need for
proving direct links]{.underline}, as these are no longer considered
necessary. The [construction of 'a threat' now includes]{.underline}
even situations [when]{.underline} '[a foreign power]{.underline} does
not engage in any direct action and [keeps its distance, while
using]{.underline} various ways ([PR, instigating statements,
propaganda]{.underline} etc.) [to inspire individual persons to take
action']{.underline} (Security Information Service, 2020, p. 9). Put
differently, Russian threat can be present even where there is no direct
Russian hand whatsoever. Literally any individual with views somehow
similar to those of the Russian state can be seen as part of it, which
makes the idea that security can ever be achieved virtually impossible.
Instead, [this logic contributes to the reproduction of an anxious
society, defined by 'the constant presence of the possibility of that
threat, and]{.underline} with it, [the sense that government cannot
fully protect the people and that danger resides in the
everyday]{.underline}' (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 247).

Third, [this notion that the possibility that something 'Russian' may be
insidiously present deep within the Czech society]{.underline} then
[revives]{.underline} also the [old anxieties inherent in
the]{.underline} 'modern' [East/West geopolitical
imagination]{.underline} itself. [Central Europeans' self-positioning in
East/West geopolitics is highly ambivalent]{.underline} (Kuus, 2007;
Todorova, 2009). On the one hand, being or becoming part of 'the Western
civilisation' is a source of ontological security. On the other hand,
this security is never quite complete or permanent. This is [because
Central Europeans locate themselves at the very limit of the
West]{.underline}, as 'European edge-men' (Ma¨lksoo, 2010, p. 5), [whose
membership in the civilisation must constantly be proved as it can
always be taken away]{.underline} -- especially [by]{.underline} the
[forces of the 'East']{.underline}. The 'old shadow of Yalta', the
feeling that the region's 'freedom could yet again be expendable in
times of crisis' is constantly present (Ma¨lksoo, 2010, p. 75). Put
differently, East/West geopolitics equips the Czech 'pro-Western'
security intellectuals with a 'mental map, where the country is depicted
as being on the "edge" of Europe and constantly risking to "fall" into
an abyss \[...\] traditionally characterised as the "East"' (Cadier,
2019, p. 84). While the East/West geopolitical imagination can succeed
in spatialising the threat in the Russian 'other', the position it
grants to the self is always potentially insecure. Therefore, it is also
East/West geopolitics itself that produces subjects that are constantly
on alert, facing the constant 'possibility of loss of one's soul'
(Balaska, 2019, p. 8) that defines the experience of anxiety.

[Such fragile geopolitical self-positioning]{.underline} [further fuels
the]{.underline} [search for new]{.underline} and new [sources of hybrid
threats, as failing to uncover and face them may have existential
consequences]{.underline}, especially given that 'Easternness' may have
already infiltrated and compromised the Czech social body. This notion
of 'East within' links to the above discussed unfathomability and
invisibility of HW and manifests itself in multiple ways. For one
counterintelligence report, it takes the form of smuggled ideas and
narratives, presented 'in a way leading Czech citizens to believe they
are recipients of opinions held by fellow citizens not of Russian
propaganda' (Security Information Service, 2015, p. 11). Similarly, a
popular book on 'fake news' geopoliticises social attitudes en bloc by
identifying them along East/West axis, presenting the 'disappointed'
part of society as 'seeing a model in Russia, or perhaps China' (Gregor,
Mlejnkova´, & Zvolsi.info, 2018, p. 62). For others, the 'East within'
takes the form in the physical presence of 'Putin's agents' who
supposedly 'quite likely teach your children at universities, you meet
them for a coffee in your favourite caf´e or work in normal jobs.'
(Kundra, 2016a, p. 88).

The [anxiety geopolitics of hybrid warfare is]{.underline} thus [also
about creating the normatively highly disturbing '"red under every bed"
mentality']{.underline} (Fridman, 2018, p. 3) [and applying 'the ethics
of total war \[...\] even to the smallest skirmish']{.underline}
(Galeotti, 2019, p. 8). Therefore, [viewing security threats through the
prism of hybrid warfare reproduces a highly anxious society and
perpetuates]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [justification]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} those '[intellectuals of statecraft']{.underline} (O ´
Tuathail & Agnew, 1992) [that would not hesitate to provide]{.underline}
the sort of [geopolitical fixes]{.underline} that were
[discussed]{.underline} in the previous sections. Thereby, the discourse
ends up reproducing itself, as the two faces of anxiety geopolitics not
only disrupt, but also dialectically reinforce one another:
[geopolitical discourse emerges to repress anxiety and provide
ontological security, yet]{.underline} the [anxiety inherent in the
discourse disrupts ontological security and]{.underline}, to come full
circle, [creates the need for geopolitical discourses]{.underline}. The
result is a society oscillating between its desire to avoid anxiety and
the repeated frustration thereof; an affective pulsation that has
arguably been elevated to a dominant mode of politics of (in)security in
our present time (Eklundh et al., 2017), of which hybrid warfare is a
prime example. [As similar patterns of]{.underline} anxious
[over-reaction and securitisation of broad areas of social life have
been recognised]{.underline} by authors writing about HW [in different
empirical contexts]{.underline} (Fridman, 2018; Galeotti, 2019; M¨
alksoo, 2018; Ord ¨ ´en, 2019), we believe [that the problem with
'hybrid warfare' is of a more general nature and the relevance of our
analysis reaches beyond the Czech case]{.underline}.

#### The 1AC's descriptions of a Russian hybrid warfare deploys Orientalist tropes to secure a collective Western identity threatened by Russia as a scapegoat for dispersed sources of anxiety

\*HW = hybrid warfare

First, a certain [event needs to be constructed as a]{.underline}
supposed [point of origin of the perceived unease]{.underline}, [a
'crisis' that dislocates the symbolic order]{.underline} (Nabers, 2015).
This is the first move in the repression of anxiety, one in which [an
'actually existing' empirical event is discursively presented as the
apparent cause of]{.underline} the [deeper ontological
crisis]{.underline} that is [affectively experienced as
anxiety]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} the [HW]{.underline} [discourse
in Czechia]{.underline}, [Russia's aggression against Ukraine of 2014 is
presented as such profoundly shocking and dislocating
event]{.underline}. As the otherwise rather down-to-earth and
matter-of-fact military intellectual, Karel Rehka, ˇ puts it: 'the
Russian Federation shocked the whole world. The unimaginable was broken
into.' (Rehka, ˇ 2017, p. 199) 'Shock' and 'helplessness' are words used
also by a high-ranking Czech diplomat (personal interview, Prague,
August 4, 2020). A leading Czech think-tanker then recalls how
'surprised' he was by Russia's invasion and how 'disorganised and
fragmented' the security debates were in the months that followed
(Janda, 2017). The affective experience is captured well also in a
widely cited and circulated popular book, which vividly describes how
'we are walking on the edge of a cliff' and '\[u\]ncertainty is the only
thing that you can count on these days' (Alvarov´ a, 2017, p. 20).
Therefore[, 2014 was constructed as a radical breakthrough into a much
more insecure world]{.underline}. Yet, this move of [identifying the
supposed origin of]{.underline} these dizzying feelings of [anxiety in
one particular event was]{.underline} at the same time already [the
first step of seeking ontological security by making sense of
it.]{.underline}

A second step is putting the name on the problem. It is only [the
performative and affect-laden performance of naming]{.underline} that
[connects disparate phenomena together and creates a discursive 'object'
that can be then dealt with politically]{.underline} (Laclau, 2005). In
our case, [this leads to the]{.underline} creative appropriation of the
[concepts of 'hybrid warfare' and 'hybrid threats', which were virtually
non-existent in the Czech public discourse prior to 2014]{.underline}
(Daniel & Eberle, 2018), [and using them as a linchpin that connects all
sorts of societal problems.]{.underline} For an authoritative Czech
security document, '[hybrid threat']{.underline} is a 'way to wage a
confrontation or a conflict', one that [is characterised by an
extraordinarily broad spectrum of measures]{.underline}: 'a wide,
complex, adaptable, and integrated combination of conventional and
unconventional means, overt and covert activities, characterised
primarily by coercion and subversion' (Ministry of the Interior of the
Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). [The range of actors that can execute
such methods is similarly broad]{.underline}, including 'military,
paramilitary, and various civilian actors' (ibid.). Similarly, an
overview of a 'Russian hybrid strategy' provided by the
counterintelligence service includes 'interpretation of modern history',
different ways of 'information warfare', 'networking/infiltration'
across the fields of politics, economy, crime, espionage, culture and
education, and military/guerrilla operations alike (Security Information
Service, 2018, p. 7). In statements like these, [hybrid warfare is
stretched so as to incorporate almost anything that can be understood as
a hostile activity.]{.underline} A such, [it becomes an universal object
of fear]{.underline}, [broad enough to be used as a placeholder for all
sorts of anxieties.]{.underline}

In the third move, [hybrid warfare is territorialised by pointing to
Russia as its ultimate source]{.underline}. The '[postmodern'
geopolitical imagination of hybrid warfare in terms of flows, clouds and
infrastructures, is backgrounded in favour]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
the '[modern' territorial East/West geopolitics of a Russian
threat]{.underline}. In certain cases, this means little more than
merely pointing out that it is indeed Russia that 'has executed hybrid
operations \[ ...\], including targeted disinformation activities and
cyber-attacks', as the Defence Strategy (Ministry of Defence of the
Czech Republic, 2017, p. 7) puts it explicitly and other documents hint
at implicitly (e.g. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic,
2015). More interesting are the [instances which present
Russia]{.underline} not only as one source of threats, but [as an
orchestrator coordinating all possible means and actors]{.underline}.
[In such cases, the 'postmodern' geopolitical imagination of networks is
used and reproduced]{.underline}, yet [with a]{.underline} key
[twist]{.underline}: such [networks are seen as hierarchical, with
centre in Moscow]{.underline}. In this logic, different domestic actors
-- 'alternative news' websites spreading anti-Western narratives,
right-wing populists, even contrarian intellectuals -- can ultimately be
tied to an overall Russia's masterplan (for an example see Janda &
Kundra, 2016). The counterintelligence agency reports are an example of
this 'puppet-master' approach. One of them lists 'covert infiltration of
Czech media and the Internet' and 'foundation of puppet organizations,
covert and open support of populist or extremist subjects' among the key
activities of Russia's 'information operations' (Security Information
Service, 2016, p. 9). Another outlines this logic in colourful detail,
claiming that 'Russia is creating a structure in Europe drawing on the
concept of the Comintern (the Communist International; the Third
International) founded by the Soviet Union' (Security Information
Service, 2015, p. 11), an organised network of all sorts of actors 'with
pro-Russian stances or fighting against the system' (ibid., 12).

However, [different actors can be labelled as agents or instrument of HW
and then geopoliticised and linked to Russia not only by direct
association, but also because they are]{.underline} merely
[voicing]{.underline} [opinions]{.underline} that can be [somehow
qualified as 'pro-Russian']{.underline}. As a more recent
counterintelligence report puts it, actually an '[overwhelming majority
of disinformation websites in Czech are the work of Czech]{.underline}
\[...\] [citizens]{.underline}, who are [not supported by Russian
entities]{.underline}.' (Security Information Service, 2018, p. 8)
Nevertheless, this still makes them a part of a broader geopolitical
threat, as 'these people and their internet projects are misused by
Russia to spread propaganda or support other components of the hybrid
strategy.' (ibid., 8) It is this imagination of a Russian-orchestrated
networked threat that enables a leading Czech journalist to blankly
dismiss the prominent disinformation website, Aeronet. cz, as 'writing
for Putin' (Kundra, 2016b), without any evidence of links to the Russian
state known at that point and with his own subsequent investigations
showing that this is most likely not the case. It also makes it possible
to deal with anxieties by externalising the problem, such as when a
popular book argues that 'Furious hate \[...\] is not Czech, it is
something new, foreign. It came from the outside and 'somehow' entered
into us.' (Alvarov´ a, 2017, p. 88).

[In the]{.underline} fourth and [final move, this 'hybrid' struggle with
Russia is endowed with meaning by being inserted into the whole symbolic
structure of East/West civilisational geopolitics]{.underline}, in which
'\[i\]ssues of security and geopolitics are \[...\] reframed in cultural
terms. They become simultaneously geographical, cultural and strategic
concepts, and they diffuse into ever more spheres of political life.'
(Kuus, 2007, p. x) The [societal anxieties that are managed via the
narrative of hybrid warfare emanating from Russia, are]{.underline} now
also [made part of an eternal struggle between the East and the
West.]{.underline} This reactivates the 'mental maps', in which '[the
West' functions as a desired point of identification and a promise of
security and prosperity, whereas 'the East' is seen as 'an
abyss']{.underline}, a notion 'which in the Czech political discourse
refers less to a geographical space than to ontological categories
defining the alienated past of the Czech Republic.' (Cadier, 2019, p.
84) As one member of parliament, Jan Bartoˇsek, put it, the Czechs are
left with an unequivocal choice: 'either we will be part of NATO as a
firm ally of our pro-Western orientation, or we will be just one of
Russia's many colonies. There is no third way.' (in Chamber of Deputies,
2018a).

In statements like these, [Russia is presented as a fundamentally
different entity, a quintessentially Oriental actor, belonging to a
different 'universe' that 'until nowadays has not met' with the European
one]{.underline} (Alvarova, ´ 2017, p. 70). Echoing classical
Orientalist tropes, [Russians supposedly]{.underline} [rely on
'\[m\]ysticism, irrationality, associational instead of logical
thinking]{.underline} -- thus, a model of thinking that is of different
civilisation, the one we know rather from the Orient' (Alvarova, ´ 2017,
p. 193). The potentially catastrophic consequences of allying with
Russia are then often presented through references to the past,
reinforcing the notion that what is at stake in HW is in fact yet
another instance of a historical struggle between civilisations. 'Many
of us probably know our modern history, from 1945 through 1948, Russian
advisers, death of \[foreign minister\] Jan Masaryk, occupation in 1968.
The Russian influence, which simply broke us away from the West, ripped
us from \[our\] democratic development, and has incalculable economic
consequences stretching to this day.' (Helena Langˇsadlov ´ a ´ in
Chamber of Deputies, 2018b).

[This idea that]{.underline} issues like [propaganda, misinformation or
rise of populism are instances of a dramatic geopolitical confrontation,
is]{.underline} finally [driven home also by the notion that it is the
West as a whole that is under attack,]{.underline} not just any
individual country. [According to a counterintelligence report, 'the
goal of the Russian hybrid campaign' is 'primarily to weaken NATO and
the EU internally]{.underline}, e.g. by weakening individual member
states' (Security Information Service, 2018, p. 7). Therefore, should
the Czechs fail to defend themselves, they are supposedly endangering
something much bigger. According to a member of parliament, Jan
Lipavský, what the Russians want is 'to break European unity' (Chamber
of Deputies, 2018b). [Such ideas connect hybrid warfare]{.underline}
squarely [to]{.underline} the [Messianistic undertones of the East/West
geopolitical imagination]{.underline}, in which the Central Europeans
serve as guardians defending the West at its limit. To paraphrase Milan
Kundera's (1984) foundational essay on Central European civilisational
geopolitics, by fighting hybrid warfare, the Czechs are risking 'dying
for Czechia and the West', which indeed gives a sense of deep purpose
and meaning to their cause and produces a strong anxiety-repressing
narrative.

To sum up this part, one important aspect of the [anxiety
geopolitics]{.underline} [of hybrid warfare]{.underline} lies in the way
how it [allows channelling deeper anxieties by using the East/West
geopolitical imagination to produce familiar storylines, identities and
objects of fear]{.underline}. Despite being constructed as multifaceted,
broad and difficult to detect, [hybrid warfare is made legible by being
projected on a familiar 'mental map', where it becomes merely the most
recent instance of long-lasting struggle between the West and a
fundamentally different, antagonist Russia]{.underline}. However, the
relationship between the discourses of hybrid warfare and East/West
geopolitics goes both ways: HW is not only territorialised by, but also
gives broader meaning to and, in a way, promises to reinforce the
East/West civilisational geopolitics. [It is in and through HW that
Russia is constructed as fundamentally different and the West presented
as a coherent entity under attack, as well as something worth
defending]{.underline} against the potentially tragic alternatives.
[Through]{.underline} the [discourse of hybrid warfare, doubts about the
relevance or resilience of a Westcentric geopolitical order are
seemingly brushed away and old geopolitical identities are
hardened]{.underline}. This is precisely the logic of ontological
security that makes the ideas of a 'return of geopolitics' and the 'new
Cold War' so appealing, as shown by Guzzini (2012, 2016) and Browning
(2018).

### NATO

the alliance afloat. [[Its visionaries point to an unstable]{.mark},

### Nuclear War

#### The 1AC's securitization of nuclear weapons creates a self-fulfilling prophecy -- their rhetoric is psychological conditioning that necessitates militarization of the American public and justifies endless warfare in the name of securing the homeland

Nuclear End-Times

[In the U.S., nuclear fear colonized the very idea of the catastrophic
in the twentieth century. It was officially deployed to create a new
kind of national security state, and with it, a new citizen-state
relationship mediated by images of absolute destruction.]{.underline}
During the Cold War, [the nuclear state not only built a meticulous
global machinery for nuclear war,]{.underline} **[it also taught
Americans to think and feel as nuclear subjects, to contemplate a sudden
end of the U.S. and transform that cataclysmic vision into a perverse
new form of nation-building.]{.underline}** What we remember today as
Civil Defense, [the duck and cover drills and national nuclear attack
exercises of the first decades of the Cold War were the means of
installing specific ideas about nuclear crisis within American society,
and then mobilizing that imagined crisis as a means of militarizing the
public.]{.underline} [**The cataclysmic became a formal basis for
political life in this moment, making claims on the imminent death of
the nation a powerful new form of state- and nation-building.** The
nuclear revolution was thus both technological and psycho-social,
simultaneously material, cultural, and emotional.]{.underline} [We
forget today that the nuclear crisis has not always been with
us,]{.underline} that before 1945 the future had many worries but not
one overpowering, totalizing one. In the U.S., [the atomic bomb has
always been a double-edged revolution, simultaneously installing a new
domestic vulnerability (in the form of surprise nuclear attack) as well
as an absolute offensive power (in the form of the U.S. nuclear
arsenal).]{.underline} **[The bomb becomes the basis for U.S.
"superpower" standing but also reorganizes collective death as
imminence, a pure potential loaded into every second of everyday
life.]{.underline}** Thus, [it sutures the ability to destroy and be
destroyed in a new machine form, one that folds official terrors and
hegemonic desires together in a novel configuration.]{.underline}
Beginning in the early 1950s, the public project of Civil Defense was to
teach Americans to respond to nuclear danger productively as Cold
Warriors, **[to train the public to psychologically engage nuclear
crisis as the basis of American power and international
order]{.underline}**.14 [Civil Defense constituted (that is, both
invented and installed) a new register of threat in everyday American
life, **the surprise nuclear attack that would decimate urban America
and leave the rest of the country a radioactive ruin in a matter of
minutes**]{.underline}. Civil Defense was [rehearsed for generations in
public schools and through national mass media campaigns, and informs
official disaster planning to this day. Its extraordinarily achievement
was to turn contemplating the end of the nation-state into a form of
national building, constituting an affective relation to destruction as
the terms of a new collective beginning.]{.underline}15 [This image of
catastrophe, constituting the public side of nuclear war planning, was
extraordinarily influential, enabling a new kind of Cold War consensus
of anti-communism and global capitalism through mass psycho-social
domestic regulation.]{.underline} In other words, [by deploying the
imminence of ultimate danger and using official secrecy to carefully
calibrate the depiction of nuclear threat, the]{.underline} Cold War
nuclear **[state transformed catastrophe itself into a politicized and
instrumental vision, a core tool of domestic governance.]{.underline}**
**[Evoking the sudden end of American civilization has since become a
basic tool in governance,]{.underline}** [a reliable means of blocking
domestic debate]{.underline} **[as well as taking extraordinary
international actions---most recently, invading other
states]{.underline}** (such as, Iraq in 2003) **[and conducting deadly
drone strikes around the world.]{.underline}** But if the public side of
Cold War nuclear crisis was civil defense, with its commitment to
emotional management via images of the end of the nation-state, [what
about official logics and registers; that is, what of the actual
governance of nuclear war?]{.underline} With that question in mind let's
consider the U.S. nuclear war plan of the early Cold War, the first
formally coded U.S. nuclear war strategy, an official program for
planetary destruction.16 Conceived during a period of hyperactive U.S.
and Soviet thermonuclear testing in the late 1950s, the official U.S.
nuclear war program was breathtakingly simple and unprecedentedly
violent.17 The U.S. nuclear war plan consisted of two versions of the
same option: a pre-emptory strike against global communism, and a
retaliatory strike against global communism.18 Both plans involved using
the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal to eliminate communism worldwide (from
the Soviet Union to North Korea to China) within a few hours of nuclear
warfare. Thus, it inscribed as U.S. policy a commitment to maximal
violence as "defense." This program was depicted in a U.S. Air Force
film, The Power of Decision, commissioned in 1958 strictly for internal
military use.19 It was declassified, and provided to the openness
activists at the National Security Archive by the U.S. National Archives
and Records Administration in 2010, having not likely been watched in
decades.20 This is a rare record of how those in control of the nuclear
arsenal first imagined and internally discussed fighting a global
nuclear war. It was made for restricted internal Air Force use and thus
was not trying to minimize the consequences of nuclear war for a public
audience along the lines of Civil Defense, but rather sought to shape
ideas about the rationality and reliability of the nuclear system itself
for war fighters. [As the American public was learning to duck and cover
in the event of nuclear war, the command and control officers were
learning how to push the buttons to launch a new kind of totalizing
violence.]{.underline} [Walking viewers through the command and control
logics of nuclear weapons and war, the film offers a factual, and
remarkably affectless, depiction of how the U.S. and the Soviet Union
would consume each other under mushroom clouds.]{.underline} The film
constitutes the ability of U.S. command and control to survive a nuclear
attack and successfully retaliate as a "victory," regardless of the
subsequent global nuclear cataclysm. Viewers are told early on that the
U.S. has the power to "strike anywhere in the world" and, in a few hours
of nuclear war, deliver "more explosive power than has been used that in
all the previous wars in human history combined." Thus, this film is
also about American self-fashioning as a reluctant but supremely
powerful warrior-state, articulating the imaginary terms for righteous
revenge against a surprise Soviet attack. Power of Decision depicts a
psychosocial field of projection and fantasy, but one mediated by a
global technological infrastructure of mass destruction. [Film has
always been a key means of establishing---giving both form and
image---to the nuclear danger in the U.S. Nuclear fear had to be learned
before it could be felt.]{.underline} [The nuclear security state
created films for every audience---military personnel, civilians,
scientists, and politicians---each crafted to bring them into a specific
relationship to the bomb.]{.underline}21 The vibrant production of
public films for civil defense was only exceeded by the production of
classified films for use within the weapons laboratories, military
branches, and for policy makers. The Power of Decision establishes the
serious authority and closed world system of early nuclear war plans
within the classified networks of the time but also, in detailing how
the U.S. would fight a nuclear war, demonstrates the paradox of that
authority.22 **[Here security and insecurity meet under the sign of the
mushroom cloud, and nuclear governance---]{.underline}**despite an
all-out effort to make it logical and proportional---**[is rendered
absurd as it contemplates generating hundreds of millions of deaths
worldwide in a few minutes of nuclear warfare.]{.underline}** In the
opening frame of The Power of Decision, viewers meet an Air Force
officer, who stares directly at the camera and introduces the film. The
style of his presentation is that of a military briefing, blunt but with
certain flourishes: declaring that he is standing hundreds of feet
underground in a blast and radiation proof bunker, our narrator
theatrically walks through layer upon layer of internal security to the
command center itself, stating that: "From this room, the \[Air\] Force
throughout the world is controlled and monitored twenty-four hours a
day---in peace as it would be in war." Rendering the distinction between
war and peace suddenly murky, our narrator quickly introduces viewers to
the "Big Board"---an analog map of all the various strike routes aimed
at the Soviet Union, as well as the exercises that are currently taking
place. A tangled web of multicolored lines, the diagram obliterates the
USSR under the weight of Air Force bomber vectors, actual planes in the
air, potential exercises, feints, and alerts. We are told that attack
vectors are being flown every minute of every day and, to keep "the
enemy" from being able to predict American routes and strategies, that
there are fake exercises mixed into the planned assault strategy.
Viewers are introduced to the "red phone," which over-rides all other
communications in an alert, as well as the multiple systems for gaining
information about the global fleet of American planes and the military
actions of enemy states. This depiction of a global early warning and
command and control system is the formal project of the film, but steely
determination to fight a nuclear war is the fetish. Defense and
deterrence are collapsed into nuclear war fighting ability in this
presentation, which depicts nuclear war as an affectless circuit of
human-machine interfaces and expertise. The will to fight is portrayed
as equally crucial to the technological infrastructure of nuclear war as
the bomb itself. The film is organized in two parts, the first a
briefing of Air Force nuclear logistics focused on "Operation
Quickstart" (the ongoing training for nuclear attack), while the second,
"Operation War Dance" offers a live action illustration of the process
of recognizing a Soviet attack, pursuing an American counter-strike, and
then conducting a post-nuclear war damage assessment. In the first part,
an animation of the globe demonstrates how U.S. and Soviet aircraft can
now fly over the polar north to attack one another, underscored by a
second animation of a globe covered in mushroom clouds (see Figure 1.1).
[This animation is the precursor to dramatizing the global sequence of
nuclear war, this time structured around actual U.S. nuclear test
footage of thermonuclear detonations, as well as blast and destruction
sequences from the nuclear test program, all intercut with staged
command and control decision-making]{.underline}. The largely analog
universe of American command control and information systems is
presented as cutting edge technology, allowing near instantaneous global
communications, a 24/7 monitoring of Soviet activities, and an always on
alert nuclear Air Force that has at least 15 percent of its fleet in the
air at all times. [This is a system claiming the highest level of
rationality: technological precision is combined with exacting
timetables, sequential assessments, and escalating actions, but
inevitably this techno-scientific system results in the end of the known
world. **Thus, the hyper-rationality of the nuclear system is mobilized
in an attempt to over-ride the inevitable reality of its use, showing
how security and defense have paradoxically merged with mass violence on
a new kind of planetary scale in Cold War nuclear logics.**]{.underline}
As reports come into the command center of a Soviet first use of nuclear
weapons in Europe and Japan, a general intones: "By giving up the
initiative, the West must expect to take the first blow." This is a
coded reference to pre-emption, as nuclear debates in the 1950s focused
on the illogic of allowing a nuclear strike on the U.S. if it could be
pre-empted by a surprise U.S. nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. The
head of the Strategic Air Command, Curtis LeMay, advocated striking the
Soviet Union before their nuclear forces reached parity with the U.S..23
But a U.S. military culture founded on the Japanese "sneak attack" at
Pearl Harbor resisted the logics of nuclear pre-emption, arguing that
such an assault would be against American values. Moreover, in the age
of thermonuclear weapons, a preemptory attack would not eliminate the
possibility of a nuclear counter-attack (precisely what is documented in
The Power of Decision). As the film theatrically presents, no matter who
starts a nuclear conflict, massive destruction occurs all around the
world: there is no place of safety on planet Earth during a nuclear war.
The Power of Decision is ultimately a documentary about a "defense
system" that is also a planetary mechanism of collective suicide. The
Air Force soon unleashes its nuclear bombers, staging sequential and
incremental runs across Soviet territories to close in on "Target M",
presumably Moscow, which is soon reported destroyed. After less than a
day of nuclear warfare, the U.S. has eliminated the Soviet Union, as one
U.S. General puts it: "They must quit: We have the air and the power and
they know it." But what does such a victory look like? The after
assessment, also a briefing on the big board, reveals a stark reality:
while the U.S. nuclear system worked perfectly in terms of command and
control, over 60 million Americans are dead or injured. The industrial
core of the U.S.---Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, as well as New
York---is destroyed. Similarly, major cities in Europe, Japan, as well
as much of the Soviet Union and China are radioactive ruins. Viewers do
not get an assessment of the total global dead. But in addition to the
urban destruction, radioactive fallout would travel globally bringing a
second wave of death in the form of radiation injury. In 1958, a
"nuclear winter"---produced by the combined atmospheric effects of the
particulate matter elevated into the stratosphere by destroying cities
on this scale---was not yet an operative concept.24 Thus, weather is
only discussed as a problem for managing planes in flight and is not yet
part of the post-nuclear world assessment, which we now know would
likely include a massively destabilized climate. But, even on its own
terms, The Power of Decision documents the nuclear cataclysm as a
techno-rational system, one in which the ability to exert American
"will" on the Soviet Union is constituted as a victory despite the
hundreds of millions of deaths worldwide, leaving an image of victory at
the end that is apocalyptic at its core. The insight that war is now too
deadly to actually fight is a repeated refrain in the film. But [this
refrain is undermined by the obvious pleasure in detailing exactly how
the nuclear war machine would function in a matter of minutes to bring
about an unprecedented, and perhaps the very last, global calamity This
ever-expanding technical capacity to fight a global nuclear war
constitutes the first human generated and controlled planetary
crisis.]{.underline} In the first decade of the Cold War, people faced
the possibility of an absolute ending of their own making for the first
time, a political deployment of a global infrastructure of mass
destruction in which there might not be a human left to tell the story
of what happened and why. In this regard, The Power of Decision does not
contemplate what the world would be like for the nuclear war fighting
team as they leave the bunker, return to the surface, and enter the
post-nuclear ruins. [The new American empire would be highly
radioactive, subject to a radically destabilized climate, and structured
by unprecedented levels of material damage and psychological
trauma.]{.underline} [It might be a technical victory for the
U.S.]{.underline} within the logics of the Cold War system as the film
claims, [but a planetary cataclysm nonetheless, all achieved in less
than a day of warfare.]{.underline} The Power of Decision offers no
insight into the cause or logic of the Soviet attack or considers the
existence of the nuclear war machine itself, opting for a factual
treatment of machines, vectors, targets, and casualties. **[There is no
room for diplomacy in this vision---only military action. What is also
lost in the description of closed world machines and nuclear delivery
systems is the extraordinary amount of work that it took to build a
global doomsday system.]{.underline}** With each frame the nuclear
fetish is ever more naturalized in this filmic production, making
catastrophe the basis for state power rather than a feat of human
engineering that could simply be dismantled or not extended in the name
of collective security. Indeed, after 1958, the U.S. nuclear arsenal
only grows in both numbers and explosive power, reaching a peak of over
35,000 nuclear weapons by the end of the 1960s, enough to destroy every
major city on the planet many times over. U.S. "defense" remains to this
day founded on the ability to strike anywhere on planet earth, and to
destroy all major population centers outside the U.S., within a few
minutes of nuclear warfare. Culturally, [this notion of the end---of a
nuclear strike that obliterates totally and almost instantaneously---has
come to define American notions of the cataclysmic. **From nuclear war
to the war on terror, U.S. security logics are structured by fear of the
surprise attack that is constituted as both imminent and
complete.**]{.underline} To a remarkable degree, [nuclear fear has been
coded into the idea of disaster itself in American culture, allowing
counter-formations that attempt to be equally total, equally surprising,
equally violent.]{.underline} In this way, building a counter-communist
state during the Cold War (and, a counter-terror state today) has relied
on certain images of the end, promoted and magnified via official state
systems as a means of affectively mobilizing diverse publics and
experts. With constant technological improvements in missiles and
warhead design, speed soon became a particular problem in the nuclear
age. By the 1960s, the technological terms of nuclear war had advanced
to such an extent that the entire system had to be slowed down to allow
human decision-making in the midst of crisis. Everything from the
telephone hot line between U.S. and Soviet leaders (established after
the Cuban Missile Crisis) to nuclear war plans themselves were
structured around the realization that a nuclear war could start before
there was time for a political debate or alternative action to launching
a full counter-strike.25 The always-on-alert system of
missiles-bombers-submarines armed with thermonuclear weapons made not
launching a nuclear war a minute-to-minute calculus, and then
naturalized that restraint as the basis of "defense". In psycho-social
terms, this means that Americans have lived for more than half a century
in the temporal space in which the missiles may have always already been
launched---that is, within the 15-minute window offered by early warning
systems[. The nuclear cataclysm thus may have always already happened,
with simply the global fallout to be negotiated.]{.underline} **[Nuclear
crisis has in this way come to structure our very idea of crisis, where
the sudden shock of a total ending becomes the basis for thinking
large-scale threat. The slow and slower violences of capital, energy,
health, and environment become difficult to see as forms of cataclysmic
violence precisely because nuclear war offers Americans so perfect and
speedy an image of the end]{.underline}**.26 [Our notions of catastrophe
today have been crafted by the nuclear system, which invented a
machinery and imaginary of ultimate endings. This concept of
danger---totalizing and short---is forever at odds with nontotalizing
violences, cataclysms of slower duration, and particularly threats that
exceed the power of the nation-state itself.]{.underline}

### Russia -- Disinformation

#### The 1AC securitizes Russian disinformation threat -- constructing uniquely Russian AI attacks.

University "Securitization of Disinformation in NATO Lexicon: A
Computational Text Analysis"
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4040148)

[Our analysis has shown that NATO has developed two
disinformation-related communication strategies for two
outlets:]{.underline} a more up-to-date and faster-developing threat
discourse for its Twitter presence, and a more traditional, slow-moving
threat presence visible in its official documents. This is particularly
interesting and acutely visible in more 20th century military topics
like command and control cohesion, missile defense, air defense
architecture, naval defense, satellites and military
intelligence-related topics that are more frequently mentioned in
official documents, and much less referenced on Twitter. [However, the
overwhelming majority of disinformation, misinformation, hybrid war,
information warfare and fake news-related communication topics are
securitized on Twitter]{.underline}. This shows the emergence of two
NATO discourses: one for its official documents, and one for its social
media presence and messaging. The advent of digital communication
technologies and social media has been significant for the evolution of
securitization. [Since **[securitization entails production and
dissemination]{.mark}** of [**insecurity** **frames through discursive
networks**]{.mark}, a more **[dynamic, interconnected information
ecosystem]{.mark}** is **[more conducive for collective
meaning-making.]{.mark}**]{.underline} On social media, the formation of
insecurity processes are more rapid and interactive, and are able to
influence and alter traditional, boring securitizing acts of elites. To
that end, media outlets like Twitter provide a more interactive and
fast-paced securitizing environment where elites and non-elites can set
the security agenda and mobilize masses. The most clear expression of
this novel medium, as demonstrated in our results, is that NATO's
Twitter securitization efforts change much faster, and spread more
widely than traditional outlets like official speeches, texts and
reports. This could be interpreted in two ways: first, that NATO may
prefer securitizing disinformation exclusively on Twitter, since such
threats are generally more visible and debated on social media
platforms. The second interpretation is that NATO's official statements
and documents could largely be focusing on macrolevel doctrinal issues
that pose a direct military security threat to its members, rather than
disinformation, which is a nuisance, but poses no direct military
threat. Since disinformation is being discussed in contemporary policy
debates within the context of electoral integrity and social
polarization, their actual military relevance may be less relevant to be
taken into account in formal NATO documents. [In either case, our study
of the [NATO lexicon]{.mark} [demonstrated]{.mark} that
[disinformation]{.mark} and related terms [are constructed as uniquely
'Russian' nuisances]{.mark}.]{.underline} This isn't surprising since
most of these terms - at least their digital interpretations - have
entered the NATO lexicon after the Russian military involvement in
eastern Ukraine and Crimea. However, since then, Russia remained the
only country against which NATO has constructed its disinformation
narratives, indicating that Russia is NATO's sole disinformation
concern. Although very recently China has emerged as a runner-up country
within the context of COVID-related disinformation concerns, Russia is
largely the main threat in NATO's lexicon. This could be
counterproductive to long-term NATO efforts to combat disinformation,
given the global prevalence of fake news and information meddling. While
Russian disinformation efforts are observably valid, cornering a
universal problem like disinformation into the limited space of NATO's
interactions with a single country may lead to conceptual contraction.
This in turn, may prevent NATO from mobilizing full alliance resources
against disinformation, defined as a global and universal problem.
Overall, our analysis has shown that NATO still defines its security
identity against Russia, and there isn't a significant shift in NATO's
securitization dynamics since the Cold War, evidenced by our comparative
analysis of older and newer NATO texts. [Although Chinese disinformation
attempts have also begun to enter into NATO threat language, **[NATO's
primary discursive security identity continues]{.mark}** to **[develop
against]{.mark}** and around **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is
most evident in our longitudinal analysis or pre- and post-2014
documents that prioritize Russia as a threat alike, implying that it is
not really disinformation or fake news agenda that is rendering Russia a
threat for NATO. [This suggests the hypothesis that [even if
tech]{.mark}nologies [change, NATO Russia rivalry]{.mark} will [remain
securitized]{.mark} the same way. In other words, contemporary
disinformation and fake news agenda is a continuation of the same
NATO-Russia rivalry -- at least in discursive form -- through newer
mediums.]{.underline}

The current condition of relations between Russia and the West, which

elimination of the institutions providing the architecture of regional
and global security.

[Both [Russia and NATO are concerned about ensuring their
security.]{.mark} [Russian actions to strengthen]{.mark} their
[defenses]{.mark} (modernization of the army, military exercises) [are
viewed by NATO as a threat to the security of its member
countries.]{.mark} At the same time, [the expansion of NATO to the
east]{.mark} (the admission of Eastern European countries into the ranks
of the Alliance, with the ensuing conduct of military exercises, the
introduction of Western standards, and the creation of new military
infrastructure) [is viewed by Russia as bringing the Alliance closer to
the Russian borders.]{.mark} Here [we see a classic manifestation of the
\"zero-sum game\" when the success of one side in defending its security
is perceived by the other side as a threat to its security and leads to
countermeasures.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Moreover, [[it's possible to use the concept of

[[Official documents]{.underline}]{.mark} in the field of security, such

the Alliance member-states, [[define each other in the categories of
"military threats" (in case of Russia) and immediate existential threats
(in case of NATO and member countries).]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The
parties]{.mark} concerned or [\"securitized]{.mark}\" certain [aspects
of international interaction]{.mark}: [they translate them into the
category of threats to the existence or integrity of the state or
security in the region, which makes it possible to use or \"legitimize\"

[[The situation is complicated by]{.mark} the use of [images of \"friend

The changed framing of Russia may thus help explain how EU energy policy
experienced recent change.

### Tech -- Dual Use

#### The aff's threat construction of dual-use technology causes security dilemmas

[A dual-use security dilemma occurs when actors face an opponent that
wields technologies with both civil and military/harmful applications.
In developing this concept of the dual-use security dilemma, I build on
traditional and constructivist approaches to security.]{.underline}
Following traditional security scholars, I suggest that uncertainty
shapes actors' behavior and argue that we can extend the concept of
security dilemma to capture the dynamics around the threat of dual-use
technologies. However, these uncertainties, and actors' responses, are
also socially constructed and shaped by knowledge and social
understandings. [From a traditional security perspective, [the dual-use
security dilemma extends the dynamics of policy makers' fears around an
opponent's defensive or offensive intentions to include the fear of the
potentially harmful civil technologies.]{.mark}]{.underline} Policy
makers are uncertain whether the opponents have harmful intentions in
using the technology. But the potential of their using or adapting the
technology for harmful purposes, even over the long term, creates
insecurity and may spur policy makers to take measures to address the
threat. [Similar to the traditional security dilemma, these measures can
influence an opponent's behavior, leading it to acquire military means
or even to make military use of the dual-use technology.]{.underline}
Furthermore, and also like the traditional security dilemma, these
dynamics may spiral, aggravating the actors' security. Even actors whose
aim was to develop technology solely for civil purposes may find
themselves in an arms race or a costly situation. While militarily
arming a civilian project can be very expensive (for both sides),
failing to respond to a military project because of its civilian
characteristics can also be very costly. From a constructivist approach,
the dilemma is shaped by how the insecurity is constructed. Insecurity
is not given, but rather is socially produced through actors calling
attention to certain issues and mobilizing support to address them.
Moreover, how a technology is applied---for peaceful or military
purposes---is also socially determined. This means a technology's
dual-usage is influenced not only by its technical characteristics, but
also by international norms, by how it is conceived, and by how
knowledge is mediated by socio-scientific agents. [[Seeing a technology
as dual-use allows an actor to construct it as a(n) (existential)
threat, even if the technology is developed for civil
purposes.]{.underline}]{.mark} The dilemma, then, is whether or not to
securitize[. While [securitizing]{.mark} a potential challenge carries
the advantage of preparing for a threat and mobilizing support for
certain policy measures, it [can]{.mark} also [contribute to a spiral
insecurity dynamic. Once a technology has been acknowledged as dual-use,
an enunciator can take advantage of the accompanying uncertainty of how
the technology will be used. They can securitize an opponent\'s dual-use
technology to justify taking extraordinary measures to address
it---regardless of the opponent's intentions around developing the
technology's military/harmful applications.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Furthermore, the very act of securitizing an opponent's technology
without taking any extraordinary measures---can alarm an opponent, who
then initiates a securitizing reaction. [[All these may result in a
securitizing chain reaction that decreases both actors'
security.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Terrorism

#### The 1AC's representations of terrorism are racialized threat constructions that boost Islamophobia- Trump's administration proves 

**Kronfeld 18-** a philosophy doctorate student at Rutgers University

Threats in the Post-Cold War Era and the Evolution of American National
Security Policy "
https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/57350/PDF/1/play/ //mj

When employing crisis discourse to frame the threat of terrorism,
[[Trump has consistently]{.mark} [engaged in]{.mark} the amplified,
[fear-mongering rhetoric]{.mark} necessary [for high level
prioritization]{.mark}]{.underline}, as depicted in Chapter Four. Crisis
discourse plays on American fears of threats to its values and
principles. Morgan Marietta, et. al. argues [[Trump has been successful
at]{.mark}, "[melding threat]{.mark} and absolutism [into]{.mark} the
[absolutist threat]{.mark}" [by grounding rhetoric in]{.mark} the
context of [threats to personal safety]{.mark}]{.underline}.1476 And
[[linking foreign policy to national identity]{.mark},]{.underline} as
explored in the Chapter Two, [[is a powerful]{.mark} rhetorical [tool
and critical framing mechanism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Oz Hassan writes,
[[Trump securitized Islam through Islamophobia and Orientalism, making
Muslims an existential threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}1477 Like his
predecessors, Micah Zenko writes, [[Trump]{.mark} has succeeded in
[depict]{.mark}ing [terrorism as a 'monolithic
enemy]{.mark}]{.underline}.'1478 [Trump has described terrorism, as "[a
tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country
understand]{.mark}]{.underline}."1479 In his inaugural address, the
President declared, "[we will unite the civilized world against radical
Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of
the Earth.]{.underline}"1480 [[Trump]{.mark} has [stated he would
'demolish']{.mark} and 'destroy' [ISIS]{.mark} [and]{.mark} vowed to
['eradicate' the threat of 'radical Islamic terrorism]{.mark}.'1481 And
following the August attacks in Spain, [Trump declared terrorism must be
stopped "by any means necessary.]{.mark}"]{.underline}1482 But this
further illustrates continuity across administrations. As Zenko notes,
Bush, Obama and Trump have all suggested, "tough-sounding but
implausible objectives."1483 But Trump's discourse tends to differ is in
the amplification of certain elements of the threat. For example, [[the
administration frequently employs the term 'radical Islamist terrorism,'
and]{.mark} he [has referred to terrorists as 'lawless savages', 'savage
killers' and 'horrible enemies.'14]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Impact

### 1NC -- Cyclical Insecurity

#### Attempts to resolve insecurity inevitably fail and creates violent cycles pursuing security -- the elimination of one threat necessitates the production of other threats to manage generalized anxiety

**Eberle and Daniel, 2022**

(Jakub, Research Director at the Institute of International Relations
Prague, and Jan, researcher and the Head of the Centre for the Study of
Global Regions at the Institute of International Relations Prague,
"Anxiety geopolitics: Hybrid warfare, civilisational geopolitics, and
the Janus-faced politics of anxiety," Political Geography, Vol. 92,
January 2022, Article 102502,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102502, accessed 6/30/2022, ZW)

On the other hand, however, [the Lacanian take allows us to
account]{.underline} also [for]{.underline} [the politics]{.underline}
that is [imminent in the failure of these anxiety-managing
attempts]{.underline}. As we have argued, [all narratives built around
particular objects of fear]{.underline}, including geopolitical ones,
[are eventually failing, as these objects are ultimately 'false
targets'.]{.underline} They are merely temporary discursive vessels
functioning as placeholders for expressing deeper ontological anxiety,
which is bound to strike back. Consequently, [attempts to make societies
(feel) more secure]{.underline}, habitually [end up making them (feel)
equally, or even more, insecure and anxious]{.underline}, regardless of
how much effort is invested into fighting this or that particular
threat. As Heath-Kelly (2015, 2018) and Jacobsen (2020) have shown,
[successful security discourses like counter-terrorism or cybersecurity
have actually managed to internalise this 'failure to
secure']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015) [by incorporating it into their
very structure]{.underline}. According to them, [counter-terrorism and
cybersecurity are constructed as dangers so slippery and multifaceted
that once we resolve one problem]{.underline} (by killing Osama bin
Laden, resolving a particular cyberthreat), [a whole new range of
terrorist groups or cyber issues emerges to occupy their
place.]{.underline}

Consequently, and in contrast to conventional ontological security
literature, [politics of anxiety is not only about managing and
repressing it through narratives, routines and relationships. It is also
about other ways of manipulating anxiety for political
purposes]{.underline}, [including reproducing, nurturing and spreading
it via the construction of threats so opaque and widespread]{.underline}
that [they]{.underline} [cannot be possibly resolved]{.underline}, [like
terrorism, cybersecurity -- or hybrid warfare.]{.underline} By its
repeated failure to secure, [such discourses hold societies in the
anxious 'state of constant and heightened alertness']{.underline}
(Davies, 2019, p. xii), [making them ready to accept a range of
pre-emptive security measures across all possible areas of social
life.]{.underline}

Bringing the argument together, by the notion of anxiety geopolitics we
conceptualise the politics of dealing with anxiety by linking it to
objects and issues spatialised through the means of geopolitical
imaginations. By references to geographical categories, such as states,
regions, continents or civilisations, this type of affective geopolitics
promises to transform the amorphous and ambiguous anxiety stemming from
range of different issues into tangible and manageable objects of fear
taking the form of geopolitical threats. Yet, [as all such narratives
and images are ultimately bound to fail to resolve the underlying
anxiety]{.underline}, the [analytical focus must be extended also to how
these failures are accounted for and how anxiety is being further
reproduced with the help of geopolitical imaginations]{.underline}.
Therefore, [anxiety geopolitics is ultimately about the oscillation
between repressing anxiety through]{.underline} the [geopoliticisation
of]{.underline} both [the 'threat' and the self, as much as it is about
dealing with the recurring failures to secure]{.underline} the [subjects
produced by such geopoliticisation]{.underline}, [which result in
reproduction of social anxiety.]{.underline}

a diplomatic breakthrough. There was no agreement on [substantive policy

such as arms control, the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, and
trade disputes. While the summit may ultimately ease tensions in the
medium-term, the two countries were less inclined to agree on a
framework that would encourage a more conciliatory approach. Part of the
difficulty appears to be a political atmosphere that is increasingly
hostile to diplomacy and a rising disposition to framing competition in
security terms. The occasional rhetoric of non-confrontation aside,

#### Securitization of China for Western self imagination leads to actual conflicts

**Song 15**(Weiqing Song, chinese university of hong kong press, 2015,
Securitization of the \"China Threat\" Discourse: A Poststructuralist
Account, Jstor, https://www.jstor.org/stable/24291932?seq=1) TG

A few researchers diverge from the mainstream response to this

issue. Oliver Turner, for example, highlights the ideational rather than
material factors in the processes of representing the China threat
complicit in the U.S.--China policy.13 [[He argues]{.underline}]{.mark}
that the main purpose of [[these processes]{.underline}]{.mark} is to
[[create]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[threatening Chinese
identity]{.underline}]{.mark}, foreign to that of the United States,
[[to trigger actions that reinforce the binary opposition between the
two countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. Before Turner and in the same vein,
Pan takes a poststructuralist discursive approach to interpreting the
role of the China threat within the U.S. political discourse. He focuses
on the "discursive construction of otherness" by which China is
fashioned as a "threatening, absolute other" to the "US-led evolutionary
scheme."14 Much of Pan's discussion of this issue is devoted to real
policy implications, namely [[the risk]{.underline}]{.mark} that
considering "theory as practice" in U.S. policy [[will give rise to a
real "China threat.]{.underline}]{.mark}"15 He further expands his scope
of enquiry by deconstructing the Western representation of China's rise.
To him, [[dominant Western perceptions of China's rise tell us less
about China and more about Western self-imagination and its desire for
certainty.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## Alternative

### 1NC -- Reject Alt

#### The alternative is to reject the 1AC's securitized representations -- threat construction is [only possible]{.underline} in a world of discursive repetition -- voting negative endorses a discursive model that does not endorse securitization as a model of understanding the world

**Van Rythoven 14** (Eric Van Rythoven, PhD candidate at Carleton
University studying emotion, securitization, and world politics,
E-international Relations, December 21,
<https://www.e-ir.info/2014/12/21/emotion-and-dystopian-idealism-in-security-studies/>)
SW

The recent forum on emotions and world politics in the journal
International Theory is a welcome development for the field of
International Relations. The contributors helpfully remind us that
emotions research in IR remains hampered by a number of deeply embedded
assumptions, such as the belief that emotions are only private and
personal phenomena, or the belief there is a sharp dichotomy between
emotion and rationality. Critically assessing these assumptions is
important not only because it highlights what the discipline gets
'wrong' in its picture of world politics, but because it illuminates how
current theories help to propagate such distortions.

In this brief intervention I focus on an additional assumption
concerning emotion, one which permeates the subfield of security
studies.  Here I am referring to the widely shared belief in the
ubiquity of [fear in the politics of security]{.underline}.  While this
association is historically rooted in Hobbesian accounts of anarchy it
has a distinct contemporary form.  [Fear]{.underline}, we are told by a
variety of figures, [permeates the politics of security and is
consistently and successfully marshalled by political elites, security
professionals, and bureaucrats to sustain new images of threat which
lead to an ever broadening security agenda.]{.underline}  [Fear, whether
over predatory great powers, immigrant minorities, or infectious
diseases, facilitates securitization]{.underline}.  As a latent social
resource collective fears always appear to be waiting patiently in the
margins of discourse until they are easily and unproblematically
deployed in a security argument.

These kinds of arguments radically underplay the fragility and
contingency of political fears.  As forms of collective embodied
judgment political fears are produced and sustained only through social
interactions.  As I have argued elsewhere the memories, traumas,
practices, rituals, symbols, and other cultural resources which sustain
political fears are always open to contestation and destabilization (Van
Rythoven, forthcoming).  Yet in security studies the logic of fear as a
relatively settled and stable substance which can be drawn upon to serve
narrow, instrumental purposes enjoys wide appeal.  The consequence is a
particular form of dystopian theory, a distorting idealism which ignores
both the empirical fragility of fears, as well as the often dispersed
power struggles which shape this emotion in a multitude of differing
ways.

To appreciate the breadth of this assumption in the field it is useful
to begin by looking at two highly disparate figures: Stephen Walt and
Didier Bigo.  Walt has become the essential flag bearer for a
conventional neorealism that continues to define the mainstream of
security studies in America.  Bigo's contribution to [the]{.underline}
so-called 'Paris School' has made him a central figure in critical
security studies which has grown exponentially outside of the heartland
of American IR ([CASE,
2006](http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/37/4/443.short)).  While both hold
sharply divergent [understandings of security]{.underline}, method, [and
the purposes of its study they are surprisingly similar in their view of
the relationship between fear and threat construction.]{.underline} 
Nowhere is this more evident than in the close resemblance between their
respective figures of the 'threat monger' and 'the manager of unease'.

The figure of the threat monger is most evident in Walt's contemporary
work, especially his popular writings for [Foreign
Policy](http://foreignpolicy.com/author/stephen-walt/).  Here the
concern is not with the international system, anarchy, the balance of
power, nor any other of the concepts normally associated with neorealist
theory.  Instead the most pressing issue is the persistent and
pernicious practice of threat inflation.  The dangers facing the
national security apparatus in western states are vastly overblown. 
Everything from the safety of the Olympics, to the danger of
international terrorism, to the neologism of [cyber
security]{.underline}, to the [threat]{.underline} of global warming are
[vastly blown out of proportion]{.underline}, [especially relative to
the traditional danger of interstate conflict]{.underline}
(Walt, [2012](http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/13/what-terrorist-threat/#.UClvYIJhDFA.twitter), [2010](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/03/30/is-the-cyber-threat-overblown/), [2009b](http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/08/10/national-security-heats-up/)). 
[Instead of objectively discerning national security demands from the
material distribution of power, the United States' security agenda has
become bloated with a host of inflated threats.]{.underline}  In Walt's
view "\[o\]ne reason [Americans exaggerate security fears]{.underline}
is the existence of an extensive cottage industry of professional
threatmongers, [who deploy a well-honed array of arguments to convince
us that we are in fact in grave danger]{.underline}"
([2009a](http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/05/04/the-threatmongers-handbook/)). 
Through a variety of argumentative techniques threat mongers are able to
engender fear in the American public over the threat of some dangerous
'other'.  Such "tried-and-true methods do not work all of the time, of
course, but they are undeniably effective" (Ibid).  Here fear receives
little scrutiny.  It is simply a latent social resource activated by the
discursive performance of the monger which helps wins audience approval.

Bigo's ([2002](http://alt.sagepub.com/content/27/1_suppl/63.extract):66)
examination of the security profession, "with its ethos of secrecy and
concern for the management of fear or unease", bears more than a passing
resemblance to Walt's threat monger.  His concern with those who work in
the professional field of security, spanning from government
bureaucracies, police, intelligence agencies, militaries, and their
private partners, comes as a reaction to [earlier
approaches](https://books.google.ca/books?id=j4BGr-Elsp8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=security+a+new+framework+for+analysis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XtuRVMHnOYv9yQSi3oCABQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=security%20a%20new%20framework%20for%20analysis&f=false) narrowly
focused on highly publicized security speech acts.  The social
production of danger, [Bigo argues, is in part sustained by the "sense
of the routines, the day-to-day practices, of the bureaucracies" who
produces both insecurity over policy fields like migration and the
techniques of governance to respond (Ibid, 73).  Like Walt's monger
however, this task is only made possible through the deft generation and
management of fear.  Security professionals partake in a broader
discursive formation where "the word immigration becomes a term for
catalyzing fears or misgivings about the economic, social, and political
development of Western countries. It becomes a fixer of frights and
confusions about national cultural identities as well as of weaknesses
of solidarity mechanisms" (Ibid, 79 emphasis original).  It is through
this capacity to affix specific frights to distinct programs of
governance, especially through institutionalized routines, that the
securitization of issues like migration is possible.]{.underline}

The differences between Walt and Bigo cannot be underplayed.  For Walt
the polemical description of the monger is necessary because these
actors recklessly inflate threats above and beyond what is objectively
reasonable based upon the current international environment[.  Bigo
rejects the very framing of threat inflation as it presupposes some
mythical baseline from which 'true' assessments of threat can be
discerned.  Security issues in this view are always historically
situated reflections of particular interests and modes of
governance.]{.underline}

Yet this deep philosophical divide over threat construction is what
makes the convergence between the figure of the threat monger and the
manager of unease all the more striking.  Both Walt and Bigo envisage a
collection of actors whom, with predictable and institutionalized
regularity, engage in a series of discursive moves which couple latent
fears with a distinct security agenda.  These fears, which never seem to
be in short supply, are amplified, managed, and molded to the
instrumental purposes of these actors.  Both present an array of
techniques, such as the creation of categories of identity, which can be
used to circulate fear, or as Walt pithily puts it "\[h\]ow to scare
your fellow citizens for fun and profit" (2009a).  Though the nuances
surrounding these figures differ when it comes to their central role in
leveraging fear to produce a collectively shared image of threat they
are the same.  The manager of unease is the threat monger and vice
versa.

[This is a permissive view of threat construction.  Practices of
securitization are not simply relatively frequent occurrences, they also
achieve a high rate of success.  In the strongest form of this view the
deliberative, rule-driven, liberal order of world politics is constantly
abridged by the emergency politics of security.  This distinctly
dystopian view is sustained by both the assumed ubiquity of fear and its
unproblematic instrumentalization]{.underline}.

[The concept of dystopia employed here is best understood through its
resemblance to earlier critiques of utopianism in IR]{.underline}. 
These began with E.H. Carr's Twenty Years Crisis in which [he chastises
interwar liberals for a utopian view which grossly exaggerated the ease
and possibility of international peace.]{.underline}  More recently
Samuel Barkin has [revived the concept in his critique of contemporary
American constructivism whose progressive view of the spread of
humanitarian and democratic norms is eerily reminiscent of Carr's
utopian liberals
([2003](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1079-1760.2003.00503002.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false):332-336). 
The utopian label functions as a shorthand for highlighting two
fundamental defects in thinking about world politics.  The first is
empirical.  For Barkin the norms that are the locus of liberal
constructivism "are accepted largely uncritically as good ones, as are
the elements of international civil society involved in spreading these
norms" (Ibid, 335).  There is little empirical interest in 'bad' norms
or what might be considered malignant forms of international civil
society.  Carr explicitly positions empirical 'reality' as the opposite
to utopianism with the latter being "the product of not analysis, but of
aspiration"
([2001\[1981\]](https://books.google.ca/books?id=Gbz_EsWbioUC&dq=twenty+years+crisis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BOWRVPu4E6yxsATrkIKIDA&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA):7). 
The second feature of this critique concerns the absence of
power. ]{.underline} On this point Barkin repeats familiar criticisms of
liberal norms-centered research: that it fails to consider why certain
norms spread and others don't, or why some norms are actively resisted
(2003:335).  Carr argues the "\[f\]ailure to recognize that power is an
essential element of politics has hitherto vitiated all attempts to
establish international forms of government" (2001\[1981\]:100).

While utopia and reality are often presented as opposing mirror
images--especially by Carr--this ignores how political idealism comes in
different forms.  Dystopianism is a form of political idealism but
instead of exaggerating the prospect of liberal progressiveness it
exaggerates illiberal regression.  Security studies has become dystopian
insofar as it has come to fetishize the illiberal character of emergency
politics.  While utopianism envisions few substantive limits to the
expansion of liberal order, the dystopianism of security studies sees
few limits on the expansion of the concept of security.  Walt's threat
monger and Bigo's manager of unease face no limits on invoking emergency
politics because of their unparalleled ability to instrumentalize fear.

Yet because this position is fundamentally idealist it is also subject
to the same lines of critique as liberal idealism.  Empirically [there
is a wealth of evidence]{.underline} (and common sense) [to suggest
collective fears are fragile, fugitive, and fickle phenomenon rather
than the stable, steady, and settled social resources which can be
reliably deployed in a security argument]{.underline}.  Wendy Pearlman's
rich ethnographic account of the Arab Spring for example, is centered
precisely on the breakdown of collective fears over violent reprisal
from authoritarian governments.  Analogous to the figures discussed
above, [authoritarian "\[p\]owerholders]{.underline} \[in the Middle
East\] [wield]{.underline}ed [fear as a tool for survival, enforcing it
with security apparatuses and state discourses that warned that the
alternative to the regime was chaos]{.underline} or Islamic radicalism"
([Pearlman,
2013](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8923772&fileId=S1537592713001072):393). 
Pearlman's account of revolution in Tunisia and Egypt is peppered with
references to the overcoming or breaking down of fear, something
captured in the popular expression "inkasar hajez al-khawf" meaning "The
barrier of fear has broken" (Ibid, 388).

[Even in instances where a broadly-based collective fear does emerge it
may lack the historical durability to sustain any lasting vision of
emergency politics.  Anxiety]{.underline} within in western [countries
over the spread of Ebola]{.underline} from West Africa [reached a
fevered pitch in the Fall of 2014. ]{.underline} When asked in October
65% of Americans said they were concerned about the possibility of a
nationwide epidemic ([Washington Post-ABC News Poll,
2014](http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/14/National-Politics/Polling/release_366.xml)). 
Citing Ebola as "a potential threat to global security" the Obama
administration deployed 3,000 military personnel to West Africa ([Mason
and Harding Giahyue,
2014](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/16/us-health-ebola-obama-idUSKBN0HB08S20140916)). 
[Yet by November declining media coverage, eroding public interest, and
empty congressional meetings suggested **popular
anxieties**]{.underline} over the disease had largely
**[evaporated]{.underline}** ([Koren,
2014](http://www.nationaljournal.com/health-care/have-americans-stopped-caring-about-ebola-20141113); [Ferris,
2014](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/224758-as-ebola-attention-fades-lawmakers-beg-for-spotlight)). 
[By December]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} administration
[was]{.underline} left [struggling to revitalize anxieties over Ebola to
sustain a security response]{.underline}.  In a plea for a further a
further \$6 billion of emergency funding to maintain the response Obama
urged that the crisis "can't get caught up in normal politics" ([Hughes,
2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-presses-congress-on-ebola-funding/article/2556874)).

The fact that [political actors]{.underline} so often [struggle and
strain to preserve]{.underline} the [underlying sense of anxiety and
crisis surrounding a security issue points to a precarious set of power
relations surrounding emotions. ]{.underline} To be clear, scholars like
Walt and Bigo offer very rich conceptions of power within their
research.  [Walt's neorealism carries an explicit view of material state
power]{.underline} even if this view is difficult to square with his
popular writings focused on security discourses.  Bigo offers a much
richer conceptualization of power which draws on both the constitutive
force of speech acts as well as the positional authority of the security
profession (2002:73-74).  While [these forms of power]{.underline} are
important they do not necessarily shape collective emotions which **[can
be situated in a much more dispersed sets of cultural
practices]{.underline}**. Consider, for example, Stephen Hawking's
recent claim that the emergence of artificial intelligence could
threaten humanity.  This claim likely resonated well in societies such
as the United States where films and texts in popular culture have long
envisioned autonomous robots as dangerous ([Brasor,
2014](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/12/06/national/media-national/cultural-differences-shade-reactions-robots/#.VImzsTHF-Sq)). 
Contrast this with how "Japan's tendency to imbue machines with sentient
qualities reflects certain native religious precepts" (Ibid).  [Machines
which may be culturally identified as objects of fear in one society may
be objects of comfort, sentimentality, and even happiness in
another.]{.underline}  In certain cases **[pre-existing cultural
practices may sharply circumscribe the power of authoritative speech to
generate collective fears.]{.underline}**

[Characterizing security studies as dystopian for its disregard of the
power relations and empirics surrounding emotions may seem
questionable.  Such accusations]{.underline} of idealism often [come to
be understood as a form of insult]{.underline} (Barkin, 2003:332).  Yet
[given how these views of fear have such broad and longstanding status
within security studies a provocation]{.underline}, in a sense, [is
necessary.  There is]{.underline} however, an additional [value to this
framing of dystopia.  If any prolonged scrutiny of emotions finds the
dystopian view of security studies to be unsustainable, then it raises
questions over what kinds of worlds do collective emotions in world
politics actually contribute to]{.underline}?  The answers to this
question are bound to be more complex than simplistic utopias or
dystopias, but they also promise to be far more interesting.

### Critique Key to Policy -- Hybrid Warfare

#### Our criticism is key to policy-making -- threat construction undermines credible threat identification, produces ineffective responses, and perpetuates anxiety rooted in Orientalism

**Eberle and Daniel, 2022**

(Jakub, Research Director at the Institute of International Relations
Prague, and Jan, researcher and the Head of the Centre for the Study of
Global Regions at the Institute of International Relations Prague,
"Anxiety geopolitics: Hybrid warfare, civilisational geopolitics, and
the Janus-faced politics of anxiety," Political Geography, Vol. 92,
January 2022, Article 102502,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102502, accessed 6/30/2022, ZW)

Introducing anxiety geopolitics as a conceptual linchpin between
disparate arguments from debates on critical geopolitics, ontological
security, and politics of anxiety, this article made two central
contributions. First, [we]{.underline} have [theorised the relationship
between geopolitics and anxiety]{.underline}, moving beyond the existing
accounts above all by [pointing out the Janus-faced character of anxiety
geopolitics, in which anxiety is both repressed and
reproduced]{.underline}. Second, using the case of Czechia,
[we]{.underline} have [argued]{.underline} that [hybrid warfare is a
discourse that constantly oscillates between repressing anxiety by
geopoliticising the source of danger in East/West terms, and subverting
its own constructions by presenting the threats as insidious, invisible,
and constantly shifting]{.underline}. Therefore, we contend that the [HW
discourse is structured in a way that cannot achieve its purported
ambition to secure populations against 'hybrid threats' and instead ends
up producing more insecurity and anxiety.]{.underline}

[Our argument has clear normative implications]{.underline} that expand
the existing criticisms of HW [by putting]{.underline} the [underlying
civilisational geopolitics in spotlight]{.underline}. This should
[help]{.underline} us [challenge]{.underline} the [technology-centred
presentism of]{.underline} the [HW discourse, showing]{.underline} that
[many]{.underline} of the [ostensibly unprecedented concerns
are]{.underline} in fact [reheated versions of narratives that date back
decades if not centuries]{.underline}. More importantly, [it enables us
to point to the presence of some of the highly problematic aspects of
East/West thinking, especially those]{.underline} that have been
[rightly criticised as Orientalist, chauvinist or]{.underline} even
[racist]{.underline} (see e.g. Said, 1978; Todorova, 2009). Realising
the presence of civilisational geopolitics makes it possible to ask
whether certain portrayals of Russia in HW debates -- e.g. as barbaric,
irrational, irredeemable -- may not represent narcissistic projections
of the 'Western' self, rather than credible threat assessments
(Chernobrov, 2019). Importantly, [these are not scholastic matters of
concern just for ivory-tower peaceniks]{.underline}, as the proponents
of HW sometimes like to put it. Instead, [these criticisms have clear
implications for security policy]{.underline}. As [recognised even among
NATO's own analysts and officials]{.underline} (Caliskan & Li´egeois,
2020; Rühle, 2019), [adopting]{.underline} the prism of [HW and
labelling Russia as an inherently irrational enemy is detrimental
to]{.underline} leading a [productive debate on the exact nature of the
challenges that Putin's regime poses and formulating appropriate and
efficient strategies to respond to it.]{.underline} We add to it by
highlighting that the HW discourse not only 'undermines strategic
thinking' (Caliskan & Li´egeois, 2020), but also never actually manages
to provide security and creates highly concerning societal side-effects
(perpetuation of anxiety, proliferation of Orientalist images).

### AT: Ivory Tower/Not Policy-Relevant

#### Critique is engagement with security politics, not an ivory-tower judgement from outside the field -- their interp's rejection of critique ensures worse policy outcomes

**de Goede, 2020**

(Marieke, Professor of Politics with a focus on \'Europe in a Global
Order' at the University of Amsterdam, "Engagement all the way down,"
Critical Studies on Security, Vol. 8, Iss. 2, 2020, pp. 101-115,
https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2020.1792158, accessed 7/2/2022, ZW)

Belgian philosopher Isabelle Stengers -- and her philosophical
companions -- may contribute to exploring the affordances of the
encounter between STS and CSS in relation to thinking critically.
Stengers' writing is substantial, and I do not here claim to be an
expert in her philosophy, nor to be able to do justice to its many
aspects. But her work as a practically engaged philosopher serves as an
inspiration to further pursue the question of critique at the
intersection between STS and CSS. It offers fruitful thinking and
concrete starting points to build on Foucault's notion of specific
intellectuals, but also to push beyond. In fact, [Stengers builds on
Foucault's calls for an 'experimental' critical attitude]{.underline},
which 'put\[s\] itself to the test of reality ... both to grasp the
points where change is possible and desirable, and to determine the
precise form this change should take' (Foucault, quoted in Stengers
2019, 2). With a parallel to 1990s debates on anti-foundationalism in
International Relations that debated whether politics is 'interpretation
all the way down' (Brown 1994; Doty 1997), [Stengers]{.underline} (2019,
19) [proposes that critique is 'engagement all the way
down.']{.underline} This section outlines possible contours of engaged
critique as offered in the work of Stengers and others, to think through
the ways in which these can be drawn upon for a critical analytics of
security.

First, [Stengers]{.underline} (2019, 7) [talks about critical thinking
as a process]{.underline} -- [not a]{.underline} fully formed,
[completed position]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} an 'inchoate'
[practice]{.underline}, that is always [anchored in a concrete
event]{.underline} (like the GMO protest) -- or what Stengers calls a
'questioning situation' (Stengers 2019, 10). There is no safe or stable
outside position from which to launch criticisms, but rather, [critical
thinking is 'immanent to the problematic events and encounters that
force one to think']{.underline} (Savransky 2018, 7).
[Consequently]{.underline}, [Stengers proposes a critical analytical
attitude that seeks to escape the trap of rejecting versus
ratifying]{.underline}, but that is primarily about following. It
entails a notion of politics which 'does not give the specialist the
power of judging, but only the possibility of following the construction
of the salutations that every collectivity brings to the problem'
(Stengers 2000: 60, emphasis in original). To be sure, this [resistance
to the power of judging]{.underline} articulated by Stengers [does not
mean]{.underline} that she claims the possibility of [a 'value-free'
approach]{.underline}. Rather, we should read it through her reliance on
Deleuze, who offers a contrast between judging and evaluating. [Where
judging comprises a 'moral attitude' that appeals to 'transcendent
values (Good/Evil),' evaluating]{.underline}, on the other hand,
[is]{.underline} thought to be '[an ethical attitude that experiments
with the qualitative and intensive difference between modes of
existence]{.underline}' (Zourabichvili 2012, 77).4

To further explore what such a move to 'evaluation' might mean, consider
Annemarie Mol's approach to suspending judgement concerning
critical-philosophical questions, like the question 'what is justice'.
Such questions, Mol writes (drawing on Boltanski and Thévenot)
traditionally demand normative answers and schemata. However, what
happens if we suspend answers, and postpone judgement concerning what is
good or bad justice? Instead, can [we 'listen and follow which ways of
justification are current in a specific field, how these are mobilised
and how these relate to each other]{.underline}' (Mol 2000: 13, my
translation)? [Such a 'philosophy in the wild' reforms]{.underline}
[normative transcendental questions into practical]{.underline},
everyday, [situated evaluations]{.underline}, that ask which ways of
doing exist and which are silenced (Mol 2000). Again, the suggestion is
that evaluation, rather than a judgement, offers the more viable mode of
critique. Closer to CSS, Nyman (2016, 832) suggests we develop a
pragmatist approach to security ethics, which calls for the 'need to
conduct a detailed empirical enquiry \[of security\] to see how
different actors use it in different contexts and how individuals
experience it, asking what do different security practices do.'

Second, what matters to critical analysis, for Stengers, is not to
believe but to practice. Political critique is an uncertain,
adventurous, engagement, not (primarily) a normative positioning. As
Stengers put it during a public debate: 'commoning' is a verb not a
position.5 It is a communal process, a collective doing, the outcomes of
which are uncertain. For Stengers (2019, 18), it means 'participating in
an ongoing, adventurous, unguaranteed, but generative process of making
sense in common.' As Savransky (2018, 6) summarises Stengers'
philosophical intervention: it entails 'an earthly, experimental, and
gripping sort of affair.' Thus, [Stengers invites us to shift registers:
from understanding critique as primarily a normative commitment
or]{.underline} an [ideological position]{.underline} (which then,
secondarily, has to be put into effect), [towards a focus on political
engagement as a mode of practice itself.]{.underline} Consequently, [the
question is not so much, 'can practice theory be a theory of critique?',
but]{.underline} more, '[what happens when we think of critique as a
practice]{.underline}, as a mode of practicing?'

Third, [if critique is a process of engagement]{.underline}, a communal
doing rather than purely a normative positioning, [its outcomes are
uncertain]{.underline}. When we critique, or engage, we do not know what
it will bring, according to Stengers (2019, 13), it demands 'casting our
lot with some ways of living and dying and not others.' [This seeks to
shift the terrain of critique: from battling through 'pregiven
positional structure(s)' to 'a dynamic evaluation']{.underline} (Massumi
2010). Again, this draws on earlier understandings, particularly by Homi
Bhabha, who introduces a temporal an processual element into critical
practice. Bhabha (1994, 25) sees politics and political resistance as a
negotiation rather than a negation, because political engagement can
never be fully counted on to produce the 'mimetic reflection of an a
priori political principle.' What matters in political engagement is 'to
open up a space for translation: a place of hybridity ... where the
construction of a political object that is new, neither the one nor the
other, properly alienates our political expectations' (Bhabha 1994: 25,
emphasis in original). Bhabha's hybrid space is a new opening, something
unpredictable. In Bhabha's reading, [politics has an uncertain,
experimental, grounded character]{.underline}, which means that things
could well go wrong (also Peter 2019). Indeed, [to speak of the failures
of critique is itself problematic, because it remains in the register of
failure and success. If critical praxis is an experiment]{.underline},
then its [measures of failure and success are not fully knowable at the
outset]{.underline} (Sjoberg 2019).

In order to grasp what an engaged critique would look like, how it would
read, look or feel, let us [consider]{.underline} Annemarie [Mol's Body
Multiple, which]{.underline} dissects and [analyses]{.underline} the
[medical practices of]{.underline} the [diagnosis and treatment of
atherosclerosis]{.underline}. The book offers a careful unpacking of the
socio-medical practices of hospital treatment, by 'foregrounding
practicalities, materialities, events' (Mol 2002: 13, emphasis in
original). [Mol shows how the illness is a 'composite
object,']{.underline} that is composed of 'elements that ... may stretch
all the way from the numbers that come out of the vascular laboratory to
the possible future anger of someone's disappointed children' (Mol 2002,
71--72). All these [elements may mix together when the hospital decides
how to treat a patient.]{.underline} Mol adopts a perspective that could
be said to think with doctors, patients, families, hospitals, laboratory
test, surgeons, indicators, vessels and drugs. [Nowhere does Mol condemn
or denounce the doctors]{.underline}. Nowhere does she [debunk Western
medicine or unveil its hidden powers]{.underline}. She does not point at
'the wrongs of medicine in general or at those of the treatment of
atherosclerosis in hospital Z' (185). [At the same time, her book
functions as a profound critique of medical ways of seeing and the
ways]{.underline} in which [hospitals come to know their
patients]{.underline}. It 'makes strange' the ways in which medial
practices sets indicators to reach its stated objectives of 'saving
lives' and 'improving health.' [Her book does not so much offer a way of
'talking about medicine' as a way of 'talking inside it']{.underline}
(185). [Mol offers]{.underline} us [a terminology and a praxiography
that helps shift questions from 'how can we be sure']{.underline} (about
the diagnosis, about the right treatment), [towards 'how to
live]{.underline} with doubt, how to live [in an underdetermined
world']{.underline} (Mol 2002, 165). Mol's ontology of multiples shows
the critical potential of foregrounding practice. [Critique is not a
matter of debunking]{.underline}, in this sense, [but]{.underline} a
matter of [caring]{.underline} -- [through assembling, enriching, and
'adding reality'.]{.underline}

## AT Common 2AC Arguments

### AT: IR Flexible

#### Their insistence on the flexibility of IR presumes white scholars who dominate the field are the agents of change informed by scholars of color relegated to the academic periphery

**Pan, 2021**

(Chengxin, Associate Professor of International Relations at the School
of Humanities and Social Sciences at Deakin University, "Racialised
politics of (in)security and the COVID-19 Westfailure," Critical Studies
on Security, Vol. 9, Iss. 1, 2021, pp. 40-45,
https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2021.1904195, accessed 7/2/2022, ZW)

Of course, [boundaries of zones of (in)security can change. But
redrawing such boundaries is]{.underline} again often the [prerogative
of scholars who self-identify with the 'zone of security']{.underline}.
They routinely play a crucial cartographer's role in mapping and
re-mapping zones of (in)security (Huntington's civilisational map and
the 'Indo-Pacific' come to mind).2 [Their dominance in the process of
knowledge production about (in)security and]{.underline} about
[IR]{.underline} more broadly [exposes]{.underline} [and]{.underline},
indeed, often [solidifies a colour line in academia that mirrors the
racialised realities of IR]{.underline} (see also Henry, and Haastrup
and Hagen 2021). [Scholars of colour]{.underline} and/or from the South
[are]{.underline} at best [treated as area specialists, a lowly ranked
niche in the scholarly epistemic hierarchy]{.underline}, thus
[perpetuating the epistemic status quo that has helped produce the
racially-mediated binaries in security thinking and practice in the
first place.]{.underline}

### AT: Realism Good

#### Realism is an inaccurate lens for understanding IR -- makes NATO inoperable and guarantees escalation

**Sireci and Coletta 09** (Jonathan Sireci and Damon Coletta, Damon V.
Coletta is Professor of Political Science at the United States Air Force
Academy. Jonathan Sireci is a US cadet., Enduring without an enemy:
NATOs realist foundations, Institute of International Relations, 2009.)

[[Difficulties associated with]{.mark} realist reactions to [the
persistence of NATO begin at the foundations of realism]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline} Realism as a theoretical orientation toward the
inter national system supposedly values what is over what should be
(Carr, c1938, 2001: 63). [[When a theory that values]{.mark} cold, hard,
[objective reality as the cornerstone for explaining what will occur
denies something obviously real, like continued NATO activity, the irony
is damning.]{.mark}]{.underline} Beginning with neorealism, the
scientific brand launched by Kenneth Waltz\'s (1979) Theory of
International Politics offered a cogent restructuring of classic realist
thought (Keohane, 1986:14). Waltz addressed Hans Morgenthau\'s failure
to clarify the usage of such central terms as \'power\' and \'balance of
power\' while avoiding the reductionism that weakened previous
formulations. With respect to actors and goals in his theory, [[Waltz
disciplined]{.mark} his [predecessors\']{.mark} ideas, [summing up
states as \'unitary actors]{.mark} [who,]{.mark} at a minimum,
[seek]{.mark} their own [preservation and, at a maximum]{.mark}, drive
for universal [domination]{.mark}\']{.underline} (Ibid.: 13-15). He
argued that the fundamental nature of states leads to balancing in their
interactions. [The position of every state within the structure of
states\' relative capabilities permits a systemic expression of
international order (i.e., bipolarity or multipolarity) (Nye,
1988).]{.underline} [For Waltz, the [Cold War was a classic example of
bipolar power alignment, NATO was]{.mark} fundamentally [linked to
this]{.mark} bipolar power alignment, [and NATO would not survive the
collapse of the Soviet Union]{.mark}]{.underline} because new power
arrangements at the interstate level would render it obsolete (Keohane
and Waltz, 2000-2001). [[Waltz excused the]{.mark} glaring [failure of
neorealism by arguing]{.mark} that]{.underline} the dissolution of the
Soviet threat ultimately allowed American policy to become capricious
(Waltz, 2000). Essentially, he retreated to the notion that [[while
constancy of threat produces constancy of policy, in the absence of
threat, policies become unpredictable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### AT: Tech Development Neutral

#### Tech innovation and dominance isn't a neutral tool, but is an end and object of US security politics to secure the US's self-image -- the instrumentalization thesis is ahistorical and can't explain the form of US innovation policies

**McCarthy, 2021**

(Daniel R., Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University
of Melbourne, "Imagining the security of innovation: technological
innovation, national security, and the American way of life," Critical
Studies on Security, Vol. 9, Iss. 3, 2021, pp. 196-211,
https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2021.1934640, accessed 7/2/2022, ZW)

[Technological innovation is generically viewed in security studies in
an instrumental fashion,]{.underline} as a means to the end of national
power and, thus, national security (Mearsheimer 2001, 62; Taylor, C.,
2004, 602; cf. Kennedy and Lim 2018). [An instrumental
understanding]{.underline} of technological innovation [presents
innovation as context-transcendent and ahistorical]{.underline}.
Essentializing innovation in these terms [makes it difficult to
understand how and why actually existing state innovation policies take
a specific form and]{.underline}, in turn, [how certain forms of
technological innovation become ends in themselves and objects of
security politics.]{.underline}

[Critical security studies and critical international relations
theory]{.underline}, [drawing on]{.underline} the theoretical [resources
of Science and Technology Studies]{.underline} (STS), has begun to
[question this apolitical view of]{.underline} the practice of
[technological innovation]{.underline} (Bourne, Johnson and Lisle 2018;
Bourne 2016; Lisle 2018). Through this work a picture of [innovation
emerges as always political]{.underline}, as [central to the making and
remaking of the state and its security politics]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} article [builds on this shared theoretical impulse
through engagement with the Socio-Technical Imaginaries]{.underline}
(STI) [framework]{.underline} developed by Sheila Jasanoff and
collaborators, whose work has been relatively neglected in International
Relations (IR) to date (Jasanoff and Sang-Hyn 2009; Jasanoff and Kim
2013, 2015; Chenou 2019; McCarthy 2021). STI analyses common-sense
socio-technical imaginaries, understood as encompassing world views.
[These are world-making, informing logics of practical action, their
materialisation in technological infrastructures, and the recreation of
specific forms of political order]{.underline}.
[Imaginaries]{.underline} are pre-theoretical, lacking the reflexivity
of theory proper. As a result, they [are informed by cultural tropes,
myths and narratives, including]{.underline}, as recent work on
cybersecurity has demonstrated, [those found in popular
culture]{.underline} (Dunn Cavelty 2019). [Viewed in these
terms]{.underline}, technological innovation, its security, and its
place in modernity, is recast. Far from being a straightforward
expression of instrumental reason, [technological innovation is a
politically and culturally contested process through which world order
is created and maintained.]{.underline}

Answering the question of why a specific form of technological
innovation is an object of security in US national security policy, this
article argues that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[pursues the national security of technological innovation]{.underline}
in order to [secure its 'way of life' as disclosed by its
socio-technical imaginaries.]{.underline} A 'way of life' is broader
than national identity -- it is a 'combination of patterns of thought
and action that, as it becomes habitual and institutionalized, defines
the thrust and character of a culture and society' (Williams 1980, 12).
Or, in Grove's (2020, 2) more succinct phrase, these are 'ways of being
in the world'. In concrete terms, the [US imaginaries]{.underline}
detailed below [portray market-led innovation as a means to the end of
classic national security goals; technological innovation will not occur
unless]{.underline} it is [enabled by market-based
incentives]{.underline}. Alongside this, the [American policy narratives
assert that market-led technological innovation enables material
practices which express the American national identity]{.underline}. For
heuristic purposes, then, we can separate these world-views into two
elements, a causal account of how technological innovation happens,
including the relationship between different actors, institutions, and
the material incentives they create, and a normative evaluation of these
practices and the threats to them (Taylor. C., 2004, 24--25).
[Technological innovation encapsulates the spirit of the American
character, with threats to intellectual property rights emerging as a
threat to America itself.]{.underline}

### AT: Threats Are Real -- General

#### Their claims about "real threats" invests in a politics of anxiety -- objects of fear are rhetorically constructed in an attempt to concretize a generalized and ever-present insecurity

For this purpose, we reach to the literature on the politics of anxiety
drawing mainly on the work of Jacques Lacan, a psychoanalyst whose ideas
have been increasingly prolific in IR (for an authoritative overview see
Zevnik & Mandelbaum, 2021), and, to a lesser extent, critical
geopolitics (Klinke, 2016; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013). Our approach
shares the Giddensian notion that [anxiety]{.underline} is an
inarticulable, traumatic and potentially paralysing affect that subjects
attempt to avoid and repress. However, [instead of seeing it as merely
something that 'lurks' behind as the dark other of normal
life]{.underline}, anxiety [is]{.underline} understood as [a durable
affective condition interwoven in everyday experiences as well as social
processes and political institutions]{.underline}. It doesn't just
lurk[, it is always already there]{.underline}, as it is present in the
key mechanisms that hold society together: [in the production of social
subjects and the creation of rules through which these are regulated and
bound together.]{.underline}

In this reading, [anxiety is correlative to the]{.underline} very
[emergence and existence of the subject as such.]{.underline} It is 'a
type of expectant dread' or 'a crushing experience of 'out of
placeness'' that arises 'when the subject, unable to ground themselves
in either a functional horizon of values or a reliable social or
subjective identification, fears that they might be somehow swallowed
up, devoured' (Hook, 2015, pp. 117, 119). [It is less about]{.underline}
the disorientation and uncertainty caused by [one particular
crisis]{.underline} ([e.g. Russia invading Ukraine,
Covid-19]{.underline} arriving) [and more about being reminded of the
ultimately irreducible fragility of all things]{.underline}, including
human lives and social orders. In this sense, [anxiety is an
affect]{.underline} linked to experiencing the limit of one's own
existence as a subject, something [that signifies the encounter with
'the real']{.underline}, [to use the Lacanian term for the internal
limit of social order and/or the biological limit of human
existence.]{.underline} [Anxiety can never be fully managed or
repressed]{.underline}, as it is a reaction to being confronted with
what is for Lacan the ultimate reality of human existence: the
fundamental 'groundlessness of meaning' (Balaska, 2019, p. 25) and,
therefore, the impossibility of ever achieving a coherent and stable
identity. In this sense, anxiety is the affect that 'does not deceive'
(Lacan, 2014, p. 160), as it does not cover over the void at the heart
of every social identity, but rather confronts us with it at the level
of bodily sensation. To put it differently, [subjects are always
ultimately ontologically insecure, as no narratives, routines or
relationships]{.underline} -- personal or geopolitical -- [can ever
fully deal with the omnipresent possibility that things may not make
sense and everything can break down any minute]{.underline}. Anxiety
emerges as the affect that signifies 'the need for the stabilisation of
the subject' (Burgess, 2017, p. 29), yet this stabilisation is doomed to
fail in the longer term.

Therefore, in contrast to readings that see it as an aberration,
[anxiety is omnipresent, even]{.underline} [though it]{.underline}
clearly [varies in]{.underline} its [intensity]{.underline} [across time
and space]{.underline}. Sometimes it is experienced more often and more
strongly, while there may be other, less anxious times (Solomon, 2012
makes this argument with respect to affects in general). The current
social condition is arguably one when anxiety is on the high; leading
some authors to argue that we are now living in an 'anxious society', 'a
society on constant alert, despite having no identifiable existential
threat. Instead, there is the constant presence of the possibility of
that threat, and with it, the sense that government cannot fully protect
the people and that danger resides in the everyday' (Kinnvall & Mitzen,
2020, p. 247, emph. added; Eklundh et al., 2017). Such (highly) anxious
society was created by the congruence of a range of factors. Some point
to the effects of neoliberalism and austerity that produce the
widespread feelings of powerlessness and loss of control (Hirvonen,
2017). Others focus on the social media economy that requires users who
are constantly obsessively checking for news updates, notifications and
the affective gratification coming from 'retweets' and 'likes' (Davies,
2019). For yet others, the proliferation of anxiety is connected to the
societal changes linked to gender, race and immigration (Ali & Whitham,
2018; Klinke, 2016; Zevnik, 2017b), or the 'security creep' perpetuated
by discourses and practices of counterterrorism and cybersecurity
(Heath-Kelly, 2018; Jacobsen, 2020).

[This]{.underline} extended [understanding of anxiety as ontologically
conditioned and socially circulated 'nervous states']{.underline}
(Davies, 2019) [without a clear and concrete referent object opens the
possibility to think (geo)politics of anxiety in]{.underline} broader
and arguably [more critical terms]{.underline} than in conventional
ontological security literature. On the one hand, the Lacanian approach
broadly agrees with the Giddensian ontological security framework with
respect to how [subjects try to deal with anxiety]{.underline}: [by
'pinning' it onto an object and transforming it into a more tangible
fear of something.]{.underline} In this manner, 'fear becomes a way of
easing anxiety; of attaching a signifier (an object of fear) to what is
otherwise an unfounded experience of unease' (Zevnik, 2017a, p. 237).
Such '[politics of fear']{.underline} then [transforms the
crushing]{.underline} and paralysing experience of [anxiety]{.underline}
[into the management of 'concrete objects that we have
invented']{.underline} (Hirvonen, 2017, p. 261), [such as
the]{.underline} geopolitically coded '[Muslim terrorists' or 'Russians
hackers']{.underline}. In this step, anxiety is ostensibly eased or
repressed by the production of (geopolitical) narratives that 'make
sense' of the unpleasant experience by giving it a name and placing it
on a map.2 \*\*\*FOOTNOTE BEGINS\*\*\* [There is nothing natural about
the construction of particular fear objects]{.underline}, be it 'Muslim
terrorists' or 'Russian hybrid warfare', [as discourses of fear are
always contingent. Societies are complicit in the production of their
fears through]{.underline} the reflexive/[strategic as well
as]{.underline} non-reflexive/[habitual ways through which discourses
are produced and reproduced.]{.underline} This also makes it possible to
challenge them and search for alternatives. \*\*\*FOOTNOTE ENDS\*\*\*

#### Be skeptical of every aff claims their threats are real -- their rhetorical acts are only meant to deepen the ruse of securitization. Skepticism makes the entire system crumble.

[The pivotal point over securitization is that speeches with a receptive
audience create a threat**. The more an idea is accepted by the
audience, it becomes a reality.**]{.underline} On the same note, [for
the process of securitization to work properly, it requires a political
actor]{.underline}, which in this case is Obama and Trump **[along with
an audience that will take their words as legitimate]{.underline}**.
According to Buzan "[unless an idea is widely held, it cannot count as
part of the idea of the state]{.underline}" (1983, 53). [Language to
work properly, or any speech act, it requires a teleological
classification, what is good and what is bad, and for it to be accepted
by the audience/society]{.underline}. Language itself is violent and
requires a binary logic to outline the limitations of its own fields by
excluding, [when there is exclusion- the gray areas in the concept do
not interrelate- then the more difficult is to forget or re-arrange the
core block of an idea]{.underline}. Language is built in a way that
**[the more you use an object as a threat, the audience will eventually
believe it and get in sync.]{.underline}** The analysis of threat
construction from the securitization theory, states that [the perception
of threat is not something exogenous.]{.underline} [Rather is
constructed by widely accepted ideas from the collectivity, the
audience, also known as the "us". A threat is not physical or tangible
but rather represent an existential danger to the construction of the
"us" .]{.underline} It is everything that can categorically be foreign
in our identity creeds. We must take into account that [at the core,
national security in the securitization theory is also linked with the
notion of securitizing oneself from outside and domestic threats for
survival]{.underline}. Hence, the political elite that invokes
"securitization" will also inherently mention the consequences of taking
no response at all, increasing fear through the possible weakening of
state foundations/institutions, which is an extension of the nation and
of individuals. [The foundation to understand a threat is the
construction of the 'us' versus the antagonist 'other', both are
mutually sustaining and not excluded.]{.underline} This mutual
constitution of language can be seen through the fact that Venezuela and
the EE.UU. are antagonist and still have deep economic ties and be
highly interdependent (Bonfili 2010).

## Case Impact Defense

### Cyberattacks

#### Scholarly articles tend to inflate the issue of cyber warfare into having a much larger impact than it does in reality, leading to fear amongst citizenry.

for Security Studies at ETH Zurich; Christopher Whyte, Assistant
Professor of Homeland Security with expertise in U.S. Cybersecurity
Policymaking), "Breaking the Myth of Cyber Doom: Securitization and
Normalization of Novel Threats," International Studies Quarterly,
https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/65/4/1137/6276244) //AA

State-sponsored OCOs are an increasingly common feature of the
international system in the twenty-first century. In the past decade,
incidents caused by these have taken a number of forms and each year has
brought a dramatic overall uptick in the number of significant and
publicly disclosed incidents. [Simultaneously, there has been an immense
diversification of those elements of government, industry, and civil
society targeted, a trend that is apparent even in [data]{.mark} that
[often]{.mark} [misrepresent the impact of cyber events on civil society
actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Maschmeyer, Deibert, and Lindsay 2020).
Cyber operations increasingly target prominent political personas and
organizations in aid of influence campaigns in a remarkably prominent
fashion. Moreover, beyond the routine theft of confidential information,
[malware]{.underline} designed to tamper with the function of industrial
control systems across power generation, factory production, and even
dam infrastructure [is found with some relative frequency. [Herein lies
the broad assertion that physical effects from OCOs seem more likely
today than ever before.]{.mark}]{.underline} Interestingly, even [[as
cyber conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} evolves [and [becomes
commonplace]{.underline}]{.mark}, professional narratives and [[media
representations remain]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhat
[[static]{.underline}]{.mark} (Dunn Cavelty 2008, 2013; Gomez and Villar
2018). [[Since]{.mark} at least [2007]{.mark},]{.underline} when
distributed denial-of-service operations targeting Estonia constituted
the first major cyber assault on a NATO member state[, [the potential
for catastrophic damage resulting from]{.underline} ]{.mark}[malicious
[digital behavior surfaced as a recurring narrative]{.mark} in Western
punditry and popular commentary. Despite such depictions, [the growing
empirical record suggests the limited efficacy of publicly disclosed
OCOs]{.mark}. Only a handful of]{.underline} deployments of [malicious
code have been captured to date that were intended to cause the physical
effects that are so often the substance of doomsayer
reporting.]{.underline} Of these[, [most did not
execute]{.underline}]{.mark}. As an instrument of foreign policy,
Iasiello (2013) and others argue that [[cyber
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[fall short of achieving their
objectives despite advances]{.underline}]{.mark} in capabilities.
Similarly, the latest version of the [Dyadic Cyber Incident and
Dispute]{.underline} (DCID) [data]{.underline}, which tracks major
interstate cyber conflict incidents between 2000 and 2016, [illustrates
the limited coercive potential of OCOs]{.underline} by identifying the
rarity of concession-generating incidents (Valeriano and Maness 2014).
The absence of empirical support for the revolutionary potential of
cyber operations encourages criticism of those who oversell the
strategic utility of the method (Gartzke 2013; Lindsay 2013; Maness and
Valeriano 2016; Borghard and Lonergan 2017; Kostyuk and Zhukov 2017),
with the result that [[the real-world impact of cyber conflict
remains]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhat [[unclear]{.underline}]{.mark}
even as the landscape of incidents becomes more densely populated. This
growing skepticism surrounding the exercise of cyber power,3
[[however]{.underline}]{.mark}, continues to go against how the issue is
framed in broader scholarship and in the public eye. [[Scholars
still]{.underline}]{.mark} regularly [[cite]{.mark} the [assumptions of
"cyber doom"]{.mark} as they present their work, particularly in
technical research]{.underline} (Dunn Cavelty 2009; Lawson et al. 2016).
Furthermore, Jarvis, Macdonald, and Whiting (2017) observe that [[media
reporting continues to depict OCOs as existential threats]{.mark} to
cyber-dependent societies.]{.underline} [Continued [references to this
narrative]{.mark},]{.underline} even among otherwise skeptical
researchers, [[are puzzling]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the six-year
Jarvis, Macdonald, and Whiting (2017) study encompasses some of the most
prominent cybersecurity incidents,4 it also permits the observation of
its limited effects. Cyber operations that reflect the prevalent
narrative are typically inaccessible to the majority of state actors
(Pytlak and Mitchell 2016). Moreover, there is reason to think that
[[prominent operations]{.mark} that could affect public perceptions of
the shape of global cyber conflict [should be few and far
between.]{.mark}]{.underline} For one thing, [[the ability to
inflict]{.mark} [damage]{.mark}]{.underline} to critical infrastructure
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} significant financial, scientific, and
organizational [[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} (Slayton 2017). For
another, if concessions are to be obtained, [[sustained pressure
is]{.underline}]{.mark} typically [[required]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
is challenging with OCOs relative to other mechanisms of state power
(Borghard and Lonergan 2017). Lastly, strategic considerations also need
to be considered. As [most interactions in cyberspace are regionally
bound and may involve rivalries, [restraint is necessary to
manage]{.mark} escalatory [risk]{.mark}]{.underline} (Valeriano and
Maness 2015; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Unlike conventional
capabilities, [[cyber operations]{.underline}]{.mark} and their
corresponding [tools [do not communicate intent well and increase the
risk of misperception]{.underline}]{.mark} (Buchanan 2017). It seems
clear that while [much conceptual and empirical clarifications about
cyber conflict exist]{.underline} in scholarly and professional
settings[, [there remains a distorted view of the impact of information
about cyber conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the average
citizen.]{.underline} [[This is problematic]{.underline}]{.mark} for a
range of reasons, perhaps most notably [[because of how the
diversification of cyber conflict has increasingly brought questions
about the nature, integrity, and function of public information
environments to the fore of strategic discussions about digital
insecurity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Cybersecurity threats are overblown and have more to do with creating the perception of a threat than the harm of the attack itself.

The nature of the cyber threat: between existentiality and urgency

Unlike other security sectors, [cybersecurity threats are always
perceived in the form of attacks, or hostile, purposeful, and deliberate
actions by an enemy/adversary against the referent
object(s).]{.underline} While this attack logic can still be used
occasionally in all sectors, it is the dominant one in cybersecurity.
[All cyber operations, even the 'defensive', involve the use of malware
by an actor to gain unauthorised access into the target's system. A
vulnerability in a system is not threatening per se]{.underline} if not
exploited, and this exploitation requires an adversary's or another
party's involvement. Although the resemblances with the military sector
here are high, one more aspect makes cybersecurity more distinctive: the
question of existentiality. According to the securitisation theory, [the
defining feature of security is the idea of existentiality; i.e.
security is concerned with the survival of a certain referent object(s),
which justifies the calls for urgent responses.]{.underline} In
cybersecurity, despite the existence of existential discourses, the
existentiality assumption is not as straightforward as it is in other
sectors for multiple reasons. Firstly, [the majority of cyber attacks
that are seen as the most serious in history were neither objectively
existential from a technical viewpoint, nor portrayed as such by the
concerned actors.]{.underline} **[Stealing military, commercial, or
personal information can hardly affect the survival of the state, the
private sector, or any individual]{.underline}**. Similarly, [denying
customers/citizens access to certain services through denial of service
attacks (DOS) does not pose an existential threat to
anyone.]{.underline} This does not mean that [cyber threats]{.underline}
cannot be **[hyped, exaggerated, or presented in urgent terms, since all
those qualities are not essentially linked to
existentiality.]{.underline}** Secondly, [the indirect nature of the
majority of cyber attacks and the non-physicality of their
consequences,]{.underline} although does not undermine their seriousness
and urgency, [acts as an impeding rather than a facilitating condition
to the existentiality assumption.]{.underline} The empirical analysis
also proves that existentiality is not the only reason for threats to
register in the cybersecurity debate and that it is not a precondition
for perceived urgency. Generally, cybersecurity is marked by different
understandings of disruptive and destructive implications of cyber
threats, and all invoke a certain level of urgency. [The majority of
discourses emphasise these 'disruptive' implications, including huge
financial losses that can slow down the economy, loss of productivity
and global competitiveness, customers' loss of confidence in the
information infrastructure, etc.]{.underline} Though not portrayed in
'survival' terms, these disruptive implications are still perceived as
immanent, urgent, and as serious threats to national security. 3.

## Miscellaneous

### Cap K -- Crisis Cap -- AT: "No alternative"

#### Capitalism relies on producing catastrophes to expand access to new markets and delegitimize criticism -- refuse the claim of no alternative in favor of analyzing capitalism's construction of crises that opens space for revolutionary potential

**Masco 15 -** Joseph Masco is Professor of Anthropology at the
University of Chicago and author of The Theater of Operations: National
Security Affect from the Cold War to the War on Terror, also published
by Duke University Press, and The Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan
Project in Post\--Cold War New Mexico, \["*The Time of Catastrophe:
Catastrophe's Apocalypse,"* 2015, Routledge, eBook ISBN9781315552187\]RA

When is the Catastrophic? [Think about the strangeness of today's
situation. Thirty, forty years ago, we were still debating about what
the future will be: communist, fascist, capitalist,
whatever.]{.underline} [Today, nobody even debates these issues. We all
silently accept global capitalism is here to stay.]{.underline} On the
other hand, **[we are obsessed with cosmic catastrophes: the whole life
on earth disintegrating, because of some virus, because of an asteroid
hitting the earth, and so on.]{.underline}** So the paradox is, that
**[it's much easier to imagine the end of all life on earth than a much
more modest radical change in capitalism.]{.underline}** "In relation to
the history of organic life on earth," writes a modern biologist, "the
paltry fifty millennia of homo sapiens constitutes something like two
seconds at the close of a twenty-four hour day. On this scale, the
history of civilized mankind would fill one-fifth of the last second of
the last hour." The present, which, as the model of Messianic time
comprises the entire history of mankind in a enormous abridgement,
coincides exactly with the stature which the history of mankind has in
the universe. In the early twenty-first century, nar[ratives of end
times proliferate---terrorism, peak oil, emerging disease, boom and bust
capitalism, and a destabilized biosphere compete with each other for
public attention. The difficulty of prioritizing which catastrophe
should take precedence over all the others has created a curious new
kind of psychosocial fatigue, where claims on imminent destruction are
met with a retreat inward or simply a shrug.]{.underline} How is it that
Americans, residents of the most powerful country in human history
(unchallenged across military, economic, and political domains) have
come to feel so precarious and vulnerable? It is important to note that
our politics of catastrophe involve cultural formations as well as
material assessments; they are historical projections that articulate
fear but can also work to block both thought and action. Žižek (building
on similar comments by Jameson about capitalism now seeming more
permanent than the world) helps us see one dimension of this problem by
underscoring the current lack of alternative ideologies to constitute
the future today.37 The demise of the large social engineering projects
of the twentieth century, and the rise of an unrestrained neoliberalism
in their wake, combine to create a vision of a market driven future that
can only produce profit by generating boom and bust cycles and
extraction regimes that leave ruin in their wake.38 **[Disaster has
actually become a kind of industry in recent years, revealing an
unplanned obsolescence for urban infrastructure breaking down under
shifting environmental condition and lack of maintenance]{.underline}**.
[This has enabled radical new kinds of corporate experimentation and
profit-making, making disaster highly lucrative]{.underline}.39 [The
formal end of the welfare state project]{.underline} (largely
coterminous with the end of the Cold War, if not the nuclear danger)
[has also diminished the public space devoted to positive visions of a
collective future in American life. It is difficult to find official
commitments to a steady improvement in the qualities of collective life
of the kind once used to balance images of nuclear
catastrophe]{.underline}. Today, we are more than a generation removed
from the kind of social contract that engineered most American
institutions, and are instead increasingly reliant on market logics to
design the collective future.40 Thus, we have inherited from the
twentieth-century's contest of utopian visions a world still organized
by nuclear weapons but subject to the radical destabilizing effects of a
boom and bust global capitalism that operates on ever-shorter windows of
profitability and with fewer restraints and responsibilities. [The
reluctance of our systems of governance to imagine different futures,
let alone to organize society on behalf of them, leaves crisis the
predominant mode for political expression, as imminent danger becomes
the primary motivating force outside of capital.]{.underline}
Consequently, [competing domains and scales of endangerment now seem to
buffet U.S. citizens without respite, as the bursting of bubble
economies resides alongside the minute-to-minute danger of a nuclear
blast within the century-long sequence of anthropogenic environmental
change.]{.underline} In a striking passage from his "Theses on the
Philosophy of History," Walter [Benjamin evokes geological time as a way
to shift the story of human beings on planet earth.41 All human history
becomes a brief moment of planetary time from this perspective, which
raises the important question how temporality itself informs the
cataclysmic and whether human beings have the right senses to understand
collective danger at all. Pre-figuring the language of the
anthropocene,]{.underline} Benjamin **[uses geological time to disrupt
the time of capital and to reposition humanity as merely one kind of
life on planet Earth, a species which may or may not be able to avoid
the cataclysmic end most creatures meet.]{.underline}** But **[if danger
incubates in the present, revealing itself in the catastrophic act, how
can we see through a normative everyday to assess accruing danger
operating on all possible temporal scales---particularly the forms that
people generate and thus collectively control?]{.underline}** Benjamin
suggests that a [radical emancipatory insight is also incubating in the
present, a Messianic potential that could shift perception itself
allowing a different kind of time to emerge, one that is not coded as
"progress" (tied to homogenous empty time) and that is outside of
capitalism]{.underline}. For Benjamin, [just as the cataclysmic is coded
into everyday life, so is the possibility for a radical shift in
perception and with it an emancipatory politics. That this "potential"
has not been activated is, for him, the ongoing state of emergency that
he critiques so forcefully. In this way, he **shifts the "emergency"
from the narratives of violence that can function as heroic vehicles for
self-sacrifice and warfare in the moment, to a more structural
assessment of how social institutions normalize and render invisible the
violence of capitalism itself**]{.underline}. What [Benjamin asks us to
consider is how social institutions function as an expression and
achievement of human engineering, and thus how the human-made can be
remade under different concepts of value and with different futures in
mind. Catastrophe's apocalypse would, in this case, be to see the
agentive behind the everyday crisis, to see the possibility of a social
order not yet conceived as forestalled in the name of history, class, or
the status quo. Catastrophe's apocalypse would be to enter into a
radically different temporality]{.underline}, [a perspectival
space]{.underline} for Benjamin **[in which structural violence is
revealed as manufactured, enabling the current moment to be opened as a
space of revolutionary critical potential.]{.underline}** From this
perspective, perhaps the proliferation of catastrophic images and
narratives today has less to say about new objective degrees of
endangerment than a shift in the psychosocial mechanisms of
normalization and absorption. And here we might focus on a temporal
paradox of our security culture today concerning the relation of nuclear
danger to climate crisis. The nuclear danger of Cold War---the fears of
a nuclear war that would consume global civilization in an
instant---seems distant to many American in the twenty-first century but
the technological systems built to enable it are still present and
active. The global nuclear infrastructure remains on high alert and
nuclear war could still be launched at a moment's notice and between
ever more nuclear powers. The Presidents of the U.S. and of Russia still
carry launch codes with them every second of the day, and weapons
scientists and defense personnel maintain a state of the art global
nuclear system of war fighting. Americans tend to see global nuclear
crisis now as an issue of the past, a matter for the last century
(replaced by a wide range of terrorist threats). But today there are
many more nuclear weapons on the planet than in 1958 when The Power of
Decision was made, and the U.S. has committed to maintaining a state of
the art arsenal for the indefinite future. Indeed, the nuclear fetish,
despite the end of underground nuclear testing in 1992, remains firmly
in place: In 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy asked Congress for
funds to build a new nuclear complex for the twenty-first century,
involving new weapons designs and production facilities---amounting to a
\$1 trillion expenditure over the next three decades.42 Thus, while
perceptions of nuclear danger have changed markedly since 1958, the
technological possibility of a total ending has only increased: we live
today on the edge of nuclear war and just don't seem to notice it
anymore.43 So what was once a national fixation on nuclear crisis no
longer mobilizes in the same way, attaining an embedded-ness in everyday
life that can be ignored by most citizens in favor of other concerns.
Similarly, the climate crisis of the twenty-first century was already
present in 1958, when The Power of Decision articulated the terms of
national crisis and Unchained Goddess warned viewers of a destabilized
future environment. In the first decade of the Cold War, earth
scientists publicized disturbing trends in their data sets, documenting
shifts in air, water, and land quality via industrial pollutants. The
debates about radioactive fallout from nuclear testing led to the
Partial Test Ban treaty in 1963, which moved U.S. nuclear testing
underground, eliminating the production of new radioactive fallout from
the U.S. test program. However, the larger lesson of how industrial
activity was harming the biosphere was left unaddressed as a security
problem for decades. Had climate change risen to the level of a nation
crisis in the 1950s the world would have been spared the coming
destabilization of ecosystems, species die-offs, flooding, illness, and
drought projected in the IPCC reports. Indeed, climate scientists now
identify 1950 as the beginning of the "great acceleration"---a period of
startling changes in human consumption patterns linked to the advance of
the middle class and escalating carbon emissions.44 In other words, [the
inauguration of the global nuclear danger was also the inflection point
for climate change, simultaneously installing two catastrophic
potentials into everyday life that operate on vastly different time
scales.]{.underline} [Americans focused on the crisis of nuclear war in
the twentieth century while missing the other incremental crisis of
their own making, the expansion of a consumer economy that has become a
highly destructive force on planet earth.]{.underline} Thus, [nuclear
and climate dangers are human-made crises decades in the making, and are
deeply embedded within a petroleum-based
capitalist-militarist-industrial system.]{.underline} After World War
II, the security state embraced nuclear danger as its coordinating
principle while rejecting the environment as a major security concern.
Partly this is explained by the radically different temporalities evoked
by each kind of danger: nuclear crisis playing out in minutes and hours
while climate crisis plays out over decades and centuries. However, each
crisis also evokes a different kind of sovereignty and requires very
different kinds of governance. A global denuclearization project could
substantially reduce the nuclear danger in a few years, [but global
warming is a planetary phenomenon that requires vast international
cooperation]{.underline}---indeed, it now demands a post-national
security logic of planetary defense. Perhaps this is also why so many
images of climate change in the U.S. rely on tropes developed to
communicate the danger of nuclear weapons, a way of acknowledging a
collective danger without forcing a change in existing conceptual
structures or modes of response. In U.S. public discourse, nuclear and
climate dangers are both grounded in images of a world that is no longer
capable of supporting human society, a time when as nuclear strategist
Herman Kahn, once put it, the "survivors would envy the dead."45 [This
kind of catastrophic narrative, in its depiction of a perfect and total
loss, however, requires an apocalyptic rendering precisely because it is
an historical and highly politicized artifact.]{.underline} [What is
required now is a critical engagement that assesses not only the
possibility of total endings but also the instrumentalities, ideologies,
and practices that inform them. Perhaps today this could take the form
of a reassessment of industrial reasoning itself and an effort to
"cancel the apocalypse" not by a heroic suicide bombing]{.underline} (as
in Pacific Rim or The Power of Decision) [but rather by attending to
local infrastructure itself as a social project that needs constant
critical reassessment and reinvention to acknowledge radically changing
environmental conditions.]{.underline} **[This would mean embracing both
middle and deep futures as a collective security project, and thinking
through multigenerational toxic legacies as well as imminent
dangers]{.underline}** (see Orff and Misrash 2012).46 Above all**[, it
would mean focusing expert and public energies not on rehearsing the
perfect catastrophes of total endings but rather on the qualities,
consequences, and insights of living in messy aftermaths.]{.underline}**

### Cyber -- "Cyber Doom" Narrative

#### No link -- studies prove "cyber doom" narratives don't produce generalized anxiety and are informed by real incidents of cyber conflict

**Gomez and Whyte 2021** (Miguel Gomez, Senior Researcher at the Center
for Security Studies at ETH Zurich; Christopher Whyte, Assistant
Professor of Homeland Security with expertise in U.S. Cybersecurity
Policymaking), "Breaking the Myth of Cyber Doom: Securitization and
Normalization of Novel Threats," International Studies Quarterly,

According to some, advancements in technological and organizational
capabilities among capable state and stateaffiliated actors over the
past decade increase the likelihood that offensive cyber operations
(OCOs) might soon produce destructive physical effects (Saltzman 2013;
Healey 2016[). [Expectations]{.mark} of real-world damage inflicted
through cyberspace [reinforce]{.mark} the ["cyber doom"]{.mark}
[narrative that digital insecurity might result in]{.mark} a massive
[failure of]{.mark} social and economic [processes]{.mark} across
societies [dependent on new information technologies]{.mark} and [that
dread of such failure permeates public perspectives on cyber
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009). For those who
study public opinion surrounding foreign policymaking[, [the "cyber
doom"]{.underline}]{.mark} [type of [narrative is not]{.mark} especially
[uncommon]{.mark}.]{.underline} Environmental circumstances of
sufficient visibility and meaning, such as the trauma-inducing
experiences of 9/11 or the Cold War, often take on life of their own and
affect opinion formation independent of an individuals' priors or the
cues of elites. Oddly, however, [the oft-referenced notion of ["cyber
doom" appears paradoxical]{.mark}, even despite the link some scholars
make between OCOs and physical effects. Presently, [conflict in
cyberspace is characterized by]{.mark} persistent-yet-[limited effects
and]{.mark} a condition of apparent [restraint exercised by
cyber-capable actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Maness and Valeriano 2016;
Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018a). Moreover, the [unabated integration
of vulnerable information systems across all aspects of modern societies
raises the question of whether or not a sense of dread associated with
the exploitation of cyberspace is as severe as commonly
portrayed]{.underline} (Jarvis, Macdonald, and Whiting 2017). [Most
damningly, the idea that ["cyber doom" is most visible in
Western]{.mark} national [experiences as a fear appeal employed by
politicians to galvanize support for policy]{.mark} in no way explains
these]{.underline} curious logical shortcomings. [[At the heart
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [["cyber doom]{.mark}"]{.underline}
narrative [[is the]{.mark} [assumption that information about
cyberattacks released to the public]{.mark}---particularly information
about sophisticated cyber operations of foreign countries and organized
crime1--- [produces anxiety]{.mark} about the digital health and
security of a person.]{.underline} Ironically, [[this assumed
relationship between cyber operations]{.underline}]{.mark}, their
portrayal in public-facing media, and individual impact [[is often
discussed]{.mark} [in unclear terms]{.mark} by scholars]{.underline}
than is the determining role of techno-strategic conditions. Despite the
recent turn by some to consider the societal impact of OCOs (Lin and
Kerr 2017; Lindsay 2020; Whyte 2020), [most [research on cyber
conflict]{.mark} continues to [emphasize]{.mark} logic-of-the-domain
[explanations for the behavior of cyber-capable
actors]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 This makes a certain sense because the
domain is human-made and malleable. However, [it is also puzzling given
the scope of cyberspace and the degree to which digital action impacts
both private industry and civil society across numerous
levels.]{.underline} Though the mechanisms of interaction may be less
precise than is the case with other forms of state power, [[the]{.mark}
[literature on public opinion]{.mark}, morale, and psychology
[in]{.mark} foreign [policymaking tells us that popular perceptions of
threat are shaped by a host of factors that]{.mark} then [impact]{.mark}
the formulation and [implementation of]{.mark} [state security
policy.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this article, we take aim at the ["cyber
doom" narrative logic as an initial step toward clarifying the
relationship between cyber conflict, its portrayal, and public thinking
about digital insecurity.]{.underline} Consequently, we align with
critics of the narrative itself but argue that such criticisms make
overly simplistic assumptions about public opinion and national security
that do little to enrich and undergird evolving cyber conflict research.
The logic of the core argument about digital disaster aside,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} broader "[[cyber doom"
argument]{.underline}]{.mark}--- i.e., that the rhetorical and cognitive
prospect of doom has some effect on a population---[[is undertheorized
and understudied]{.mark}.]{.underline} This point is particularly
important because scholarship aimed at explaining the sources of state
public policy on cyberspace makes the curious misstep of holding
domestic population preferences constant while focusing on third image
determinants of strategy development. Authors argue that
[[publics]{.mark} cyclically [react with]{.mark} some [fear to emergent
threats]{.mark} and that, therefore, public policy is best explained by
the incidence of cyber conflict or steps taken by state
peers.]{.underline} Given that such assumptions are clearly far from
safe on the merits, this article aims to ascertain whether or not
negativity among the general public associated with malicious behavior
in cyberspace is as salient as broadly claimed. [We add evidence to the
argument that [the "cyber doom" narrative is
unrealistic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lawson 2013) by showing that the
assumptions found therein are misleading. Our study finds that
[sensitivity to cybersecurity threats]{.underline} is situationally
shaped by exposure to negative reporting but that the onset of
associated dread is not a given. Instead, it [is influenced by
expectations of the role of technology in modern society.]{.underline}
Respondents dependent on such technologies are not as prone to negative
effect as are those who remain not so deeply embedded in the fabric of
digital society. Both groups become more sensitive to cybersecurity
threats to their person as the information they consume becomes more
negative, and this personal concern facilitates a heightened sensitivity
to threats to the polity. However, the dread predicted by the "cyber
doom" narrative is only weakly predictive of this dynamic and has no
effect on the threat sensitivity of those who do not respond
emotionally. Finally, in both cases, the link between concern for
society is not a clear result of negative information so much as it is
the result of initial sensitivity to threats at the personal level.
Consequently, we make two contributions. First, we show that the impact
of novel environmental circumstances on individual opinion formation is
shaped by issue embeddedness, suggesting that long-term exposure to any
invasive development mitigates the affective response it is associated
with. Second, we present evidence suggesting nevertheless that the
unique characteristics of such a development matter in opinion
formation, as sensitivity to digital threats to the polity is clearly
premised on personal threat sensitivity. [These findings suggest that
[not only "cyber doom" is strategically and functionally unrealistic,
but the effects of the idea's securitization are also minimal and prone
to diminishment over time.]{.mark}]{.underline} In doing so, they speak
to the broad research program on public opinion and audience dynamics in
foreign policymaking. More specifically, in line with recent work
(Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017), [our study suggests that citizens are far
more capable of responding to threat stimuli absent elite
cues.]{.underline} Significantly, our work joins research that locates
responsiveness to policy issues in the interaction of cognitive priors
and social context with incoming information about new events.
[[Judgment is]{.mark} [rarely as linear as the "cyber doom" narrative
suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} in its linking of negative reporting,
fearful response, and sensitivity to threat inflation. Instead,
individuals are conditioned by social circumstances such that even novel
threats are incorporated into the horizon of issues the public
encounters. The remainder of this article is divided into four sections.
The first introduces the theoretical framework supporting the underlying
claims investigated and adopts existing frameworks to account for the
effects of continued exposure to cyber threats. The second discusses the
experimental design employed. Though common across political science
research, the methodology is only recently employed in cybersecurity and
cyber conflict scholarship in response to (1) difficulties related to
obtaining observational data and (2) the growing interest in
individual-level behavior as impactful in digital affairs (Gross,
Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Gomez 2019b; Jensen and Valeriano 2019). This
is followed by the presentation and analysis of results. Finally, an
in-depth discussion is offered that further develops the theoretical and
policy implications of the findings. The findings are not limited to the
validity of the core "cyber doom" narrative and the general disposition
of non-elites toward cybersecurity issues. Instead, we contribute to the
body of scholarship on public opinion in foreign policymaking and speak
to ongoing research linking decision-making and the modern digital
information environment.

Atmospheres of Destruction

Warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Human influence on the
climate system is clear. It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover
will continue to shrink and thin[... Continued emissions of greenhouse
gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the
climate system]{.underline}. IPCC, Climate Change 2013 [The latest
projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are
startlingly depicting a new kind of collective violence that is
escalating and will play out over the coming centuries in every
ecosystem on Earth]{.underline} (see Figure 1.2).27 [The extraordinary
achievement of the IPCC is its radical interdisciplinary and
multi-national cooperation, allowing teams of scientists across a vast
range of fields to integrate huge data sets, and via computer
simulations, project atmospheric effects out into the coming
decades.]{.underline}28 The portrait of the coming century that the IPCC
presents, however, is not pretty and asks us to seriously rethink
industrial age understandings of both progress and catastrophe. [The
predicted elevation of the global temperature by between two and six
degrees by mid-century, the IPCC argues, will create increasingly
volatile conditions. The reduction in polar ice will lead to rising
ocean levels, which will flood islands and coastal cities worldwide. It
will also produce a more acidic ocean leading to vast oceanic dead
zones.]{.underline} Similarly, [extreme weather patterns (producing
regional droughts and flooding) will challenge food production
worldwide, while changing habitat zones on a massive scale and enabling
new emerging diseases. Moreover, human population growth, potentially
rising from 7 to 9 billion people by 2050, will create more consumers,
and only increase pressure on the global environment. The resulting
ecological stress could exceed what ecologists calculate is the
"carrying capacity" of the global biosphere, leading to widespread
scarcity or even more shocking ecological destabilizations. The
worst-case vision is of future where the food chain collapses, leading
to mass starvation and pushing species of all kinds towards
extinction.]{.underline} Earth Scientists note that over 99 percent of
the life forms that have ever lived on our planet have gone extinct.
[Extinction is thus not the exception but rather the rule over the long,
longue duree of life on planet Earth.]{.underline} [The best estimates
today are that some four billion species have evolved over the past 3.5
billion years on this planet, almost all to die out. In addition to the
process of natural selection in eliminating and promoting particular
species, there have been five mass extinction events, periods where due
to asteroid collisions or planetary-scale climatic changes, two-thirds
or more of all the organisms on Earth have disappeared. In light of the
IPCC assessments, there is much discussion today of a sixth mass
extinction event---an ongoing shift in the terms of living on our planet
drawn from the combined impacts of habitat destruction, pollution,
overharvesting, invasive species, and human population
growth]{.underline}. [This sixth mass extinction will be unique in our
planet's history as it does not arrive in the form of an asteroid
collision or volcanic eruption, but rather through the hyperactive work
on one indigenous species: people.]{.underline} [The industrial age
human has become an ecological, even a geological force, constituting a
future of fewer species, less biodiversity, and potentially catastrophic
disruptions in the food chain.]{.underline}29 [Climate change thus now
posits a vision of end-times that rivals that of the nuclear danger, as
the incremental and cumulative effects of human industry have
foundationally shifted the atmospheric chemistry on our planet, setting
off a reverberating chain of effects throughout the
biosphere.]{.underline} But [if the global nuclear danger is
characterized by its shocking immediacy,]{.underline} **[climate danger
works on an opposite temporality, constituting a slower violence that is
treacherous precisely because it is so incremental that it is difficult
in any given moment to sense a change in the environment or to connect
discreet issues]{.underline}** (such as, sea level or drought or violent
weather) to industrially generated greenhouse gas emissions. It is a
cumulative and momentum driven process, operating on so vast a scale
that it raises basic questions about human perception, memory, and the
terms of visualization appropriate for a planetary problem. In light of
climate change, geologists are now debating how to sequence planetary
time to recognize the effects of human industry. [The professional
geological societies are formally contemplating the adoption of the term
"anthropocene" to designate the era of human impacts on the planet, a
startling recognition of a new agentive force on Earth; as leading
advocates of the concept put it: The advent of the Anthropocene, the
time interval in which human activities now rival global geophysical
processes, suggests that we need to fundamentally alter our relationship
with the planet we inhabit.]{.underline} Many approaches could be
adopted, ranging from geoengineering solutions that purposefully
manipulate parts of the Earth System to becoming active stewards of our
own life support system. [The Anthropocene is a reminder that the
Holocene, during which complex human societies have developed, has been
a stable, accommodating environment and is the only state of the Earth
System that we know for sure can support contemporary
society]{.underline}. The need to achieve effective planetary
stewardship is urgent. As we go further into the Anthropocene, we risk
driving the Earth System into a trajectory toward more hostile states
from which we cannot easily return.30 Geoengineering, life support
systems, planetary stewardship---these are the terms of a new kind of
emergency, one that operates on a total environmental scale. The
10,000-plus years of the Holocene emerges as a temporary atmospheric
condition on planet Earth, one particularly beneficial to humans, who,
living in that special air, rose to become the dominant species,
inventing agriculture, writing, cars, computers, and atomic bombs in the
process. Our concept of the planet is now fundamentally shifting, from
literally the stable ground under our feet, unchangeable in its nature,
to a "lifeboat" in hostile waters, underscoring that the fragile
environmental envelope on which we depend is changing under accumulated
industrial stresses. [Historian Dipesh Chakrabarty has pointed out how
climate change merges human history with natural history, creating a new
kind of temporality that radically undercuts longstanding logics of
economic progress and development]{.underline}.31 [This collapsing of
human time into geological time forces us to think on unfamiliar
scales---such as, the planet---and to think not of populations and
nation-states but species level human impacts]{.underline} (earth
systems of air, ice, water, and geology). Thus, [climate change as a
collective problem challenges our political, economic and industrial
orders, requiring not only a reverse engineering of global
infrastructure to prevent a deepening ecological crisis, but also new
conceptual structures.]{.underline} Here, the built universe of things
and the desires that organize our consumption patterns are revealed to
be literally catastrophic. [The petrochemical economy that has
revolutionized human society has unintentionally generated an
unprecedented global environmental crisis, one that transforms the
smallest of everyday activities---driving in a car or eating a
hamburger---into a new kind of end-times.]{.underline} Hamburgers, the
quintessential American fast food, are ruinous for the planet. In fact,
geologists now use the global proliferation of McDonald's restaurants as
an index of anthropocenic environmental change.32 Every aspect of the
mass-produced burger---from the management of cattle to the global
supply chains to the plastic containers---is now a planetary force.
Here, the catastrophic is revealed to be not just an external
threat---an asteroid or foreign attack---it is now coded into tastes,
desires, and naturalized modes of consumption. [The everyday consumption
patterns of each person on the planet, unremarkable in their
singularity, have become cumulatively destructive in their species
totality. This makes the basic requirements for human life]{.underline}
(including food, transportation, heating, clothing) [fundamentally
dangerous to the future stability of the climate as they are embedded in
a petrochemical economy.]{.underline} The virtues of modernization,
globalization, and technology have thus been turned upside down by
climate change: rather than extending equality, security, and comfort,
these practices are a negative form of geoengineering, putting ever more
pressure on the atmospheric "lifeboat" on which we depend. [McDonald's
Big Mac now joins the atomic bomb as an existential threat to the
collective future.]{.underline} How could such a calamity---with so many
vectors of change---appear so suddenly in American life, challenging
twenty-first century society simultaneously to reinvent economy,
consumption, and governance? Climate change has, of course, been a
scientific concern for decades, emerging from the data sets and theories
of Cold War earth sciences.33 Indeed, one can find speculations about
radical climate change from the mid-twentieth century that are eerie
from a contemporary point of view.34 Consider Frank Capra's 1958
educational film, Unchained Goddess, part of The Bell Laboratory Science
Series, a post-Sputnik campaign to interest Americans in scientific
careers hosted by literary professor Frank Baxter.35 The film, which
merges cartoon characters, experts, actors, and documentary footage,
presents an overview of meteorology but ends with a disturbing
hypothesis about the future (see Figure 1.3). After a discussion of the
possibility of weather modification and control, Baxter cautions:
Extremely dangerous questions, because with our present knowledge we
have no idea what would happen. Even now Man may be unwittingly changing
the world's climate through the waste products of his civilization. [Due
to our release through our factories and automobiles every year of more
than six billion tons of carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat
from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer ... It's been
calculated that a few degrees rise in the earth's temperature would melt
the polar ice caps. And if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good
portion of the Mississippi Valley. Tourists in glass bottom boats would
be viewing the grand towers of Miami through 150-feet of tropical water.
For in weather we are not only dealing with forces of a far greater
variety than even the atomic physicists encounters but with life itself.
Without air and water, which are weather, Man would never have appeared
on this small planet earth.]{.underline} There would be no sky, no
ocean, no fields, no forests, nothing but a barren rock rotating in an
airless void. Tourists in glass bottom boats over Miami. [So what was
part of a basic public survey of climatology in 1958 has suddenly become
a collective emergency in the twenty-first century. The privileging of
economy and nuclear threat over all other concerns in the second half of
the twentieth century required a subsuming of climate danger, with
mounting consequences.]{.underline} Thus, [the environment emerges here
as a problem not just of knowledge but also of perception, not just of
understanding but also of collective memory. Catastrophe's apocalypse is
to recognize the human agency not only in producing anthropogenic
changes in the environment but also in mystifying and occluding those
understandings while the problem intensifies.]{.underline} Given the
scale of environmental crisis, one of the immediate problems concerns
its visualization and narration---of how to make hyper-complex,
planetary dangers intelligible to nonexperts. [We do not yet have a
popular culture of climate change to match that of the nuclear
danger,]{.underline} but it is emerging. J.C. Chandor's 2013 film, All
Is Lost, offers a disciplined start to such an endeavor.36 The plot is
simple: a seventy-something white American male (played by Robert
Redford) is alone, "somewhere in the Indian Ocean," sleeping comfortably
in his sailboat when an errant shipping container afloat in the open
ocean ruptures the hull. After attempting to patch the hole, he endures
a massive storm and is forced onto an inflatable lifeboat when the
sailboat sinks. Drifting into shipping lanes, he repeatedly tries to
signal gigantic freighters (stacked with the kind of containers that
damaged his ship) for help, but they pass him by unnoticed, completely
indifferent to his plight. Eight traumatic days later, out of supplies
and hope, he sees a light on the nighttime horizon that might be a small
boat, he accidently ignites his lifeboat in hopes of drawing attention
to his plight and watches from underneath the water as his sole means of
shelter goes up in flames. The last frames of the film are of a hand
from a small rescue boat reaching down into the ocean offering our
protagonist one last chance for survival, which he swims towards. A
story with one character, known simply as "Our Man," and only two real
words of dialog---"help" (thrown in vain at shipping vessels) and a
singular "fuck" (when the situation turns irrevocable)---the story is
ultimately about the fragility of all lifeboats. [Our Man is the
quintessential master of industry. He is likely retired and wealthy
enough to own the boat. He is also a man of action, both able and
strong. When problems appear he does not complain or hesitate but
responds with a learned confidence (even taking time to shave before the
giant storm hits). He does not make any real mistakes. The weather and
ocean are simply too strong for his technology, which continually breaks
down, but it is more than bad luck. It is as if his vision of danger is
out of synch with the universe he now inhabits and despite his best
efforts and seriousness, his world falls apart. The story can also be
read as an illustration of the indifference of global capital to
individual suffering: the shipping container that strikes his boat is
carrying children's sneakers, a marker of the global industrial trade
and not unlike the shoes Our Man is also wearing.]{.underline} His boat
is filled with consumer products promising comfort and safety that
ultimately prove insufficient. He is the big man rendered small in the
face of linked planetary forces---capitalism and climate. The film
begins almost at the end of his story, with a voice over reading of a
note Our Man puts in a jar and tosses into the ocean, a last message to
his family and friends, set adrift in hopes of finding a reader: 13th of
July, 4:50pm. I'm sorry ... I know that means little at this point, but
I am. I tried. I think you all agree that I tried: to be true, to be
strong, to be kind, to love, to be right. But I wasn't. And I know you
knew this, in each of your ways. And I am sorry. All is lost here ...
except for soul and body ... that is what's left of them ... and a
half-day's ration. It's inexcusable really. I know that now. How it
could have taken this long to admit that I'm not sure, but it did. I
fought until the end, I'm not sure what that is worth, but know that I
did. I have always hoped for more for you all. I will miss you. I'm
sorry. [The embarrassment in the face of calamity here is the high note
of the film. A man who is in control---and might well be part of the
American elite that built the global infrastructure of neoliberal
capitalism and petrochemical industry---loses that control when his
technology fails in the face of global and planetary
forces.]{.underline} He should have known better (given the obvious
violence of global capital) but instead trusted his abilities and
technology and resourcefulness. The global market is weaponized here in
the form of the shipping container and the uncaring transport ships. [A
powerful storm---potentially amplified by climate change, a side effect
of the petrochemical economy---merely finishes the job, leaving Our Man
sinking in the open sea, to contemplate his decisions and
fate]{.underline}. We do not know how far into the future the film is
set---or if Our Man's boat is traveling over any flooded cities as
predicted in the Unchained Goddess---but the fragility of the
environment that supports human life on planet Earth is underscored in
every frame. Our Man's message in a bottle is thus a profound projection
of what we all might say in a few decades. [It is an insufficient, if
heartfelt, apology for embracing an economic form that offered
short-term comfort in exchange for amplifying future dangers, and that
abandons individuals increasingly to the uncontrollable and violent
forces of capital/climate.]{.underline}

### Extinction Impacts

#### Securitization is essential to survival because it brings attention to existential threats and demands immediate action 

**Masua 22** (Robinson Masua Ph.D Student, Department of Security and
Correction Science, School of Security, Diplomacy and Peace Studies,
Kenyatta University. "Security is about survival: assessment of the
assumption underlying the securitization theory". Shikshan Sanshodhan :
Journal of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. April 4, 2022
http://shikshansanshodhan.researchculturesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/SS202204003.pdf)
//BK

Securitization is one of the most talked about, contested and revised
concept of theoretical framework in Security Studies and specifically in
Critical Security Studies. According to Williams, (2003), the concept is
connected with the Copenhagen School and is seen as a synthesis of
constructivist and classical political realism in its approach. Buzan
and Weaver defined securitization as: a successful speech act through
which an intersubjective understanding is constructed within a political
community to treat something as an existential threat to a valued
referent object, and to enable a call for urgent and exceptional
measures to deal with the threat (Buzan & Weaver, 2003, p. 491).
According to Lieven (2020, pp. 6-9), [[securitization]{.mark} begins
with a speech act concerning a particular threat,]{.underline} by an
authoritative national leader, institution, or party. [The speech
act]{.underline} attempts to [[shift the threat]{.mark} from normal
politics [into a security concern]{.mark}, thereby [legitimating
extraordinary measures to contain the threat.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Securitization is a process-oriented conception of security, which
stands in contrast to materialist approaches of classical security
studies. Classical approaches of security focus on the material
dispositions of the threat including distribution of power, military
capabilities, and polarity, whereas [[securitization]{.mark} examines
how a certain issue is transformed by an actor into a matter of security
in order to [allow for the use of extraordinary
measures.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, the securitization act, to be
successful, must be accepted by the audience, regardless of the subject
matter being a real threat. As Thierry Balzacq puts it: \"securitization
is a rule-governed practice, the success of which does not necessarily
depend on the existence of a real threat, but on the discursive ability
to effectively endow a development with such a specific complexion\"
(Balzacq, 2005). The audience may take several forms including
technical, bureaucratic, public, and policymaking, and different
audiences can perform different functions by accepting a securitization,
as has been explored by (Roe, 2008). [[Securitization is]{.mark} the
intersubjective [establishment of]{.mark} an [existential
threat,]{.mark} which [demands urgent and immediate attention]{.mark},
as well as the [use of]{.mark} [extraordinary measures to
counter]{.mark} this threat]{.underline} (Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde, 1998;
Wæver, 1995) Like any other concepts in social science the concept of
securitization has been revised and developed but there are still key
concepts that has stood time and space. For example, the idea that
security is not something real or given, but a process or move that
someone applies in order to bring a discussion beyond the realm of
everyday politics and to a sphere where extra ordinary, out-of- hand
measures ought to be deployed and "actions outside of normal bounds of
political procedure" (Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde, 1998, p. 24) are
justified. It is important to note that securitization as a process is
different from politicization. According to Buzan, Weaver and Wilde,
(1998), a public issue can be politicized once it is discussed in
political debate and a politicized issue will subsequently require
government decisions based -- at least in democracies- on careful
consideration of possible odds reflecting logics and features on the
individual political system. For that reason, [[securitized
issue]{.mark} is perceived as an issue that [constitutes]{.mark}
[Existential threat]{.mark} to a certain entity be it the state or else
and [requires]{.mark} extra-ordinary and [emergency
measures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde, 1998, pp. 23-24).
Within politicized issues there is room for debate and the outcome of

other hand, [[securitization demands firm actions]{.underline}]{.mark}
and does not offer much room for political choice [because it is so
urgent that it should not be exposed to the normal haggling of political
but [should be dealt with]{.mark} decisively [by top leaders prior to
other]{.mark} [issues]{.mark}]{.underline} (Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde,
1998, p. 29) [In the securitization process the [term]{.mark}
[existential threat is very important]{.mark} as it provides the crucial
criterion for analysis of securitization]{.underline} as some authors
suggest should be textual analysis (Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde, 1998, p.
29). This idea of [l[abelling]{.mark} a [threat as existential]{.mark}
means that not only extra ordinary measures outside legal framework as a
coercive necessity but also [provides]{.mark} a moral or ontological
[justification for "emergency measures".]{.mark}]{.underline} The
assumption here in is that [[if the enemy is not stopped]{.mark} or the
threat is not contained [the most precious feature of]{.mark} a
state/[society]{.mark}/habitat [is at stake]{.mark} and its very
existence and survival.]{.underline} Look at the case of Saddam Hussein
Iraq and USA invasion in 1993. It was informed by this logic of
extentialism of Iraq as a threat to the other neighbouring countries
including Kuwait. Buzan, Weaver and Wilde (1998, p. 25) asserts, a
securitization must be intersubjective and accompanied by "saliency
sufficient to have substantial political effects". This bring about
debate on securitization and political again, that not everyone could
perform it as long as it is not successful, that is has a measurable
political impact (Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde, 1998). Also Buzan, Weaver and
Wilde, (1998) call it as many securitization moves, which include speech
acts performed towards an audience by securitization actor seeking to
convince it of existential character of a threat towards referent
object. Therefore, [[the emergency measures should be taken to]{.mark}
contain or [eliminate]{.mark} the [existential]{.mark}
[threat]{.mark}.]{.underline} Where we have a recurring or pervasive
threats to certain referent object, the securitization can become
institutionalized. Examples of institutionalized securitization is of a
state where it sustains a standing army or relies on the services of its
secret agencies and also the dikes preventing large parts of the
Netherlands from being flooded which are a commonly agreed upon feature
of the Dutch security (Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde, 1998, p. 28). Figure 1:
The Securitization Process. Source: (Emmmers, 2010, p. 138). According
to Buzan, Weaver and Wilde (1998, p. 24), the securitization process is
a three-way process- can go either side or come from one side to the
other in the cycle. That an issue can either be non-politicized (the
state does not deal with it, and it is not an issue in the public
debate)- de-securitization, politicized (an issue that is part of public
debate and policy) or securitized (an issue that is presented as an
existential threat, and can be dealt with using measures outside normal
politics), and that 'any issue can end up on any part of the spectrum'
(Buzan, Weaver, & Wilde, 1998, p. 24) . So apart from security issue
being securitized as shown on above figure, or after being securitized
it can be de-securitized again. Therefore, de-securitizations are
processes 'in which a political community downgrades or ceases to treat
something as an existential threat to a valued referent object, and
reduces or stops calling for exceptional measures to deal with the
threat' stated by Buzan and Waever, cited in (Coskun, 2008, p. 405).
Thus, the key aim of (de)securitization theory is to identify what,
when, where and how an issue is moved from being part of the normal
environment of politics to become a threat to security and beyond normal
politics -- and the other way around (Snetkov, 2017).

## Thesis Indicts -- Securitization Theory Wrong

### Realism Good -- NATO

#### Realism is the only way to ensure US and NATO security -- Countries will not stop in pursuit of cyberattacks on a military scale.

Department of Intelligence and Security; Soner Celik, of Suleymen

Intellectuals such as Thomas Hobbes, Niccolò Machiavelli and
Jean-Jacques Rousseau had a pessimistic perspective that can be applied
to the ways in which national security needs to be understood. [Those
intellectuals accepted the international system as an area where [states
continuously fight with each other to pursue their own selfish
interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} For this reason, [[it is impossible to
establish universal peace]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the Idealists desire.
This line of reasoning is accepted by Realists such as Carr and Hans
Morgenthau; in their view, the only way to prevent a state from becoming
a hegemon in the international system, where there is a constant
conflict of interests among states, is for states to balance each
other's power.11 The pessimistic viewpoint of classical Realists is
accepted by neo-realists such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer,
according to whom [security or insecurity is a result of the anarchic
nature of the international system on a large scale.]{.underline}
Therefore[, [international policy will]{.underline}]{.mark}
[continuously [sustain a tendency to violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}12
The Realist political approach accepts states as the main actors of the
international system; since the interests of each country differ from
each other, there is always the possibility of war, and some kind of
conflict or fighting is inevitable. The [[Realist
approach]{.underline}]{.mark} defines the international system as
anarchic, and [[characterizes international policy as a power struggle
in which security is the main agenda item in the realm of international
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this respect, the security concept
for Realist theoreticians is discussed through "insecurity" in general
terms, and this theoretic approach is explained via themes of power,
threat and insecurity. [[Cyberspace-based
developments]{.mark},]{.underline} today, [[propose new approaches to
states' threat, security and deterrence agendas.]{.mark} Some
[states]{.mark} have even begun to [see cyber attack]{.mark} and cyber
conflict [as]{.mark} important [methods of engaging in]{.mark} strategic
[defense and inflicting damage on]{.mark} their
[opponents]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Developments in [cyberspace bring
along new security risks]{.mark}; the importance of removing these risks
has thus also increased, compelling states to develop strategies to
address this issue.]{.underline} For Realist theorists[, [this makes the
international system even more]{.mark}]{.underline} uncertain and
[[anarchic]{.mark} than before, especially given that cyber attacks can
be caused not merely by states but by individuals.]{.underline}13 In
Realist terms, the diversification of risks to cyberspace resources, and
the inability to determine the source of these risks, deepens the
anarchic structure of the international system. A cyberspace attacker
can hide his or her identity by using various forms of crypto software
and programs[. [The attacker can even conduct a "false flag"14
operation, making it appear that the source of the cyber attack is
another state or a state-sponsored hacker group]{.underline}]{.mark} [by
using similar software. [All of these circumstances]{.mark} deepen the
insecurity of the international system and [reinforce the mutual
distrust between states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Power struggle and
competition in the international system have [expanded into a new
dimension]{.underline} thanks to internet-based developments. [Many
[states]{.mark} have [used]{.mark} these [technologies]{.mark} as an
[opportunity to develop their hard power. Improving military power with
the help of cyber-based technology and skill has become an important
goal for these states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Allocating budgets, making
investments, training experts and establishing cyber military commands
in tandem with conventional army development are now essential for
states in order to reach a powerful attack and defense capacity in
cyberspace.15 [All of these [developments]{.mark} [contribute
to]{.mark}]{.underline} what Realists call [[the "security
dilemma,"]{.mark} a phenomenon [whereby]{.mark} "many of the
[instruments]{.mark} that [are used by a state to increase its security
decrease the security of others]{.mark}."]{.underline}16 And it is
ongoing. When one state makes a military investment or takes a military
measure, this is taken as a threat by another state, which then applies
similar measures, which in turn are interpreted by other states as a
threat[. The [threat perceptions of states]{.mark}]{.underline}
vis-à-vis one another [[escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}, in some cases
leading to an armament race with mutual measures taken back and forth.17
Based on the security dilemma concept, [[states evaluate international
relations as a zero-sum game, and plan their behavior patterns in the
international system based on the assumption of relative
earnings]{.mark}.]{.underline} They also avoid cooperation by asking the
question, "who will benefit more?" instead of, "how can we both profit?"
As indicated above, [[the Realist approach adopts a]{.mark} [competitive
and confrontational security perspective]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
axis of anarchy. Given the rigidity of this perspective, the limitations
and difficulties of cooperation in the Realist paradigm come into
prominence. Because the structure of the international system is
anarchic, according to this approach, this insecure environment prevents
states from cooperating in the long term,18 a situation exacerbated by
the anonymous structure of cyberspace and its accompanying
uncertainties, which diversify and deepen risks. Concerning all these
evaluations, [the mentality that has started to gain credence recently
is that [critical infrastructure is an inseparable part of]{.mark} a
state's [cybersecurity]{.mark} and thus its cybersecurity strategies.
[This perspective is clearly emphasized in the national cybersecurity
documents of many states.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, Turkey's
National Cyber Security Strategy (2020--2023) Document states,
"Cybersecurity is an inseparable part of national security. Providing
national security in an absolute manner depends on achieving \[our\]
goals in the cybersecurity field."19 As mentioned above, the [[security
of critical infrastructure]{.mark} and information systems that are
mostly managed by internet technologies [has become vital to the
security of any state. State]{.mark}s, now, [are aware that cyber
attacks targeting critical structures can be a serious threat, and that
such attacks can negatively affect their political, economic and
military security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In critical realism, [[language is understood as
constructing]{.underline}]{.mark} our social
[[realiti]{.underline}]{.mark}es. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[these constructions are]{.underline}]{.mark} theorized as being
[[shaped by]{.underline}]{.mark} the possibilities and constraints
inherent in [[the material world]{.underline}]{.mark}. For critical
realists, [[material practices are given an ontological status that is
independent of]{.underline}]{.mark}, but in relation with, [[discursive
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline} The advantage in taking a critical
realist, rather than relativist, approach is that analysis can include
relationships between people\'s material conditions and discursive
practices. [Despite calls to develop a critical realist discourse
analysis there has been **little empirical critical realist
work**]{.underline}, possibly [because]{.underline} few have addressed
the critique that **[critical realists have no systematic method of
distinguishing between discursive and non-discursive]{.underline}**. In
this article we outline a three-stage procedure that enables a
systematic critical realist discourse analysis using women\'s talk of
motherhood, childcare and female employment as an example.

### Securitization Theory Too Limited

#### Securitization theory is flawed -- scope too limited to be useful for accurately analyzing geopolitical developments beyond the West

**Masua '22** (Robinson Masua Ph.D Student, Department of Security and
Correction Science, School of Security, Diplomacy and Peace Studies,
Kenyatta University. "Security is about survival: assessment of the
assumption underlying the securitization theory". Shikshan Sanshodhan :
Journal of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. April 4, 2022

//CD

[The [Securitization theor]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark} in security
studies is applauded because of its widening concept of security
analysis from the traditional military and positivist approach that
security is real and we need real methodologies to deal with it. But
besides its strengths in [security studies it has found some [serious
criticism]{.mark} both [in its function]{.mark} as a paradigm for
analysing security processes [and in overcoming the normative
dilemma]{.mark} of analysing contemporary global security. The approach
to securitization has often been criticized [for being too limited, too
focused]{.mark} upon the speech act and thus not serving a useful
purpose in the study of real world situations]{.underline} (Balzacq,
2005; Stritzel, 2007; McDonald, 2008). [It therefore falls short of
referring to non-speech acts and practices (i.e. body language, visual
representations in media) in the process of securitization.]{.underline}
The main criticism is that of being a Eurocentric approach to security.
For example, Wilkinson (2007), describes the case of Kyrgyzstan to show
that the [securitization theory is [unable to sufficiently account for
developments beyond the West]{.mark} for two reasons: [First,
she]{.mark} says, the theory t[akes]{.mark} it [for granted 'that
European understandings of society and the state are
universal']{.mark}]{.underline}. Wilkinson sates that theorists within
the Copenhagen School must explicitly question normative concepts such
as state and society. [[Second]{.mark}, the theory's [emphasis on the
speech act]{.mark} may be unsuited to non-Western contexts where
limitations to speech exist, and where securitization may take place
through other means, including action.]{.underline} Realists have also
argued that the securitization theory widening of the security agenda
risks giving the discipline of security studies \"intellectual
incoherence\". For any paradigm to retain its theoretical precision and
utility, and having in mind not everything can be defined as a security
issue, as well as to remain engaged with the existing contentious
definition of what is security, Wæver discusses the apprehension towards
redefining security until the concept becomes meaningless and the
analyst is no longer able to discuss operations of security working
within a specific field (Wæver, 1995, pp. 48-49, 56; Buzan, Weaver, &
Wilde, 1998, p. 24). [[The point is]{.mark} that the [securitization
theory is too broa]{.mark}d in [definition of securit]{.mark}y and
actually as scholars we end up not being sure not differentiating
security, human development and sustainable development. [The other
problem]{.mark} of the securitization theory [is]{.mark} the [assumption
of]{.mark} a [normal state]{.mark} of [politics that can be
distinguished from exceptional measures]{.mark}, especially separation
of politics and society]{.underline}. Holbraad and Pedersen (2012),
argues that revolutionary Cuba provides a case of a non-liberal
non-Western state where the liberal assumptions underpinning Copenhagen
School cannot explain fully the separation of the two- politics and
society. [They posit that the liberal distinction between the state and
society collapses in a revolutionary ontology, with revolutionary states
assuming themselves to be the people.]{.underline} [Thus, [rules and
exceptions cease to exist]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a [revolutionary
state]{.mark} [because the state is society]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Holbraad & Pederson, 2012). The Securitization theory assumes a basic
level of stability and cannot therefore be applied to exceptional
situations where there is no such thing as normal politics. A good
example is the work of Greenwood and Weaver Shikshan Sanshodhan :

(2013), who test the paradigm in the context of Egypt during the Arab
Spring. They point out that the Arab Uprisings separated regimes from
societies in a number of states, toppling previously embedded
authoritarian regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. In other
states, regimes framed protesting groups as existential threats,
reconstructing the nature of political organization amidst the
conflation of domestic and regional, normative and geopolitical agendas.

## Threats Real -- Specific Scenarios

### AI Tech Race

#### The international security is currently at high risk, especially as countries compete to make breakthroughs in AI.

**Schmidt 22** - Eric Schmidt, a Fellow of the American Academy since
2007, is the former Chief Executive Officer of Google and former
Executive Chairman and Technical Advisor of Alphabet, Inc. He is also a
Founder of the Schmidt Foundation, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, and
Schmidt Futures. He is the Chair of the Special Competitive Studies
Project and was the Chairman of the National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence from 2019 to 2021. (Eric Schmidt, "AI, Great
Power Competition & National Security", 5-1-22,
<https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/151/2/288/110603/AI-Great-Power-Competition-amp-National-Security>)

[[Breakthroughs]{.mark} in [AI]{.mark} are [accelerat]{.mark}ing [global
commercial competition]{.mark} and [transforming]{.mark} the
[international security environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The reach and
influence of foreign-based network platforms present risks to American
society and require us to confront questions about their origin and
purpose. Meanwhile, AI technologies are enhancing several existing
national security threats, and will change the way states try to gain
leverage against adversaries and exercise coercion and influence in
other societies. [The [**open nature** of]{.mark} [free]{.mark} and
**[democratic societies]{.mark}**, [combined with]{.mark} their
[increasing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[reliance on poorly secured digital
networks, **makes them especially vulnerable.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In
the military realm, AI holds the prospect of augmenting cyber,
conventional, and nuclear capabilities in ways that make security
relationships among rivals more challenging to predict and maintain, and
conflicts more difficult to limit. Even as they compete, rivals should
explore limits on AI capabilities. The AI ecosystems of the principal
global competitors, the United States and China, remain intertwined, and
a calibration of the bilateral technology relationship requires both
selective decoupling and continued collaboration in areas of mutual
interest. These changes require a comprehensive national strategy for
the next decade that preserves global leadership advantages for
America\'s economy and security.

The second decade of the twenty-first century featured two major
developments that, together, are shaping the third decade we have now
entered. [The [geopolitical landscape]{.mark} is [marked b]{.mark}y
[intensifying competition]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its major power rivals, [China and
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, the scientific landscape
is characterized by significant advances in artificial intelligence,
which promise tremendous economic and strategic advantages for those who
capitalize on them.

### China AI

#### Empirical evidence shows China is increasing military AI systems to compete with US, showing how the threat is now and prevalent.

Artificial intelligence has not only begun to be introduced by states in
various spheres of activity, but has also become part of everyday life.
[[China]{.mark}, as an emerging great power, [strives]{.mark} to
maintain and [improve]{.mark} its positions in the field of artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.mark}) [at]{.mark} a [rapid pace]{.mark}, [with
military artificial intelligence]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [one of its
priorities]{.mark}.]{.underline} The article analyzes the activities of
the Chinese government aimed at the development of military artificial
intelligence systems, examines the existing threats, and also provides
recommendations on the use of automated weapons.

The use of artificial intelligence by large states has become one of the
main means to achieve dominance on the world stage. Along with the use
of automated systems in vital spheres (education, industry, medicine,
etc.), achieving economic superiority and improving living standards,
artificial intelligence has also become an integral part of warfare and
the defense sector. [According to statistics, [China]{.mark} currently
ranks second after the United States in terms of [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence development, and the [global market]{.mark} in
this area is [grow]{.mark}ing [by 44.5%]{.mark} [annually, while]{.mark}
the [cost]{.mark} of [AI development ranges]{.mark} from [1.6 to 2.7
billion dollars]{.mark}, which is approximately equal to the cost of
American AI. These [data clearly demonstrate]{.mark} that [China]{.mark}
is [striving]{.mark} to [compete with]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [in]{.mark} the [near future and rise]{.mark} to the
[highest level]{.mark} of [a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence
[development]{.mark}.]{.underline} The widespread introduction of
artificial intelligence in China has become the national interest of the
country and has come to the fore, so the concept of the transition of
war from \"informational\" to \"intellectual\" has influenced the speed
and nature of the development of artificial automated systems \[1\].
Since 2014, Xi Jinping has been paying particular attention to changes
related to the development of military technologies, that is why at the
meeting of the Politburo in August the Chinese leader set the goal to
develop artificial automated systems in the military sphere for the
reformation of the RMA. [An important step forward in the development of
military AI is considered to be the adoption of the \"White Paper\" in
2015, namely the [Chinese]{.mark} Military Strategy, which refers to a
\"new stage\" in the development of military AI. As part of this, 7
areas were identified in which the PLA is mastering artificial
intelligence, where the most popular are intelligence, intelligent and
autonomous transport, intelligence and information weapons, as well as
automatic target recognition.]{.underline} The turning point in the
development of AI in China was the adoption by the State Council of
China of the \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development
Program\" in 2017 in which the main directions of the development of
artificial intelligence were highlighted[. А [plan]{.mark} was
[developed with]{.mark} the [purpose of improving military equipment,
making command decisions]{.mark}, as well as [increasing funding for
paramilitary systems]{.mark}, as Xi Jinping said.]{.underline} This
implementation was the first initiative on the national level that is
directly focused on the development of paramilitary AI as Chinese common
strategy. China has set a benchmark for the Development of its C4ISR
among which are command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. [At the moment, China
has many goals, and, in addition to economic superiority, [China]{.mark}
also [seeks]{.mark} to [gain military leadership,]{.mark} which is
confirmed by the Communist Party in a report from the Ministry of
Defense and Military Power of China for 2020. According to the report,
the [PLA plans]{.mark} to [reach]{.mark} a qualitatively [new
level]{.mark} of [military equipment and warfare]{.mark}, which will be
[carried out with]{.mark} the [aim of conducting]{.mark} [a systemic
war]{.mark}, [as well as]{.mark} the [ability]{.mark} to [seriously
repel hostile neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conflicts with the
Uighurs, unresolved contradictions with Hong Kong and Taiwan, conflicts
in the South China Sea - all these problems motivate China to accelerate
the pace of development in the military sphere, in particular in the
field of AI, as well as to change the approach to warfare.

### China Cyber War 

#### Chinese cyber warfare is real -- unchecked that makes conflict inevitable

//AA

Taipei, Taiwan --- 22 February 2022 --- [[CyCraft]{.mark}, a leading
managed detection and response]{.underline} (MDR) [provider]{.underline}
based [in Taiwan, [uncovered intelligence regarding]{.mark} the November
[2021 cyberattacks targeting the Taiwan financial and securities]{.mark}
trading [sector]{.mark}]{.underline}; CyCraft further
[[attributed]{.underline}]{.mark} the cyberattacks [[to]{.mark} APT10
--- [a China state-sponsored hacker group]{.mark}]{.underline} widely
[believed to be associated with the Chinese Intelligence
Agency]{.underline}, the Ministry of State Security (MSS).

The November 2021 attacks were originally attributed to password
mismanagement; however, [[following]{.mark} a security incident
response]{.underline} (IR) [[investigation]{.underline}]{.mark}
conducted by CyCraft into the second wave of February 2022 attacks,
[[new evidence uncovered the exploitation of a]{.mark} severe
[vulnerability in]{.mark} commonly used [financial software aided by a
new]{.mark}ly identified [hacking technique]{.mark}, Reflective Code
Loading.]{.underline}

CyCraft urges all organizations who may be vulnerable to this attack ---
especially financial firms who have recently experienced an increase in
compromised user credentials --- to conduct an immediate, thorough
security assessment.

[[These attacks are the latest in a series of attack campaigns against
Taiwan by China]{.mark}-based threat groups.]{.underline} In early 2020,
CyCraft curtailed a year-long attack campaign targeting Taiwan's
semiconductor ecosystem; this attack was attributed to another
China-based threat group, Chimera. Again, [[in]{.mark} April [2020,
a]{.mark} CyCraft incident response (IR) [investigation into a
government agency breach uncovered]{.mark} Waterbear malware ---
[malware designed and distributed by the China-based threat group
BlackTech.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The frequency of cyberattacks targeting Taiwan institutions surged by
38% in 2021, reaching an average of 2,644 attacks per
week]{.underline}]{.mark}, Taiwan News reports. The global average is
925 attacks per week. This disparity is due to Taiwan's unique
geopolitical situation, high-tech economy, and mature communications
infrastructure.

First Attack Wave, November 2021

At 5:27 p.m. on Thursday, November 25 of [[last year,]{.mark} a number
of [Taiwan financial institutions and securities
traders]{.mark}]{.underline} informed the Taiwan Stock Exchange
Corporation (TWSE) and the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) that
they [would be [suspending online transactions due to]{.mark} suspicious
behavior --- large, unusual purchases of Hong Kong stocks on consumer
trading accounts --- as a result of [a cyberattack.]{.mark}]{.underline}

After several weeks, the IR investigations theorized that the November
attacks were most likely due to password mismanagement and credential
stuffing; however, the findings were not conclusive and suggested there
may have been other causes.

Credential stuffing attacks leverage poor cyber hygiene habits (i.e.,
users reusing the same username/password combinations across multiple
platforms and websites). Several security countermeasures were taken,
including forced password updates and multi-factor authentication.

Second Attack Wave, February 2022

Once [again, [in mid-February 2022, a number of Taiwan financial
institutions and securities traders were targeted]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- some being victims of the November 2021 attacks and others CyCraft
customers. CyCraft MDR/EDR cybersecurity solutions observed suspicious
files and login events on customer servers and immediately began
investigating. After three days, CyCraft completed their IR
investigations.

[[CyCraft's]{.mark} three-day [IR investigation uncovered that]{.mark}
neither the February 2022 nor the November 2021 attacks were solely a
direct result of credential stuffing. A more thorough investigation
revealed [evidence suggesting credential stuffing was purposely left
behind by APT10]{.mark} --- credential stuffing was just a
smokescreen.]{.underline}

[[Both attacks were the result of a supply chain attack]{.mark}
targeting]{.underline} specific [financial software. A
vulnerability]{.underline} existing in financial software with a
majority market share among Taiwan securities traders [was exploited by
the attackers, [granting them high-level access to multiple
firms]{.mark}.]{.underline} Further investigation showed that [what
was]{.underline} initially [presumed to be two separate]{.underline}
waves of [cyberattacks was actually one prolonged attack]{.underline}
campaign in which the attackers leveraged advanced obfuscation
techniques not previously observed.

[[This isn't the first "smokescreen attack" by a China-based threat
group.]{.underline}]{.mark} In April 2020, CyCraft observed a
China-based threat group use ransomware as a smokescreen for a targeted
attack on the CPC Corporation, as reported by CyCraft and Bloomberg.

["For more than a decade[, Chinese hackers have waged a persistent cyber
offensive against Taiwan]{.mark}ese government, non-government and
corporate targets. [Taiwan]{.mark} also [happens to be home to some of
the]{.mark} electronics, semiconductor, and military [technology that
China]{.mark} desperately [wants]{.mark} to get its hands
on."]{.underline}

Attack Attribution

[[Analysis of the attacker]{.mark} C2 domain, the Quasar backdoor
malware, and the attacker behavior]{.underline} used in the attacks
[[has led to a high degree of confidence in attributing the attacks to a
Chinese threat actor.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the second wave of attacks
observed by CyCraft, there is a medium degree of confidence in the
attribution of APT10 --- a China-based threat group.

[[The objective of these attacks does not appear to have solely been
financial gain but rather the exfiltration of brokerage information, the
scraping of high-value]{.mark} PII [data, damaging]{.mark} the
[reputation of Taiwan financial institutions, and the disruption of
investor confidence during a period of economic growth for
Taiwan.]{.mark}]{.underline}

One of the many attack techniques utilized by APT10 was the new
technique "Reflective Code Loading", which was incorporated into the
MITRE ATT&CK framework just last October.

### Hybrid Warfare

Over the last few years[, [**disinformation, information warfare** and
**fake news**]{.mark} have [become]{.mark} important [**strategic** and
**political concepts** in **international
relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}(Cour la, 2020; Lanoszka, 2019).
Although these terms aren't new and [are as old as the term
'propaganda', their mainstream use within the context of digital
communication skyrocketed after the 2016 US elections]{.underline}
(Grinberg et al., 2019). However even before that, these terms had begun
to enter into the foreign policy discourse of NATO countries following
the 2014 Russian military operations in Ukraine. [Prior to the
annexation of Crimea, [Russia]{.mark} had already designated information
warfare [as]{.mark} part of [its]{.mark} 2010 [Military
Doctrine]{.mark}, which was updated again 2014 with a special emphasis
on digital communication]{.underline} (Renz, 2014). A year prior, the
importance of the digital space for military doctrinal considerations
was outlined by General Valery Gerasimov - Russian Chief of the General
Staff. [In his 2013 article titled 'The Value of Science is in the
Foresight']{.underline}[, Gerasimov wrote: "The very 'rules of war' have
changed]{.mark}. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political
and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, [they have exceeded
the power of force of weapons]{.mark} in their effectiveness. ... [All
this is supplemented by military means of a concealed
character.]{.underline}" (Galeotti, 2019) These three texts are
generally accepted as the doctrinal basis of modern Russian information
operations that were demonstrated both in Ukraine in 2014, and later in
Syria, after mid-2015 (Sinovets, Renz, 2015). [[Since then, strategic
communicative actions]{.mark} that are intended to influence, [mislead
and confuse foreign populations]{.mark} have assumed a central position
in global debates about politics and foreign policy.]{.underline} Given
the impact of such actions on elections, polarization and crisis
management, it was natural for the rhetoric about these actions to
assume such a central position(Bradshaw, Howard, 2018). [However, over
time, popular buzzwords like 'disinformation/misinformation', 'fake
news', and 'information [operations]{.mark}' [have proliferated in
global political mainstream]{.mark} discourse and assumed an accusatory
nature worldwide as more leaders, diplomats, [and]{.mark} politicians
have begun using them to discredit and delegitimize their political
opponents.]{.underline} This dynamic was later conceptualized as
'discursive deflection' (Ross, Rivers, 2018; Smith, 2019) and became
acutely visible in the foreign policy domain, as more countries have
begun [securitizing the concepts]{.mark} **['fake news',
'disinformation', and 'information warfare' to]{.mark}** similarly
**[discredit, and delegitimize]{.mark}** rival [countries(]{.mark}Baum,
Potter, 2019). Broadly speaking, '[discursive-deflection' is the
strategy of discrediting competitors and rivals by portraying oneself as
the sole source of truth.]{.underline} While the domestic political use
of these terms is well-studied, we are still somewhat in the dark with
regard to why countries choose to securitize these terms and what
happens in their interactions with other countries when they do so.
