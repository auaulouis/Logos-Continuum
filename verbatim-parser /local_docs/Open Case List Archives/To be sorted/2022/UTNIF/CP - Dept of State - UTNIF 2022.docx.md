U.S. security sector assistance to foreign countries is funded primarily
in the foreign affairs and defense budgets. As the 115th Congress
considers its spending priorities for the coming fiscal year, the
magnitude, trends, and uses of such assistance may be examined and
debated. [The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related
Programs (SFOPS) appropriations; the National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA); and the Department of Defense (DOD) appropriations all contain
provisions that could affect security assistance funding in FY2018 and
beyond]{.underline}. While the Department of State (DOS) and the
Department of Defense (DOD) are the primary actors in the provision of
such assistance to foreign countries---and the primary focus of this CRS
report―other U.S. agencies may also conduct related programs, including
the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); the Departments
of Energy (DOE), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and the
Treasury; and parts of the intelligence community.

[With the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA, P.L. 87-195) and later
the Arms Export Control Act of 1976]{.underline} (AECA, P.L. 90-629), as
amended, [Congress established the foundational authorities for
contemporary U.S. security assistance programs.]{.underline} These
authorities charged the Secretary of State with responsibility to
provide "continuous supervision and general direction" of foreign
assistance and contained specific reference to "military assistance,
including military education and training," to ensure its coherence with
foreign policy. Over time, the Secretary of State's security assistance
authorities expanded to include international narcotics control,
peacekeeping operations, antiterrorism assistance, and nonproliferation
and export control assistance. [The State Department's authorities were
codified in **Title 22** of the U.S. Code (Foreign Relations and
Intercourse), and funds for such assistance programs are largely
**appropriated through State Department accounts**.]{.underline} [Such
assistance to foreign governments, security forces, and militaries
covers a wide spectrum of activitie]{.underline}s, including the
transfer of conventional arms, training and equipping regular and
irregular forces for combat, law enforcement training, defense
institution reform, humanitarian assistance, and engagement and
educational activities. [These activities may serve multiple purposes
for both the United States and the recipient country.]{.underline}

DOD has long played a crucial role in the implementation of Title 22
security assistance programs and activities, but for many decades, it
otherwise relegated the training, equipping, and assisting of foreign
military forces as a secondary mission on its list of priorities, far
below warfighting.1 [Beginning in the 1980s, Congress began providing
DOD with additional authority in **Title 10** of the U.S. Code and
annual NDAAs to conduct a range of programs and activities funded by DOD
appropriations]{.underline}. Congress began providing such authorities
in the 1980s for counternarcotics and humanitarian assistance; authority
for nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs was subsequently
added in the 1980s and 1990s.

In recent years, the international security environment, and the
associated perceived threats to the United States homeland, has led DOD
increasingly to give greater priority to building and strengthening
security partnerships in a variety of contexts around the world.
Particularly since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
[Congress has granted DOD new authorities in annual NDAAs and in Title
10 (Armed Services) of the U.S. Code to engage in "**security
cooperation**" with foreign militaries and other security
forces]{.underline}---now considered by DOD to be an "important tool"
for executing its national security responsibilities and "an integral
element of the DOD mission." 2 [This trend underlies a significant
expansion of DOD direct engagements with foreign security forces and an
accompanying increase in DOD's role in foreign policy
decisionmaking]{.underline}. As the United States undertook military
action and increased the scope of its foreign counterterrorism
operations, Congress provided a number of DOD crisis and wartime
authorities, some providing new global authority and some specific to
certain geographic areas.3

In enacting these new authorities and appropriations, Congress has
bolstered an expanding global DOD role in building foreign partner
capacity through programs to train and equip foreign security forces,
notably in the realms of counterterrorism, counternarcotics, and defense
institution building. In addition, DOD is authorized to carry out
various security cooperation and logistical support activities, as well
as advise and assist missions that may have the added impact of boosting
partner country capabilities. [DOD's security cooperation authorities
were most recently and significantly modified in the FY2017 National
Defense Authorization Act]{.underline} (NDAA) (P.L. 114-328; signed
December 23, 2016), [which enacted several new provisions that modify
the budgeting, execution, administration, and evaluation of DOD security
cooperation programs and activities]{.underline}. Implementation of
these provisions remains a work in progress.

[The expansion of DOD's engagement with foreign partner militaries over
the past decade has both policy and budgetary implications]{.underline}.
[These include the overall size and scope of U.S. security
assistance]{.underline} activities worldwide, the geographic
distribution of such activities, [and the relative influence of DOS and
DOD in interagency security policymaking processes]{.underline}. Another
implication relates to congressional committees of jurisdiction, as
primary oversight and funding prerogatives have progressively extended
and migrated from foreign relations to defense authorizers and
appropriators. Yet, challenges continue to exist in the development of
consistent interagency action and terminology to describe the range of
security assistance and cooperation programs and activities funded by
the U.S. government.

[U.S. security assistance is broken and in need of an
overhaul.]{.underline} Over the past two decades, the bureaucratic
system developed to deliver billions of dollars of military aid to
partner nations has evolved and expanded not by design but as the result
of a series of ad hoc legislative and policy changes. [Though
the]{.underline} U.S. [Department of State was initially in
charge]{.underline} of security assistance policy and accounts, since
9/11[, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has established a separate,
well-funded security assistance bureaucracy at the
Pentagon]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} has [inhibited effective
congressional oversight, harmed coordination between diplomacy and
defense, and contributed to the growing militarization of U.S. foreign
policy. It has created a dysfunctional and bifurcated security
assistance system. Under the current]{.underline} security assistance
[system]{.underline}, the [returns on]{.underline} America's [security
investments are limited, inconsistent, and not strategic. The
consequences of today's broken system include increased reliance on the
military to solve foreign policy challenges; a perpetuated status quo
where]{.underline}by [nondemocratic partners receive]{.underline} U.S.
[assistance]{.underline} and where human rights abuses are ignored; [and
an ineffective and unwieldy bureaucracy]{.underline}. This matters
because the United States depends on capable allies and partners as a
core component of its national security strategy, but [the current
system is not suited to the task. A new administration can
change]{.underline} this [by embracing wholesale reform of the security
assistance system.]{.underline} To do so, however, a
[Biden]{.underline}-Harris administration [must move
quickly]{.underline} [to]{.underline} work with Congress and include
such reforms in any effort to [rebuild and revive U.S. diplomacy. This
will require talking]{.underline} not only about security assistance
authorities, but fundamentally [about money and resources as
well.]{.underline} [Any reform efforts]{.underline} intending to bolster
the role of the State Department [must start by examining how funding is
oriented and balanced]{.underline} between the departments. This
necessitates close cooperation with the Hill. There must be a dramatic
realignment of U.S. security assistance. This report provides an
overview and a systemic critique of the current bureaucratic structure
of U.S. security assistance and outlines how transferring resources and
responsibilities for security assistance back to the State Department
will better advance U.S. interests and address the current geopolitical
challenges America confronts. It calls for reviving the centrality of
diplomacy by restoring the State Department's role, as originally
intended under U.S. law, as the overseer of all U.S. foreign assistance.
It also offers recommendations for expanding and training the security
assistance workforce, improving interagency coordination, elevating
human rights concerns in security assistance policy, and adapting best
practices from the DOD. Specifically, this report calls for transferring
the following programs and funding from the DOD to the State Department:
The relatively newly created Section 333 train and equip authority,
which replicates the State Department's Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
authority The DOD's security assistance authorities that focus on
long-term security force reform to the State Department, including the
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund, and the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative fund This would result in a roughly \$7 billion transfer,
significantly augmenting the State Department's budget and capacity to
guide security assistance policy. [Putting the State Department back in
charge]{.underline} of security assistance [will be a major reform
and]{.underline} will [require]{.underline} significant operational
changes within the department, as well as [a dramatic expansion of its
administrative capacity]{.underline}. This will take time to implement
and require significant reform within the agency. The DOD has done an
admirable job in setting up a new institutional structure, in
implementing assistance, and in coordinating with the State Department.
However, officials across the U.S. foreign policy world acknowledge that
the system is not working. [Tommy Ross, a former DOD
official]{.underline} in charge of overseeing the Pentagon's security
assistance, recently [argued that U.S. security assistance
is]{.underline} "not fit for purpose" and is "[out of sync with U.S.
priorities when it comes to where resources are needed most]{.underline}
and the types of capabilities required by America's allied and
partners."1 Indeed, throughout much of the last decade, it has been DOD
officials who publicly argued for increased funding for the State
Department.2 Ultimately[, the current bifurcated security assistance
system]{.underline} is suboptimal and [results in the bureaucratic
diminishment of the State Department]{.underline} relative to the
military considerations of the DOD. [Transferring resources and
responsibility to the State Department would centralize responsibility
for foreign aid]{.underline} [under diplomatic control]{.underline},
while improving interagency cooperation, as DOD would remain the primary
implementer of U.S. assistance. Some of these ideas will likely be met
with innate skepticism from a generation of security professionals whose
experience in Washington has been characterized by an ever-withering
State Department and an ever-strengthening Pentagon. This report
anticipates and rebuts likely arguments against reform, including the
capacity of the State Department to take on this responsibility, the
benefits of the Pentagon's current management, or the unnecessary
disruption that would result from significant bureaucratic change laid
out in this proposal. [Failing to reform security assistance not only
leaves the United States with a wasteful and inefficient status quo, it
also perpetuates the marginalization of diplomacy and locks in the
military's newly found dominance]{.underline} in driving U.S. foreign
policy. The current security assistance system evolved to address the
threats posed by the post-9/11 era and is now outdated and ill-suited
for a new geopolitical environment characterized by competition. [If
the]{.underline} next [administration is to revive U.S. diplomacy and
rebuild the State Department, it must empower the agency to oversee and
direct foreign assistance]{.underline}. The Biden-Harris administration
should seize the opportunity to work with a new Congress to reform the
system from its first days in office and restore an effective tool in
the U.S. foreign policy arsenal. [A new security assistance system,
centralized and coordinated within the State Department, would allow
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to wield
its]{.underline} security [assistance more effectively and responsibly
in today's competitive geopolitical environment.]{.underline} [Arms
transfers, training, and support could]{.underline} also [better
support]{.underline} U.S. foreign [policy goals]{.underline}, [in
particular bolstering democratic partners and emerging democracies,
making them stronger]{.underline} U.S. partners [to counter threats from
authoritarian actors]{.underline}. [Empowering the State
Department]{.underline} to oversee and manage security assistance [would
also ensure that aid is used to advance a values-based foreign policy
that respects and supports human rights]{.underline}.3 [It would also
give U.S. diplomats greater clout and leverage and]{.underline}
[potentially create greater coherence to the provision of foreign
assistance overall.]{.underline} [The result would be to strengthen a
key tool in the U.S. foreign policy toolbox and increase the clout and
authority of America's diplomats, which is badly needed]{.underline} in
this new era of geopolitical competition.

#### The perm fails -- ensures an uncoordinated [bifurcated system]{.underline} that undermines deterrence and causes miscal

**Bergmann and Schmitt 21** (Max Bergmann, Senior Fellow at the Center
for American Progress, focusing on European security and US-Russia
relations. Alexandra Schmitt, Senior Policy Analyst, "It's time to get
the Pentagon out of the business of administering U.S. foreign aid,"

[The result today is that the United States has two distinct security
assistance systems]{.underline} --- [one at the State Department and one
at the Defense Department --- **doing the same thing**]{.underline}.
[That has created a **bureaucratic mess** involving countless planning
and operational conflicts]{.underline} --- one that also makes it
[impossible for Congress to conduct effective
**oversight**]{.underline}, [since the two departments answer to
different committees]{.underline}. Recognizing the problem, some
policymakers in Congress and the Pentagon have recently implemented a
few useful reforms --- but they go only so far.

Today, when combatant commanders show up in the countries they're
assigned to, they frequently have security assistance funding at their
disposal. But [State Department officials of similar rank often lack
comparably flexible funding and yet have to deliver tough
messages]{.underline} [on other U.S. foreign policy
priorities,]{.underline} from human rights to economic reform,
democratization or even climate policy. [This power imbalance is not
lost on foreign partners, and they act accordingly]{.underline}, [often
tuning out the State Department while cultivating their relations with
the Defense Department.]{.underline}

[The current **bifurcated system** is not just wasteful --- it's also
potentially **dangerous**]{.underline}. Policymakers originally expanded
Defense Department assistance in response to the post-9/11 focus on
counterterrorism, when security assistance was often seen as a technical
tool to smooth collaboration with foreign militaries. [But in a new era
of global **great power competition**, the provision of arms to another
country sends a loud foreign policy signal, one that can easily lead to
**miscalculation**]{.underline}. [Those assistance decisions need to be
well coordinated and **calibrated by diplomats, not
generals**.]{.underline}

Fortunately, [fixing this bureaucratic morass is straightforward: Just
give the money to the State Department]{.underline}. Our new report
argues that transferring the roughly \$7 billion dollars in annual
Defense Department security assistance funds that train and equip
military partners to the State Department would restore the foreign aid
system to its original conception as outlined in the Foreign Assistance
Act of 1961. The law put the secretary of state in charge of supervising
all foreign assistance, including "military assistance" --- exactly the
programs that the Defense Department is now running on its own.

[Putting the State Department back in charge of security assistance will
give it **renewed clout** and **minimize** needless **waste** and
bureaucratic confusion]{.underline}. [Most importantly, it will
**reaffirm** our commitment to a foreign policy based on **democratic
values** **and** support for **human rights**.]{.underline}

There are [several challenges of this **duplicative security
assistance** system at the DOD]{.underline}:

[The DOD's authorities **duplicate authorities** originally granted to
the State Department]{.underline}. Congress originally granted long-term
efforts to develop another country's security forces to the State
Department and put these efforts under the purview of diplomats. [But in
the post-9/11 security environment, rather than fix the State
Department's lack of resources to handle counterterrorism issues,
appropriators gave the funds to the DOD, contributing to more
**bifurcation** of security assistance policy]{.underline}. [This was
exemplified by the 2006 creation of Section 1206:]{.underline} a \$350
million annual authority for the secretary of defense to support
counterterrorism efforts and assist coalition partners. [Though it
required cooperation with the State Department, it was explicitly
designed to empower the DOD, in part because some DOD officials thought
the State Department was too slow and lacking expertise]{.underline} to
carry out counterterrorism activities.37 In 2014, a Congressional
Research Service report found that "government personnel state that
Section 1206 has been used as a substitute for FMF, especially in the
early years, given what many analysts believe is a shortage of FMF funds
to meet legitimate foreign defense equipment needs."38

[Congressional barriers exacerbated the **DOD-State Department
imbalance**]{.underline}. The 2011 Budget Control Act and a
Republican-controlled Congress skeptical of the State Department made
giving more resources to the department a nonstarter.39 Senior DOD
officials urged Congress to grant the agency new authorities, such as in
a 2008 House Armed Services Committee hearing with the secretary of
defense and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.40 Faced with these
constraints, the Obama administration opted to create more authorities
at the DOD through the annual must-pass National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA). Meanwhile, the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign
Affairs committees, with jurisdiction only over the State Department's
security assistance programs, did little to correct the imbalance.41
According to one study before the recent consolidation efforts, the DOD
managed 48 out of 50 new programs created after the 9/11 attacks.42 Of
the 107 existing security assistance programs today, the DOD manages
87---a whopping 81 percent.43

[DOD officials can work around the State Department's
diplomats]{.underline}. In part due to restrictions from the Budget
Control Act and with new programs at the [DOD]{.underline}, [Pentagon
officials had **more flexibility** on security assistance
programs]{.underline} than their State Department counterparts. The DOD
had budgetary space to reallocate significant funds from the substantial
Pentagon budget to respond to sudden emergencies or new crises,
something that is virtually impossible for the State Department, making
the DOD often the lead actor in a crisis.44 Regional combatant commands
aggressively sought more resources from Congress to conduct their own
security assistance programs, giving them added flexibility to work with
partners in the field that their State Department counterparts lacked.45
A Government Accountability Office report found that 56 DOD security
assistance programs do not require any involvement from the State
Department.46

Temporary programs become permanent. The majority of the new DOD
security assistance authorities were premised as temporary, operational
programs, designed to tackle immediate threats and challenges.47 But in
practice, many programs have endured. Once a multiyear,
multimillion-dollar program is established, it has a tendency to become
entrenched, becoming a permanent assistance program with its own
invested bureaucracy to sustain and expand it.48 The Section 1206
authority exemplifies this phenomenon: A 2017 DOD inspector general
report found that "DoD officials stated that the temporary nature of the
authority made it infeasible to commit the resources necessary to
effectively manage Section 1206 as a 'program'"---despite the fact that
it was annually authorized and funded for 10 years until fiscal year
2015. Some \$2.2 billion was appropriated for Section 1206 before it
became law. Section 333 funding now replicates many of the same
functions today.

[The DOD's duplicative security assistance programs **complicate overall
foreign policymaking**]{.underline}. [Reforming security assistance by
centralizing resources at the State Department---and coupling the move
with necessary reforms at the State Department---would go a long way
toward improving this policy process.]{.underline}

DOD and State Roles in Security Cooperation and Security Assistance
Efforts

[DOD has the primary role in managing and executing a majority of
security cooperation efforts authorized under Title 10 of the U.S. Code
and various public laws]{.underline}. [DOD defines **security
cooperation as activities undertaken by the Department of Defense** to
encourage and enable international partners to work with the United
States to achieve strategic objectives.]{.underline} [\[Security
cooperation\] includes all DOD interactions with foreign defense and
security establishments, **including all DOD-administered security
assistance programs,**]{.underline} that: build defense and security
relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests, including
all international armaments cooperation activities and security
assistance activities; develop allied and friendly military capabilities
for self-defense and multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces
with peacetime and contingency access to host nations.[17State has the
primary role in managing and executing a majority of security assistance
efforts authorized under Title 22 of the U.S. Code and various public
laws.]{.underline} DOD's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) also
administers some of State's security assistance efforts. According to
State officials, State does not have a formal, documented definition of
security assistance and instead refers to the Foreign Assistance Act for
a working commonly understood definition.18 However, DOD has defined
security assistance as a group of programs authorized by Title 22, U.S.
Code, as amended, or other related statutes by which the United States
provides defense articles, military training, and other defense-related
services by grant, loan, credit, cash sales, or lease, in furtherance of
national policies and objectives. **[The Department of Defense does not
administer all security assistance programs.]{.underline}** [Those
security assistance programs that are administered by the Department are
a subset of security cooperation]{.underline}.19

In addition, [some legal authorities are provided directly to the
President who, in turn, delegates agency roles through executive orders
to one or both of these agencies or to other agencies]{.underline}. For
each effort, the agency authorized to oversee or manage the program may
be legally required to consult with, or obtain concurrence from, another
agency or to conduct some other form of collaboration, depending on the
requirements stated in the authorities and accompanying executive orders
supporting the effort and the particular activities being undertaken.

#### Security cooperation requires the DoD

**Quinn '19** \[Major Jason A. Quinn; 2019; Judge Advocate in the United
States Army; the Military Law Review, "Other Security Forces Too:
Traditional Combatant Commander Activities Between U.S. Special
Operations Forces and Foreign Non-Military Forces," vol. 227\]

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the
relevant policies, programs, or activities of any executive agency.
Complicating matters, though, [Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance]{.underline}" that, in
contrast to the presidential policy definition,130 encompasses DoS
programs, but not DoD or other executive agency programs.131 **[In
addition, Congress has defined "security cooperation" as DoD
specific]{.underline}**,132 but it has not defined "security
assistance." [The DoD adheres to the presidential policy definition and
further defines "security cooperation" as all its relationship building
and foreign partner development activities, including "security
assistance," **which the DoD defines as a subset of security cooperation
that is funded and authorized by the DoS**]{.underline} and administered
by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.133 The DoS, on the other
hand, uses the term "security assistance" in a manner that contradicts
the DoD\'s definition, employing it to describe any DoS or DoD
assistance to foreign military or other security forces.134

#### The counterplan competes -- "security cooperation" is exclusively DoD funding and "security assistance" is the DoS

**Kerr 18** (Alexandra Kerr, Institute for National Strategic Studies,

Finally, in the U.S. government[, "security cooperation" and "security
assistance]{.underline}"---[which are the chief lines of effort in the
U.S. toolkit to help partners bolster their security]{.underline} and
work with the United States to support common security objectives---[are
overlapping but **not** necessarily **interchangeable**]{.underline}.
[The distinction between "security cooperation" and "security
assistance" activities has to do with the agency administering the
program]{.underline}: in simplest terms, **[it is either an activity of
the Department of Defense (security cooperation) or the Department of
State (security assistance).]{.underline}**

[DOD and the Department of State (DOS) have shared responsibility for
engaging with foreign partner militaries since the mid-twentieth
century]{.underline}, [with the bulk of congressional security
assistance funding allocated to DOS]{.underline}. **[Any security
assistance administered by DOD]{.underline}**---[whether funded under
Title 10 (Armed Services) or Title 22 (Foreign Affairs) of the U.S.
Code---i**s a "security cooperation"activity**]{.underline}.21 After the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the legal framework for the
funding and administration of such activities evolved in response to
emerging threats. [Congress increasingly granted funding and authorities
directly to DOD under Title 10 for security cooperation]{.underline}.22
[Therefore, while DOS security assistance programs can include DIB
components]{.underline}, [the majority of DIB-specific programming is
currently funded under and implemented by the Department of Defense and
is thus considered security cooperation.]{.underline}

The two terms most commonly used today for assistance to foreign
military and security forces are "[security assistance" and "security
cooperation]{.underline}." Security assistance is the term most
frequently used, regardless of the agency providing that assistance.

There is no State Department definition for security assistance. [The

(]{.underline}CBJ), however, [lists six budget accounts under the
heading "International Security Assistance."]{.underline} [These
accounts, with their underlying **Title 22 authorities**]{.underline}
(the 1961 FAA and the AECA), [are commonly regarded as the State
Department's **security assistance** portfolio]{.underline}.

**[DOD formally defines security assistance as the group of State
Department]{.underline}** 1961 FAA and AECA [programs that a **DOD**
organization]{.underline}, the [Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA]{.underline}), **[administers]{.underline}**. [These include
programs conducted under two of the State Department international
**security assistance accounts** and attendant authorities]{.underline},
as well as programs conducted under four related 1961 FAA and AECA
authorities.

[DOD uses the overarching term "**security cooperation**" to denote the
**State Department** security assistance administered by DSCA **through
which the U.S. government furnishes** defense articles, military
training, and other defense-related services, as well as all other DOD
interactions with foreign defense establishments.]{.underline} The
purposes of the interactions with foreign defense establishments defined
as security cooperation are to "build defense relationships that promote
specific U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly military
capabilities for self-defense and multilateral operations, and provide
US forces with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation."8

Department of Defense (DOD) [security cooperation
activities]{.underline} support or are combined with other assistance
programs and often are a part of nation assistance. This
[often]{.underline} occurs in a manner that may [appear
confusing]{.underline} or convoluted to the joint warfighter. This
article portrays how the programs and activities converge. Although the
various [terms]{.underline} and activities in show in the accompanying
figure appear to have simple names and meanings, they in fact [have
**strict definitions** based on funding **and**
authorities]{.underline}. While some of the activities directly support
one another, others have distinct boundaries between their definitions
and functions. The joint community is beginning to address the framework
of security cooperation in a new joint doctrine publication, Joint
Publication (JP) 3-XX, *Security Cooperation*. [It is important to
embark with clear definitions and understanding of the complex
relationship among these terms]{.underline} to facilitate understanding
by the joint force.

[Security cooperation is]{.underline} referred to in both joint
professional military education programs and joint staffs as [a
tool]{.underline} to be [employed by combatant commands.]{.underline}
However, in other settings, it is a set of programs managed by the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Extensive review of joint doctrine
and policy reveals that the definition of *security cooperation* appears
to encompass these areas and more. After expanding our understanding of
security cooperation, other terms such as [*security force assistance,
foreign internal defense,* and **security assistance**]{.underline}
provide additional specificity for the tasks being conducted, yet some
of these actions [fall **outside security cooperation**]{.underline}.
Even though security cooperation spans the range of military operations
and is inclusive of large-scale operations conducted in support of
foreign nations, it is not all-encompassing of security related support
from U.S. agencies other than DOD.

[Nation assistance is support rendered by foreign forces within another
nation's territory]{.underline} based on mutual agreements.1 While this
term is used to describe the comprehensive approach to assisting other
nations, the definition associated with nation assistance has two
limitations: it does not encompass support to regional organizations,
and it is only assistance by foreign forces. [A better, broader term is
*foreign assistance*, which is assistance to foreign nations ranging
from the sale of military equipment to donations of food and medical
supplies]{.underline} to aid survivors of natural and manmade
disasters.2 When examining the current definitions for *foreign
assistance* and *nation assistance*, we find significant overlap:

Foreign assistance to foreign nations \[ranges\] from the sale of
military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
survivors of natural and man-made disasters. U.S. foreign assistance
takes three forms: development assistance, humanitarian assistance, and
security assistance.3

This term is likely to resonate with the State Department, which has an
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance and a designated foreign assistance
budget.

Nation assistance---assistance rendered to a nation by foreign forces
within that nation's territory based on agreements mutually concluded
between nations.4

The term nation assistance is not often used in policy or strategy. For
example, the current National Security Strategy mentions foreign
assistance three times but does not use the term nation assistance. The
first opportunity to create some clarity is to replace the term nation
assistance with foreign assistance in the upcoming revisions of JP 3-0,
Joint Operations, and JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense.

If foreign assistance were to replace nation assistance in joint
doctrine, the definition would include that portion of security
cooperation that falls outside the realm of nation assistance in
figure 1. Foreign assistance then encompasses all of security
cooperation and reduces some of the ambiguity. [Security
cooperation]{.underline} then [focuses **strictly on the DOD
contribution** to foreign assistance and encompasses all DOD
interactions with foreign defense establishments to build]{.underline}
both national and regional [defense relationships]{.underline} that
promote specific U.S. security interests, [develop allied and friendly
military capabilities for self-defense]{.underline} [and multinational
operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access to host nations]{.underline}.5

Having addressed the larger constructs, it is possible to review and
clarify the relationships between other programs and activities that
occur within them. First is **[security assistance]{.underline}** with a
specific definition in relation to both DOD and State. It [refers to a
group of programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline}
of 1961, as amended, [and the Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} of
1976, as amended. [These programs are **funded and authorized by
State**]{.underline} to be administered by DOD through the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency.6 This is the process by which the United
States provides defense articles, military training, and other
defense-related services. [That portion of security assistance **outside
of security cooperation**]{.underline} in figure 1 [reflects **State and
other civilian agency** involvement]{.underline}.

Moreover, [countries that receive U.S. military systems are not just
buying equipment off the shelf; they are entering into a longer-term
relationship]{.underline} with that country [for training, maintenance,
and sustainment.]{.underline} This is similar to when a consumer buys a
smart phone, as they are not simply buying a piece of hardware; they are
reliant on the company to access its broader ecosystem of apps and
software and trusting the company to safeguard important data. Over
time, a consumer becomes locked in and dependent on a particular
provider. Similarly, [when a state commits to expanding
military-to-military ties]{.underline}---often the most sensitive area
for a country---[they are making a diplomatic bet on that
country]{.underline}. [As they base their military on U.S. equipment and
U.S. training and engagement, they similarly become locked in to
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [This sets
the ground for more productive American partnerships to tackle a range

assistance has been key to building ties with Vietnam after the

One of America's most important foreign policy tools is not fit for
purpose. [U.S. security sector assistance]{.underline} --- [the means by
which the United States strengthens alliances and partners --- is stuck
in the past]{.underline}. Crucially[, it is out of sync with U.S.
priorities when it comes to where resources are needed most and the
types of capabilities required]{.underline} by America's allied and
partners. Despite widespread agreement on the need to prioritize
strategic competition with Russia and China, the United States still
directs a disproportionate amount of assistance toward the Middle East.
An emphasis on counter-terrorism since 9/11 has also contributed to an
emphasis on building the wrong capabilities. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is not equipping allies]{.underline} and partners
[with the capabilities they need to deal with]{.underline} competitors
who are adopting [increasingly sophisticated strategies in the areas of
cyber security]{.underline}, [strategic communications, and illicit
commercial activity.]{.underline} Moreover, [the mechanisms needed to
integrate security sector competition with]{.underline} other
instruments of national power, including [diplomacy, military
operations,]{.underline} strategic communications, [and other foreign
assistance, are underdeveloped]{.underline} at best. [These]{.underline}
shortcomings [hinder U.S. allies]{.underline} and partners, in turn
[leaving them vulnerable to Chinese and Russian influence.
Assistance]{.underline} could and [should be a critical tool for
deterring competitors]{.underline} and enabling, influencing, and
reassuring frontline allies and partners. [Making it so will require the
United States to change how it]{.underline} envisions,
[prioritizes]{.underline}, plans, [and executes security sector
assistance]{.underline}, and that it become more adept at using
assistance for signaling purposes. This in turn will necessitate that
the executive and legislative branches work together to expand the
resources for security assistance or to slay the sacred cows that
account for the misuse of the resources currently available. In taking
these steps, [the U.S. government should ensure that
assistance]{.underline} is delivered in a way that [reinforces, rather
than neglects, its fundamental commitment to democracy and human
rights,]{.underline} for ignoring these values cedes valuable ground to
America's competitors. Signs of a Gradual Shift The United States
provides security sector assistance to foreign civilian and military
forces, agencies, and institutions ranging from local law enforcement
and judicial systems to standing militaries. [This assistance is
intended to strengthen U.S. access to key territories and facilities,
shape partners' national security decision-making and governance, and
build their capacity]{.underline} and capabilities for use [against
shared threats and adversaries]{.underline}. [It also promotes the U.S.
defense industry via arms transfers, supports the infrastructure and
operations of multilateral organizations such as NATO, and increases
military interoperability.]{.underline} [The State Department implements
assistance across the entire security sector,]{.underline} including
organizations responsible for defense, law enforcement, and security of
key assets like ports and borders. [The Department of Defense has a
narrower mandate, and provides assistance to partner militaries under
the umbrella of security cooperation]{.underline}. The Pentagon also
engages in a range of other activities --- combined exercises, staff
talks, port visits, and officer exchanges --- that fall under security
cooperation as well. We use the term security sector assistance for
simplicity, and distinguish where these additional security cooperation
activities are relevant. The U.S. government does not typically define
[Foreign Military
Sales](https://www.dsca.mil/programs/foreign-military-sales-fms) as
assistance, but we believe it should, and that it ought to factor Direct
Commercial Sales into its assistance planning as well. Both types of
sales can lead to sustained U.S. engagement with a partner in the form
of training, maintenance, and sustainment for the purchased items. Over
the last several years, [the national security enterprise]{.underline}
[has]{.underline}, with a great many fits and starts, [endeavored to
shift its broader focus --- from weapons systems to
diplomacy]{.underline} --- away from counter-terrorism and toward
strategic competition with state actors. As part of this shift,
[policymakers]{.underline} have [attempted to realign security
assistance to contribute more directly to strategic
competition,]{.underline} primarily [by creating new resources for
security assistance in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}.
[The [European Deterrence
Initiative](https://www.eucom.mil/document/39921/fy-2020-european-deterrence-initiative-fact-s)]{.underline},
launched in 2014, has [allocated around \$6 billion annually to enhance
America's deterrent posture vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline}. It has been
supplemented by the [Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative](https://securityassistance.org/content/%22ukraine%20security%20assistance%20initiative%22),
authorized by Congress in Fiscal Year 2016 to provide \$250 million in
security assistance to bolster Ukraine's security. Congress also created
[the [Southeast Asia Maritime Security
Initiative](https://www.defensenews.com/home/2015/05/30/carter-announces-425m-in-pacific-partnership-funding/)]{.underline}
in 2014, later re-designated as the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security
Initiative, and funded it as a five-year, \$425 million security
assistance effort, which it has since extended through FY2025. This
[program is intended to improve the ability of Southeast and East Asian
nations to address growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China
Sea.]{.underline} In the FY2021 defense bill currently being finalized,
Congress is set to authorize a [Pacific Deterrence
Initiative](https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/the-pacific-deterrence-initiative-peace-through-strength-in-the-indo-pacific/),
modeled on the European Deterrence Initiative, with as much as [\$6
billion
annually](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/06/11/senate-panel-oks-6-billion-military-fund-to-confront-china/)
to improve U.S. posture in the Asia-Pacific region, reportedly with a
significant security assistance component. [These efforts have been
laudable, but far from sufficient. The European Deterrence
Initiative]{.underline} has largely been used to [shift enduring
costs](https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688849.pdf) for U.S. military
presence in Europe into the Overseas Contingency Operations portion of
the defense budget. It has also [dedicated]{.underline} the vast
majority of funds to posture and equipment pre-positioning, with [little
attention to security assistance beyond combined exercises --- a
significant missed opportunity]{.underline}. The Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative has been managed insularly by the U.S. Europe
Command, which has bypassed synchronization with other Defense
Department and U.S. government stakeholders, leading to a
[focus](https://www.ponarseurasia.org/memo/washington-security-assistance-kyiv-improving-long-term-returns-military-investments-ukraine)
on the provision of "training and equipment at the expense of developing
a long-term strategic vision and implementation of meaningful defense
reform." [In the Asia-Pacific, the Maritime Security Initiative has
shown promise, but its relatively limited funding has failed to
significantly contribute to a rebalance of assistance toward the
region]{.underline}, and it has largely funded projects with little
deterrent value. Incoming U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Philip
Davidson
[declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/world/asia/south-china-sea-navy.html),
"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all
scenarios short of war with the United States." Moreover[, none of these
initiatives have prioritized partner security sector governance --- a
vital element of any strategy]{.underline} that seeks to shape the
behavior of U.S. allies and partners. [As Congress considers the Pacific
Deterrence Initiative, it is essential that these mistakes --- failure
to integrate security assistance]{.underline} with other instruments of
national power, [overemphasis on posture at the expense of cooperation,
and too little ambition]{.underline} for assistance initiatives --- [are
not repeated.]{.underline} Even avoiding them, however, will go only so
far in terms of optimizing security sector assistance for the challenges
ahead. The U.S. government should also address broader challenges with
the way security sector assistance is prioritized and executed.

[The State Department has a wider mandate for security assistance,
encompassing both military aid and assistance for civilians. It is also
supposed to use security assistance to advance broader, more long-term
objectives like trade and investment, efforts to help allies and
partners develop an innovation base, and major diplomatic
initiatives.]{.underline} [To fulfill this mission, the State Department
should develop a planning process that elevates common interagency
objectives]{.underline} for assistance, deconflicts competing objectives
where necessary, [identifies security assistance resources projected to
be available]{.underline} for the period of time [necessary to achieve
such objectives, and recommends the allocation of
assistance]{.underline} based on U.S. foreign policy priorities. Those
priorities should be derived from the next administration's national
security strategy and informed by the availability of resources, and
regional and country-specific assumptions. State also needs to create a
framework to guide the use of assistance as dictated by the above
planning process in alignment with other instruments of national power,
and a framework for factoring in how arms sales --- both Foreign
Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales --- might affect U.S.
security assistance planning and broader U.S. foreign policy objectives.
Last year, the House of Representatives passed a State Authorization Act
that required these and other reforms, but it has languished in the
Senate since then. Defense Department assistance should focus narrowly
on four inherently military objectives: supporting State
Department-coordinated efforts to build long-term capacity so that an
ally or partner can manage its own security challenges; achieving a
fundamental improvement in U.S. posture to prevail (including via
coalitions) in a potential contingency, for example by assisting a
partner to build a deep-water port or develop the capability to
contribute in a specific role to potential coalition operations;
generating short-term capacity when deemed necessary to achieve
strategic objectives or improving interoperability for a specific goal;
and responding to real-time developments, such as deterrent signaling,
personnel recovery, or humanitarian response. Defense Department
planners should be required to identify the objective(s) they're serving
and justify their plans on that basis. They also should be conducting a
rigorous analysis to identify gaps in Pentagon plans for contingency
scenarios involving near-peer competitors or other real-time
developments that could impact U.S. interests, and basing priorities for
security assistance on those gaps. Stronger links between contingency
planning and security cooperation will help focus Defense Department
security assistance and advance strategic competition. Second, [a more
sophisticated and coordinated planning process should lead the United
States to redirect security assistance to U.S. allies and partners in
Asia and Eastern Europe, and expand the nature of assistance
provided]{.underline}. [The U.S. government has begun shifting some
assistance, such as Section 333 capacity building administered by the
Pentagon]{.underline}, away from U.S. Central Command countries to
countries in the U.S. European Command and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command
regions. The State and Defense departments need to accelerate this shift
to compete more effectively with Russia and China. The United States
should be using Foreign Military Financing, as well as Maritime Security
Initiative funding and other programs, to help regional states in Asia
develop anti-access/area denial systems to challenge Chinese
power-projection operations. The departments of State, Defense, and
Homeland Security should also be coordinating to increase support for
U.S. Coast Guard cooperation with allies and partners to challenge
China's white hull strategy. [Realizing a significant reallocation of
security assistance in support of strategic competition will require
increasing the overall budget for Foreign Military
Financing]{.underline}. These budgets have declined from a peak of \$9.4
billion in FY2015 to the current year's \$7.5 billion, while the
importance placed on security cooperation with allies and partners and
the variety of threats they face have increased. The amount of such an
increase will depend on the needs of key allies and partners, and
whether Congress is willing to reduce Foreign Military Financing to
Israel and Egypt, which in some years accounts for nearly two-thirds of
the program's budget. [Unquestionably, the State Department can improve
its prioritization of the remaining amount, which is spread across more
than 100 partners globally,]{.underline} but those limited resources go
only so far. In our experience, selling Congress on an injection of
resources or on reductions to Israel and Egypt will require considerable
effort. The State Department would need not only to provide a compelling
strategy for how resources that can be freed up by reducing commitments
to Israel and Egypt will be used to improve America's national security
posture. It also will need to provide a convincing assessment that such
reductions will not infringe on Israel's qualitative military edge in
the region or lead to a breakdown in the peace treaties between Israel
and Egypt. We believe these crucial U.S. interests --- Israel's security
and regional stability --- can be maintained at lower aid levels.
However, we are also realistic about the political challenges that make
such a shift so difficult regardless of what any policy analysis
suggests. For this reason, although we typically would recommend
starting with a reallocation of existing resources before increasing the
overall budget, in this instance we recognize that directing more money
to the problem might be the least-worst option. [A compelling case can
be made for new resources and authorities to expand the types of aid
provided under Foreign Military Financing]{.underline} --- [including to
address the gaps identified above, such as cyber security and law
enforcement.]{.underline} The argument will be strongest if it is
articulated within broader strategies for competing with China and
Russia. In addition to Foreign Military Financing, [there are a mix of
other programs the United States could use to increase the capacity and
capabilities of key Eastern European NATO allies]{.underline}. As Max
Bergmann observed on these pages a few years ago, Congress is likely to
be unwilling to provide much assistance funding through traditional
grant methods, especially as Eastern European countries are wealthier
than typical grant assistance recipients. This approach is deeply
flawed: Many of Eastern Europe's governments lack the economic
wherewithal to engage in the types of military development necessary to
compete with Russia. Moreover, the United States has clear and urgent
goals in the region that should not be left dependent on the
vicissitudes of partners' budget politics. At the same time, we agree
with Bergmann that the United States cannot and should not shoulder too
much of the responsibility for these countries, which should demonstrate
a commitment to acquisitions. One of the problems with Foreign Military
Sales, though, is that U.S. weapons systems that Eastern European
militaries would need to compete with Russia are top-of-the-line and
likely unaffordable for midtier countries. Providing excess defense
articles is one workaround, but this puts recipients at the mercy of
what is available. Bergmann's recommendation that the United States
provide a mix of grants and loans to help NATO countries make
acquisitions themselves is a fine one, and we would offer complementary
or alternative approaches as well. The U.S. government could consider a
lend-lease program in which equipment itself is provided via a loan or
low-cost lease for a period of time to be used in an agreed-upon manner,
after which the recipient could purchase the equipment at a reduced
cost. Pooled sales and multilateral cooperative platforms modeled on the
Movement Coordination Center Europe are other promising solutions. Any
one of these models would be an improvement on the current approach. [As
China, Russia, and others compete across a range of domains stretching
beyond traditional military strength --- cyber security, law
enforcement, and disinformation --- the U.S. government should enhance
its ability to provide timely, relevant assistance in these
areas.]{.underline} In our experience in government, American allies and
partners routinely ask for this assistance. Yet, [U.S. capacity building
in each of these areas is immature. Cyber security assistance is
meagerly resourced and often ad hoc, with limited assistance programs
spread incoherently across government agencies.]{.underline} Likewise,
intelligence and law enforcement capacity building are limited and often
plagued by turf battles. [Enabling allies and partners to counter
disinformation represents an emerging area of focus, and Washington
should rise to the occasion.]{.underline} In many of these areas,
[effective governance is often one of the most crucial gaps America's
allies and partners confront.]{.underline} To meet these challenges, the
United States should reimagine security sector assistance, factor in its
impact on governance and rule of law, and increase the involvement of
the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Treasury.

#### DoS is key to prevent cyberattacks

<https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2022/04/state-department-announces-first-bureau-cyberspace-and-digital-policy/363982/>//daxw

[The U.S. Department of State announced Monday the formation of its
first Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, an office emphasizing the
digital modernization in the federal sphere that is a key mission within
the Biden administration.]{.underline} Some of the areas of focus
[include national security, economic developments and digital
technologies]{.underline}, all within a policy lense. "[The Bureau of
Cyberspace and Digital Policy leads and coordinates the Department's
work on cyberspace and digital diplomacy to encourage responsible state
behavior in cyberspace and advance policies that protect the integrity
and security of the infrastructure of the internet, serve U.S.
interests, promote competitiveness and uphold democratic values," the
office's website reads.]{.underline} A Senate-confirmed
Ambassador-at-Large will helm the office, with Jennifer
Bachus---previously the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in
Prague, Czech Republic---serving as its inaugural lead. [The CDP will
include three distinct policy offices, including International
Cyberspace Security, International Information and Communications
Policy, and Digital Freedom. In a statement, Secretary of State Antony
Blinken said that the new office will usher in a new focus in U.S.
foreign and domestic security by incorporating emerging technologies
into policy decisions]{.underline}. ["On **cyberspace and emerging
technologies, we have a major stake in shaping the digital revolution**
that's happening around us and making sure that it serves our people,
protects our interests, boosts our competitiveness and upholds our
values,"]{.underline} Blinken said. "**[We want to prevent cyber attacks
that put our people, our networks, companies and critical infrastructure
at risk.]{.underline}** We want the internet to remain a transformative
force for learning, for connection, for economic growth, not a tool of
repression. We want to shape the standards that govern new technology,
so they ensure quality, protect consumer health and safety, facilitate
trade, respect people's rights." Modernization is also a goal the office
hopes to achieve. Blinken commented that the State Department will be
asking for a 50% increase in its information technology budget and more
sophisticated data strategy to build a robust technological environment
within the agency. "A learning institution is a strong
institution---open to new insights, new information, new ways of
working," Blinken said.

#### State Department has a [comparative advantage]{.underline} in AI cooperation -- solves best

**[The State Department Should Lead on AI]{.underline}**

[Why is diplomacy]{.underline} --- **[rather than defense]{.underline}**
or industrial policy --- [the right venue]{.underline} for advancing a
digital democracy agenda, or something like it? [Simply put, the
multidimensional and transnational nature of AI requires an integrated,
strategic approach, and **diplomats are uniquely skilled** in making
policy across these issues more than the sum of their piecemeal
parts]{.underline}. To channel former French Prime Minister Georges
Clemenceau, [AI is too important to be left to the generals]{.underline}
--- or the technologists --- [alone]{.underline}.

So far, most of the government's focus on AI has been through research
and development investments at [the Defense Department]{.underline}, or
through White House Office of Science and Technology Policy efforts to
capitalize on it as an innovative economic windfall. Unfortunately, this
[approach]{.underline} --- including leaving much of the
intergovernmental norm-setting on AI to peer-to-peer military
discussions --- [misses the strategic forest for the tactical
trees]{.underline}. Issue-specific approaches that target global AI only
as a military tool or an economic boon have two dangerous flaws: [They
largely ignore AI as a human rights issue, and forsake the potential for
alliances and issue-linkage across policy areas]{.underline}. [For
example]{.underline}, existing [efforts]{.underline} have
**[fail]{.underline}**ed to leverage U.S. technological leadership to
advance global norms aligned with Western values, or [to use foreign
assistance to promote inclusive digital development at
scale]{.underline}.

[The State Department's diplomats maintain a **comparative advantage**
over interagency peers in remedying exactly these flaws. Diplomats are
skilled in dealing with crosscutting global problems, and well suited to
play a leading, orchestrating role in advancing a concerted American
vision for AI across its economic, security, and human rights
aspects]{.underline}. In Washington, at their posts, and in multilateral
organizations, diplomats spend much of their days integrating peer
agencies' competing perspectives to advance a concerted U.S. agenda[;
leveraging instruments of national power such as]{.underline} foreign
aid, [military assistance]{.underline}, or visa regulations [to advance
disparate goals across different issues; and negotiating in bilateral
and multilateral fora on economic, political, human rights, and military
matters]{.underline}. [The State Department's sustained leadership in
international organizations, which will play a major role in digital
technology governance, is an additional underutilized
advantage]{.underline}. [The White House is wrong not to include the
State Department as a "**key agency**" in its strategy on
AI]{.underline}. In fact, [the department may be **the** keystone
agency]{.underline} --- [linking disparate, issue-specific efforts
together so the result is more than the sum of its parts]{.underline}.

#### DoS is the key actor in emerging technology -- fixing policy is an essential first step in solvency

Carl Sagan was right. The renowned American scientist once warned that
"we have arranged a society based on science and technology, in which
nobody understands anything about science and technology." A case in
point: the State Department's ongoing review of whether to keep cyber
security and emerging technology policy in the hands of the
undersecretary for arms control and international security, where former
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put both portfolios in January 2021. It
makes some sense for arms controllers to lead on security threats in
cyberspace[. Deterrence is an important element of cyber security, and
those who work on arms control would be familiar with deterrence. But
developing and executing emerging technology policy requires a different
set of skills. AI, the Internet of Things, and 5G, to name only a few
emerging technologies, hold vast economic, military, and political
potential. Their impact goes far beyond security, the traditional focus
of arms control.]{.underline} It is multidimensional and so policy
approaches should be too. These technologies lie at the heart of
Sino-American rivalry, U.S. innovation and economic leadership, and the
future of the global order. They are driving tectonic shifts that will
test American diplomacy in ways unseen since the Cold War. [Congress
agrees that a security-dominated approach to technology issues is
insufficient. However, its proposals to improve Foggy Bottom's
policymaking apparatus do not go far enough. **The State Department
could address both problems** --- **where to put emerging technologies
and how to fix technology policymaking overall** --- by consolidating
technology issues under a new undersecretary position. Doing so would
ensure equal attention to economic, security, and political
interests,]{.underline} improve coordination and integration of policy,
and elevate the stature of cyber diplomacy and technology issues. This
move would be consistent with the recommendations of the National
Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. Ultimately,
consolidating technology policy at the State Department would also help
to build the skills and expertise that the department needs to lead
foreign policy in the digital age. Geopolitical and Geoeconomic
Implications of Emerging Technologies Emerging technologies are
redefining what it means to be prosperous, secure, and powerful. Every
country wants to acquire them and use them to expand or project power
and influence, causing friction among nations and provoking anxiety,
jealousy, fear, and rage. To lead at this new frontier is to gain a
geostrategic advantage for the next century. [China is devoting massive
resources to that race. Emerging technologies are effectively driving
two big shifts: the technological revolution and the rise of China as a
strategic competitor to the United States. But this is no rerun of the
era of U.S.-Soviet rivalry. It is more complex. The unprecedented speed
and scope of technological advances today are disrupting the pecking
order within and among nations]{.underline} and hastening the decline of
the existing global order. Cyberspace is now as critical an arena for
diplomacy and conflict as the physical world. China, furthermore, is not
the Soviet Union. The world's second largest economy is an engine of
global growth and has integrated into the international economic order
while playing by its own rules. The U.S. and Chinese economies are also
deeply interdependent, raising the costs of conflict and complacency.
For all the foregoing reasons, competition with China should be a key
consideration in deciding where to place emerging technology policy.
This competition is not primarily a weapons race but a race for economic
and technological supremacy, and a political contest between two dueling
systems. State Department Responses to the Emerging Technology Challenge
Until Pompeo established the bureau for cyberspace security and emerging
technologies in January 2021, no single office or bureau was in charge
of emerging technology policy at the State Department. [The bureau has
not been stood up, awaiting the outcome of an internal review. Pompeo
sought to merge two offices with responsibilities for coordinating
diplomatic responses to the security aspects of emerging technologies
and effectively create a stronger, more unified, security voice. One
office was already under the undersecretary for arms control and
international security, the other was not. Pompeo's predecessor, Rex
Tillerson, took the opposite approach: He wanted to place the latter
office under the undersecretary for economic affairs in 2017, part of
his effort to eliminate]{.underline} special envoy positions, but
critics argued that security issues would get short shrift. Pompeo's
arrangement has operated informally since 2018. He notified Congress of
his intent to formalize it in June 2019. But then-House Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Eliot Engel blocked the formation of the bureau
because it would focus too narrowly on cyber security and fail to
elevate economic and political interests. However, that was Pompeo's
point --- to address "the security challenges presented by rapid
developments in emerging technologies." Emerging technology policy was
thus not really a stand-alone effort after all, but an adjunct of
cyberspace security. Two General Accountability Office investigations
during Pompeo's tenure confirmed that arms control specialists were
focusing solely on security to the detriment of economic and political
interests. While State Department officials maintained that coordination
with other parts of the bureaucracy was taking place, and there is no
reason to doubt that assertion, the General Accountability Office was
unable to confirm it. Furthermore, in public statements at the time U.S.
officials made clear that their focus was on security challenges. But
emerging technology policy requires equal consideration of the economic
and political challenges that these technologies present in the hands of
competitors and adversaries. AI, for instance, could give autocrats
greater capacity to manipulate public opinion, destabilize democracies,
and monitor their citizens. It makes as much sense for arms control
specialists to formulate and drive the required policy responses as it
does to ask democracy experts to address the strategic stability
questions raised by hypersonic missiles (another emerging technology).
Economic interests fare no better. The last administration reached into
its security policy toolkit to regulate "the availability of things" in
response to China's unfair practices in the technology race with United
States, risking American innovation leadership and economic
competitiveness. While some may argue that the administration was
responding to the perceived loss of U.S. competitiveness resulting from
China's predatory trade practices, U.S. industry, at the center of the
storm, certainly did not see it that way. American technology companies
pushed back hard against the worst of these policies on the grounds that
they would not only harm their interests but also the U.S. economy, and
so undercut the very goals that the administration was trying to
achieve. The strategic risks of a security-dominated approach are even
broader. Restrictive U.S. policies and China's responses to them also
turned the dial of Sino-American relations decisively towards
confrontation. A warier, more critical approach to Beijing is warranted,
but Washington has to walk a fine line to keep the complicated mix of
rivalry and mutual interests in the relationship from spilling over or
prompting hedging by other states. A security-dominated approach to
emerging technologies is simply too blunt and too narrow. Arms control
specialists, with their focus on security, unquestionably have a
critical role to play on such issues as seeking a global prohibition
against AI-enabled systems deciding when to deploy nuclear weapons. But
leading the State Department on emerging technology policy requires
perspective on a diversity of vital U.S. interests that go well beyond
security.

### 2NC -- Solves Arms Sales

#### DoS oversee international arms sales -- they solve best

**US DoS 21** -- U.S Department of State -- U.S. Arms Sales and Defense
Trade -- January 21, 2021 --
https://www.state.gov/u-s-arms-sales-and-defense-trade/#:\~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20State\'s,the%20Foreign%20Assistance%20Act%20of//daxw

The United States is committed to strengthening allies and partners
worldwide to meet their sovereign self-defense needs and to improve
their capabilities to operate with U.S. forces to address shared
security challenges. [The **U.S. Department of State's** Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs **oversees most government-to-government arms
transfers and commercial export licensing of U.S.-origin defense
equipment and technologies**, consistent with the Arms Export Control
Act, the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961 , the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and other
statutory authorities and relevant international
agreements]{.underline}. Arms sales and defense trade are tangible
implements of foreign policy with potential long-term implications for
regional security. [For this reason, the United States takes into
account political, military, economic, arms control, and human rights
conditions in determining the provision of military equipment and the
licensing of direct commercial sales to any country]{.underline}. Each
proposed transfer we review is carefully assessed on a case-by-case
basis, and approved if found to further U.S. foreign policy and national
security interests. In addition, major defense transfers and sales may
be subject to Congressional notification. Review and End Use Monitoring
are integral components of the process for U.S.-origin defense equipment
delivered to any recipient nation. The United States works to ensure
U.S.-origin defense equipment is used consistent with the agreement or
licenses under which the arms were transferred. The United States is
committed to expediting, when possible, defense transfers to U.S. allies
and partners, while at the same time seeking to control access to
U.S.-origin defense technologies by hostile state and non-state actors.
Before U.S.-origin defense articles and services are exported or
transferred to foreign entities, those entities must agree to: 1) not
retransfer equipment to third parties without first receiving written
U.S. government authorization; 2) not dispose of or use the defense
article for purposes other than those for which they were furnished
without first receiving written U.S. government authorization; and; 3)
maintain the security of any item with substantially the same degree of
protection afforded by the U.S. government. Properly regulated defense
transfers support the U.S. defense industrial base, promote
interoperability, and reduce the costs of procurement for our own
military. Up to 1 million people across our nation rely on U.S. defense
exports for their jobs. These individuals and the companies they work
for represent a key part of American entrepreneurship and innovation, as
they help to maintain the United States as the world leader in the
defense and aerospace sectors and ensure our armed forces sustain their
military edge. FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) Under FMS, the United States
government manages approximately \$55 billion per year in new sales of
defense equipment to foreign allies and partners. The Office of Regional
Security and Arms Transfers in the Department of State's Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs (PM/RSAT) manages the FMS approval process,
in close partnership with the Department of Defense's Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA) . [DSCA coordinates implementation of FMS
cases]{.underline} the military services negotiate with U.S. defense
contractors. These sales provide the foreign allies and partners who are
our customers with a complete defense capability that includes training,
sustainment, and contractor logistics support. The FMS sales process
begins when a country submits a formal Letter of Request (LOR). Ideally,
this includes both a desired military capability, and a rough estimate
of what the partner is able to spend. Sales are approved following U.S.
government review and, when required, after Congressional notification.
After the sale is approved, the DSCA issues a Letter of Offer and
Acceptance (LOA) specifying the defense articles, training, and support
being offered for delivery. Major FMS sales formally notified to
Congress are publicly announced on the DSCA website . Processing times
for FMS cases vary, but they may take months to define and approve,
especially for major defense articles that may require modifications to
standard U.S. configurations. Partners often do not take delivery of the
full package until years after the LOA is finalized, which is primarily
due to the time required to construct sophisticated defense systems such
as fighter aircraft. DIRECT COMMERCIAL SALES (DCS) Under DCS, the Bureau
of Political-Military Affairs' Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
(PM/DDTC) provides regulatory approvals for approximately \$115 billion
per year in sales of defense equipment, services, and related
manufacturing technologies controlled under the 21 categories of the
U.S. Munitions List (USML) . These sales are negotiated privately
between foreign end-users and U.S. companies. Under the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), any U.S. company or individual
involved in certain activities involving defense articles described on
the USML is required to register with DDTC. Further, a DDTC license or
other approval is required before exporting a defense article (including
ITAR-controlled technical data), or providing a defense service to a
foreign end-user. As with FMS, export licenses approved under DCS are
approved following an intensive U.S. government review, and after
congressional notification, as required. Export licenses are valid up to
four years. Authorizations for defense services may be for longer
timeframes. They may be extended or amended as needed. DCS cases are
considered to be proprietary agreements between the foreign governments
or companies and U.S. defense contractors; however certain information
about cases notified to Congress is published quarterly in the Federal
Register , in fulfillment of requirements in the Arms Export Control
Act. Aggregate data regarding approved export authorizations to
governments is published annually to DDTC's website, known as the "655
Report." Dual-use items and some less sensitive military technologies
are controlled by the Department of Commerce on the Commerce Control
List (CCL) . Since 2013, the U.S. Government has transferred a
significant number of items and technologies from the USML to the CCL to
ease the burden on U.S industry as part of our ongoing regulatory reform
efforts.

Georgia to progress, this is necessary.

Conclusion

Ukraine and Georgia are on the front lines of strategic competition.
While the United States and NATO have provided robust tactical training
and strategic development over the last twenty years, there is a gap in
joint training and development at the operational level. [The U.S. and
NATO security assistance to these geopolitically key nations contributes
to deterrence of Russia]{.underline} while improving the
interoperability and capability of important partners. **[An integrated
joint approach to security cooperation]{.underline}** [focusing at the
operational level will strengthen Ukraine and Georgia and serve as
an]{.underline} [**appropriate deterrent to Russian aggression**. A
joint approach to partnership programs would significantly enhance
the]{.underline} **[defense capability and
interoperability]{.underline}** of Ukraine and Georgia to participate
[in NATO operations and exercises]{.underline}. [Expanding combined,
joint interoperability at the operational level should be the next
critical focus of our partnerships.]{.underline}

\*\*\*Foreign internal defense (FID) is the participation by civilian
and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs
taken by another government or other designated organization, to free
and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency,
terrorism, and other threats to their security\*\*\*

Although the United States TSC efforts are facilitating many of the
military-focused assurance and deterrence tasks NATO has recently
undertaken, [there is room for improvement in gaining U.S. interagency
support for conducting FID training]{.underline}. [The goal for this
type of FID would be to assist with strengthening the **resilience of a
NATO ally** to ensure they are less vulnerable to Russian ambiguous
actions.]{.underline} The challenge for conducting what might be thought
of as "interagency FID" would be establishing priority countries,
identifying focus areas, and getting the appropriate trainers in place.
The key in every case is for the United States and allied or partner
countries to jointly determine the lines of effort necessary to achieve
specific and attainable objectives while considering NATO defense
planning process priorities. [The United States must be cognizant of the
strategic end states for each Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) and associated
country specific **Security Cooperation** Sections]{.underline}, which
should lay out the end states and the ways to achieve them, [and should
be coordinated]{.underline} with the U.S. Embassy Integrated Country
Strategy and associated foreign assistance plans.

There are several challenges to employing an interagency FID effort to
build resilience among NATO allies. First, [the U.S. Department of State
(DoS) and EUCOM must ensure that the DoS Regional Strategies and EUCOM's
TCP are mutually supporting]{.underline}. There is no clear chain of
command in this process, and it will certainly involve intense personal
engagement from leaders across the interagency. [The primary
stakeholders, DoS and EUCOM, operate differently with respect to
generating strategy.]{.underline} The presidentially appointed
ambassadors are the lead for developing their country plans, which are
then forwarded to the DoS in Washington for inclusion in the regional
strategies. In the DoD, the policy offices of the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSDP) and EUCOM generate the strategy
and then push it down to subordinate elements for execution. [The common
ground for decision-makers can be hard to determine since the Ambassador
is the lead for DoS and is country focused and the EUCOM commander is
the lead for DoD and is regionally focused]{.underline}. [Achieving
unity of effort toward building resilient partners will require a
constant, integrated engagement from both bureaucracies]{.underline}.
[Additionally, it would be invaluable to generate some form of
**interagency resilience strategy** that would **synchronize
efforts**]{.underline}.23

Pentagon until June 2021, where he focused on defense-wide topics
including budgets, acquisition policy, combatant commands, missile
defense and cyber, "DOD, State Department establish security assistance
steering committee," Inside the Pentagon , September 28, 2017, Vol. 33,
No. 39, pp. 1, 10-11, WC)

[The Pentagon and the State Department have set up a high-level group to
help **synchronize the two agencies' control over billions of dollars'
worth of security assistance** to foreign countries]{.underline}.

[The Security Sector Assistance Steering Group was established this past
spring by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis]{.underline}, according to Todd Harvey, acting assistant
secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities. Harvey
testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sept. 26.

[The steering committee will help "oversee a collaborative planning
process, identifying top national security priorities and synchronizing
investments to maximize results]{.underline}," according to Harvey's
written testimony.

[One of the committee's immediate priorities]{.underline} is to develop
a process for fiscal year 2018 security sector assistance planning to
"[permit State and DOD to validate security assistance requirements for
countries that directly support this administration's top
priorities]{.underline}," according to Tina Kaidanow, acting assistant
secretary of state for the bureau of political military affairs.
Kaidanow and Harvey are co-chairs of the new steering committee.

[The committee will also ensure DOD's expanding security assistance
programs match up with the State Department's traditional lead role for
that function]{.underline}, according to Kaidanow's testimony. The State
Department requested \$5.1 billion for Foreign Military Financing in
FY-18, with \$3.1 billion earmarked for Israel and \$1.3 billion planned
for Egypt.

But Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-MD)
expressed concern over the growing security assistance role played by
the Pentagon. [DOD oversees several security assistance
programs]{.underline}, [including the \$1.5 billion Counter-Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria fund and the \$4.2 billion Afghanistan Security
Forces Fund.]{.underline}

Cardin called such programs "necessary and important," but worried about
the [control over security assistance shifting from the State Department
to the Pentagon.]{.underline}

"My chief concern, however, [is that DOD is setting up an essentially
parallel security assistance structure without sufficient State
Department oversight, input and coordination]{.underline}," Cardin said.
"[Combine this with the current administration's profoundly unwise
proposal to **slash the Department of State's budget**, **opaque
reorganization efforts** and increasing **loss of experienced
personnel**, and one could easily see us in a scenario in which the
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense could become the **dominant source of
U.S. security assistance."**]{.underline}

Cardin pointed to section 333 of Title 10, which mandates the secretary
of state concur with any train-and-equip program proposed by the
Pentagon.

[The new steering committee will]{.underline} ["optimize]{.underline}
section 333 military assistance and \[Foreign Military Financing\]
[resources to effectively advance national security
objectives]{.underline}, leverage each Department's expertise and
authorities, and reinforce our respective requests to Congress,"
according to Kaidanow's testimony.

"In the longer term[, the intent is to strategically integrate State and
DOD planning and resourcing processes for a wider range of SSA
resources, including by synchronizing budget requests and rationalizing
and refining the use of SSA authorities,"]{.underline} her testimony
added. \-- Justin Doubleday

### 2AC - DoD key - AI

#### DoD action better than DoS -- leaders have already allocated leadership to them

**Horowitz and Kahn 22** (Michael C. Horowitz and Lauren Kahn --
Professor on American foreign policy at John Hopkins -- "Why DoD's New
Approach to Data and Artificial Intelligence Should Enhance National
Defense" -- March 11, 2022 --
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-dods-new-approach-data-and-artificial-intelligence-should-enhance-national-defense//daxw>)

[The ability of the United States to compete in the 21st century depends
on U.S. leadership in data and artificial intelligence (AI). In
response, **the Department of Defense (DoD) is taking a new and
much-needed approach to U.S. defense efforts in data and AI**. David
Spirk, the departing Chief Data Officer of the Pentagon, made clear
yesterday that the office of the Chief Digital and AI Officer (CDAO), in
addition to its other functions, will be the successor organization for
and replace DoD's much-touted Joint Artificial Intelligence Center
(JAIC). While the]{.underline} JAIC symbolized DoD's efforts to get
smart on AI beginning in 2018, the integration of data and AI represents
a maturation of the U.S. AI approach---one that elevates the importance
of AI in national defense. The JAIC itself was not as important as what
the JAIC stood for---**[DoD's commitment to U.S. defense AI
leadership]{.underline}**. In paving the way forward and getting AI on
the agenda, the JAIC succeeded. [From this point on, a more cohesive
approach to AI and data through the CDAO is more likely to accelerate AI
adoption throughout the U.S. military because it links DoD's AI efforts
with]{.underline} data, the fuel AI requires. [For U.S. defense AI
adoption, in particular, aligning these organizations could be
game-changing. Addressing DoD's siloed data, standardizing and improving
its quality and access, is a precondition to having the data necessary
to train algorithms for many defense uses, and any future technologies
that rely on collecting, processing, and using information]{.underline}.
Implementation will be critical and heavily dependent on two things.
First, to catalyze AI adoption, the CDAO will need to develop close
relationships with the military services and combatant commands. Second,
the CDAO will need to coordinate with DoD's research and development
organizations, such as the Defense Innovation Unit, leading on AI
experimentation and research. There is hard work ahead, but the new
organizational design is promising. The office of the CDAO brings
together previously independent components of DoD: the JAIC, the office
of the Chief Data Officer, the Defense Digital Service (DDS), and the
Office of Advancing Analytics (ADVANA). The office of the Chief Data
Officer is in charge of data management and coordination, DDS finds
digital solutions for internal data and security issues, and ADVANA
aggregates data and conducts data analytics. The combination of these
offices raised questions about whether an independent JAIC was necessary
for U.S. defense AI leadership. Departing CDO Spirk says that the CDAO
will be "taking the best parts of all the organizations it is overseeing
and redistributing them for faster and better decision-making." We
agree. At present, not only is DoD's data siloed but its AI efforts and
initiatives are as well. According to the company Govini, in FY21,
fifteen separate departments and organizations funded and worked on AI
and AI-adjacent technologies, often without formal coordination or
throughlines. This has led to redundancies, gaps, inconsistencies in
application and access to data and resources, and an overall hodge-podge
of AI efforts. [DoD has acknowledged this and is making organizational
changes necessary to accelerate AI adoption even more by restructuring
its AI approach from the ground up]{.underline}. Now, CDAO will have
teams working on policy and governance, technology development, and
rolling out data and AI for the Pentagon and the military services, to
avoid bureaucratic duplication and confusion that could undermine the
CDAO's overall authority. In particular, bringing the data and AI teams
[together will improve the data DoD needs for AI development. Some might
fear that the reorganization of the JAIC's functions within the CDAO
means the United States is not as committed to the role of AI in the
future of U.S. national defense.]{.underline} Based on current
information, this concern is misplaced. First, the JAIC was created so
the U.S. military could effectively take advantage of the way AI will
shape the future of war. It succeeded in many ways. Recognition of the
importance of AI for the future of U.S. defense, and national security
in general, is much more widespread. The JAIC made headway on AI
adoption and data literacy, with initiatives like "AI 101," and on the
data integration issue, as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Data
Initiative (AIDA). The military services are investing more in AI and
related technologies such as autonomous systems. This, ironically, makes
an independent JAIC less necessary. Renewing America Ideas and
initiatives for renewing America's economic strength. Email Address View
all newsletters \> Second, the JAIC has also faced challenges that the
CDAO approach can address. The JAIC had multiple missions, including
advising DoD on AI adoption, funding AI research, and building AI tools
itself. The JAIC also lacked the authority to advance military service
adoption of AI on its own, or to itself transform the connection between
AI and overall DoD policy and strategy. The JAIC ended up arguably not
policy-focused enough to lead on policy, and not technically equipped
enough to lead on algorithm development. While the JAIC encouraged AI
investment within DoD, its existence also highlighted how the
uncoordinated DoD AI portfolio required even more organization. The CDAO
approach will address some of these issues by fusing DoD data and AI
efforts, as will a growing focus on AI in other DoD components, from
Research & Engineering on the technology development side to OSD-Policy
(Office of the Secretary of Defense Policy) on the strategy and
governance side. Third, it is difficult to get things immediately right
when it comes to converting emerging technologies into adopted
innovations, especially for conservative institutions like militaries.
We think about experimentation as a critical part of how the technology
invention process works, but the same is true when it comes to
transforming organizations. Given the way data access and integration
are essential to innovation, consolidating data and AI, rather than
having a specific JAIC only [focused on AI, will make technological
adoption across DoD more likely]{.underline}. While it will hopefully
spur AI forward within the department, subsuming the JAIC into the CDAO
does come with some risks. Currently, there is a widespread
understanding that AI is essential for U.S. success in strategic
competition and defense leadership. However, we may be taking the
prioritization of AI for granted, and future DoD leaders might have a
different perspective even if the capabilities of AI tools continue to
mature and advance. If that were to happen, the absence of an
independent JAIC could lead to a withering of focus on AI, and a
downplaying of its importance and relevance, just at the key moment
advances in algorithms become more relevant for many military functions.
Reward requires risk, especially when it comes to innovation with
emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Technology
development is not a linear process and often involves failure along the
way. Innovation becomes even more challenging when it requires
organizational change to facilitate adoption. Saying goodbye to the JAIC
will be bittersweet---the JAIC played a critical role in advancing the
U.S. military's emphasis on AI and set the table for what is next.
Moving forward, however, bringing the JAIC into the CDAO will create a
more integrated approach to AI and data that is likely to help the
United States achieve defense AI leadership.

[Another challenge will be getting the right interagency trainers in the
right country at the right time.]{.underline} With no overall
decision-maker across the interagency other than the President,
organizations will have to choose to contribute to the effort versus
being compelled to contribute. [**In a resource-constrained
environment**, the ability of agencies to surge people forward will
remain difficult.]{.underline} A [potential **DoD** contribution in this
area would be to **leverage the unique capabilities and relationships**
that exist in the National Guard State Partnership Program
(SPP]{.underline}). Although it would not be a systemic fix, the
National Guard frequently has citizen soldiers who have unique skills
from their civilian life that would transfer over to assisting with FID
efforts. Stereotypically, there are a high number of police officers in
the Guard who would have the ability to train in civil disturbance
response. [Information technology professionals would also be invaluable
assets in assisting the Allies with **hardening** their **networks
against Russian cyberattacks**.]{.underline} Additional funding and
authorities would be required to effectively pursue this course of
action but, in the short term, [the National Guard could assist with
filling this gap]{.underline}. [The relationships already built through
years of the SPP would serve to enhance this type of
training.]{.underline}

[The United States must also take into account the nature of the threat
and the operational environment facing each ally when it considers
training and equipping efforts]{.underline}. Each ally will use their
forces in a manner informed by culture, history, geopolitics, and other
factors, which ideally should shape the scope and breadth of U.S.
efforts. For example, [FID activities could enable the Baltic States in
their efforts to counter ambiguous threats ultimately emanating from
Moscow, but U.S. planners must be cognizant of Baltic State
sensitivities toward their Russian-speaking populations]{.underline}. A
large amount of the recommended FID training is already taking place
under EUCOM's TSC efforts. [**What is currently lacking is a
synchronized interagency effort** that is focused on building national
resiliency as a component of an overall country specific
strategy.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- DoD key -- Funding

#### DoD is better -- they have the budget flexibility key to solve

Moreover, funding data for security assistance and data on historical
security assistance funding are incomplete. [Although DOS has long been
required to track most security assistance funding by aid account and on
an individual country basis, DOD has not]{.underline}. As a result,
comparisons between security assistance funding provided by both
departments are challenging, and totaling the two may leave gaps.

The 115th Congress is continuing scrutiny and debate on security
assistance matters. [Within the **Department of State**, Foreign
Operations, and Related Programs FY2018 budget request, the
Administration is seeking to]{.underline} reduce [international security
assistance by about \$2.3 billion, or 24.4%.]{.underline} [Each of the
security assistance programs would be reduced by amounts ranging from 9%
to more than 54%.]{.underline} [In addition, the Administration proposes
making changes to security assistance programs, such as **designating
95%** of the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program to four
countries]{.underline}. [The r**emaining 5% of the funds**, rather than
being made available on a grant basis globally as FMF is currently
implemented, would be made available to all other countries with a
combination of grant and loan assistance]{.underline} to be coordinated
with DOD. Congress is also debating a possible increase of Overseas
Contingency Operations (OCO) funds for defense and nondefense, including
for funding security assistance activities in FY2018.5

Currently, [**there is no DOD budget request** for security cooperation
programs and activities that is **comparable** **to the Department of
State**]{.underline}, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs FY2018
budget request for State Department-managed security assistance
accounts. Soon, however, this may change; Section 1249 of the FY2017
NDAA added a new section to Title 10 of the U.S. Code, requiring the
President, beginning with the FY2019 budget, to submit a formal,
consolidated budget request for all DOD's security cooperation efforts,
including the military departments and, as practicable, by country or
region and by authority.

### 2AC -- CP fails -- Staffing

#### DoS is structurally flawed and can't solve -- lack of talent and funding 

**Zeya and Finer 20** (Uzra S. Zeya, CEO and president of the Alliance
for Peacebuilding, a network of more than 130 organizations working in
over 180 countries to end conflict through peaceful means. Jon Finer,

WC)

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that [principled
**American leadership has waned** but remains in demand around the
world]{.underline}. Moreover, America's network of international
relationships is its foremost strategic asset, even as the agency
charged with advancing U.S. interests through diplomacy---the
[Department of State (DOS)--- has fallen into a deep and **sustained
period of crisis**]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing
assumption: that the current crisis offers an opportunity to address
this predicament and revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the
decades-long failure to implement essential reforms---and even in the
face of sustained hostility from the current administration---diplomacy
remains the best tool the United States has to advance its foreign
policy interests.

The role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid
the onslaught it has suffered under the Donald J. [Trump
administration]{.underline}, which has [treated American diplomats and
diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of the challenges
facing the DOS have existed for decades]{.underline}. [Deficits in
diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization are endemic to
the State Department as an institution, and a diminished policy role for
career officials persisted under previous administrations]{.underline}.
Too often, leaders from both major parties have taken public support for
U.S. leadership in the world for granted without making a strong enough
case to the American public for why it is essential. Concrete steps can,
and should, be taken solely through executive action in the first year
of an administration committed to revitalizing American diplomacy, with
thought to cementing change through legislation.

The most [pressing challenges facing the State Department]{.underline}
[include]{.underline} a twenty-first-century [policy environment
tha]{.underline}t has, in some priority areas, [evolved beyond the core
competencies of most Foreign and Civil Service officers and an
institution hollowed out by three years of **talent
flight,**]{.underline} [mired in excessively layered structure, and
**resistant to reform.**]{.underline} Perhaps most important, they
include the multigenerational challenge of a [diplomatic workforce that
falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves,]{.underline} particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising
its effectiveness and [fostering a **homogeneous and risk-averse
culture**]{.underline} [that **drives out** rather than cultivates fresh
**perspectives**]{.underline}. [The State Department today risks
**losing the "war for talent**,"]{.underline} [not only to the private
sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to inflexible
career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack of
commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered by Congress's** failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation]{.underline}, [leading to **budgetary
pressures** and **diminishing DOS's status** i]{.underline}n the
hierarchy of national security agencies rather than reinforcing the
nation's paramount foreign policy institution.

In an era in which the United States' military and economic advantages
over its nearest rivals are eroding and the more than \$5 trillion spent
in the U.S. war on terrorism since 9/11 has corresponded with a fivefold
increase in global terrorist attacks annually, alliances and
relationships with partners around the world are ever-important
components of U.S. national power.1 [In recent years]{.underline}, for a
range of reasons, the [United States' international relationships have
**atrophied** along with its diplomatic capacity to leverage them
against the threats and opportunities it faces]{.underline}. The
profoundly challenging moment at home--- interrelated crises of public
health, economic prosperity, and racial justice---is all the more reason
to take stock of how to participate in the wider world, not turn away
from it.

#### The DoS is ill-staffed to undergo a major AI crusade now

#### Buble 20 Courtney Buble, staff correspondent who covers federal management, oversight, contracting and regulations, "Watchdog Finds Serious Staffing and Leadership Problems at State Department", JANUARY 23, 2020, https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2020/01/watchdog-finds-serious-staffing-and-leadership-problems-state-department/162621/

[The State Department's mission is compromised by "staff shortages,
frequent turnover, poor leadership, and inexperienced and undertrained
staff]{.underline}," the department's inspector general warned in a new
report. "Workforce management issues are pervasive, affecting programs
and operations domestically and overseas and across functional areas and
geographic regions," the watchdog
[reported](https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/fy_2019_ig_statement_on_department_management_challenges.pdf)
Wednesday. [The [16-month hiring
freeze](https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2018/05/after-16-months-state-department-ends-hiring-freeze/148219/) imposed
by the Trump administration in early 2017 continues to affect operations
and morale]{.underline}, the IG found, noting that department officials
anticipate it will take until 2021 to fully recover from its impact. All
38 bureaus and offices that responded to the IG's survey and 97% of the
embassies and consulates reported that the hiring freeze had either a
somewhat negative or very negative effect on employee morale and
welfare. "[Employees told OIG that the hiring freeze contributed to
excessive workloads, and the lack of transparency about the objectives
intended to be achieved by the hiring freeze caused some to be concerned
about losing their jobs,"]{.underline} the IG reported. Not all
workforce problems can be attributed to the hiring freeze, however. The
report cited challenges at the U.S. embassy in Nassau, Bahamas, stemming
from senior leadership vacancies that date back years---[the embassy has
been without a permanent confirmed ambassador since November
2011]{.underline}. At the same embassy, [the acting director of the
Office of Foreign Mission was "overburdened and
overwhelmed"]{.underline} from holding three positions and there was a
disproportionate workload from the realignment of other personnel. In
addition to staffing shortages, ["under-qualified staff is an issue that
frequently intersects with the department's difficulties managing and
overseeing contracts,"]{.underline} the IG said. For example, [in Iraq,
there was a lack of qualified employees to serve as contracting officer
representatives and, in India, officers in charge of human rights and
counterterrorism did not have the necessary training. ]{.underline}In
its response to the IG's findings, State agreed that it is "critically
important" to maintain adequate staffing levels and said the department
has made significant progress: "Under Secretary Pompeo's leadership,
currently the department is just 1% shy of its goal to have over 13,000
Foreign Service employees by January 2020, with nearly 12,800 FS staff
on board as of October 2019." The department also aims to increase civil
service hiring by about 7%, and is taking steps to improve retention and
recruitment. Beyond staffing and training, the [IG also cited a number
of examples of poor leadership. At the Bureau of International
Organization Affairs, which has 11 offices that carry out U.S. policy in
the United Nations and other international organizations, the IG found
allegations of political appointees disrespecting, retaliating against,
and harassing career staff.]{.underline} Compounding the problems,
leadership failed to address the issues. At the Libreville Embassy in
Gabon, Africa, the problems were rife: a senior leader's verbal
outbursts rattled staff; [supervisors failed to address poor
performance; and the deputy chief of mission urged staff to find a job
for his spouse, which possibly violated the anti-nepotism
policy.]{.underline} "The department acknowledges that combatting a
toxic workplace starts at the top; holding leadership accountable is key
to maintaining a productive and mission-focused workplace," State said
in its response.

[A growing, bipartisan number of lawmakers are expressing alarm over

they have contributed to plummeting morale and will undermine diplomacy

wrote that \"America\'s diplomatic power is being weakened internally as

But anecdotes abound in the agency's halls. Former ambassadors recalled
to Washington feel humiliated about being assigned menial jobs such as
reviewing Freedom of Information Act requests to clear a large backlog.
[Competition for overseas jobs has become fiercer as more young
diplomats seek to escape the turmoil for the next few
years]{.underline}. Many employees are still bristling over Trump's
assertion this month that while a number of [**key positions** at the
State Department still **have no nominees** to fill them,]{.underline}
"I'm the only one that matters" in formulating foreign policy. Job
opportunities also are shrinking at the U.S. Agency for International
Development, which recently notified 97 applicants for overseas postings
that the positions had been canceled, a tacit admission that the hiring
freeze will be in place for a long time. \[[USAID cancels jobs for

Nevertheless, State Department figures show that the number of employees
remains about the same as it was when Tillerson took the reins in early
February. Two-thirds of the 76,000 employees are locally employed in 276
missions around the world, leaving almost 14,000 Foreign Service
officers and almost 11,000 civil service employees. Although the hiring
freeze is still in effect, Tillerson has mitigated the impact by
approving more than 2,300 exemptions to the freeze as of late October.
Among the hires are about 300 new Foreign Service officers and almost
150 civil service employees. The numbers underscore a flight of
experienced leadership. Barbara Stephenson, who heads the American
Foreign Service Association union, wrote in a recent newsletter that
senior leaders are departing at a "dizzying speed." Among the figures
she cited, three of the five career ambassadors, the highest rank for
diplomats, have quit or retired since Tillerson took over. The number of
career ministers, the next level down, also has decreased, from 33 to
19. The next-level ministers are down by 62 diplomats, to 369, just
since Labor Day, "and are still falling," she wrote. Stephenson also
said that fewer Foreign Service officers are being recruited, and far
fewer are taking the entrance exam, although State Department officials
attribute this to an improving economy rather than a lack of interest.
Stephenson thinks the damage will be felt for years. "The talent being
shown the door now is not only our top talent but also talent that
cannot be replicated overnight," she wrote. This is not the first time
the State Department has been hit with big staff cuts. Under President
Bill Clinton, the department cut more than 2,000 employees, largely by
shuttering the U.S. Information Agency, and closed consulates in 26
foreign cities. USAID, which runs foreign aid programs, closed 23
overseas missions. According to congressional aides who deal with State
Department operations, the goal is again to reduce the ranks by 2,000
people, a proposed cut that has held steady since Trump came to office
and before Tillerson took over. [But the latest round of staff cuts is
far less transparent than previous efforts, with almost no details
provided to Congress]{.underline}, [they say. "It's being done behind
the scenes,]{.underline}" said one aide, speaking on the condition of
anonymity to offer frank insight about what they are hearing from State
Department employees who don't normally speak to Congress. "They dismiss
the legitimacy of Foreign Service officers. They started working at
breaking down morale from the get-go. There's not a lot of trust there."
In their letter to Tillerson, Shaheen and McCain cited the union's
statistics to paint a picture of a State Department floundering. Shaheen
sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and McCain heads the
Senate Armed Services Committee. "Taken together," they wrote,
"[questionable management practices at the Department of State; the
attitudes of some in the Administration on the value of diplomacy;
declining morale, recruitment and retention; the lack of experienced
leadership to further the strength and longevity of our nation's
diplomatic corps; and reports of American diplomacy becoming less
effective paint a disturbing picture."]{.underline}

[Congressional barriers exacerbated the **DOD-State Department
imbalance**]{.underline}. [The 2011 Budget Control Act]{.underline} [and
a Republican-controlled Congress skeptical of the State Department made
giving more resources to the department a nonstarter]{.underline}.39
Senior DOD officials urged Congress to grant the agency new authorities,
such as in a 2008 House Armed Services Committee hearing with the
secretary of defense and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.40 [Faced
with these constraints, the Obama administration opted to create more
authorities at the DOD]{.underline} through the annual must-pass
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Meanwhile, the Senate Foreign
Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees, with jurisdiction only
over the State Department's security assistance programs, did little to
correct the imbalance.41 According to one study before the recent
consolidation efforts, the [DOD managed 48 out of 50 new programs
created after the 9/11 attacks.42 Of the 107 **existing security
assistance programs toda**y, the **DOD manages** 87---**a whopping 81
percent**.43]{.underline}

[DOD officials can work around the State Department's
diplomats]{.underline}. In part due to restrictions from the Budget
Control Act and with new programs at the [DOD]{.underline}, [Pentagon
officials had **more flexibility** on security assistance programs than
their State Department counterparts]{.underline}. [The **DOD had
budgetary space** **to reallocate significant funds** f**rom the
substantial Pentagon budget to respond to sudden emergencies or new
crises**, **something that is virtually impossible for the State
Department, making the DOD often the lead actor in a
crisis**.]{.underline}44 Regional combatant commands aggressively sought
more resources from Congress to conduct their own security assistance
programs, [giving them added flexibility to work with partners in the
field that their State Department counterparts lacked]{.underline}.45 A
Government Accountability Office report found that [56 DOD security
assistance programs do not require any involvement from the State
Department.]{.underline}46
