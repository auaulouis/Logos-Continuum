#### US-Taiwan security cooperation is [expanding now]{.underline}, but success depends on [sustained]{.underline} US support

**[Bilateral military initiatives are]{.underline}** reportedly
**[expanding]{.underline}**, [in accordance with the growing threat
posed by China]{.underline}. [Washington is]{.underline} reportedly
[considering using special **op**]{.underline}erator[**s** to help
Taipei to conduct irregular warfare, including establishing resistance
networks and countering an amphibious landing. This could support
Taiwan's grassroots efforts to mount a **whole-of-society** defense of
the island, integrating civilian militias with active-duty and reserve
military personnel]{.underline}. Earlier this year, [the United States
and Taiwan signed a coast guard cooperation agreement]{.underline}.
Taiwan is fielding coast guard vessels capable of carrying anti-ship
missiles and envisions its coast guard as a second navy during wartime.
[Taiwan is also revamping its military reserve system. These are
**complex** **undertakings** that]{.underline} would **[benefit from
substantial U.S. advice and assistance]{.underline}** --- [especially if
they are to be realized this decade]{.underline}. [Congress is also
**pushing** for more tangible U.S. support to Taiwan's defensive
preparedness]{.underline}, beyond routine U.S. arms sales. The recently
introduced Taiwan Deterrence Act and Arm Taiwan Act would authorize \$2
billion and \$3 billion a year respectively in foreign military
financing for Taiwan. [This could help Taipei to purchase relevant
defense articles]{.underline} like survivable communications systems,
coastal defense cruise missiles (including in shipping containers),
small missile boats, sea mines, loitering munition swarms, and mobile
air defenses. The Taiwan Partnership Act would establish a partnership
between the U.S. National Guard and Taiwan's military. Taiwan's plan to
spend an extra \$9 billion on domestically manufactured missiles and
other capabilities may also generate demand for increased U.S. military
assistance.

#### Perception is key. Re-commitment to NATO at the [expense of Asia]{.underline} triggers Chinese aggression against Taiwan

**Sacks 22** (David Sacks, research fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, where his work focuses on U.S.-China relations, U.S.-Taiwan
relations, Chinese foreign policy, cross-Strait relations, and the
political thought of Hans Morgenthau, "Don\'t Pivot From the Pivot to
Asia," *Council on Foreign Relations*, March 2022,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/dont-pivot-pivot-asia)>

[With]{.underline} Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}, major
[war has returned to Europe and with it calls for the United States to
prioritize countering the present threat posed by Russia
over]{.underline} the threat [China]{.underline} could one day pose.
[But Russia's ineffectiveness on the battlefield, paired with the
increasing investments European nations are making in their defense,
gives the United States a better opportunity than ever **to finally
pivot to Asia** and **focus on the more formidable challenge China
represents**]{.underline}. [A failure to do so could **embolden China**
and give Beijing an **opening to increase its influence**, to the
detriment of U.S. security and prosperity]{.underline}. Over a decade
ago, President [Obama announced the "pivot]{.underline}" or "rebalance"
to Asia in a speech to the Australian Parliament, declaring "the United
States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia
Pacific region." The president's speech followed an essay by Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton entitled "America's Pacific Century," where she
argued for a "strategic turn to the region." All too often, however, the
United States has failed to pair this ambitious rhetoric with policies
that reflected the region's importance. Now, Putin's aggression against
Ukraine has led to a growing consensus that the United States needs
[**to**]{.underline} view Russia as its primary geopolitical challenge
and **[shift resources to Europe]{.underline}**. But such a
reorientation of U.S. strategy **[would]{.underline}** again [**delay
the pivot** to Asia just when it is both **more necessary and more
viable than ever**]{.underline}. The reasoning may be counterintuitive
but holds all the same. The [war in Ukraine has revealed Russia's
military is incapable of waging modern warfare and does not have the
ability to fundamentally threaten NATO]{.underline}. Russia failed to
establish air superiority over Ukraine, its logistics are in shambles,
and morale among its soldiers is reportedly dangerously low. The
defining image of this war thus far is of a stalled Russian convoy
stretching forty miles on a road leading to Kyiv. Overcoming these
issues will take years and require a fundamental overhaul of Russia's
military culture and doctrine. Russia will have to undertake these
difficult reforms with its military in tatters. While it is difficult to
know exactly how many casualties Russia has suffered in Ukraine, it is
well into the thousands, and the Russian military will likely suffer far
greater losses if it attempts to take Kyiv. [Russia has lost some of its
most advanced fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, and artillery, while
depleting its munitions. It will take a long time for Russia to rebuild
its material strength, a prospect that will be even more daunting given
the sanctions that are in force]{.underline}. [The crisis in Ukraine has
also forced European countries to awaken from their slumber, and they
are now willing to shoulder a greater burden for their
defense]{.underline}. Most consequentially, Germany has announced it
will increase its defense spending to 2 percent of GDP and purchase 35
F-35 fighter jets, which will increase interoperability with NATO
forces. Sweden is also looking to increase its defense spending to 2
percent of GDP, while support for joining NATO has surged in the
country. Denmark has pledged to meet the 2 percent target, while Latvia,
Poland, and Romania have signaled they will boost defense spending to
exceed that target. [A depleted and exhausted Russian military and
increased European investments in their defense mean the United States
can meet its obligations to its NATO allies while **shifting resources
to Asia**]{.underline}. As such, [the Department of Defense should
continue to identify China **as the pacing challenge** given its
military might and its regional ambitions.]{.underline} [Taiwan **should
remain the pacing scenario**, as it is the most difficult one for the
United States to address and therefore if the United States gets that
right it will be well-positioned to respond to other regional
contingencies]{.underline}. [**Capabilities**]{.underline} most relevant
[**for** a **Taiwan scenario should be prioritized**]{.underline}, in
particular long-range missiles and submarines, while the United States
should continue to distribute its military presence throughout the
region. With NATO's conventional capabilities set to improve, once this
crisis passes the United States should withdraw the seven thousand
troops it sent to Europe following Russia's invasion and review its
force posture on the continent, where it currently has ninety thousand
service members based. [While Putin has upended European security,
nothing has occurred since the war in Ukraine began that reduces the
challenge that China poses for the United States]{.underline}. China's
military spending shows no sign of slowing down and is projected to
increase by over 7 percent this year. It is continuing to invest in
capabilities designed to prevent the United States from successfully
intervening on behalf of its allies and is rapidly expanding its nuclear
arsenal. China's economy is set to grow by 5.5 percent this year and it
is pulling additional economies into its orbit with the entry into force
of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and ongoing Belt and
Road Initiative investments. While [the United States]{.underline}
certainly needs to deal with the urgent threat to European security, it
[cannot lose sight of the more serious and multidimensional challenge
coming from Beijing]{.underline}. Indeed, [if the **perception takes
root** that the United States is pivoting away from Asia and **toward
Europe** this could prompt China to conclude it has a **window of
opportunity** for remaking the regional order]{.underline}.

#### China-Taiwan war goes nuclear

**Pettyjohn and Wasser 22**, Stacie L. Pettyjohn, senior fellow and
director of the defense program at the Center for a New American
Security. Becca Wasser, fellow in the defense program and co-lead of The
Gaming Lab at the Center for a New American Security, "A Fight Over
Taiwan Could Go Nuclear," *Foreign Affairs*, 2022,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-05-20/fight-over-taiwan-could-go-nuclear/)>

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

## UQ

### U\-\--Assistance High

#### US-Taiwan defense cooperation is high now

<https://warontherocks.com/2022/01/reestablish-the-u-s-military-assistance-advisory-group-taiwan/)>

The United States has a nasty habit of firing resources at a military
problem first and asking questions about effective implementation later
--- as recently demonstrated in Iraq and Afghanistan --- but that does
not have to be the case with Taiwan. [U.S. officials are **starting to
get more serious** about supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself.
They debate competing policy stances on defending Taiwan]{.underline}
(ambiguity versus clarity) [but largely agree that "bolstering Taiwan's
self-defenses is an urgent task and an **essential feature of
deterrence**]{.underline}," as recently stated by the Pentagon's top
official for Asia. [Experienced U.S. officials are raising the alarm
that China may attempt forceful unification with Taiwan]{.underline}
later this decade [if deterrence continues to erode]{.underline}. In the
1970s, the United States used triangular diplomacy to gain leverage over
the Soviet Union by opening relations with China and eventually
switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei, which Washington had
previously recognized as the seat of the legitimate Chinese state and
government, to Beijing. Prior to this switch in 1979, the U.S. Military
Assistance Advisory Group-Taiwan was the central hub for planning,
coordinating, and executing defense cooperation initiatives. It served
as the eyes, ears, and voice of the U.S. military to the Taiwanese armed
forces. It possessed the requisite staff and planning horsepower to
facilitate the large-scale military arms transfers, training, and
advising that contributed to decades of Taiwanese military superiority
over China, which has since evaporated. [U.S.-Taiwanese defense
initiatives are **ramping up** --- to levels unseen since 1979 --- due
to legitimate concerns about Chinese designs on the island]{.underline}.
However, the thick military organizational connective tissue that
existed prior to 1979 is no longer in place to facilitate this
cooperation. Without a military organization focused on the island, the
U.S. personnel, funding, and materiel poured into supporting Taiwan may
be inefficiently applied and generate limited return on investment ---
defined in terms of deterrence and lethality in conflict. To help to
deter Chinese aggression, the United States should establish a 21st
century version of this often forgotten advisory group to provide the
staff capacity, synchronization, and interagency integration required to
facilitate increasingly robust U.S.-Taiwanese military collaboration,
bolster Taiwan's defenses, and strengthen its will to fight. Despite
inevitable Chinese government counterpressure, reestablishing this
organization would probably not trigger military conflict and would be
consistent with the U.S. commitment to the One China policy, guided by
the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six
Assurances.

#### Status quo security cooperation is key to develop Taiwan's asymmetric capabilities

**Wong and Schmitt 22**, (Edward Wong, analysts at NYT, and Eric
Schmitt, "U.S. Speeds Up Reshaping of Taiwan's Defenses to Deter China,"
*New York Times*, 2022,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/politics/china-taiwan-military.html)>

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [has **accelerated its efforts**
to reshape Taiwan's defense systems]{.underline} as it projects a more
robust American military presence in the region [to]{.underline} try to
[deter a potential attack by the Chinese military]{.underline}, current
and former U.S. officials say. Russia's war in [Ukraine has made
American and Taiwanese officials acutely aware that an autocrat can
order an invasion of a neighboring territory at any moment. But it has
also shown how a small military can hold out against a seemingly
powerful foe]{.underline}. [U.S. officials are taking lessons learned
from arming Ukraine to work with Taiwan in molding a stronger force that
could repel a seaborne invasion by China]{.underline}, which has one of
the world's largest militaries. [The aim is to turn Taiwan
into]{.underline} what some officials call [a]{.underline}
"[porcupine]{.underline}"--- a territory bristling with armaments and
other forms of U.S.-led support that appears too painful to attack.
Taiwan has long had missiles that can hit China. But the American-made
weapons that it has recently bought --- mobile rocket platforms, F-16
fighter jets and antiship projectiles --- are better suited for
repelling an invading force. Some military analysts say Taiwan might buy
sea mines and armed drones later. And as it has in Ukraine, the U.S.
government could also supply intelligence to enhance the lethality of
the weapons, even if it refrains from sending troops. [American
officials have been quietly pressing their Taiwanese
counterparts]{.underline} to buy weapons suitable **[for asymmetric
warfare]{.underline}**, a conflict in which a smaller military uses
mobile systems to conduct lethal strikes on a much bigger force, U.S.
and Taiwanese officials say.

### U\-\--China-Focus High

#### Pivot to Asia is [high now]{.underline}. But it's [not permanent]{.underline}.

**Wilkinson 22** (Tracy Wilkinson, "Remember the 'pivot' to Asia? U.S.
wants to reassure Pacific allies it's still on," *Los Angeles Times*,
2022,
<https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-09/us-pivot-asia-reassure-pacific-allies>)

Like many U.S. governments before it, the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [intended a foreign policy "pivot" toward
China]{.underline} and Asia. [Instead, Washington quickly faced war
in]{.underline} Gaza, a chaotic pullout from Afghanistan and a possible
Russian invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}. **[On
Wednesday]{.underline}**, Secretary of State Antony J.
**[Blinken]{.underline}** **[arrived]{.underline}** in Melbourne,
Australia, [for a regional tour that will see him try to reassert U.S.
influence in the Indo-Pacific against a rising China and to reassure
allies worried that their issues are being given less priority in
Washington]{.underline}. Blinken is scheduled to meet with his
Australian, Indian and Japanese counterparts, whose nations, together
with the U.S., form the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, an
on-again, off-again group established as a counterbalance to Beijing.
Speaking to reporters traveling with him, [Blinken insisted that the
Biden administration has maintained a "sustained focus" on the region
despite]{.underline} an all-consuming and urgent mission to prevent
Russia from invading [Ukraine]{.underline}. He said he was on the phone
in consultations over Ukraine during the long flight from Washington to
Australia --- the latest of some 200 engagements in recent weeks --- and
acknowledged that video-conferences and calls between Washington and
European capitals on the crisis would continue to hum in the background
of the talks in Melbourne. "Having said that, the world is a big place,
our interests are global and [you all know very well the focus that we
have put on the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} and the Indo-Pacific region,"
Blinken said. [Blinken]{.underline} and the Quad representatives [will
tackle an "increasingly broad and deep agenda]{.underline}," he said. It
will be **[dominated by]{.underline}** what most other countries in the
region see as **[Chinese aggression on]{.underline}** land and sea, as
well as other issues such as **[emerging tech]{.underline}**nologies
that can also be threatened by Beijing. Australian Foreign Minister
Marise Payne welcomed Blinken's arrival and that of the other Quad
ministers, saying that by gathering here they were "voting with their
feet in terms of the priority that they accord to \[Indo-Pacific\]
issues." Target fine lines and wrinkles while visibly firming skin with
our anti-aging treatment for men. Kiehls first all-in-one anti-aging
moisturizer for men is specifically formulated for men\'s thicker,
coarser skin. This revitalizing anti-wrinkle\... U.S. officials tacitly
acknowledge a pep talk is in order. Blinken "will demonstrate the
strength and the credibility of America's commitment to the Indo-Pacific
region," Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of State for East
Asia and Pacific affairs, said ahead of the trip. "We intend to
demonstrate that our partnerships deliver, and they deliver practical
and real benefits to our own peoples and to the peoples of the region."
Some in Asia expected greater interaction with President Biden, who
campaigned on a shift to "strategic competition" with China as a pillar
of his foreign policy. During Biden's eight years as vice president, the
Obama administration had also promised a "pivot" to Asia as its
diplomatic focus. Instead, as crises erupted around the world, full-on
engagement was delayed. In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping,
who has converted himself into leader for life, continued to claim
Beijing's sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea;
pushed its massive "Belt and Road" program, which spends billions of
dollars in development money to gain influence in Europe, Africa and
Latin America; and ignored international criticism of its treatment of
the Muslim Uyghur minority, which the U.S. has called a genocide. This
week, China again took the global center stage by hosting the Winter
Olympics. The U.S. and several Western countries refused to send
government delegations, but Russian President Vladimir Putin attended,
striking a masterfully symbolic pose with Xi as the leaders of a new
post-democratic alignment. The two men issued statements lavishing
support on one another. "A much more powerful and assertive Xi
government increasingly sees U.S. geopolitical strategy and activities
in Asia through a very similar lens as \[the one through which\] Putin
has long viewed American activities in Europe," Ian Bremmer, president
of the Eurasia Group, said in an analysis of Blinken's tour. "To China,
the Quad feels a lot like NATO encroachment does to Putin." [One
potential flashpoint is China's claim on Taiwan]{.underline}, which
Beijing considers a breakaway republic much as Putin views post-Soviet
Ukraine. Despite its stated focus on the region, the [Biden
administration still seems to **be seeking its footing** in Asia
policy]{.underline}, said Michael Green, an Asia expert at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [receives credit for designating
China as a strategic competitor]{.underline}, Green said, although it
did not follow through with policy. **[Biden "has picked up and
amplified" that decision]{.underline}**, "but has essentially no
economic strategy for Asia."

#### Biden is right-sizing the force posture now to prioritize [finite resources]{.underline} on the China threat

**Wasser and Joyce 21** (Becca Wasser, Fellow for the Defense Program

Posture Puzzle," *CNAS*, 2021,
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/all-about-access-solving-americas-force-posture-puzzle)>

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [has promised to revise US global
force posture]{.underline} and alter the vast constellation of overseas
forces, bases, and capabilities that underpin America's ability to deter
adversaries, counter threats, and protect allies. [It has signaled an
intent to]{.underline} reduce US presence in the Middle East to make it
more commensurate with the region's relative strategic importance (i.e.,
"rightsize" forces) and **[bolster its posture in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**, much like previous administrations
attempted to do. To this end, the administration has a Global Force
Posture Review underway and has already drawn down US combat forces in
Afghanistan, effectively ending the almost 20-year US presence in the
country. [This impulse to remake the US global footprint reflects a
desire to address a new era of strategic competition with
China]{.underline} **[and to expend finite resources]{.underline}** and
taxpayer dollars more **[efficiently]{.underline}**. It is not the first
push to revise US force posture. The Trump administration also attempted
to make changes, including controversial plans to draw down forces in
South Korea and Germany, while simultaneously seeking to stand up a new
base and enhance US troop numbers in Poland. Such moves were, in theory,
intended to correct US global posture to be more in line with the
Department of Defense's refocus on preparing for a future conflict with
China and Russia.

Blinken's speech repays close study. About one-tenth of it was
conciliatory. "We are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War," he
declared. "We do not seek to transform China's political system. ... We
will engage constructively with China wherever we can." But the rest was
as hawkish a speech on China as the one delivered by then Vice President
Mike Pence in October 2018, which for me was the moment Cold War II got
going in earnest. In Blinken's words: Under President Xi, the ruling
Chinese Communist Party has become more repressive at home and more
aggressive abroad. We see that in how Beijing has perfected mass
surveillance within China and exported that technology to more than 80
countries; how its advancing unlawful maritime claims in the South China
Sea, undermining peace and security, freedom of navigation, and
commerce; how it's circumventing or breaking trade rules ... and how it
purports to champion sovereignty and territorial integrity while
standing with governments that brazenly violate them. [Blinken spelled
out how the US intends to "shape the strategic environment around
Beijing]{.underline}," citing the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework
for Prosperity, announced by Biden on his recent Asia tour, and [the
Quad]{.underline} of the US, Australia, India and Japan, with [its new
Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness]{.underline},
[not forgetting AUKUS]{.underline}, the US deal on nuclear submarines
with Australia and the UK. But the most startling lines in Blinken's
speech were the ones on "the genocide and crimes against humanity
happening in the Xinjiang region"; on US support for "Tibet, where the
authorities continue to wage a brutal campaign against Tibetans and
their culture, language, and religious traditions"; on Hong Kong, "where
the Chinese Communist Party has imposed harsh anti-democratic measures
under the guise of national security"; on "Beijing's aggressive and
unlawful activities in the South and East China Seas"; and --- the coup
de grace from a Chinese vantage point --- on "Beijing's growing
coercion" and "increasingly provocative rhetoric and activity" toward
Taiwan. The response of the Chinese Foreign Ministry to this
confrontational speech was, I thought, surprisingly restrained.
**[Taiwan is, of course, the key issue]{.underline}**. As if to confirm
Xi Jinping's darkest suspicions, Biden went off script again at a press
conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on May
23. A reporter asked if the United States would defend Taiwan in the
event of a Chinese attack. "Yes," the president answered. "That's the
commitment we made. We agree with a one-China policy. We\'ve signed on
to it and all the intended agreements made from there. But the idea
that, that it (Taiwan) can be taken by force, just taken by force, is
just not, is just not appropriate."

Enterprise Institute and a former staff member on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, "Biden Must Do Better Than Obama on Ukraine,"
Foreign Policy, 2022,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/27/biden-obama-russia-ukraine-military-strategy-nato/>)

The Winter Olympics are just around the corner. Russian President
Vladimir Putin has Ukraine on his mind. In Washington, the [Pentagon is
preparing a new defense strategy]{.underline} that looks beyond the
Middle East [to focus on the Pacific and China. The White House,
meanwhile, is concerned about costs and wants to rein in military
spending]{.underline}. Sound familiar? Well, this is exactly what the
world looked like once before---in 2014. When the Obama administration's
defense strategy was released in March 2014, the document was obsolete
the day it was published. It did not mention Ukraine, even though
Putin's little green men had already seized Crimea. It did not mention
the Islamic State by name, though the group's fighters had already
captured Fallujah. With the defense budget under spending caps and the
threat of sequestration, the Pentagon had to spend tens of billions of
dollars in contingency funds to rebuild European deterrence following
Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine and to defeat the Islamic
State in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the Obama administration's attempt
to pivot to Asia stalled, and the U.S. military edge over China
continued to shrink. As history threatens to repeat itself, U.S.
President Joe Biden---who served under Barack Obama as vice
president---looks perilously close to following in his predecessor's
footsteps. [Biden faces the same question as in 2014: How can the United
States stay focused on China while dealing with]{.underline} the crisis
in [Ukraine]{.underline}? Just as it was then, prioritizing the
Indo-Pacific and countering China will not be strategically effective or
politically sustainable if it is premised on sacrificing the commitment
to credible NATO deterrence and defense. But [given **finite
resources**, the United States **cannot** confront China, the most
powerful adversary it has ever faced, without **substantially changing**
how it achieves strategic ends in
Europe]{.underline}---[especially]{.underline} when it comes to
**[military power]{.underline}**. That's not just an urgent strategic
question to answer now, as Washington decides how to deal with Russia's
threatened invasion of Ukraine. It also needs to be at the core of the
Pentagon's strategy that is set to be published as early as March.
**[The administration must resist calls]{.underline}** for a return to a
strategy designed **[to win on two fronts simultaneously]{.underline}**
or in sequence. [**Right now**, the United States can do a lot to
support Ukraine]{.underline}, impose costs on Russia,
**[and]{.underline}** [assure NATO allies without compromising its
strategy to counter China]{.underline}. At the top of the list are
accelerated deliveries of defensive military equipment to
Ukraine---especially anti-armor, anti-ship, and air defense
capabilities---as well as intelligence support and humanitarian
assistance. If Russia does invade, Biden should get much more serious
about sanctions than Obama was in 2014. Washington should target the
wealth of Putin's cronies in Western financial hubs, terminate Russian
access to the SWIFT global payment system, prohibit transactions in
Russian sovereign debt, sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and cut off
access to U.S. technology critical for industries favored by Putin,
including defense. The Trump administration's technology sanctions that
have seriously hobbled the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei are
an excellent precedent for this. The United States should also join NATO
efforts to reinforce its eastern flank, including contributing U.S.
troops to support the temporary activation and deployment of NATO's
Response Force. For this eventuality, the Biden administration has
placed up to 8,500 U.S. military personnel on alert.
**[But]{.underline}** even as Washington reacts to Moscow's threats to
overturn the European security order, **[China]{.underline}** and the
Indo-Pacific **[must remain the primary focus of the United States'
strategic calculus]{.underline}**. To that end, the administration
should ensure sanctions do not inflict collateral damage on Indo-Pacific
allies and partners. In particular, ensnaring India in Russia-focused
sanctions for New Delhi's planned purchase of the Russian S-400 air and
missile defense system would be a mistake. Sanctions won't stop the
S-400 deal, but they would play into the narrative pushed by Moscow and
Beijing that Washington is not a trustworthy partner for New Delhi. [To
keep its focus squarely on the Indo-Pacific, the United States must
exercise **restraint** in what]{.underline} forces **[it sends
to]{.underline}** reinforce **[NATO]{.underline}** should Putin invade
Ukraine, and from where. Forces should not be taken from the Pacific.
They should be relocated within Europe, from the United States, or from
lower-priority theaters. For example, air and ground forces stationed in
the Middle East could be moved to southeastern Europe to bolster NATO
while remaining close enough to respond to any contingency. Deployment
of an additional U.S. Army brigade combat team---of limited utility
vis-à-vis China---may be sensible. But the Pentagon should avoid new,
long-term deployments of assets in low supply, such as missile defense
systems and advanced platforms for intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. The Biden administration should also remember that
allies provide the bricks, while the United States provides the mortar.
[NATO allies should contribute the bulk of any new forces]{.underline}
deployed to guard the alliance's eastern flank while the United States
provides key military enablers such as command and control, logistics,
and combat medicine. The good news is that allies are in fact stepping
up: Denmark, France, Spain, and the Netherlands have all recently
announced or proposed reinforcements of ships, fighter aircraft, and
ground forces. Even as it responds to the crisis in Europe, Washington
can take parallel steps to bolster deterrence in the Pacific---so that
the current attention on Europe is not interpreted as a sign of weakness
and distraction, as it was in 2014. For example, the Biden
administration could announce plans to station a fifth and eventual
sixth attack submarine in Guam. It could also back legislation on
Capitol Hill to increase security assistance to Taiwan. Taking these
steps during a crisis in Europe would send a powerful signal to Beijing
and allied capitals that the United States' priority on the Pacific
perseveres. The **[Biden]{.underline}**
administration**['s]{.underline}** new defense [strategy needs to
confront the question of overstretch head-on. Given **limited
resources** and the strength of the United States'
adversaries---**especially China**---the U.S. ability to prevail in a
great-power conflict cannot be taken for granted]{.underline}. [That's
why the administration must resist calls for a return to a strategy
designed to win on two fronts simultaneously]{.underline} or in
sequence. [Such a force sizing is simply not realistic and **would
dilute the U.S. military's focus on the Indo-Pacific as its priority
theater**, China as its pacing threat, and Taiwan as **its pressing
scenario**]{.underline}. Critically, [staying on track in the Pacific
requires matching any new military commitments in
Europe]{.underline}---even temporary ones---[with new
resources]{.underline}. [The United States **must not ask its military
to do more with less** or pretend that China]{.underline} and Russia
[can be deterred]{.underline} and confronted [on the cheap]{.underline}.
Now is not the time to cut defense spending as the Biden administration
has proposed. Not when the U.S. military edge relative to China has so
dangerously eroded. Not when inflation, aging platforms, rising
personnel costs, and the failure to pass a budget on time are sapping
the Pentagon's buying power. The Biden administration and the U.S.
Congress must provide the military with the sufficient, timely, and
predictable funding demanded in these perilous times, and which U.S.
service members deserve.

#### Biden is [shifting from Ukraine]{.underline} to focus resources on China now

The past couple of months marked a rallying moment for the geopolitical
West. [The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a sweeping, united
response from Europe and its allies across the Atlantic]{.underline}. It
led to far-reaching, coordinated sanctions on Moscow. [It provoked a
new, steely approach from many Europeans to diplomatically and
militarily confront Russia. And it spurred the imminent expansion of
NATO]{.underline}, an alliance cast by critics not long ago as an
obsolete relic of the Cold War. [The United States and its E.U. partners
are flooding Ukraine with weaponry and aid]{.underline}. By some
accounts, the Biden administration alone has mustered more funding for
Ukraine in recent weeks than it is committing in the next fiscal year
for fighting the planetary peril of climate change. [Yet]{.underline} in
Washington, **[there remains a large elephant in the room:
China.]{.underline}** New battles with the Kremlin have energized the
doyens of the city's foreign policy establishment, many of whom cut
their teeth during the Cold War. But the [Biden]{.underline}
administration is trying to show that it **[hasn't lost sight of its key
21st century "strategic competitor."]{.underline}** And it recognizes
that its contest with China requires closer partnerships well outside
Europe. **[A new push started this week]{.underline}**. On Thursday
evening, the White House hosted a dinner with eight leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a part of a major
U.S.-led summit with the regional bloc. On Friday, the Southeast Asian
delegations are slated to continue discussions at the State Department
before a plenary session with President Biden. Next week, [Biden will
embark on a five-day trip to South Korea and Japan, culminating in
another meeting of the "Quad" grouping with Australia, Japan and
India]{.underline}. U.S. officials recognize that a decade of talk about
a strategic "pivot" to Asia has yet to yield concrete results. "Several
administrations in succession in the United States have tried ... to
launch more fundamental efforts, policies, frameworks in Asia, East
Asia, Indo-Pacific, and found themselves stymied or misdirected or
directed toward other pursuits," said Kurt Campbell, the White House's
lead official on Indo-Pacific policy, in a speech this week at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "And that
has been something that I think all of us are deeply aware of in the
formulation and execution of policy."

The [Biden]{.underline} administration aims to show that its heavy
[involvement in]{.underline} the **[Ukraine]{.underline}** war **[is not
a distraction from its priorities to the East]{.underline}**. But it is
climbing an uphill road with ASEAN countries, where many officials
lament a lack of American engagement, especially during the years of the
Trump administration.

It is easy to get wrapped up in the rhetorical shifts and policy
particulars of the moment, but the United States has consistently
approached NATO through a combination of opportunism and geopolitics.
Since the alliance's creation in the late 1940s, the United States has
attempted to strike a balance between its own contradictory impulses.
Going forward, the question is whether this balance is sustainable in
practice, if not in declared intent, given the emerging shape of
international politics. [It is not defeatist to be skeptical. Alliance
commitments tend to change when new threats appear and strategic
priorities shift. As **America's attention moves toward Asia**, its
longstanding attitudes toward European **security should be reevaluated
and accorded lower strategic priority**]{.underline}. [Western Europe,
and much of Eastern Europe, are secure. No European hegemon is on the
horizon. A balance of power exists and ought to be allowed to
mature]{.underline}. This is good news. America's postwar commitment to
European security went on far longer and became far more expansive than
policymakers envisioned in the 1940s and 1950s. Now [the mission is
accomplished]{.underline}. Western Europe, and much of Eastern Europe,
are secure. No European hegemon is on the horizon. A balance of power
exists and ought to be allowed to mature. [Seventy-two years after
NATO's founding, **America's role in the alliance can change
fundamentally** with **little risk to U.S. or European security** ---
and much to gain for both]{.underline}.

#### US-NATO AI interoperability requires a [significant increase]{.underline} in funding

**Christie 22** (Edward Hunter Christie, senior research fellow @
Finnish Institute of International Affairs, "Defence cooperation in
artificial intelligence: Bridging the transatlantic gap for a stronger
Europe," *European View*, 2022, 2.1)

[Much has already been achieved in terms of new structures, new
initiatives and new policy developments to support the collaborative
adoption of AI among NATO Allies]{.underline} and EU member states. In
addition to pre-existing structures and mechanisms at both the NATO and
EU levels, which have ensured that nations are not starting from
scratch, national defence institutions are already able to refer to
common policy commitments and to options, whether through NATO or the
EDA, for research or capability-development activities. [At the same
time, ensuring a competitive edge in AI is a truly whole-of-government
effort which requires considerable cross-over between the military and
civilian realms]{.underline}. [Large gaps remain]{.underline} between
the US and the EU on certain key indicators. At the same time, the gaps
pertaining to research are far smaller. To ensure greater European
performance and relevance in AI in general, and its defence applications
in particular, [it seems desirable to focus on]{.underline} two
strategic priorities: **[investment volumes]{.underline}**, both public
and private, **[which need to be significantly increased]{.underline}**;
[and]{.underline} the full use of [collaborative mechanisms involving
the US]{.underline}. To that end, it would be beneficial [for nations on
both sides of the Atlantic to ensure that a clear and common vision is
set out]{.underline} in forthcoming strategic documents, most notably
the EU's Strategic Compass and NATO's new Strategic Concept. **[This
should include clear]{.underline}** political **[commitments to
increasing investment, both in general and in instruments for promoting
collaborative innovation]{.underline}**. There are opportunities for
'more Europe' through the EDA and the European Defence Fund. But while
pursuing those avenues, European capitals should prioritise efforts that
complement and enhance transatlantic approaches, [in recognition of the
reality that the US remains the indispensable ally]{.underline} for
Europe's security.

#### AI interoperability requires [serious investment]{.underline} from both sides of the Atlantic

**Christie 22** (Edward Hunter Christie, senior research fellow @
Finnish Institute of International Affairs, "Defence cooperation in
artificial intelligence: Bridging the transatlantic gap for a stronger
Europe," *European View*, 2022, 2.1)

Artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) is the ability of
machines to perform tasks that typically require human
intelligence---for example, recognising patterns, learning from
experience, drawing conclusions, making predictions or taking
action---whether digitally or as the smart software behind autonomous
physical systems (Reding and Eaton 2020, 14). [The range of potential
military applications is]{.underline} at least as **[vast]{.underline}**
as the range of tasks that require human cognition, for example
analysing and classifying visual data, organising logistics, operating
support vehicles, or tracking and engaging hostile targets (Christie
2021b, 84). [States are racing to achieve superiority in the AI
domain]{.underline} (Lin-Greenberg 2020). Furthermore, like other
digital technologies, AI diffuses rapidly and cheaply across areas of
human activity and across borders. Nevertheless, as with other
technological transformations, states with greater resources and levels
of effort, and better policies, will reap the benefits of technology
adoption more rapidly than others. [In an alliance context, matters
pertaining to cooperation and interoperability take centre
stage]{.underline}. The good news is that Europeans are not starting
from scratch. European states that are members of NATO can rely on
decades of experience with the Alliance's mechanisms of consultation and
collaboration. In addition, European states that are members of the EU
can pursue collaborative activities through the European Defence Agency
(EDA). Furthermore, EU funding is available through the European Defence
Fund for defence research and capability-development activities. At NATO
the key processes address, most notably, the areas of defence research,
military transformation, capability development, military--technical
standardisation, and defence planning and capability targets. For these
areas of work, formal consultative mechanisms---committees in which each
Ally has a voice---include the Science and Technology Board, the
Military Committee, the Conference of National Armaments Directors, the
NATO Standardisation Board, and the Defence Policy and Planning
Committee. Each of these committees relies on support staffs and
structures. Of particular interest when considering AI are the Science
and Technology Organisation, which has several facilities and is led by
the Office of the Chief Scientist at NATO Headquarters; and, Allied
Command Transformation. The latter, including its Innovation Hub, plays
a particularly central role in driving innovation and force
transformation for the Alliance. In addition, two staff units created in
2019 are of particular importance, namely the Innovation Unit and the
Data Policy Unit, both of which are within the Emerging Security
Challenges Division of the NATO International Staff. The Innovation Unit
provides thought leadership and initiatives to accelerate technology
adoption, while the Data Policy Unit provides policy thought leadership
on how to treat data as a strategic resource. The Innovation Unit
designs new initiatives for the promotion and financing of
defencerelated innovation. A notable achievement in this area was the
creation of the NATO Innovation Fund (NATO 2021). In the EU context, the
EDA plays a central role in several areas of work. Among other
activities, the EDA supports defence research cooperation, defence
standardisation and pooled procurement programmes, while also
contributing to the EU's Capability Development Plan and Coordinated
Annual Review on Defence (Fiott 2018, 287). Most of the EDA's functions
are broadly analogous to ones that exist at NATO. Of particular interest
is the intention to create a new Defence Innovation Hub within the EDA,
as announced in the EU's November 2021 draft Strategic Compass (European
External Action Service 2021, 23). Before proceeding, it is worth
spelling out the extent to which European security is dependent on NATO
and in particular on the US. Of the EU's 27 member states, 21 are
members of NATO. These countries account for about 93% of the
population1 of the EU. Within NATO, those Allies that are also EU
members only account for about 20% of total defence expenditure across
the Alliance, while the US alone accounts for about 70% of the same
total.2 Beyond these aggregate indicators, it is furthermore the case
that the US is considerably ahead of the EU in terms of practical
adoption of AI. For illustration, in 2020 US private-sector investment
in AI was around \$23.6 billion, but was only \$2 billion in the EU,
implying a ratio of 12 to 1 in favour of the US (Zhang et al. 2021, 96).
Scientific output indicators offer a more nuanced picture. In 2019, the
EU accounted for 16.4% of the world's peer-reviewed AI publications,
ahead of the US with 14.6%, while China occupied the top spot with 22.4%
(Zhang et al. 2021, 20). On the other hand, if one measures research
output in terms of publications on the Arxiv database, the US is ahead
of the EU (Zhang et al. 2021, 33) by a ratio of almost two to one, which
is nonetheless much less than the large gap in private investment
mentioned above. That the EU performs similarly to the US in terms of
scientific research, but far less well in terms of investment and
commercialisation of new digital technologies, is an old problem which
has proven very difficult to address, whether at national or EU level
(Baroudy et al. 2020). In the following sections, I offer reflections on
three challenge areas for European and Allied defence institutions:
interoperability challenges, international security challenges and
investment challenges. These three challenges are effectively
interdependent. [While]{.underline} [interoperability is a permanent
goal in an alliance context, be it NATO or the EU, it is particularly
salient in cases of rapid technological change, such as with AI, as
there is a need for a higher tempo across areas of
activity]{.underline}. Heightened international security challenges
likewise increase the need for urgency to ensure that Western nations do
not fall behind potential adversaries. **[Investment]{.underline}**, in
turn, **[is the engine for rapid change]{.underline}**, enabling the
dynamic adoption of new technologies, relevant capability-development
activities and other adaptations along the value chain of military
activities. Overall, my central argument is that [the confluence of
rapid technological change and heightened international security
challenges requires a higher pace of change and adaptation that can only
succeed **if serious investments** are made on both sides of the
Atlantic]{.underline}.

[At United States Cyber Command]{.underline}, which has [expanded
rapidly]{.underline} since the United States carried out cyberattacks
against Iran in 2010, Russia's networks are a regular target of
surveillance. By next year, Cyber Command will have more than 130 teams
fully in operation around the world, integrated into Army, Navy, Marine
and Air Force units, in addition to teams that work alongside the
National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md. It has built up a vast early
warning network, placing tens of thousands of "implants" --- sensors
that can also be used to insert malware --- into networks around the
world. [But NATO is **only beginning** to explore what it delicately
calls "active defense,"]{.underline} and says it is not focused on
offensive cyberweapons. [The Russians have no such
compunctions]{.underline}. But it is unclear what Russian hackers hope
to achieve here in the Baltics, other than to make the point, as they
did in 2007 when they brought Estonia to an electronic halt, that they
can get into any system, anytime. "Whatever the Russians have in mind
--- mostly intimidation --- it usually fails," said Estonia's president,
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who grew up in New Jersey before coming here to
turn this small NATO country into a pioneer in introducing new web-based
technology for governing a nation. The 2007 attacks backfired, he noted,
because they drove Estonians far more solidly into the European and NATO
camps. In Sweden and Finland, neutral nations in the Cold War, the
politics are more complex. As the NATO exercise began in Finland last
week, the Finnish foreign minister was in Moscow, meeting his Russian
counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. The more Sweden and Finland turn to NATO,
the more their networks, their news sites and their government
ministries come under cyberattack. As Adm. John Richardson, the chief of
United States naval operations, said at an event at the Council on
Foreign Relations in May, "[The fact is it's a pretty hot war in the
cyber domain going on right now." A hot war, but a kind that suits
Russia well: It is part of what military strategists call "gray zone"
combat.]{.underline} [For]{.underline} Mr. [Putin]{.underline},
[cyberespionage and cyberattacks keep NATO and its partners off
balance]{.underline}. **[They are enormously difficult and expensive to
defend against]{.underline}**, and, at least for now, they have operated
below the line that is likely to prompt a military or economic response.
"It stays below the radar," Martin Libicki of the RAND Corporation told
a conference sponsored this month by the NATO cyber center here,
officially known as the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence. For the Russians, Mr. Libicki said, cyberespionage and
weaponry are part of a larger strategy of information warfare and a
blitz of propaganda that makes sorting out fact from fiction --- say,
the causes of the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine --- all the more
difficult. But the attacks also remind the smaller nations here of their
vulnerability, even if Russia's troops stay on their side of the border.
[So far, NATO has found few effective means of deterring
attacks]{.underline}.

simply chose to not include the requirements at all. Militaries around
the world are now exploiting these vulnerabilities in weapons systems to
carry out operations. When Israel in 2007 bombed a Syrian nuclear
reactor, the raid was preceded by what is believed to have been a cyber
attack on Syrian air defenses that resulted in radar screens showing no
threat as bombers zoomed overhead. In 2018, a 29-country NATO exercise,

GPS jamming. [NATO does try to test cyberweapons outside]{.underline}

systems that make armies run. It's not (solely) that bases will get
blown up; it's that some bases will lose power, data, and
communications. It's not that self-driving trucks will suddenly go mad
and begin rolling over friendly soldiers; it's that they'll casually
roll off roads or into water where they sit, rusting, and in need of
repair. It's not that targeting systems on guns will be retargeted to
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; it's that many of them could simply turn off
and not turn back on again. **[So, how do we prepare]{.underline}** for
this next war**[?]{.underline}** First, militaries need to introduce a
little anarchy into their planning. Let's have wargames where essential
systems malfunction or are subverted---not all of the time, but
randomly. To help combat siloed military thinking, include some
civilians as well. Allow their ideas into the room when predicting
potential enemy action. And militaries need to have well-developed
backup plans, for when systems are subverted. In Joe Haldeman's 1975
science-fiction novel The Forever War, he postulated a "stasis field"
that forced his space marines to rely on nothing more than Roman
military technologies, like javelins. We should be thinking in the same
direction. NATO isn't yet allowing civilians not employed by NATO or
associated military contractors access to their training cyber ranges
where vulnerabilities could be discovered and remediated before
battlefield deployment. Last year, one of us (Tarah) was listening to a
NATO briefing after the end of the 2020 Cyber Coalition exercises, and
asked how she and other information security researchers could volunteer
to test cyber ranges used to train its cyber incident response force.
She was told that including civilians would be a "welcome thought
experiment in the tabletop exercises," but including them in reality
wasn't considered. There is a rich opportunity for improvement here,
providing transparency into where improvements could be made. Second,
[it's time to take cybersecurity seriously in military procurement, from
weapons systems to logistics and communications contracts]{.underline}.
In the three year span from the original 2018 GAO report to this year's
report, cybersecurity audit compliance went from 0% to 40% (those 2 of 5
programs mentioned earlier). We need to get much better. DOD requires
that its contractors and suppliers follow the Cybersecurity Maturity
Model Certification process; it should abide by the same standards.
Making those standards both more rigorous and mandatory would be an
obvious second step. Gone are the days when we can pretend that our
technologies will work in the face of a military cyberattack. [Securing
our systems will make **everything we buy more expensive**---**maybe a
lot more expensive**]{.underline}. But the alternative is no longer
viable.

#### Normal means is not an overall budget increase

Rep. Seth Moulton: And part of the criteria is going to have to be cost.
That's just the budgetary environment that we're facing. [It's very easy
to sit in Congress and say, "I'm always going to spend more on national
security]{.underline}, I'm always going to couch it in terms of
supporting our troops or whatever. **[But the reality is,
we]{.underline}**, like every country in the world **[have finite
resources]{.underline}**. [And what's most important is that we make the
tough decisions to spend those resources as wisely as we
can]{.underline} to support our troops and to support our national
security, [that's]{.underline} [going to be tough]{.underline}.

### Link\-\--AT Cheap

#### Even if the plan [seems]{.underline} cheap, it will [outpace]{.underline} cost projections because of military squandering of resources

**Munson 13** (Peter Munson, senior vice president for preventive
services and global crisis management for a private sector corporation
and a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer, "The Limits of Security
Cooperation," *War on the Rocks*, 2013,
<https://warontherocks.com/2013/09/the-limits-of-security-cooperation/)>

SC does work to build capacity in certain, relatively elite units that
perceive a real need for improvement and hard training. Likewise, it
works to build interoperability between already-capable partner forces
and U.S. and coalition militaries. SC in the right doses can be a good
way of showing solidarity with allies against other regional threats.
But [SC \[Security Cooperation\] is not a panacea and must be applied
with significantly more discernment than the usual
some-is-good-more-is-better logic of U.S. military
spending]{.underline}. Planners should go to great lengths to ensure
that SC is seen as a tool for a specific purpose, not a reward to
condition behaviors. SC-as-a-conditioning-tool becomes bribery with
diminishing returns. If policymakers want a quid pro quo, they need to
admit as much and use much more precisely targeted incentives: paying a
fee for access or head-of-the-line transit privileges for example. This
becomes a much more predictable business transaction than trying to use
SC funds, winks, and nudges to get one's way. Finally, [in the land of
perverse incentives, SC is often seen as a means to drive defense
business to U.S. contractors. This is true. By creating arms
races]{.underline} and supplying prestige weapons, however useless, to
unstable areas of the world, [they are creating U.S. jobs. But wouldn't
taxpayer money and efforts be better spent if officials more precisely
targeted]{.underline} domestic [concerns]{.underline} with taxpayer
funds [rather than hoping that efforts trickle down
predictably]{.underline} from collaboration with corpulent and unsavory
foreign generals? [In the land of perverse incentives, SC **funding is
one of the most egregious**]{.underline}---and in the post-9/11 era,
many officials see SC as a critical tool of strategic positioning.
However, [the premises of SC must be reconsidered before the U.S.
**military squanders** more resources on white elephant
projects]{.underline}.

#### Every SC initiative generates financial op-costs

**Gold 21**, researcher at CNA (Zack, "A Better Way to Measure Returns
on U.S. Security Cooperation Investments," *Defense One News*,
<https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/06/better-way-measure-returns-us-security-cooperation-investments/174742/)>

Second, [even if the returns were quantifiable, the real costs of
security cooperation for the U.S. military are often
unmeasurable]{.underline}. For example, past analysis indicates that
[the structure of]{.underline} the Navy's cost [accounting]{.underline}
system [makes it impossible to know the full, exact cost of any security
cooperation deployment or activity]{.underline}. Additionally, [there is
**opportunity cost in every decision about security
cooperation**]{.underline}. In Washington, the focus in recent years has
been on [realigning resources for great power competition]{.underline}.
However, each geographic combatant command has dozens of partners. How,
for example, can one accurately calculate the real and opportunity costs
of conducting a bilateral exercise with Brazil as opposed to Colombia;
or even with the UAE navy versus the UAE armed forces?

#### Security Cooperation drains finite resources needed for other programs

[A corollary to the problem of contractor-led assistance is the problem
of "supply-side assistance." This occurs when organizations involved in
institutional capacity-building]{.underline} (ICB) [in the U.S. "market"
their services to partner nations, rather than assistance being
contingent upon a demand signal]{.underline} from the partner nation,
validated by the Security Cooperation Organization (SCO) in the U.S.
Embassy. Most partner nations, unwilling to appear ungrateful, will
gladly accept whatever assistance is offered, even if it doesn't address
an important national interest and even if the partner nation lacks the
ability to absorb and sustain it. While such "marketing" allows
ICB-providers to claim relevance and secure [funding]{.underline},
[for]{.underline} the \[[Security Cooperation]{.underline} Organization
\] SCO, it [**represents a drain on**]{.underline} its **[finite
resources without]{.underline}** the **[payoff of achieving important
U.S. or partner nation interests]{.underline}**.

## Internal Link

### IL\-\--Resources Zero-sum 

#### Washington has internalized a zero-sum relationship between Europe and Asia. They will trade-off resources, even if it's not legally required.

**Simon, Desmaele and Becker 21** (Luise Simon, head of international
security at the Institute for European Studies (Vrije Universiteit
Brussel) and director of the Brussels office of the Elcano Royal
Institute. Linde Desmaele, doctoral fellow at the Institute for European
Studies at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Jordan Becker, currently the
US liaison to the French Joint Staff. He was previously a senior
transatlantic fellow at the Institute for European Studies, "Europe as a
Secondary Theater? Competition with China and the Future of America's
European Strategy," *Strategic Studies Quarterly*, 2021,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-15_Issue-1/Simon.pdf)>

First, [to]{.underline} influence and [maintain]{.underline} a favorable
balance of [power in Europe]{.underline}, [Washington has traditionally
relied on]{.underline} a strategy of forward [military]{.underline}
presence coupled with economic and diplomatic [engagement]{.underline}.
[But US resources are limited, and increasing demand for them in Asia
raises new questions about whether Washington can preserve
a]{.underline} favorable [European regional balance]{.underline} at a
lower cost than in the past. In this context, Washington must consider
how much influence it is willing to cede to European actors, including
Germany, Russia, Britain, France and the European Union (EU). Second, as
Europe becomes a secondary theater in US grand strategy, Washington is
compelled to ensure that Europe's key powers and institutions support US
interests when it comes to competition with Beijing, or at least that
they do not undermine US efforts in this regard. In reframing its
relationship with Europe, the US is paying increasing attention to
Europe's positions toward China and Asia. Washington recently warned
Europeans, for example, about China's efforts to leverage investments
and trade to gain technological and related strategic advantages
relative to the United States.9 China-related considerations are also
likely to gain relevance in the context of America's calculations
vis-à-vis Russia, a country that can play a direct---if
limited---strategic role in China's immediate periphery: Central Asia,
Northeast Asia, and the Western Pacific. For now, the US continues to
look at Russia (primarily) through a European lens and worries about
Moscow's potential to threaten US regional interests and upset the
European balance. However, as competition with China becomes the focus
of US grand strategy, Washington may increasingly consider how Russia
can affect that competition---whether through its relationship with
China, its ability to strain the European balance of power, or its
propensity to create challenges elsewhere in the world. [While it is
certainly conceivable that the United States could retain such
overwhelming advantages vis-à-vis all its peer competitors, or that
China's rise could organically slow or reverse]{.underline}, **[the US
does not seem to be betting on either scenario]{.underline}**.10 [The
centrality of China in US grand strategy appears to be structural,
driven by the broader eastward shift in the distribution of]{.underline}
global economic [power]{.underline}. It is therefore unsurprising that
[as the United States becomes increasingly preoccupied with China's
rise, it **adjusts strategy in other regions accordingly**]{.underline}.
The fact that Washington has labelled China as a "global" competitor
makes it difficult to isolate SinoAmerican competition in Asia and the
broader Indo-Pacific area from what happens in other theaters,
particularly Europe.

#### The plan requires a [forced choice]{.underline} to sacrifice resources and focus needed to defend Taiwan

**Colby 22** (Eldridge Colby, co-founder and principal of The Marathon
Initiative, a policy initiative focused on developing strategies to
prepare the United States for an era of sustained great power
competition, "The U.S. Must Support Ukraine, But China Must Be Our
Priority," *TIME Magazine*, 2022,
<https://time.com/6152096/us-support-ukraine-china-priority/>)

[How should America respond to]{.underline} Russia's abominable invasion
of [Ukraine]{.underline}? This is a question of immense importance.
Right now, there is more heat than light in the discussion. Given the
momentous stakes, Americans must respond to this crisis [with clarity of
mind and sobriety]{.underline}. Moscow's invasion is likely to be a
hinge point in history. If nothing else, it lays to rest the idea that
history is over, that power politics and the threat of war are gone from
the developed areas of the world. This is sad, but it is a reality. In
developing our response to Russia's brazen act, we must face and adapt
to this reality. For too long, we have discounted the hard facts of
international politics. But now America must look at the world situation
much more soberly and strategically, proceeding from these hard facts
rather than ignoring them or wishing them away. Above all, [our response
must be strategic---it must match our response to the threats we face in
light of our resources and the risks we are willing to take
on]{.underline}. [The reality is that we face multiple serious threats
in different parts of the world]{.underline}. The danger Russia poses,
including to our NATO allies, is now very clear. But others have not
gone away. We also must consider Iran, North Korea, transnational
terrorists like al Qaeda, and, above all, the threat of a China that
seeks first hegemony over Asia and then global preeminence. So far this
is familiar. Less familiar but [absolutely critical is the fact that we
do not have a military large or capable enough to fight major wars
against Russia and China in even roughly concurrent
timelines]{.underline}. It is true that Europe is mainly a land theater
and the Western Pacific is mainly a maritime one. But many of the things
our [forces]{.underline} would need [to defeat Russia or China are
needed in both theaters]{.underline}---like heavy penetrating bombers,
attack submarines, advanced munitions, air defenses, and survivable
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. Even
certain assets once thought most appropriate or necessary for Europe may
well play a critical role in a fight against China, such as Army
long-range missiles and artillery. These and other capabilities like
them would be just as vital for beating back a Russian assault as they
would be for denying a Chinese fait accompli against Taiwan---and are
already in short supply. Unfortunately, this is not a problem that we
can solve easily, quickly, or cheaply. We should seek to redress it,
but, even if we muster the will, it will take years and a significantly
larger defense budget to build more of the things we need to fight a
major war, like penetrating heavy bombers and nuclear-powered attack
submarines. In the meantime, **[what we do have can only be used in one
place at a time]{.underline}**. A missile used in Europe can't be used
in Asia, and a bomber lost over Europe will take years to be replaced.
We do also have an unparalleled network of allies. But a similar problem
confronts us here. In theory our alliance network is far stronger than
the threats we face. But in reality few of our allies have significant
militaries, and it will take those that don't significant time to
develop their armed forces even if they gather the resolve. Over the
long term, then, our strategy should be clear. We should reshape our
military to field far more of the kinds of systems needed to fight a
great power war and, with a few exceptions like sustaining our ongoing
counterterrorism efforts, dispense with those elements that are
ill-suited for it. Meantime, we should press and encourage our allies,
especially Japan, Germany, and Taiwan, to build up their conventional
defenses, and fully enable those, like Poland, Australia, and the United
Kingdom, willing to do more for their and others' defense. But this
strategy will take time to bear fruit. This is the strategy the 2018
National Defense Strategy called for---yet four years later, due to
factors ranging from inertia through political and bureaucratic
resistance to allied footdragging, we still have a long way to go. [In
the coming years]{.underline}, then, [we face]{.underline} what Henry
Kissinger called "**[the necessity for choice]{.underline}**." [We don't
have enough of the right military might to cover all the threats to our
interests. **So we must prioritize**]{.underline}. This is far from
unprecedented. The U.S. and Britain faced this dilemma in 1941, and
elected a "Europe first" strategy, prioritizing defeating much stronger
Nazi Germany before Imperial Japan. Similarly today, **[America must
prioritize]{.underline}** addressing **[the threat China poses in
Asia]{.underline}**. [Asia is the world's "decisive theater" and China
by far the most powerful other state in the world]{.underline}. If China
attains its goal of becoming dominant over Asia, it will control over
half of the global economy. Americans' fundamental liberties and
prosperity will suffer grievously. [This is the most dangerous outcome
for Americans, and preventing it **must be the priority of our foreign
policy**]{.underline}. [In practical military terms, this means that we
must ensure enough of the right military forces]{.underline}---bombers,
submarines, munitions, ISR, and the like---[are ready and available to
defend Taiwan, and on relatively short notice]{.underline}. Taiwan is
China's best target for breaking apart the anti-hegemonic coalition that
is the only way we can prevent Beijing from dominating Asia. If China
seizes Taiwan, it will deal this coalition a huge---possibly
mortal---blow. We cannot allow this. And, crucially, [this is a problem
right now.]{.underline} We don't know Beijing's assessment of the
People's Liberation Army's ability to seize Taiwan. But we do know that
[America's ability to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has eroded
very substantially in recent years, that it is continuing to erode, and
that Beijing's perceptions of its ability to take the island **would
rise dramatically** if it knew we had expended]{.underline} or tied down
**[critical parts of our military in or for Europe]{.underline}**. In
other words, [we are in]{.underline} or very close to [the window
**where a successful Chinese attack on Taiwan is possible**, and we
**must hedge against this risk**]{.underline}.

#### The plan trades off with resources needed to deter China

**Blackwill and Fontaine 22** (Robert Blackwill, senior fellow at the
Council of Foreign Relations. Richard Fontaine, Chief Executive Officer
of the Center for a New American Security, "Ukraine War Should Slow But
Not Stop the U.S. Pivot to Asia," *Bloomberg*, 2022,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-09/russia-s-ukraine-invasion-should-slow-not-stop-u-s-pivot-to-china)>

Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal and unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine has upended this approach. Now [Washington must deal with
revisionist great powers in two regions]{.underline}, while the Middle
East also continues to demand attention. **[The U.S. should continue
a]{.underline}** long-term **[shift to Asia]{.underline}**, but in a way
that better balances resources and engagements across the three
strategic theaters. Paradoxically, Putin's aggression demonstrates how
this should be done. First, [policy makers should absorb the enduring
strategic logic behind a pivot to Asia. China combines the **greatest
capability and will** to upend the international order. The Indo-Pacific
represents the **primary**]{.underline}, but not the only, regional
[**theater** in which U.S.-China competition takes place]{.underline}.
But a sustainable pivot to Asia is possible only in the absence of
serious national security crises in Europe and the Middle East. No U.S.
president will ignore a Russian-induced emergency in Europe, a major
terrorist threat, or a nuclear and/or hegemonic Iran. America remains a
global and not a regional power. [The central challenge is allocating
national security resources **across**]{.underline} all three
**[regions]{.underline}**, [without]{.underline} either weakening vital
U.S. national interests in one or [imagining that **America can do
everything, everywhere**]{.underline}. [That problem is most acute in
the **military sphere**]{.underline}. An increase in **[defense spending
will be required, but how that money is spent is equally
important]{.underline}**. In the Middle East, for example, regular
troops should relieve the burden placed on elite special operations
forces in security cooperation missions. Washington should move
expensive military equipment --- like F-35 and F-22 aircraft --- to the
two arenas of great-power competition, employing less-capable aircraft,
including unmanned systems, for counterterrorism missions. A combination
of regional diplomacy and continued deterrence could limit Iran\'s
regional ambitions, freeing up some of the forces that have deployed to
the Middle East in recent years to deter a potential Iran threat. [In
Europe, the U.S. should build on its allies' newfound willingness to
enhance their military capabilities and deter further Russian
aggression]{.underline}. This should involve moving American troops
currently stationed in Europe further east, to countries such as Poland,
Romania and the Baltics. Washington should also capitalize on the recent
increase in intelligence sharing -- including to NATO non-members -- by
eliminating barriers to sharing defense technology with allies newly
willing to invest. For **[the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**, Washington
[should **reserve the lion\'s share of military resources**]{.underline}
that matter most, including smaller naval surface ships, long-range
missiles and next-generation fighter aircraft. Building on efforts like
the Aukus security arrangement with Australia and the U.K. would give
regional allies more leverage to strengthen their own defense, helping
them better deter China and serve as the frontline in daily competition
with it. **[Diplomatic resources are less zero-sum than military
power]{.underline}**, and economic engagement less still. [Intense
diplomatic work in Europe]{.underline} and the Middle East [could
**bolster the coalitions** in each that are willing and able to deal
with threats there, and potentially **reduce some of the threats
themselves**]{.underline}. Washington should couple this with an
affirmative economic agenda, beginning with re-entry to or renegotiation
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.

#### Resources for Europe [directly tradeoff]{.underline} with resources dedicated to Asian power projection

**Simon, Desmaele and Becker 21** (Luise Simon, head of international
security at the Institute for European Studies (Vrije Universiteit

[Because outcompeting China has become its most pressing strategic
challenge, Washington is adjusting its]{.underline} policies and
[relationships elsewhere in the world to ensure that they support
competition with Beijing]{.underline}. While [the shift]{.underline} has
been gradual, it **[is]{.underline}** now **[apparent]{.underline}**;
[it represents a significant change from the twentieth century when the
US went to war twice in Europe and conflicts elsewhere were often driven
by the logic of European security]{.underline}. Whereas during the Cold
War the US enlisted European allies in a global struggle against a
European power, today the US seeks to enlist European allies in a global
competition with a non-European power. To be sure, neither competition
with China nor the preservation of a favorable regional balance in the
Indo-Pacific fully monopolizes US global strategy. Both the 2017 NSS and
the declassified synopsis of the 2018 NDS emphasize America's ongoing
commitment to the preservation of "favorable balances of power in Europe
and the Middle East."31 The NSS even refers to Europe as the United
States' most "significant trading partner" and notes that America is
"safer when Europe is prosperous and stable."32 Yet there is growing
concern in Washington about how China's rise might affect European
security. In this regard, the NSS warns about Beijing's supposed efforts
to "gain a strategic foothold in Europe by expanding its unfair trade
practices and investing in key industries, sensitive technologies and
infrastructure."33 A 2019 task force report published by the bipartisan
Asia Society similarly identifies "China's pursuit of a mercantilist
high-tech import-substitution industrial policy" and its "economic and
diplomatic statecraft to gain a military foothold beyond Asia,"
including in Europe, as key grand strategic challenges.34 In other
words, because US strategic objectives in Asia and Europe are
increasingly interdependent, China and Asia are also becoming
increasingly relevant in Washington's dealings with and in Europe.
[This]{.underline} interdependence [complicates America's European
strategy]{.underline} in two ways: [by underscoring the problem
**resource trade-offs** and by pushing the US to reconcile competing
interests **across the two regions**]{.underline}.

### IL\-\--Resources Finite\-\--Generic

#### Military resources are [finite]{.underline}. New expenditures [require]{.underline} a draw-down from other regions

**Wasser** **20** (Becca Wasser, fellow in the Defense Program and
co-lead of the Gaming Lab at the Center for a New American Security,
"Making Critical Choices for Better Posture Approaches," *Center for New
American Security*, 2020,
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/making-critical-choices-for-better-posture-approaches)>

The 2018 NDS was widely lauded for acknowledging that [the United States
has **finite resources** and therefore must prioritize its
activities]{.underline}. A key element of the strategic guidance was the
elevation of China and Russia as top threats to the United States. This
move raised the importance of Asia and Europe to U.S. defense strategy.2
While creating a clear hierarchy of threats was commendable, the details
of how the DoD would implement this guidance was and continues to be
unclear and has resulted in haphazard attempts to adjust posture. U.S.
posture in Asia---with the exception of a reported planned troop
reduction in the Republic of Korea and increased freedom of navigation
operations---has remained remarkably stagnant for the top geographic
priority.3 Europe, on the other hand, has seen significant plans to
alter the U.S. footprint and establish a new base in Poland, with the
intent to better address the Russian threat.4 The Middle East, despite
being an implied region of lesser importance, has received an influx of
U.S. forces and capabilities since the strategy was published.5
High-demand, low-density assets that the United States had previously
removed from there for use in Asia and Europe have since been returned,
along with additional capabilities.6 Moreover, while the DoD has
undertaken combatant command--level posture reviews, only minimal force
reductions have been made in Africa and South America, areas where the
U.S. footprint is already relatively small.7 Although the elevation of
China and Russia in the NDS had obvious implications for U.S. posture,
actualizing these changes has been difficult. This is in part because
the prioritization within the last NDS still does not go far enough in
forcing DoD policymakers to make difficult posture choices. [Altering
posture using finite resources]{.underline}, manpower, [and capabilities
involves a dynamic similar to that of a **seesaw**]{.underline}---[to
reinforce forces and capabilities **in one region**, forces and the same
capabilities **in another region will have to be restrained** in order
to balance things out]{.underline}. [With the United States facing
further resource constraints]{.underline} as a result of COVID-19, the
next NDS\[National [Defense Strategy]{.underline}\] [**must further
prioritize** adversaries and geographic regions]{.underline} to help
determine a more aligned posture---[one that better prepares the nation
to prevail against other great powers while deterring lesser
opponents]{.underline}.

#### Defense budgets are flat\-\--tradeoffs are required for the plan

**Burns 21** (Robert Burns,"Pentagon rethinking how to array forces to
focus on China," *Associated Press*, 2021,
<https://www.wdhn.com/uncategorized/pentagon-rethinking-how-to-array-forces-to-focus-on-china/)>

The Biden [administration faces a conundrum as it rethinks the
positioning of military forces]{.underline} around the world: [How to
focus more on China and Russia without retreating]{.underline} from
longstanding Mideast threats --- [and to make this shift with
potentially leaner Pentagon budgets]{.underline}. Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin ordered a monthslong "global posture" review just days
after taking office. It will assess how the United States can best
arrange and support its far-flung network of troops, weapons, bases and
alliances to buttress President Joe Biden's foreign policy. [The review
is part of the administration's effort to chart a path for a
military]{.underline} still caught in decades-old Mideast conflicts,
**[facing flat]{.underline}** or declining **[budgets]{.underline}** and
grappling with internal problems like racism and extremism. Its outcome
could have a long-lasting impact on the military's first priority:
ensuring it is ready for war in an era of uncertain arms control. Also
at stake are relations with allies and partners, weakened in some cases
by the Trump administration's "America first" approach to diplomacy.
Austin's review is closely related to a pending administration decision
on whether to fulfill the prior administration's promise to fully
withdraw from Afghanistan this spring. And it is advancing separately
from big-dollar questions about modernizing the strategic nuclear force.
Like the Trump administration, Biden's national security team views
China, not militant extremists like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group,
as the No. 1 long-term security challenge. Unlike his predecessor, Biden
sees great value in U.S. commitments to European nations in the NATO
alliance. That could lead to significant shifts in the U.S. military
"footprint" in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific, although
such changes have been tried before with limited success. The Trump
administration, for example, felt compelled to send thousands of extra
air and naval forces to the Persian Gulf area in 2019 in an effort to
deter what it called threats to regional stability. Biden has seen
reminders of this problem in recent days with violence in Iraq and
Afghanistan. It might also mean a Biden embrace of recent efforts by
military commanders to seek innovative ways to deploy forces, untethered
from permanent bases that carry political, financial and security costs.
A recent example was a U.S. aircraft carrier visit to a Vietnamese port.
Commanders see value in deploying forces in smaller groups on less
predictable cycles to keep China off balance. Hints of change were
surfacing before Biden took office. In December, Gen. Mark Milley,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke of his own view that
technological and geopolitical change argue for rethinking old ways of
organizing and positioning forces. [The **very survival** of U.S. forces
will depend on adapting to the rise of China, the spread of technologies
like artificial intelligence and robotics]{.underline}, and the
emergence of unconventional threats like pandemics and climate change,
Milley said. "Smaller will be better in the future. A small force that
is nearly invisible and undetectable, that's in a constant state of
movement, and is widely distributed --- that would be a force that is
survivable," he told a Washington conference. "You're not going to
accomplish any objective if you're dead." Austin made a similar,
narrower point last month about the positioning of U.S. forces in Asia
and the Pacific. "There's no question that we need a more resilient and
distributed force posture in the Indo-Pacific in response to China's
counter-intervention capabilities and approaches, supported by new
operational concepts," Austin wrote in response to Senate questions
posed in advance of his confirmation hearing. Austin also noted his
concern about competing with Russia in the Arctic. "This is fast
becoming a region of geopolitical competition, and I have serious
concerns about the Russian military buildup and aggressive behavior in
the Arctic --- and around the world," he wrote. "Likewise, I am deeply
concerned about Chinese intentions in the region." That doesn't argue
for abandoning the U.S. military's large hubs overseas. But it suggests
more emphasis on deployments of smaller groups of troops on shorter
rotations to nontraditional destinations. This shift already is
underway. The Army, for example, is developing what it calls an
"Arctic-capable brigade" of soldiers as part of an increased focus on
the High North. That area is seen as a potential flashpoint as big
powers compete for natural resources that are more accessible as ice
packs recede. Similarly, the Air Force is sending B-1 long-range bombers
to Norway, a NATO ally and neighbor of Russia, for the first time. China
considers itself an Arctic nation, but the main U.S. concern with
Beijing is its growing assertiveness in Asia and the Pacific. In the
U.S. view, China aims to build the military strength to deter or block
any U.S. effort to intervene in Taiwan, the semi-autonomous democracy
that Beijing views as a renegade province that must eventually return to
the communist fold. [A Council on Foreign Relations report]{.underline}
this month [called Taiwan the most likely spark for]{.underline} a
U.S.-China [war]{.underline}, a prospect with dire human consequences
[that it said "**should preoccupy** the Biden team]{.underline}."
"Millions of Americans could die in the first war in human history
between two nuclear weapons states," the report said.
[Washington]{.underline} also [cites concern about China's efforts to
modernize and potentially expand its nuclear arsenal while it declines
to participate in any international nuclear arms control
negotiations]{.underline}. [The sharpened focus on China began during
the Obama administration]{.underline}. The Trump administration went
further by formally declaring that China and Russia, not global
terrorism, were the top threats to U.S. national security. Some now
question whether this shift has gone too far. Christopher Miller, who
served as acting secretary of defense for the final two months of Donald
Trump's presidency, said in an interview that he agrees [China is the
key national security threat. But]{.underline} he said U.S. [commanders
elsewhere in the world told him the China focus was **costing them

### IL\-\-- Taiwan Assistance Key

#### Effective US assistance to Taiwan deters Chinese aggression

**Gramm and Wicker 22** (Phil Gramm, former chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee and a nonresident senior fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute. Roger Wicker, a U.S. senator from Mississippi, is
in line to become the chairman of the Armed Services Committee if

[The paramount lesson from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that
repeated threats of economic sanctions didn't deter]{.underline}
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} from launching an all-out invasion. [This
offers a warning for Taiwan, the U.S. and their allies as threats from
China loom]{.underline}. The long history of sanctions, embargoes and
economic blockades strongly suggests they are difficult to enforce,
entail significant costs to the nations imposing them, and trigger
market forces that eventually override them. Benefits flow to countries
that don't enforce the sanctions. The enforcement challenges grow
significantly if the economy of the targeted nation is large, and as the
size of the target country increases, the deterrent effect of
threatening sanctions loses credibility. [Since the Chinese
economy---one-sixth of the world's economy---is 10 times as large as the
Russian economy, effective sanctions would be virtually impossible to
enforce]{.underline}. Relying on threatened sanctions to deter a Chinese
attack on Taiwan could therefore entice aggression that could pull the
U.S. into a war with China, an event that would alter the course of
world history. [Thankfully, there is a far more effective
deterrent]{.underline}. [Taiwan is an island roughly 100 miles off the
coast of mainland China. Unlike Ukraine, a large land army can't be
massed along its border. But because it is an island, supplies also
can't be delivered]{.underline} to an adjacent neighbor and
clandestinely driven across the border. [Any supplies delivered after an
attack would have to be flown in or delivered by ship, putting the
supplier directly in harm's way. Supplying Taiwan on anything like the
scale we have supplied Ukraine during a Chinese attack would be a
logistical nightmare]{.underline}. When China was an economic basket
case, 100 miles of ocean was more than enough deterrent. But [with China
now an economic and military powerhouse, Taiwan's lack of preparedness
is increasingly dangerous]{.underline}. Taiwan's economy is two-thirds
larger than Israel's, but Taiwan spends almost two-thirds less as a
percentage of gross domestic product on defense. U.S. support can't be
allowed to abet Taiwan's neglect of its own defense. As Machiavelli
observed, "nothing is so weak and unsustainable as a reputation for
power which is not based on one's own strength." [The good news is that
modern technology makes it relatively easy for Taiwan to afford weapons
that would make the cost of invasion exceed any reasonable
benefit]{.underline}. Ukraine's valiant resistance has shown how highly
motivated defenders with high-tech weapons can scramble the calculus of
military power. Like David's smooth stone that slew Goliath, two
Ukrainian Neptune missiles sank the flagship of the Russian navy in the
Black Sea. With 400 U.S. Harpoon missiles, costing only 0.3% of its GDP,
Taiwan could imperil any Chinese warship in the Taiwan Strait. Modern
sea mines are even less expensive, and Turkish Bayraktar drones, which
have been so effective in Ukraine, cost less than \$2 million each. Two
hundred fifty million dollars would buy 5,000 Switchblade drones, which
could devastate landing craft, armored vehicles, and small assault
ships. Taiwan already has two Patriot missile battalions and for \$3
billion could double its air and missile defense. Stinger missiles, used
to great effect in Ukraine, cost only \$400 million for 1,000 missiles.
Taiwan will have more than 200 F-16 fighter jets by 2026, including
almost 70 of the newest Block 70 aircraft. With additional F-16s and
other aircraft being retired from the U.S. Air Force, more aircraft
could be made available at their depreciated value. If the U.S. and its
allies are willing to accelerate the sale of these and other
force-multiplier weapons at cost, [Taiwan could totally upgrade and
harden its defenses]{.underline} by simply raising its defense budget
from 2% to 3% of GDP. At that level, Taiwan could fund all these weapon
purchases over a five-year period. Sustaining its defense outlays at 3%
of GDP would allow Taiwan to continue modernizing its defenses while
spending at a level roughly equal to Israel's defense expenditures in
real dollar terms. With these investments, [Taiwan should focus heavily
on training for new weapons systems]{.underline}. It should also
consider transforming its army from the current conscript system into a
smaller voluntary force that would better accommodate a defense system
based on the power of modern technology. Citizens who would have
otherwise been drafted could be trained in high-end weaponry and kept in
reserve or home-guard forces that could be activated in emergencies.
[The primary objective of the U.S., its allies and Taiwan isn't to repel
a Chinese attack but to prevent it from ever occurring. Effective
deterrence is the key to national security]{.underline}. [Any wolf has
the ability to kill a gentle porcupine. And yet such an attack virtually
never occurs in nature]{.underline}. The **[defense]{.underline}** of
the porcupine's quills, which can rip through the predator's mouth and
throat, **[is the deterrent that protects]{.underline}** the small
creature in the violent woods. [Through the **force-multiplying miracle
of modern weapons**, we can help make Taiwan a **porcupine** and **deter
aggression** that could have profoundly negative consequences for
Taiwan, China and the world]{.underline}.

#### Assistance to Taiwan is key to deters invasion

**Porter and Mazarr 21** (Patrick Porter, Professor of International
Security and Strategy at the University of Birmingham. He is also Senior

TAIWAN: A THIRD WAY," *Lowy Institute*, 2021,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/countering-china-s-adventurism-over-taiwan-third-way)

[The first and most important component of]{.underline} such [a US
approach would be for the United States to serve as
armourer]{.underline} rather than guarantor, [to help Taiwan strengthen
its own ability to defeat an invasion]{.underline}. [Taiwan is, in fact,
an eminently defensible nation. Both geography and weather are
unfriendly to aggressors and tend to channel possible invasions into
narrow apertures of space and time]{.underline}. [Surprise is nearly
impossible]{.underline}: China would need to build up massive forces in
ways that would provide Taiwan with ample warning time.\[60\] [If Taiwan
acquires, over roughly the next five years]{.underline}, large numbers
of additional anti-ship [missiles]{.underline}, more extensive
ground-based air [defence capabilities, smart mines, better
trained]{.underline} and more effective reserve [forces]{.underline}, a
significantly bolstered [capacity for offensive cyber
warfare]{.underline}, a large suite of unmanned intelligence,
surveillance, [and]{.underline} reconnaissance ([ISR]{.underline}) and
strike [systems]{.underline}, and counterstrike capabilities able to hit
coastal targets on the mainland, [it will continually increase the price
China will have to pay to win a war]{.underline}.\[61\] [Taiwan is
gradually embracing such an approach]{.underline}, but even given recent
increases, it does not yet spend enough on defence to give such a
strategy teeth.\[62\] This has been a problem for some time: Taiwan's
defence cuts prior to 2018, one analyst argued then, after earlier cuts
between 1993 and 2002, suggested "either a state of denial about the
threat, a gridlocked political system, misplaced faith in current
systems and geographic advantages, or perhaps most disturbingly, a
belief that the United States is certain to provide timely military
assistance."\[63\] This is now changing, but slowly. Taiwan's military
reserves, which ought to be a leading tool of an island nation's
self-defence strategy, are poorly trained and equipped.\[64\] Open
sources suggested that as of 2018, Taiwan was only able to fill 153 000
of 188 000 active-duty billets; reports suggest that even frontline
units are only manned at 60 to 80 per cent strength. Taiwanese military
exercises are rigid, scripted, and of low value.\[65\] Logistics
shortfalls have reportedly even led to suicides by despondent Taiwanese
soldiers.\[66\] Taiwan needs a serious domestic debate over the steps
required to more fully provide for its own defence. President Tsai
Ing-wen posted this image to her Twitter account on 24 March 2020,
accompanied by the text, \"As the world grapples with the severity of
the #COVID19 pandemic, China\'s military maneuvers around #Taiwan have
continued unabated. Whether it\'s national defence or preventing the
spread of disease, our armed forces remain as vigilant as ever.\" Image:
Tsai Ing-wen/Twitter. Just as important as the amount Taiwan spends on
defence is how it spends those funds. Military analysts almost
universally agree that Taipei has over-invested in large, expensive,
exquisite combat systems. Weapons like modern fighter aircraft, large
surface combatants, and even large anti-aircraft missile systems like
the Patriot will be vulnerable to the barrage of Chinese air and missile
attack.\[67\] Happily, this is now changing: Taiwan's 2017 Overall
Defense Concept (ODC) pointed the country in the direction of what has
been termed a "porcupine strategy" with a shift away from legacy systems
to smaller, cheaper, more numerous and survivable, and more explicitly
defensive capabilities.\[68\] This new approach has been manifest in
some recent arms purchases\[69\] and will reportedly be confirmed in
Taiwan's 2021 Quadrennial Defense Review.\[70\] [The United States could
encourage Taiwan's planned evolution to such asymmetric capabilities in
more direct ways. It could offer **advice and direct aid** to help
Taiwan with purely defensive steps]{.underline}, such as national
infrastructure resilience, stockpiles of key materials to deal with a
potential blockade, and cyber resilience. More ambitiously, it could
encourage and directly support development of technologies geared less
towards power projection and more towards repelling invasion, such as
cheap anti-ship missiles and UAVs,\[71\] the potential for which was
again recently demonstrated in the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh.\[72\]
[China would object, but the United States could argue that this
cooperation on lower-technology systems is fully in line with its
long-term commitments to reduce arms transfers]{.underline}.

#### Security cooperation is key\-\--it's the most powerful demonstration of the US commitment

**Kanapathy 22** (Ivan Kanapathy, senior associate with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. He served on the U.S. National
Security Council staff from March 2018 to July 2021, "Taiwan Doesn't
Need a Formal U.S. Security Guarantee," *Foreign Policy*, 2022,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/26/taiwan-us-security-guarantee-defense-china-ukraine-war/)>

[From an adversary's perspective, the breadth and depth of U.S.
**security cooperation** are]{.underline} perhaps [**the most powerful**
demonstration of American commitment]{.underline}---more so than any
mere declaration of intent. As with Ukraine, the United States compelled
Taiwan to give up its nuclear weapons program decades ago. Also, as with
Ukraine, [the United States restricts the weapons it offers to
Taiwan]{.underline}. In hindsight, U.S. failure to provide lethal
assistance to Ukraine following the 2014 Russian incursions and twice
again in 2021---all intended as de-escalatory olive branches extended to
Russia---had the opposite effect on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[Given the imbalance of military power across the Taiwan Strait,
historical U.S. resistance to offering Taiwan security
assistance]{.underline} out of consideration for Beijing [has
been]{.underline} equally unjustified and
[counterproductive]{.underline}. Strategic clarity, however, would not
solve this problem. Current U.S. law already provides ample guidance.
The Taiwan Relations Act establishes U.S. policy "to maintain the
capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force ... that
would jeopardize the security" of Taiwan. On the question of security
assistance, the statute requires the U.S. government to "make available
to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services" as needed for its
self-protection. Prioritizing the U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation
relationship is simply a matter of U.S. political will and bureaucratic
implementation. Similarly, the U.S. president's statutory obligations to
respond to an attack are arguably already commensurate with, and in some
ways stronger than, the U.S. mutual defense treaties with the
Philippines and Japan, both of which are targets of China's maritime
military coercion. The latter documents obligate the United States to
consider an attack on the counterpart to be "dangerous to its own peace
and safety" and to "act to meet the common danger." (This same language
was used in the 1954 defense treaty with Taiwan, which the United States
abrogated in 1980.) The Taiwan Relations Act, by contrast, sets a lower
bar to initiate action by directing the president to consult Congress on
a response to "any threat \[emphasis added\] to the security or the
social or economic system of" Taiwan. Compared with a defense pact, the
president can invoke the act earlier in a crisis---possibly even today.
Haass and Sacks argue that strategic clarity should be accompanied by
increased counter-China defense resources and enhanced diplomacy to
signal severe economic and political costs in response to aggression.
But the U.S. Defense Department has been focused on China as its top
long-term priority since early 2018, and the recent implementation of
U.S. and allied sanctions on Russia has instructed Beijing more than
diplomacy ever could. READ MORE A man holds a Chinese flag on a Chinese

Taiwan Invasion Plans May Get Faster and Deadlier Russian mistakes offer
some warnings for Beijing's ambitions. ANALYSIS \| BONNY LIN, JOHN
CULVER To build on this credibility, the United States must demonstrate
willingness to sanction and restrict entities in China whenever
appropriate---even at a cost to shorter-term U.S. economic interests.
For their part, Edelman and Miller go further, suggesting that the
United States deploy forces to Taiwan to train the Taiwanese military.
Given revelations that U.S. force rotations to Taiwan already exist,
though, no new policy declaration is needed to publicize or expand these
programs. Putin's trampling of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Ukraine
and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's evisceration of the 1984 Sino-British
Joint Declaration on Hong Kong indicate both leaders respect hard power,
not words on paper. It is concrete actions---increased military
resources to counter China, demonstrated willingness to enact sanctions,
and deployments of U.S. forces in Taiwan---that have and will impact
Beijing's perceptions of U.S. capability and resolve. Such actions can
be taken without a U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan. Conversely, a
declaration of strategic clarity could instead be counterproductive. A
U.S. security guarantee would necessarily come with two caveats or
conditions. The first relates to geographic scope. The Taiwan Relations
Act (like the mutual defense treaty that preceded it) covers the main
island and the nearby Penghu islets, leaving out Taiwan's outer islands,
which include offshore islands along China's coast and South China Sea
features. With very little warning, the Chinese military could annex one
or more of these isles in a matter of hours---presenting a fait accompli
before the United States could respond. And with China's unparalleled
anti-access defenses, not even the U.S. Marines would attempt to reclaim
islands within China's coastal territories. Therefore, a U.S. security
guarantee cannot credibly include these outlying islands. But even if
they are not covered under a defense pact, by annexing them Beijing
would diminish U.S. credibility and sow division in Taiwan, just as it
has in the Philippines, a longtime U.S. treaty ally. Ten years ago,
Beijing ran such a playbook in the South China Sea, leveraging its
superior maritime power. China's armed vessels escalated a
jurisdictional fishing dispute at the Philippines-controlled Scarborough
Shoal, which China also claims and which is technically not covered by
the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty. Washington stepped in to mediate,
but Beijing reportedly reneged on an agreement for both claimants to
withdraw. Following the Philippines' withdrawal, the United States did
not challenge China's remaining vessels, effectively ceding control of
the shoal to China. In the decade following this incident, many in the
Philippines, including its president, have expressed resignation to
China's regional dominance and questioned the credibility of the
U.S.-Philippines defense pact. Furthermore, the Philippines government
delayed key U.S. security cooperation programs that would have enhanced
allied deterrence posture vis-à-vis China. Given how Beijing's 2012
aggression undermined the U.S.-Philippines alliance in Manila, if
Washington were to adopt strategic clarity for Taiwan, Beijing might be
incentivized to attempt a similar gambit with Taipei by seizing one of
its outlying islands. A second condition of strategic clarity would be a
"no Taiwan independence" clause, wherein a U.S. pledge "to come to
Taiwan's aid \[would not be\] unconditional and would not necessarily
cover a crisis initiated by Taipei," as Haass and Sacks write. But the
assignment of blame for initiating a conflict is in the eye of the
beholder. Such a caveat would be welcomed by Beijing, which argues that
all its coercive measures are in response to provocations by Taipei and
Washington. In Beijing's view, Washington threatens China's sovereignty
by encouraging Taiwan along its steady march toward independence. With
Ukraine, Chinese officials and media adopted Russia's narrative that the
United States is to blame for having broken a purported promise to not
expand NATO eastward. In this reading, Putin was forced to invade
Ukraine to block NATO from reaching Russia's doorstep. Beijing also
claims that Washington is acting equally as dangerously in the
Indo-Pacific---so presumably Xi will be compelled to prevent Taiwanese
independence. Considering Taipei's assertions that Taiwan is "an
independent country already," a conditional U.S. promise to intervene
would only provide fodder for China's global propaganda organs, casting
the United States as again reneging on a commitment not to interfere in
China's internal affairs. In practice, the "no independence" condition
removes clarity from strategic clarity and enhances China's propaganda
narratives. Like most Americans, many Taiwanese people naively assume
that the U.S. military can save them from subjugation. In truth,
however, Taiwan's inherent capacity to resist an invasion until partners
can come to its aid is likely a decisive factor in mounting a successful
defense, and therefore in deterring an attack in the first place.
According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission
(USCC), "Taiwan faces significant challenges from decades of
underinvestment in defense." In 2020, Taiwan spent just under 2 percent
of its GDP on its military, while many other so-called front-line
democracies, including South Korea, India, the Baltic states, Poland,
and Israel, all spent more than 2 percent. While Taiwan's defense budget
has inched upward in recent years, a U.S. security guarantee would be
counterproductive to overall military deterrence, because it would
reduce pressure on the Taiwanese government to further increase defense
spending, marginalizing effective capability enhancements such as
additional defensive munitions and drones. Lastly, the argument for
strategic clarity is premised on the notion that China currently
believes the United States will not intervene militarily to defend
Taiwan. While Beijing's propaganda denigrates Washington's commitment to
the region, there is scant evidence that China's leaders actually
believe it. The Chinese Communist Party's internal doctrine frames the
United States as China's greatest threat, and China's military likewise
assumes U.S. intervention in its planning. In China, U.S. President Joe
Biden's invocations of a commitment to defend Taiwan are viewed as
intentional signaling, not as unscripted commentary. As the USCC
concluded, "The perceived lack of clarity ... may be less relevant to
deterrence failure than other factors ... given that Chinese leaders
already assume U.S. intervention." The instinct to provide a security
guarantee to Taiwan arises from deeply held American values. But U.S.
adversaries hold different values and are swayed by alternative
propositions. Beijing would likely exploit a declaration of strategic
clarity and seek to create divisions between Washington and Taipei. From
China's point of view, a decision to invade Taiwan would not be tied to
a U.S. security guarantee---[Beijing already assumes that Washington
will intervene.]{.underline} [To enhance military deterrence, Washington
**must advance credible U.S., Taiwanese**]{.underline}, and allied
**[defense postures and capabilities]{.underline}**. To increase
economic and political deterrence, the United States must demonstrate
willingness to hold China accountable and build coalitions to do the
same. Given the high stakes, [Washington must **lead from the front

The decision to go to Asia is one that all thinking Americans can and

[East and South Asia are the places where the 21st century]{.underline},
for better or for worse, [will most likely be shaped]{.underline};
economic growth, environmental progress, the destiny of democracy and
success against terror are all at stake here.  American objectives in

dash for supremacy in the region, the US does not want either to isolate
or contain China.  We want a strong, rich, open and free China in an
Asia that is also strong, rich, open and free.  Our destiny is
inextricably linked with Asia's; Asian success will make America
stronger, richer and more secure.[  **Asia's failures** will reverberate
over here, threatening our prosperity, our security and perhaps even
**our survival**.]{.underline} [The world's two most mutually hostile
nuclear states, India and Pakistan, are in Asia.  The two states most
likely to threaten others with nukes, North Korea and aspiring rogue
nuclear power Iran, are there.  The two superpowers with a billion plus
people are in Asia as well]{.underline}.  This is where the world's

world's most populous Islamic country (Indonesia --- which is also among
the most democratic and pluralistic of Islamic countries), and the
world's most rapidly rising non-democratic power as well.  Asia holds
more oil resources than any other continent; the world's most important
and most threatened trade routes lie off its shores.  East Asia, South

#### Strategic overstretch causes the US military to fail in [both]{.underline} Europe and Asia

**Wertheim 22** (Stephen Wertheim, senior fellow in the American
Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
"Europe is showing that it could lead its own defense," *Washington
Post*, 2022,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/03/europe-defense-nato-ukraine-war/>)

[Providing **temporary** reinforcements is the right decision **today**
in the face of Russia's bald aggression]{.underline}. [But the United
States **should resist the inclination** to revive its role as the
military protector of Europe]{.underline}, especially [since Europe is
awakening to its responsibilities]{.underline}. Britain is sending
troops to the Baltic states and Poland. France is pushing "strategic
autonomy" for the European Union. And days after halting the Nord Stream
2 pipeline supplying natural gas from Russia, Germany reversed a
long-standing ban on providing military assistance and sent weapons to
Ukraine. Germany also vowed to spend more than 2 percent of its economy
on defense, finally committing to meet NATO's target. German Chancellor
Olaf Scholz declared his country, and Europe, to have reached a
"historic turning point." Both Americans and Europeans would benefit if
Scholz's words prove true. In the coming years, [European states
should]{.underline} move to **[take the lead]{.underline}** in their
collective defense, and the United States should do everything possible
to encourage them. To stake the defense of Europe on the United States,
over the next decade and beyond, would be to answer Putin's rash gamble
with a slow-moving gamble of our own. It might seem as though the United
States will remain able and willing to protect all of NATO's 28 European
countries far into the future. After all, America has orchestrated
Europe's defense for the past eight decades. Yet it did so under two
markedly different conditions. During World War II and the Cold War, the
United States sought to stop totalitarian powers from conquering the
region. An Axis or Soviet takeover of Europe would have closed off the
entire continent to liberal, American-style interaction and influence,
and put the Western Hemisphere on the defensive. After the Cold War,
however, as the Soviet threat collapsed, the United States recommitted
to Europe not because the stakes were high but arguably because they
were low. Threats were so negligible that it seemed U.S. leadership
could keep things that way through modest exertion --- and spread
democracy to boot. Expanding NATO eastward, American officials convinced
themselves that what had been a military alliance was more comparable to
a political club, one that need not become an adversary of Russia.
Russia's assault on Ukraine ends that chapter and begins a new one. The
prospect of further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe cannot be
dismissed as negligible, as it was in the 1990s or 2000s. At the same
time, Russia poses far less a threat to overrun Europe and threaten
American security or prosperity than the Soviet Union did. After all,
the Russian economy is roughly one-fifth the size of that of the
European Union, and that was before the severe sanctions of the past
week. Although Russia has built a formidable military, one that enables
it to launch wars like that in Ukraine, NATO's European members
collectively outspend Russia on defense. During the Cold War, by
contrast, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact boasted land forces superior in
number to those of NATO (including the U.S. share), and the gap between
its economic output and that of Western Europe was several times smaller
than Russia's shortfall today. In the security environment now emerging,
with Russia menacing Eastern Europe, the United States is set to face
major costs and the ultimate risk: great-power war between nuclear
peers. Yet [the threat Russia poses remains one that Europeans could
handle themselves, with America acting as a supporter rather than the
leader]{.underline}. [The United States remains a superpower. Why
shouldn't it be the main counterweight in Europe to Moscow?]{.underline}
There are two reasons both the United States and Europe would be better
off if it declined this role. One lies in **[Beijing]{.underline}**, and
the other in Washington. [The United States has already identified China
as its primary rival, embarking on "strategic competition" with the
world's number-two power. Taking on China and Russia at once would be
**unwise** and likely **impossible**]{.underline}. True, the Pentagon
has previously planned to fight two wars at once, but those wars were
envisioned as "regional" conflicts against small states like Iran, Iraq
or North Korea. In practice, the United States had difficulty
prosecuting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan simultaneously. [China and
Russia represent challenges of a far greater magnitude]{.underline},
which explains why the Pentagon abandoned its two-war standard in 2018,
even as its budget has grown. [If the United States doubles down on
European security while leading the charge in Asia]{.underline}, **[it
may]{.underline}** either **[fall short in both places or default on its
commitments in Europe just when they come due]{.underline}**.

Why **[the US Will Defend Taiwan]{.underline}**

Some critics claim that the US' messy withdrawal from Afghanistan has
only fueled Beijing's desire to conquer Taiwan because of nagging doubts
about Washington's determination to defend allies. Brussels-based
journalist Stuart Lau, for instance, wrote on Twitter: ​"Imagine Beijing
watching the US military ​'commitment' in Afghanistan while contemplating
its next move on Taiwan." This is a misguided analogy. For one, Beijing
understands that Washington chose to withdraw from Afghanistan to free
up political and military resources to deal with China. Moreover, Taiwan
is strategically much more important to the US than Afghanistan. The
island is a like-minded democracy and an important economic partner
(particularly in semiconductor technology sector, where Taiwan is world
leader). But above all, [Taiwan is crucial as a strategic location for
the US in the region.]{.underline} At a hearing of the US Senate in
December 2021, Ely Ratner -- assistant secretary of defense for the
Indo-Pacific in the Biden administration -- clearly cited Taiwan's
location as a central motivation for his government's commitment to
supporting Taiwan: ​"[Taiwan is located at a critical node within the
first island chain, anchoring a network of US allies and
partners]{.underline} --- stretching from the Japanese archipelago down
to the Philippines and into the South China Sea --- [that is critical to
the region's security and critical to the defense of vital US interests
in the Indo-Pacific. Geographically, Taiwan is also situated alongside
major trade lanes that provide sea lines of communication for much of
the world's commerce and energy shipping]{.underline}." [If Beijing
brings Taiwan under its control, the entire military balance in the
Western Pacific will change]{.underline}. So far, as Bruce Jones very
clearly states in his book To Rule the Waves, China has been severely
restricted by the fact that the first island chain off its coast is
comprised of US allies: Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines. If China
controlled Taiwan, it would break through the first island chain and
gain much freer access to the Western Pacific at large. As Jones writes:
​"China would suddenly gain naval bases beyond the first island chain.
The southern coast of Japan would be much more vulnerable to the Chinese
PLAN and American defenses in the rest of the Western Pacific more
exposed to Chinese power." [It is precisely because the strategic
consequences are so dramatic that we should assume that the US
(alongside allies]{.underline} such as Australia and Japan, which have
both indicated possible military support) [is prepared to defend Taiwan
militarily -- and that **this would lead to a great power
war**]{.underline}. Unless someone who is an advocate of radical
retrenchment assumes the US presidency, [this scenario would likely hold
true in the foreseeable future and under both Republican and Democrat
administrations]{.underline}.

[A decision to jettison Taiwan, or even cut back significantly on U.S.
support, would **prove to an increasingly confident China that
Washington has become weak, vacillating, and unreliable**.]{.underline}
The 2009 U.S.--China Joint Statement reflected Beijing\'s estimate that
Washington could be intimidated or misled, as it juxtaposed a reference
to Taiwan as a Chinese core interest with concurrence that \"the two
sides agreed that respecting each other\'s core interests is extremely
important to ensure steady progress in U.S--China relations.\"\[ 4\]
[Analysts who argue that Washington can safely appease
Beijing]{.underline} because \"territorial concessions are not always
bound to fail\" [are]{.underline}, without evidence, [assuming
improbably modest Chinese objectives]{.underline} (emphasis added).\[
5\]

Relying on the sacrifice of Taiwan to fulfill Chinese ambitions ignores
more than intentions, it also overlooks internal dynamics in China.
Beijing confronts constant domestic turmoil. Corruption, income
inequality, and environmental degradation have tarnished the
accomplishments of the government and party. Fears among the leadership
concerning mounting social unrest, spurred by the Jasmine Revolutions in
the Middle East, produced harsh restrictions of the media and the
Internet along with the imprisonment of artists, underground church
members, protesting peasants, lawyers, and human rights activists.
Regaining Taiwan is unlikely to provide a broad and enduring balance to
internal unhappiness.

[Beijing]{.underline} also [confronts **militant nationalism**
which]{.underline}, though fostered by the government, [is]{.underline}
still [difficult to control.]{.underline} Any suspicion that authorities
are not adequately safeguarding Chinese interests and securing
international respect could threaten regime stability. Accordingly, [a
U.S. sacrifice of Taiwan]{.underline}, while gratifying, [could not
thoroughly slake a continuing need for Beijing to demonstrate its power.
Indeed, **the sacrifice might promote new appetites** and necessitate
fresh efforts to satisfy that need]{.underline}.

[In Europe, all eyes are currently on Russia's brutal invasion of

into a full-scale war between NATO and Russia. [At the same time,
Europeans should not lose sight of the risk for another major conflict
that has been brewing in the Indo-Pacific: a military confrontation
between China and the US over Taiwan]{.underline}. [Such an escalation
poses one of the greatest threats to]{.underline} both German and
**[European prosperity and global stability]{.underline}**. [Taiwan
is]{.underline} an island of 23 million citizens. The Economist, in an
article published in 2021, has called it ​"**[the most dangerous place on
earth]{.underline}**." And the reason is clear: Taiwan is one of the
most likely locations of a war between great powers in the coming
decade. [An armed conflict between the world's two main nuclear powers
-- China and the US -- would have catastrophic consequences not only in
the region, but also for the rest of the world]{.underline}. Such a war
over Taiwan would not only claim countless lives and hold an
incalculable potential for escalation -- [it would]{.underline} also
[cause fundamental economic shocks and disruption. The **fallout would

[The prospect of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan echoes some of the most
disastrous 20th century instances of great power
expansion]{.underline}---reminiscent, perhaps, of Nazi Germany's
Anschluss or even its subsequent invasion of Poland. Given that the
latter ignited World War II, America's strategic community has been
rightly fixated on the vast military and political contingencies of a
Chinese invasion that would remake Asia. But [Taiwan]{.underline} is not
just the geopolitical fulcrum of the Indo-Pacific; it [is]{.underline}
also [the nexus of a rapidly evolving Sino-American technological
competition]{.underline}. And if 20th century great power competition is
any guide, tech races are just as important to long-term competition as
territorial military contests. The U.S. needs to act now to secure the
technological dimensions of a looming Taiwan crisis, or risk losing far
more than the island. In the domain of Sino-American tech rivalry,
Taiwan is unique in two aspects: First, the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) remains the world's tightest bottleneck
in the global high-tech ecosystem, with exclusive capabilities to
construct the most valuable, sophisticated computer chips in existence.
Second, [military conflagration in Taiwan would represent a

### Yes China invades 

#### Xi will invade -- its key to his China Dream

and international relations scholar. He is currently a visiting scholar
at the University of Nottingham, and also a member of council at the

mmv)

[Retired US navy captain Jim Fanell also made this prediction at a US
House of Representatives intelligence hearing this year. He said there
would be increasing pressure from inside the Communist Party in the next
decade to "pull the trigger" and recover Taiwan]{.underline}. Xi has
declared he will achieve the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"
by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, hence
Fanell's forecast that China will retake Taiwan in 2029. His reason was
that the world's leaders forgot about the June 4 incident in less than
20 years and "eagerly flocked to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony
of the 2008 Olympic Games". So, counting backwards from 2049, China
would have to recover Taiwan in 2030 at the latest.

Although Fanell's deduction about China's timetable is somewhat
far-fetched, his analysis of Beijing's agenda -- and of Xi's ambition --
is bang on. In theory, the realisation of Xi's "Chinese dream" of
national rejuvenation requires a series of indicators. However, [if the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait were still separate in 2049, it would be
difficult to persuade the Chinese people that the Chinese dream had been
realised, and Xi himself would be dissatisfied]{.underline}. How do you
claim to have rejuvenated a nation when it is still split?

Xi is a nationalist and his Chinese dream includes complete
reunification. [Only by retaking Taiwan could Xi realise the dream; only
by bringing off this immortal achievement could he surpass Mao Zedong in
the historical narrative of the Communist Party]{.underline}. From this
perspective, [Taiwan is the most important element of Xi's Chinese
dream]{.underline}.

Besides, [Xi has personal considerations to take into account. He has
offended too many people during his anti-corruption campaign in recent
years and, even if the party collapses, he might have difficulty making
a safe landing]{.underline}. [But if he could win back Taiwan and
reunify the country, he would become a national hero with an
unparalleled achievement under his belt, and no one would dare touch
him]{.underline}.

[At the party's 19th National Congress in 2017, Xi set out a 30-year
plan for the Chinese dream: from 2020 to 2035, the country will be
basically modernised]{.underline}; and, from 2035 to 2050, it will
become a fully modern power. Xi is 65, and it is unlikely he will be in
power into his 90s, till 2050. He probably envisions four terms, or 20
years in office, from late 2012 to early 2033, close to the halfway mark
of the Chinese dream: 20 years, because that is how long it takes to
transform China, expand the economy, and develop national strength and
military power.

[Considering that Xi would want the glory of the recovery of Taiwan for
himself]{.underline}, a suitable time to retake the island should be
near the end of his reign, in 2030. Complications could ensue -- the
world, especially the West, could impose sanctions or carry out a
military intervention -- and China would need two to three years, or a
little longer, to clean up the mess. Then, in 2035, right on schedule,
it could announce its achievement of the goal of basic modernisation.

The above analysis is based on the general logic of Chinese strategy,
but unforeseen factors may influence the outcome. For example, [Xi did
not expect the trade war. In the next decade, three variables could
force him to move forward his timetable for retaking Taiwan. First,
Sino-American relations could worsen further, if Washington's support
for Taipei crosses Beijing's red line]{.underline}. [Second, the
situation in Taiwan could spin out of control, if independence forces
gain political dominance and hold a referendum to rename the
island]{.underline}. [Third, the Chinese public could become
increasingly impatient with the status quo of self-rule in
Taiwan]{.underline}.

Su Chi, a former secretary general of Taiwan's National Security
Council, recently analysed the Chinese Communist Party's past use of
military force. He concluded that whenever its sovereign, territorial or
national security was threatened, Beijing would go to war, no matter how
difficult its internal situation was or how heavy the price it would
have to pay. The Taiwan issue is related to China's sovereignty, and is
an unbearable burden on Beijing.

Deng Xiaoping once said no Chinese leader could risk losing Hong Kong,
thereby repeating a humiliating episode of Chinese history. In 1982, he
told Margaret Thatcher that if China did not take back Hong Kong, it
would mean that the Chinese government was another late Qing government
and that the Chinese leadership was another Li Hongzhang. [It remains
true that no Chinese leader can risk losing Taiwan]{.underline}.

#### Taiwan is key to contain unchecked Chinese expansionism and war

Summary The ongoing [tensions between the United States and
China]{.underline}, which have come to partly define the Trump
presidency, [have seen both sides strive to gain economic, military and
geopolitical advantage]{.underline}. Their ongoing trade negotiations
appear to have captured the interest of observers and analysts but a
close second, if that is indeed what it is, would have to be their
dispute over the Republic of China (Taiwan). Having reacquired Hong Kong
and Macau, **[Taiwan remains the last geographical region that Beijing
claims it must "re-integrate" in order to right some of the wrongs it
has historically suffered]{.underline}**. So important is that
reintegration to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that it comes second
only to the very survival of the Party itself. From the political
perspective, [if the CCP is to claim a legitimate hold on power and,
simultaneously, maintain the legitimacy of its authoritarian rule, it
must necessarily absorb a democratically-run region to demonstrate that
its authoritarian rule is superior to democracy]{.underline}. Taiwan
also remains an embarrassment to Beijing in that it is proof that the
citizens of a democratically-run Chinese country, which Beijing
considers a breakaway province, enjoy a standard of living, including
various personal freedoms, far above those of Chinese citizens on the
mainland. Those aspects aside, [**Taiwan represents the most tangible
and immediate impediment to** the securitisation of **China's** sea
trade, together with any **maritime ambitions it may have in the region
and further afield**]{.underline}. The **[island's geographic position
allows it to thwart virtually all power projection from the
mainland]{.underline}**. The [island chain]{.underline}, of which Taiwan
is a major part, stretches from Japan to the Philippine archipelago,
[virtually encompassing the entire Chinese mainland which arcs into the
Pacific Ocean]{.underline}. [Taiwan lies offshore in the centre of the
Chinese coastline; it has, therefore, the potential to block all of
China's access to the ocean]{.underline}. In naval terms, [Taiwan could
potentially block the Chinese north and south fleets from
amassing]{.underline}. **[It is also the most effective barrier to
Chinese naval operations beyond the island chain]{.underline}**. China
learned the value of Taiwan during the Korean War of 1950-53. After US
President [Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}, General Douglas [MacArthur stated that]{.underline}
Formosa ([Taiwan]{.underline}) [was]{.underline} "[an unsinkable
aircraft carrier]{.underline}", [able to project American power along
China's coast in a containment strategy]{.underline}. The island's
position, along with its ties to the US, has caused resentment in
Beijing because the CCP cannot achieve its goal of national unification
while also posing a potentially major security threat to China's
development. The Chinese analyst Lin Zhibo sums up the situation:
Militarily, **[Taiwan is a potential which the USA could use in the
western Pacific]{.underline}**. The [use of Taiwan could enable
effective control of sea lines of communication between North-East Asia
and South-East Asia and the Middle East]{.underline}. ... Thus, the [USA
sees Taiwan as "an unsinkable aircraft carrier", giving it a **maximum
degree of control over China's East and South Sea
fleets**]{.underline}.\[1\] [China has]{.underline}, in short, [more
than one reason to wish to absorb Taiwan and bring it under CCP
rule]{.underline}.

American democracy. Its agents operate on U.S. soil in violation of
America's sovereignty. It is making preparations to improperly interfere
in the 2020 election, Russia-style. China may have actually done so last
year as well.]{.underline} In any event, it brazenly tried to influence
electoral outcomes last year. [Beijing is giving safe haven to North
Koreans who have cyberattacked the United States.]{.underline} The
assault on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 originated from
Chinese IP addresses. Many, if not most, of the North's hackers live in
China, most notably the city of Shenyang. [China has imprisoned American
legal residents---and possibly U.S. citizens---in concentration camps
located in what Beijing calls its Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
what traditional inhabitants of the area, the Uighurs, say is East
Turkestan. The maintenance of these camps, whose purpose is to eradicate
religion and ethnicity, constitutes a crime against humanity. China for
decades has been the world's master proliferator of nuclear weapons
technology. In defiance of American and global norms, it armed Pakistan
and through Pakistan sent nuclear tech to the Middle East and North
Africa. China has delivered components, equipment, and materials to
North Korea for its nuke effort.]{.underline} Moreover, the North's most
sophisticated ballistic missiles---the solid-fuel ones---appear to be
based on Chinese design. [China supplied mobile launchers.]{.underline}
And ruler [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has been dropping hints that China
is the world's only sovereign state]{.underline}, thereby [implying that
Americans are subjects]{.underline}, not to mention [calling into
question the legitimacy of the]{.underline} Westphalian [international
system. Challenges don't come more comprehensive and **existential**
than China's.]{.underline} As Vice President Mike Pence said in his
landmark October 4 Hudson Institute speech, Beijing is implementing "a
whole-of-government approach," and this requires, I believe, America's
whole-of-society response.

are scheduled to speak by phone on Friday, a conversation that the White
House says will center on "managing the competition between our two
countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of
mutual concern." [The Biden administration is left needing to **focus

[not simply economic imperatives but military ones as well]{.underline}.

U.S. focus in two regions. "**[But]{.underline}** it's also essential,
and I believe [we're entering a period where that's what will be
required of the United States]{.underline} and of this generation of
Americans." [Biden has been deeply invested in rallying NATO and Western
allies to respond to Russia]{.underline} with crippling sanctions,
supplying an overmatched Ukraine military with \$2 billion in military
assistance --- including \$800 million in new aid announced Wednesday
--- and addressing a growing humanitarian crisis. Eastern flank NATO
allies, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, have
made clear to the Biden administration that they want the U.S. to
increase its military presence in the region and do more to address the
worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. More than 3
million Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in recent weeks.

the need for Washington to **spend less time worrying** about provoking
authoritarian bullies and more time working to defend]{.underline}
threatened [democracies]{.underline} before the invasion starts. This is
especially critical as U.S. forces are much more likely to be directly
involved in a response to coercion against Taiwan. For 25 years, Beijing
has pursued a determined strategy featuring military modernization,
technological advancements, economic infiltration, cyberattacks and
persistent disinformation campaigns. These efforts have focused on
building a world-class military, erasing American military supremacy in
the seas and skies around Taiwan, and preparing for a potential attack
designed to establish CCP dominion over Taiwan. Meanwhile, **[the United
States has been distracted]{.underline}** elsewhere, **[unable to focus
its strategic and fiscal efforts on the rising power in

congressional failures to provide the Pentagon with the timely,
sufficient and predictable funding necessary to modernize U.S. forces

### \-\--xt: Not Zero-Sum

#### The US [can]{.underline} focus on both regions at once

**Kroenig 22** (Matthew Security, deputy director of the Atlantic
Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and a professor in

Service at Georgetown University, "Washington Must Prepare for War With
Both Russia and China," *Foreign Policy*, 2022,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/18/us-russia-china-war-nato-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/)>

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear: [How can the United States]{.underline}
[manage]{.underline} two revisionist, autocratic, nuclear-armed great
powers ([Russia and China]{.underline}) [simultaneously?]{.underline}
[The answer, according to many]{.underline} politicians and [defense
experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to Russia in
Europe to focus on]{.underline} the greater threat posed by
[China]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific. **[This would be a
mistake]{.underline}**. **[The United States]{.underline}** remains the
world's leading power with global interests, and it **[cannot afford to
choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Instead,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [should develop a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and
China at the same time]{.underline}. In recent weeks, Biden has sent
several thousand U.S. troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for
good reason. A major war in Ukraine could spill across international
boundaries and threaten the seven NATO allies that border Russia,
Belarus, and Ukraine. Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin
succeeds in Ukraine, why would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear
interest in resurrecting the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable
Eastern European countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic
states---might be next. A successful Russian incursion into a NATO
ally's territory could mean the end of the Western alliance and the
credibility of U.S. security commitments globally. The threat posed by
China is also serious. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years. This is a war the United States might lose. If China
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well on its way to disrupting the
U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to doing the same globally.
Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly working together. As this
month's summit between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shows,
Moscow and Beijing are forging a closer strategic partnership, including
on military matters. These dictators could coordinate dual attacks on
the U.S. alliance structure or opportunistically seize on the
distraction provided by the other's aggression. In other words, there is
a serious risk of simultaneous major-power wars in both Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. To address this problem, many have proposed answers that
simply will not work. The Biden administration initially hoped to put
relations with Russia on a "stable and predictable" footing to focus on
China, but Putin had other ideas, as the world is now seeing in Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Washington does not get to decide how its adversaries
sequence their aggression. Others have expressed hope that Washington
can peel these powers apart or even align with Russia against China, but
these are not realistic solutions. The misguided view gaining the most
recent acceptance, however, is that Washington should simply choose the
Indo-Pacific over Europe. Politicians and experts argue that the United
States lacks the resources to take on both Russia and China. They point
to China's power and Asia's wealth and argue that Asia should be the
priority. While Washington pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries,
such as Germany, should step up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed,
the Biden administration's National Defense Strategy, which has been
delayed due to the Ukraine crisis, is expected to focus on China without
offering a clear solution to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy
starts with clear goals---and Washington's objectives are to maintain
peace and stability in both Europe and Asia. [A good
strategy]{.underline}, however, [starts with clear goals, and
Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and stability in **both**
Europe and Asia]{.underline}. U[.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies]{.underline}. Indeed, the European Union,
not Asia, is the United States' largest trade and investment partner,
and this imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States
seeks greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
Moreover, [**the United States is not France**; it is **not compelled**
to make gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due
to constrained resources]{.underline}. In short, publishing [a defense
strategy that can only handle one of the United States' great-power
rivals]{.underline} (which is what is expected from the forthcoming
national defense strategy) [is planning to fail]{.underline}.

overseas. Security cooperation also can include conducting
quasi-operational efforts, such as helping U.S. partners and allies

### Asia Pivot Bad

#### Pivot to Europe solves Russia war, pivot to Asia causes it

**McKinley** **22** (Michael McKinley, non-resident senior adviser at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "It's Time to Pivot
Back to Europe," *Politico*, 2022,
<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/24/its-time-to-pivot-back-to-europe-00011324>)

President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the separatist republics of
Luhansk and Donetsk, which opened the door to the wider assault on
Ukraine that is now underway, is a game-changer on a historic scale. It
underscores, like nothing else, that the drift away from Europe by the
United States over the past 20 years in pursuit of wars and priorities
elsewhere has been short-sighted. Like 1949, the year in which the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization came into being, [America and its European
allies are facing a moment requiring a profound redefinition of their
security, political and economic ties]{.underline}. Going forward,
[a]{.underline} strategic, not tactical, [pivot back to Europe **should
be the driving imperative** of American foreign policy]{.underline}. In
doing so, it is important to accept reality: Putin called the bluff of
the not-very-collected West, which was equivocating by placing only
selective sanctions on Russia for its virtual annexation of part of
Ukraine. Putin is unlikely to be deterred by a staggered escalation of
these measures meant to allow room for him to change course: He is dead
set on achieving at least a partial reconstitution of the Russian empire
as he sees it and forcing the creation of a new security architecture
for Europe. Putin's words need to be taken seriously instead of being
dismissed as ramblings or misleading. For all the lingering suggestions
that there is still time for diplomacy, Putin could not have been
clearer this week that he was also setting the stage for more aggressive
steps in the very near future. He even raised a non-existent nuclear
threat to Russia from a NATO-dominated Ukraine and again dismissed
Ukrainian national identity as a fiction. Arriving at this point, too
many commentators and politicians spent months resorting to dismissive
rhetoric about Putin even as he outmaneuvered Western leaders. They
belittled Russia --- as a declining power, a declining economy and as a
nation fearful of democratization on its borders. They argued that the
United States and NATO allies could force Putin to rethink his actions
--- even though there has been no sign of him reconsidering course. Some
argued that Putin would not risk war given the likely costs. It is now
possible to see the limits of their world view. The inviolability of a
nation's sovereignty and its right to decide its own security alliances
have also been presented as self-evident truths. In the case of Ukraine,
however, many of us side-stepped uncomfortable questions about why NATO
did not invite the country to join, and about the precedents set for
Finland and Austria after World War II to ensure their neutrality. A now
prophetic article by Henry Kissinger in 2014 makes it clear that
something like the neutrality option would have been a more desirable
outcome for Ukraine and reflected the reality of Ukraine's situation.
The West will find it difficult to break the momentum that Russia is
building, or to reverse the new realities Putin is creating.
[Russia]{.underline} may not be a colossus, but it remains one of the
most powerful countries in the world, with a nuclear arsenal, a
modernized military and a serious player in international oil and gas
markets. It [cannot]{.underline}, in other words, [be dismissed only as
a "regional power threatening its neighbors out of
weakness,"]{.underline} and while it is becoming an outright
dictatorship by smothering democracy at home, that is not a central
concern in the current crisis. [Russia can project its military
globally]{.underline} --- as its interventions in Syria and elsewhere
have shown. [It can wage cyberattacks on Europe and the United States
with relative impunity]{.underline}. Putin has triumphed in political
showdowns with leaders like Turkey's President Erdogan and, even as
Russia's relationship with Europe in general turns adversarial, the
likes of Serbia and NATO member Hungary appear more sympathetic to
Putin. World leaders until last week came to Putin as he limited his own
international travel --- and gave little away. Russia's diplomatic
fortunes are hardly crumbling elsewhere, as evidenced by a rising
entente between China and Russia --- aligned in their security interests
against perceived Western encroachment. There is another factor at work,
and that is that Putin's view of history, often seen as opportunistic,
does appear to be a primary driver of his actions. And it is not his
worldview alone. The incorporation of Russian-speaking populations
inside neighboring borders after 1991 remains an issue for nationalists
in Moscow; and the West has systematically downplayed how NATO expansion
since 1997 has looked to a generation of Russian leaders, and not just
President Putin. It is not dovish, as a recent New Yorker article
suggested, or appeasement as a British defense minister stated, to take
these perceptions into account in the current crisis. The deep
undercurrents of historical myth drive almost every nation into
destructive paths. It is in this context that the United States and its
allies have chosen to draw a line in the sand over a further Russian
military intervention in Ukraine which has now materialized on a major
scale. The relative success of President Joe Biden in preserving a
united front with European allies on a gradual escalation of sanctions
masks the lingering challenges of fully cohering on strategy. There have
been differences between the responses by the United States and Britain
on the one hand; the French and the Germans on another; and disparate
governments like Italy (opposed to energy sanctions as late as this past
weekend) and Hungary (offering veiled sympathy to Russia's demands).
French President Emmanuel Macron until recently was openly discussing
the need for a new security architecture for Europe. Chancellor Olaf
Scholz of Germany told national reporters on his return from Moscow that
"we just can't have a possible military conflict over a question that is
not on the agenda" regarding Ukraine's future membership in NATO. As EU
foreign ministers met in Brussels this week, there were continued
differences between those arguing for "incrementalism" on sanctions like
Germany and Italy, and those wanting a more forceful response. There may
be greater unity now as the scale of the Russian invasion becomes clear,
but the proof will only be evident in the coming days. The allies'
caution in recent days contrasted with President Zelensky's increasing
concern as options close around him. The gathering of senior NATO and EU
ministers at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 18-20, as well as
the presence of a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Kamala Harris,
did not convey the strongest confidence on an agreed approach to Russian
aggression. President Zelensky's speech at the gathering was a searing
indictment of the lack of decisiveness of Western nations over the last
many years, and Ukrainian ministers were publicly critical of the slow
pace of the imposition of sanctions since the recognition of the
separatist republics by Russia. [Western governments are now at a real,
not hypothetical crossroads]{.underline}. The invasion is underway, and
Putin would appear to be achieving his long-stated objectives, some of
which he began to make clear 15 years ago in a speech to the 2007 Munich
Security Conference. He has torn up the 2015 Minsk agreement which was
meant to be the foundation for talks between Ukraine and Russia
regarding the future of the Donbas. Putin is calculating he can survive
sanctions for an indefinite period as he builds a significant war chest
of foreign reserves. He is also betting on a swifter and easier military
victory in Ukraine than Western analysts are predicting. If either of
these scenarios were to hold, NATO, EU and American threats or actions
would end up ringing hollow to most of the rest of the world. Putin, in
short, means to complete what he has started, and more. As Lithuanian
Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis suggested, Ukraine may not be
the end of the story, and Belarus' renewed and total subservience to
Moscow can, in retrospect, be seen as prelude to Putin's attempt to do
the same to Ukraine. In responding to Russia's expanding aggression in
Ukraine, Western nations will build towards ever more severe sanctions.
There will be United Nations resolutions and condemnations. Russian
oligarchs may lose their right to residence and investment in London and
Paris. Nord Stream 2 is being suspended and may be canceled. NATO may be
strengthened; European members may finally spend 2 percent of their GDP
on defense. NATO may accelerate military assistance to Ukraine or arm an
insurgency in Ukraine in the future. The broader international community
may be galvanized into supporting harsher measures to punish Russia
depending on the scale of the conflict. Longer-term, however, the latest
developments suggest it is time to rethink the West's approach to the
next phase of dealing with Putin. That will entail recognizing that the
security landscape of Europe is being changed as we watch, in real time,
and is unlikely to be turned back to what it was any time soon. The
response must stop Russia from destroying the post-World War II
architecture that has largely preserved peace for 70 years. Doing so
will require another historic decision and response. [We need to
revitalize NATO and the transatlantic economic and political relations
which have been **weakened for two decades as the United States
prioritized Asia**]{.underline}, abandoned trade agreements, diverted
NATO to fight wars farther afield and allowed allies to take for granted
the alliance's centrality to their own collective defense. In the
process, we may rediscover that [the future of the United States is
still **most fundamentally impacted by what happens in
Europe**]{.underline}.

#### Asia pivot causes Russian aggression and solve focus on Asia can't solve Chinese aggression

Eastern targets officer in the Central Intelligence Agency, is a senior
fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Ray Takeyh, a

<https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-folly-of-the-pivot-to-asia-pacific-china-russia-global-power-nato-11647981737)>

[Seldom has a diplomatic phrase been more reckless than]{.underline} the
Obama administration's "**[pivot to Asia]{.underline}**." The U.S. has
never been able to disentangle itself from key regions of the world, as
the war in Ukraine demonstrates. But [the notion that a new "Pacific
century" should become the nation's defining priority surely has
**emboldened adversaries** elsewhere and **called into question** other
alliances, including the most indispensable, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization]{.underline}. The question that ought to haunt the [White
House]{.underline} today is whether its ignominious retreat from
Afghanistan in the name of ending so-called forever wars, and its
[stream of press releases insisting that China is the only rival worthy
of attention, prompted]{.underline} an impetuous Vladimir [Putin to
undertake the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II]{.underline}. In January 1950, Secretary of State Dean Acheson gave a
speech placing Korea outside America's defense perimeter, thus inviting
aggression from North Korea. Often overlooked in that speech is Mr.
Acheson's insistence that "it is a mistake . . . to become obsessed with
military invasions" when thinking strategically about Asia and the
Pacific. Acheson seemed to assume that the dilemmas of newly independent
Asian states came from internal subversion stemming from economic
stagnation. To be fair, the Truman administration didn't shrink from its
responsibilities in Europe when war broke out in the Korean Peninsula.
The U.S. has been a global power for a century and has always given some
regions and countries priority over others. Early in the Cold War,
Europe's economic rehabilitation and its military defense preoccupied
America's politicians and strategists. In the 1960s, as the Cold War
stabilized in Europe, the U.S. turned its gaze toward Asia, where a
truculent China and an eastward-looking Soviet Union were both bent on
exporting revolution. With 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, the Far East
became a priority. And in the aftermath of 9/11, the Middle East took on
importance as Washington hunted down terrorists and sought, however
haphazardly, to refashion a political culture that had generated so much
hate. [Before]{.underline} Barack [Obama, no president had insisted that
the exigencies of one region mandated ignoring others]{.underline}. The
U.S. fought prolonged wars in East Asia, yet Washington didn't claim
that these conflicts meant that it had to pivot from Europe or Latin
America. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were beset by Vietnam; they
didn't complain about "forever wars" and the need to leave the Far East.
When George W. Bush found himself mired in Iraq, he didn't proclaim that
Europe and Asia no longer mattered. Burden sharing has been an objective
of all U.S. presidents. [The strategic neglect of Asia-firsters is
new]{.underline}. Joe Biden must be considered the least authentic of
China hawks. Much more than Mr. Obama, he has brandished the China
threat as cover for isolationism. Even the hasty departure from
Afghanistan was in part justified as a means of focusing on China.
Leaving Afghanistan would somehow, Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told us, make the U.S. stronger vis-à-vis Xi Jinping. At home Democrats
partly justified exorbitant domestic spending as a means of rebuilding
an America better able to resist China. Yet Mr. Biden hasn't taken any
serious military measures, or reinitiated a free-trading alliance, to
confront Beijing. This disconnect between words and deeds might have
been starkest when, soon after his inauguration, Mr. Biden held a summit
meeting with Mr. Putin---whom Democrats had denounced throughout Donald
Trump's presidency as a threat to democracy---where he pressed for a
"stable and predictable" relationship with Moscow. Much of the cheap
talk about pivoting stems from U.S. frustrations in the Middle East. The
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan caused the political class to question its
assumptions about American power. Yet the Middle East remains. Energy
markets are still global. Fracking hasn't made Persian Gulf oil less
important to America's national security. The perverse interplay between
Arab authoritarian states and Islamic radicalism (the former feeds the
latter) continues. Iran's nuclear ambitions, unimpeded by arms-control
diplomacy, will soon confront the international community. As Mr. Putin
has shown, a revisionist leader, armed with nuclear weapons and nursing
grievances, can easily rattle, if not upend, financial markets and
cherished assumptions. [For the foreseeable future, the Far East will
have a prominent place in America's strategic imagination]{.underline}.
China's conversion from a communist laggard to a rich and militarily
powerful fascist state has Western leaders in a bind, given that they
literally bet the bank on the hope that investment and trade would
somehow pacify Beijing's ambitions. **[But China's rise doesn't mean
that Europe matters little]{.underline}** or that the Middle East can be
ignored. The U.S. isn't Sweden. **[When America retreats, everyone
suffers]{.underline}**.

### US-Europe Relations Solve China War

#### US-Europe relations are a force-multiplier that solve Chinese aggression

[The US focus on East Asia continues to rock relations between

partners---including those in Europe---in]{.underline} the planning,
negotiating, and implementation stages of [its efforts to manage threats
from China will be critical]{.underline}. The effort should also pay
dividends. [By restoring and reinvigorating damaged European alliances,
the United States will be **better positioned** to manage threats in
**East Asia and elsewhere**]{.underline}.

#### Europe is a key counterbalance against Chinese leadership

British, French, and Spanish ties with Africa are important in pushing
back against China's growing influence in the continent. European
universities still produce stellar research which is crucial in the
technological competition with China. [Each of Europe's strengths in a
competition with China also makes it an important region in its own
right]{.underline}. [With three-quarters of a billion people, it is an
important trade partner and plays a key role in the American economy. It
is home to many U.S. military bases used for important
missions]{.underline}, most recently during the evacuation from
Afghanistan. Its scientific and technological achievements contribute to
American prosperity---the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that the president of
the United States and millions of others recieved would not have been
made without German partnership. **[America can't afford to take Europe
for granted]{.underline}** anymore. They need us and **[we need
them]{.underline}**. The hard part of alliance management is supposed to
be responding to the needs, wants, and objectives, and insecurities of
the other side. But lately, the United States has had more trouble
figuring out what its own needs, wants, and objectives in Europe
are---or if it has any at all.

Why **[China Cannot Challenge the United States]{.underline}**

People's Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) [Major]{.underline} General
Zhang Shaozhong [ranked Chinese military power in 2020 in the fifth
place]{.underline} behind the United States, Russia, Britain, and
France, [while PLAN surface power was ranked in the eighth
place]{.underline} behind Japan and India. The Peoples Liberation Army
Air Force ([PLAAF]{.underline}) [was ranked seventh]{.underline} in the
world, due to its lack of fourth-generation fighter planes and high-end
drones. In General Shaozhong's view, China will become the
second-largest military power in the world only in 2049, when it
celebrates its centennial anniversary.27 The US Military as an Economic
Deterrent [The US military plays the central role of economic
deterrence]{.underline}. The Communist Party of China
([CCP]{.underline}) [gains its legitimacy from economic
development]{.underline}. [It is possible that China could target Guam
with its small fleet of]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missiles
([ICBM]{.underline}). [However, the use of ICBMs will lead to massive
retaliatory strikes by the United States leading to total annihilation
of China's military and economic centers of gravity]{.underline}.28 The
USN Maritime Strike Tomahawk Cruise Missile Block V will destroy coastal
cities like Shanghai, obliterating China's hi-tech industries in a
matter of hours. The CCP leadership is inexperienced in nuclear matters
as it lacks exposure to a nuclear warfare strategy as practiced by the
United States and Russia. [China's nuclear policy is based on low-level
deterrence, "minimum deterrence," and its nuclear arsenal remains small
and vulnerable]{.underline}.29 **[Threatening the United
States]{.underline}** with 200 nuclear weapons **[is not an
option]{.underline}**. Geographically, the United States and China are
similar in size. However, [China's economy will be decimated by a few US
nuclear weapons, as its critical infrastructure is concentrated on the
coastlines and not dispersed like the US infrastructure]{.underline}. [A
war will lead to a loss of China's exports]{.underline} to the United
States worth USD 310 billion. The war will result in a decline in
industrial production, unemployment, and inflation, causing an economic
crash and a people's revolution. As seen from World War II, the United
States will experience reverse economic gains and benefit from the war,
resulting in high employment and industrial growth. It is expensive to
be a superpower. Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War two and a half
millennia ago, "first count the cost."30 China's defense budget cannot
compete with the combined power of United States, India, Japan, and
Australia. The United States alone spends more on national defense than
China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
Japan, South Korea, and Brazil combined.31 Can China afford it? An arms
race will lead to an increase in China's military spending, affecting
its development goals. The Absence of War-fighting Experience The United
States has an analytical learning process in place---China does not.32
Lessons learned have been well documented by the US military in the form
of doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures. The US military has
been documenting lessons learned since as early as the Boxer Revolution
during the China campaign.33 The US military has been led by outstanding
military generals like George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, George
Patton, and David Petraeus, while China always lacked great generals.
The world sends its military officers to US military institutions and
not China's military colleges. [The PLA strategy is based on Mao's
theory of the weak contender fighting a stronger adversary through
deceit and deception. China's only option is an asymmetric
strategy]{.underline} due to its incapability to fight symmetric wars.
Chinese scholars have authored books like Science of Military Campaigns,
Science of Military Strategy, and Unrestricted Warfare.34 However, China
is unable to convert the strategies and tactics mentioned in these books
into an executable doctrine. The Lack of Power Projection Power
projection capabilities set a superpower apart. From its Charm Offensive
to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has been wielding its
economic power to compel US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific
region to align with China, which has not been greatly successful.35
China lacks global reach, as it does not have foreign defense treaties
or logistical bases abroad equipped with military stockpiles.36 During a
war with the United States, soliciting Pakistan's military support looks
difficult, as China's all-weather friend has been hesitant to cut its
military ties with the United States. [China is constrained to operate
beyond the unrefueled range of its aircraft, warships, and
submarines]{.underline}. [US nuclear-powered carriers can rule the seas
for four years before being refueled]{.underline}. China's
nonnuclear-powered AC can barely operate beyond its green waters. The
Type 903 replenishment ship can only support two to three ships for
approximately two weeks.37 The USN's 68 nuclear-powered submarines have
been prowling the world's oceans displaying naval power, while the
PLAN's nuclear-powered submarines are unable to do so. Fighter aircraft
operating without a package of air-refueling tankers, Airborne Warning
and Control System aircraft, or a network of expeditionary airfields
cannot travel very far. The PLAAF's capability to target US bases in the
Pacific is hindered by a lack of air-refueling capacity. A flight group
of eight J-11B Flankers will have to be simultaneously refueled twice by
two air-refueling tankers for a seven-hour flight.38 The PLAAF will have
to deploy 20 percent of its tanker fleet to refuel the Flankers. The
PLAAF has 10 tankers for more than a thousand fighter aircraft, while
the USAF has 625 tankers for 1,956 fighter aircraft.39 The tankers will
be the prime targets for the USN potentially putting the Flankers at
risk. [China's only existing bomber, the H-6K, is reverse engineered
from the 1950s Soviet-designed Tu-16 bomber]{.underline}. The bomber is
incapable of attacking Hawaii---even when equipped with CJ-10 cruise
missiles. The H-6K has a range of 3,800 miles, while Hawaii is 5,157
miles from the closest H-6K base. The H-6K cannot attack nearby US
bases, as the bomber will be detected on open seas by the US C4ISR
systems. [PLAAF fighters are unable to escort the bombers, as they
cannot match its range]{.underline}.40 An Archaic Military [Less than 30
percent of China's surface forces, air force, and air defense forces and
55 percent of its submarine fleet were modern in 2011]{.underline}.41.
Subsequently, nothing much has changed, as a substantial percentage of
China's military remains obsolete.42 [China's military faces
institutional shortcomings]{.underline} arising from obsolete command
structures, low quality of personnel, and corruption.43 The military has
weaknesses centering on supporting capabilities such as logistics,
inadequate airlift, and deficient air defense and antisubmarine
warfare.44 The PLA's loyalty to the CCP has hampered its competence.45
China's military training and operational capabilities and competences
do not match US standards.46 PLAAF pilots fall short on the requirement
of executing sophisticated aerial maneuvers during unplanned
operations.47 [China's military structure presents significant cultural
challenges]{.underline},48 [as it emphasizes control above
command]{.underline}.49 [A culture of risk aversion and low levels of
trust in subordinates impacts the PLA effectiveness]{.underline}.50 A
highly centralized structure does not allow the PLAN to operate
autonomously during a war. Therefore, a political commissar is
positioned on PLAN warships and submarines.51 The USN values autonomy
from the individual to the institution, which reflects its emphasis on
commanding at sea.52 Nation states cannot project power globally through
a rigid command-and-control system.53 [PLAN submarines have the worst
safety record in the world]{.underline}.54 The PLAN's rudimentary
nuclear missile submarine fleet carries a limited number of missiles.55
The PLAN cannot threaten the US mainland, as its submarines will have to
sail through chokepoints such as the Kuriles and the Ryukyus islands,
Luzon Strait, Taiwan Strait, and the Philippine archipelago---all of
which are controlled by the USN.56 These chokepoints, forming a
crescent-shaped chain, are also a defensive line for US containment
policy; and the United States is involved in monitoring them. The PLAN
submarine power is outdated, compared to the overwhelming USN undersea
warfare capabilities. The US submarine arm brings strategic deterrence
to the Indo-Pacific through a wide array of capabilities such as
antisubmarine warfare antisurface warfare precision land strike;
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and special warfare
capabilities. Soviet weapon systems were much sought after by the United
States to learn their strengths and weaknesses. Numerous Soviet-made
fighter aircraft defected during the Cold War. An Iraqi MiG 21 defected
to Israel, while a Soviet MiG 25 landed in Japan. The aircraft were
later handed over to the United States to decipher the technical
details. However, US intelligence is not similarly orchestrating any
defections of PLAAF fighter aircraft, as the United States is not
interested in obsolete Chinese technology. Instead, China is stealing
weapon data or reverse engineering US weapon systems.57 The
CCP-controlled military press described the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark
fighter aircraft as a "flopping fish" and criticized it for lacking the
stealth capabilities of the F-35 Lightning.58 The US F-117 Nighthawk
stealth fighter entered service in 1983 and saw combat during the First
Gulf War, while the fifth-generation F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning
fighter aircraft have been deployed in conflict zones. However, the
PLAAF has not operationally inducted the J-31 fighter aircraft while the
J-20 fighter aircraft has not yet proven its capabilities in any
bilateral or multilateral military exercise. The much-hyped Chengdu J-20
is a heavy fighter aircraft comparable to the MiG 31, which is
essentially an interceptor and not a multirole or an air superiority
aircraft. China's Vulnerable A2/AD Zones A study of modern wars suggests
that [the United States will **decimate** China's military without
entering the A2/AD zone]{.underline}. This is how the United States
devastated Iraqi defenses in 1990. US strategic depth in Asia will allow
military planners to concentrate the military at different locations.
[The United States has a devastating array of lethal weapon
systems]{.underline}, such as submarines, [for countering China's A2/AD
strategies]{.underline}. During the First Gulf War, the United States
launched 297 Tomahawks, which destroyed the Iraqi military.59 Ohio-class
submarines can operate unhindered in the adversary's A2/AD zone closer
to the shore; thus, striking targets far inland. Collectively, four
Ohio-class submarines installed with 616 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise
missiles would obliterate China's military. The inexperienced PLAN AC
group will be destroyed by long-range antiship missiles (LRASM),
Tomahawks, and Mark 48-Mod 7 torpedoes launched from USS Key West, USS
Oklahoma City, USS Topeka, and USS Asheville submarines based in Guam.
The USN and USAF have signed a USD 414 million contract for autonomously
guided with onboard sensors, jam-resistant, and difficult to detect
antiship LRASM.60 The stealthy Zumwalt-class warship---equipped with
emerging technologies---can sail undetected in littoral waters and
contested territories to launch LRASM and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
China is constructing military bases on islands in the South China Sea;
however, this military infrastructure is vulnerable to US weapon
systems, as the islands lack natural defenses and camouflage.61 During a
war, the bases will be annihilated by the USN as the PLA cannot hide
behind hills and forests. Once destroyed, these facilities cannot be
supported from the mainland, as the logistical supplies will be
demolished by the USN. China's military modernization may enhance A2/AD
zones, but it does not contribute to a blue-water, sea-control
capability.62 [China's Hyped DF-21 Missile]{.underline} The antiship
DF-21 missile, carried by colossal transporter erector launchers, has a
range of 1,400 miles. The missile regiments are based in the barren Gobi
Desert, which makes it an easy target for the US military. [The DF-21
has been tested on a stationary ship, but it has not yet been
successfully tested against a moving target]{.underline}.63 A system of
systems is required to track the AC,64 acquire the precise location,
keep the missile locked on the target, penetrate the carrier's
multilayered defenses, and provide mid-course updates as within one hour
the ship will have moved 30 miles. China does not know about the DF-21
performance against the US CSG countermeasures.65 The United States and
Russia have not yet developed a missile equivalent to the DF-21.
However, China lacks the C4ISR systems to strike targets at that range.
China does not release the missile testing data, leading to many
questions, including whether it can hit moving targets. Does it have
precision targeting technologies?66 Until proven otherwise, [the
functionality of the missile is based on nothing but circumstantial
inference and speculation]{.underline}.

### No China War

#### **No US-China war**

**Lei 20** (Cui Lei, PhD and MA in International Politics, associate
research fellow with the China Institute of International Studies,
7-24-2020, \"Despite heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\",
*South China Morning Post*,
<https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk>)

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**
of all, [**deterrents** to a flare-up are]{.underline} much
**[strong]{.underline}**er [**in US-China relations** than in US-Soviet
relations]{.underline}. Although economic and people-to-people ties
between China and the US are declining, they are still close compared to
US-Soviet ties. [It is **hard to decouple** two **closely intertwined
economies** and **societies**.]{.underline} Take two examples. [China is
expected to become the world\'s **largest consumer market**, a
temptation **hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from
the US. And in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students**
study in the US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}. Many universities go to great lengths to woo
international students. Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology even sued the government over its new visa restrictions,
now aborted, on international students. [Second, **even if** there is
decoupling, the pain would **not be too great** and can be **kept out**
of the **national security sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In
fact, for national security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will
make both sides more secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's
information technology equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US
will be more relaxed. If China cannot get advanced technologies from the
US and its technological progress slows down, the US will be less
anxious. In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China. Economic decoupling is undeniably more
painful for China than for the US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which
was hit hard by the US oil embargo because of its lack of natural
resources, China has no such problems. Given its large domestic market,
losing the US as a major customer is not a disaster for China, and can
be compensated through more dynamic economic activities at home. China
can also make up for being freezed out of technological exchanges by
turning to indigenous innovation. As for the US, it can import goods
from other developing countries, albeit less cheaply. The relative loss
is acceptable when weighed against the heightened perception of economic
independence and security. [Third, the ideological confrontation between
China and the US is **less intense**]{.underline} than that during the
Cold War. Unlike the obsession with ideology in those days, [the line
between capitalism and socialism is **blurred** today. The **market
economy** has become **universally recognised** as the best way to
promote economic growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries
have embraced democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still
long for the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world,
[after **many years** of fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most
American people are **not interested** in promoting democracy
abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China just wants to **preserve its
political system** and has **no interest in exporting it** to other
countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological **antagonism** in
China-US relations can easily be **eased** by calculations of realistic
**interests**, which create conditions for **compromise and
cooperation**. **Fourth**, both China and the US have **many options
other than war** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While they
have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential
conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, [both countries are
**adept at operating in grey zones** and fighting psychological, public
opinion or diplomatic warfare **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate in
Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship. In
addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in the
US, the latter can **wield the stick of sanctions** when use of force is
**highly risky** or not worth it.]{.underline} [When both sides have
**many tools and options,** why would they **rush to war** to achieve
their goals? **Last**]{.underline} but not least, [the **imbalance of
power** will act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet
Union did not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was
not the case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union was at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, [a country
needs the **will to fight** before **going to war,** even if it is
stronger militarily than its adversary. Having fought **years of
meaningless wars**, the US is **weary of war**]{.underline}. [China,
too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US strength,
**especially** when its own economy is **slowing down** and it is facing
**various domestic challenges**]{.underline}, [China would **not wish**
to **recklessly start a war with the US**. In summary, the possibility
of a **hot war** between China and the US is **very
small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a cold or hot
confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation of the
momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

#### No SCS escalation -- China is taking calculated risks to avoid conflict 

**Nielsen 19** (Nicolai Fogth Gjøde Nielsen, holds a master's degree in
International Relations - European Studies and a bachelor's degree in
Language and International Studies, both of which were obtained from
Aalborg University in Denmark. "How China Avoids War in the South China
Sea." The National Interest, The Center for the National Interest, 15
Jan. 2019,

WC)

[China has been able to avoid an all-out conflict in the region by
taking only small bursts of actions that are unlikely to cause any
detrimental fallout from neighboring countries.]{.underline} [This
strategy of **below-the-threshold expansion** allows China to acquire
strategic territories]{.underline}, **[since Chinese actions are
calibrated to avoid full-on war]{.underline}**, [despite very negative
responses from its neighbors]{.underline}. Russia's President Vladimir
Putin, as an exception, has expressed his support for China's
territorial claims, stating that Russia does not recognize the fact that
the Court of Arbitration ruled against the Chinese claim of the Spratly
Islands, nor that China has violated the sovereign rights of the
Philippines by intervention.

Despite the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration[, the outcome
ultimately is in China's favor, as a bilateral agreement between China
and the Philippines enables China to retain the artificially built
islands**. This is just one example of a case that highlights China's
growing confidence and influence in the region**]{.underline}. This is
arguably a long-term gain for Beijing since China has built artificial
islands in the disputed areas and restricted access for Filipino
fishermen and oil exploration vessels even inside the Philippines' own
exclusive economic zone.

[China is likely trying to gain enough influence in the region to
challenge and push out the United States completely from the South China
Sea. Beijing does not try to provoke a war with its neighbors as it
would be too costly and counterproductive]{.underline}. [This is
especially because the cost of a war with America and its East Asian
allies would not be worth the potential territorial gains]{.underline}.
[Instead, China is operating from a **rational standpoint** and conducts
its actions based on **calculated consideration of the
consequences**]{.underline}. At the same time, it is increasingly
evident that China is not interested in maintaining the pro-American
current status quo in the regional balance of power.

### China Not Revisionist

#### China [isn't revisionist]{.underline}

**McKinney and Butts 19** (Jared Morgan McKinney, PhD candidate at the
S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological
University (Singapore). Nicholas Butts, Center for Strategic and
International Studies Pacific Forum Young Leader, "Bringing Balance to
the Strategic Discourse on China's Rise", *Journal of Indo-Pacific
Affairs*, pg. 75-76, 2019,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/JIPA/journals/Volume-02_Issue-4/McKinney.pdf>)

In the abstract, such claims are alarming---in context, and in balance,
rather humdrum. In fact, [the **evidence** of a]{.underline}ny [Chinese
intention to]{.underline} destroy, or even merely
**[undermine]{.underline}** and exploit, [the current order is
**slight**]{.underline}. [China **is**]{.underline} certainly [using
its]{.underline} growing [military power to **defend** its **claims in
the SCS**]{.underline} and even---on occasion--- to coerce its
neighbors. [It uses **protectionist**]{.underline} economic
**[policies]{.underline}** to boost the prospects of Chinese companies
and reduce competition. [It employs **economic statecraft**]{.underline}
to serve its interests abroad. And it certainly is opposed to America's
policy of global democracy promotion. [However, **none** of these
positions **fundamentally challenge the existing order**, **none** of
them **radically depart** from America's **own actions** when it was a
**rising power**]{.underline} in the nineteenth century, [and none of
them **obviously surpass** America's **own contemporary record** of
**order subversion**]{.underline}.

When [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates was a rising
power, it [took **half of Mexico**]{.underline} [and **considered taking
the rest**,]{.underline} [it **colonized** the **Philippines** and
**Hawaii**]{.underline}, [and it **unilaterally seized** the **maritime
choke points of the Caribbean**]{.underline} (Puerto Rico and Cuba).21
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [used
**tariffs**]{.underline}---which by 1857 averaged 20 percent22 and by
the end of the nineteenth century were "the highest import duties in the
industrial world"23---[to **protect its industries**]{.underline}. [It
**stole intellectual property**]{.underline},24 [and]{.underline} it
[**ideologically challenged** the governments of the "Old
World."]{.underline} Today, despite no longer being a rising power, [the
U]{.underline}nited [States has launched]{.underline} two **[disastrous
invasions]{.underline}**, **[tortured prisoners]{.underline}**, [and
dispatches **drone strikes at a whim** with **little international legal
authority**]{.underline}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make a
right; it is that [international order is **much more resilient** than
**critics seem to realize**]{.underline},26 [and it is **utopian** to
expect any **rising Great Power** to act in a way that **uniformly
satisfies** one's **moral scruples**,]{.underline} evolving, in
Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible' status quo
power."27

Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took place in the
context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but the more
important point is that the long nineteenth century (1815--1914)---the
era of America's rise---was the first iteration of the New Peace.28 The
implication is that [relative peace **can** and **has** **coexist**ed
with **limited wars**, **property** and **territorial thefts**, acts of
**coercion**, and **aggressive assertions of status.** This does not
mean any of these are **desirable**]{.underline}--- they are [not---but
it shows that they **need not be fatal to the system**]{.underline}.
[Insofar as there **is** a lesson from that **first period** of
**relative peace**, it is that **Great Power confrontation** is the
**one thing that is fatal**]{.underline}. [Accepting this does not mean
**capitulating** in **every instance**, as implied by
some]{.underline},29 [but it **does** mean **rediscovering** the rules
of **Great Power competition**]{.underline}30 alongside the art of
strategy.31

Focusing only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the
established powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which [China,
**has**]{.underline}, in fact, [**conformed** to the **existing
order.**]{.underline} As a RAND Corporation report published in 2018
concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a conditional one---of
the international order: "Since [China undertook a **policy of
international engagement**]{.underline} in the 1980s ... the level and
quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most other
states."32 The way in which **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping, following his
2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [has been heralded as the
**most prominent champion of international order** and **defender of
globalization**]{.underline} underscores the fact that [there are
**different elements** of this order, and that China supports **many**,
if not **most, of them**]{.underline}. [Even in places where China is
**supposedly "altering"** the current order, Beijing tends to
simultaneously **affirm that order**]{.underline}. [China's Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank]{.underline}, for instance, actually
**[mirrors existing structures]{.underline}**, and China has
intentionally copied elements and "best practices" of the World Bank and
Asian Development Bank. [China is **playing the same game**, even if it
is **seeking a bigger role within it**]{.underline}.33

### War Turns DA

#### War turns the DA\-\--a new conflict is a [significant drain]{.underline} on [all]{.underline} military resources

Opportunity cost #4: [**Managing a war** saps U.S. **focus and
diplomatic energy**]{.underline}. [While the United States is a global
power, it does not have endless capacity]{.underline}. [Inevitably, the
attention of high-level policymakers is focused on the highest-priority
concerns]{.underline}--- and as long as the [war]{.underline} in
Afghanistan continues, it [will]{.underline} rightly [garner significant
attention and resources from all sectors of the U.S.
government]{.underline}. [When it comes foreign policy priorities,
urgency outweighs importance, so regular decisions about the war require
the highest-level attention at the White House, the State Department,
and the DOD]{.underline}. [For the senior-most national security
officials, time is precious, and dedicating enough time to issues such
as climate change or China can be **crowded out by the need for regular,
high-level engagement on life-or-death decisions**]{.underline} in
Afghanistan.

#### Specifically, undermines Asian deterrence

• Opportunity cost #5: Two decades of military conflict have eroded U.S.
military readiness. [While the U.S. military has global
responsibilities, it has finite resources, and nothing drains U.S.
military readiness like an active war]{.underline}, as made clear by the
2017 report of a Task Force on Defense Personnel co-chaired by former
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and former National Security
Adviser James Jones.39 For the Pentagon, [prosecuting]{.underline} the
[war]{.underline} in Afghanistan [is a top-level priority that
**requires significant time** from its top officials as well as
tremendous resources]{.underline}---[from regular rotations of thousands
of personnel to equipment to budget expenditures]{.underline}. [With
pressing needs to bolster U.S. force posture in Asia and Europe to deter
threats from Russia and China]{.underline} and adapt the military to
emerging threats such as cybersecurity, [the U.S. military will have a
difficult time dedicating the necessary attention and resources to these
threats while **fighting an indefinite war**]{.underline} with roughly
14,000 troops in Afghanistan.
