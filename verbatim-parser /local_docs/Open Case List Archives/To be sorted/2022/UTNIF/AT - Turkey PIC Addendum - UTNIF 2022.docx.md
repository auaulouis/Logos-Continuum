A month ago, Washington hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu
and signaled a new bilateral strategic dialogue. This included possible
sales of F-16's to Ankara, symbolically ending the bitter dispute over a
Turkish Russian missile purchase, and Washington's subsequent cutting
Turkey from the F-35 program. Turkey was also following analogous
rapprochement with Arab states, Israel, Greece, and Armenia, and now
plays a central role in the Ukrainian conflict providing weapons,
closing the Straits to Russian naval reinforcements and pressing on
various diplomatic exchanges. Then almost overnight Ankara lashed out
against Finland and Sweden, threatening to block their NATO accession if
they did not cut real and alleged ties to the PKK, and followed up with
the aforementioned threats in Syria and escalation in the Aegean.
Predictably, American commentators reacted vigorously, even suggesting
once again for Turkey to be thrown out of NATO.

Shifting attitudes toward Turkey

Such dramatic flips in Turkish policy, gelding any predictable
diplomacy, have become a hallmark of both Turkish president Erdogan and
the convoluted internal political system with his party, dependent on an
extremist nationalist partner. Such flips also make efforts to resolve
issues such as those above (let alone the underlying rift between Ankara
and NATO allies), a high-risk endeavor which most Western leaders avoid,
writing Turkey off as a lost cause. But [as Ukraine has demonstrated,
Turkey is vital to containing Russia, as it has been to NATO's nuclear
deterrence, missile defense against Iran, operations in the Balkans, and
Afghanistan. It is just too big, too important, and at times too
problematic to ignore.]{.underline}

While [the Ukraine conflict]{.underline} is now generating strife
between Turkey and NATO over Scandinavian accession, it also [offers a
chance to improve relations between them.]{.underline} That conflict
resembles nothing seen since the late 1930s and immediate post-war
period, with the very survival of the world order at stake. [Winning
this conflict, by maintaining Ukraine's survival as an independent state
and deterring new Russian aggression, while avoiding escalation into the
unknown, is a categorical imperative not experienced since the Cold
War.]{.underline} While this is true of the Alliance as a whole, it is
[especially relevant for Turkey, a front line state with a long history
under Russian pressure.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [experience shows Turkey can be cooperative. The Bush
administration worked well with Turkey on counter-PKK operations, and
the Obama administration negotiated a NATO anti- Iranian ballistic
missile radar deployment.]{.underline} The 2019 Pence-Erdogan ceasefire
in Northeast Syria still holds despite Turkish threats, and the [two
capitals handled well President Biden's acknowledgment of Armenian
genocide.]{.underline} And, ironically, [despite deep geostrategic
hostility and recent military clashes, Russia and Turkey maintain
productive presidential-level relations, with Putin and especially
Erdogan usually following a 'no-surprises' principle.]{.underline}

#### Turkey-NATO military partnerships are necessary and successful. Turkey is KEY to NATO military ops.

Relations in a Turbulent Environment: The Military Dimension of
NATO-Turkey Relations", NATO-Turkey Relations Policy Brief, Beyond the
Horizon ISSG, December 2020,
<https://behorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NATO-Turkey-Relations-Policy-Brief_Beyond-the-Horizon-ISSG.pdf>)

Unlike political turmoil, [military relations between Turkey and NATO
are on track. What most analysts agree about is that there is no
shrinkage of Turkish military contribution to NATO. Turkey (still)
provides substantial contributions to the NATO and EU-led
operations.]{.underline} As Flanagan and Wilson point out \"engagement
slowed somewhat in the immediate months after the coup, almost 95 per
cent of planned operations and activities with US Army Europe forces
resumed the following year. In fact, the TSK \[TAF\] participated in ten
US Army Europe exercises during 2016, which was a significant increase
over previous years.\"

Along with these operations, [Turkey contributes to the NATO Response
Force (NRF) substantially]{.underline}, e.g. hosting an NRDC
Headquarters in Istanbul and [providing naval vessels to SNMG-2 and
SNMCMG-2 that are maritime components of the NRF.]{.underline}

More importantly, Turkey will resume the command of NATO\'s Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), the spearhead force of the NRF in
2021 and is expected to assign additional military headquarters
regarding NATO Readiness Initiative (NRI).16

[The active participation of Turkey is incoherent with harsh rhetoric of
both sides.]{.underline} In case, a Turkey, which is pivoting to the
East, is expected to diminish its contributions. Why doesn\'t Turkey
decouple from NATO at least to some extent? Conversely, [cooperation is
still increasing amidst tensions.]{.underline} For example, the Maritime
Security Centre of Excellence was accredited by NATO in June 2020. 17

[Turkish Armed Forces is amalgamated with NATO. Its broad participation
necessitates a deeper integration, i.e. interoperability and capacity to
conduct exercises, campaigns together with the other members of the
Alliance. Almost all Turkish assets, whether they are made indigenously
or exported, are produced according to NATO standards and contain
critical components that are imported from Western allies. Moreover,
maintenance and operating procedures, spare parts, technical manuals,
field manuals, signals, messaging standards are generated and maintained
as such, that requires a specific training and foreign language, i.e.
English, know-how, all of which takes a long time to
acquire.]{.underline}

NATO countries are Turkey\'s most critical foreign arms suppliers.
[Turkey imported/ordered all primary weapons from NATO countries between
2016-2019 except for a training aircraft from Pakistan and S-400 system,
that is an extraordinary one with a top-down order]{.underline} as Egeli
points out.18 For instance, [Turkey is the number one customer for the
German defence industry]{.underline}, accounting one-third of German
arms exports.19

[Substantial Turkish commitments to NATO entities as well as the active
participation of TAF to the NATO missions and operations contradict with
the Turkish government\'s (domestic) political discourse and hardliners
in the Western community. This continuation indicates that traditional
tendencies are still in place when it comes to defence and security
priorities.]{.underline}

#### The plan's inclusion solves -- integrating Turkey into a unified NATO vision. Exclusion merely maintains squo conflict.

**Jeffrey 6/15** (James, Former ambassador to Iraq and Turkey, and
Special Envoy to the Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, \"The NATO
Accession Crisis Risks Final Collapse of the Alliance-Turkey
Relationship\" June 25, 2022,
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/nato-accession-crisis-risks-final-collapse-alliance-turkey-relationship)

A new course

[The first step out of this dilemma is for all sides to recognize that
with Russian aggression, they face a unique international situation that
requires subordination of all other priorities to the core
objective.]{.underline} That sort of wisdom, familiar to Churchill,
Roosevelt, Truman, military planners, and in a perverse way, Putin, has
largely faded in the West since 1989, replaced by what has become
conventional foreign policy thinking: nothing is critical and
innumerable factors compete for consideration, for example moral,
ideological, humanitarian, domestic, security, alliance, economic,
personal, or usually some triangulation of them.

[Both sides must prioritize vigorously containing Russia, seek
transactional deals on those issues between them that can be resolved,
and ignore the others.]{.underline}

In the impasse between Turkey and NATO, this [conventional thinking
encourages states, buffeted by various interests and negative voices
towards Turkey, to treat it as a second class, suspect member of the
alliance, while benefiting from its extraordinary NATO contributions.
But conventional thinking also pushes Ankara, with its domestic
pressures, to see the Ukrainian crisis as simply another opportunity to
extort Europe over Turkey's second-class status, EU accession, arms
sales, and specific issues such as the PKK and the Aegean. Both sides
thus must prioritize vigorously containing Russia, seek transactional
deals on those issues between them that can be resolved, and ignore the
others. In short, accepting partners as they are, not as they should
be.]{.underline}

The immediate challenge is NATO accession. Here Turkey has to blink
first and recognize that the stakes, not just stopping Russia but
preserving its own relations with NATO, require accepting half a loaf
(not always an Erdogan government trait). It cannot expect Sweden and
Finland to extradite people to a state whose legal system is under
continuous international criticism, nor for those countries to silence
freedom of expression, even when it is sympathetic to the terrorist PKK
cause. It should also be accepted that, while the fight against the PKK
is truly important to Turkish security, it is still secondary to Russia
advancing on its borders.

In return, Sweden should lift its ban on arms sales to Turkey (and the
US Congress the same with its informal ban, now impacting the F-16
sale). Finland and especially Sweden, given their long affinity for
"national liberation" movements, should cut official contacts with the
PKK and its fronts, recommit to Helsinki Final Act on noninterference in
others' internal affairs and give assurances they would cooperate in
NATO on issues important to Turkey.

[Turkey's partners should continue counseling it against a new incursion
into northern Syria. But if Turkey compromises by only attacking PKK
elements west of the Euphrates, away from US forces and the main
anti-ISIS effort, Washington's objections should be muted. Likewise,
partners should urge Turkey to stop overflying Greek territory, but
simultaneously speak out on provocative Greek policies.]{.underline}

While these steps can manage the immediate crises Turkey has launched,
[the longer-term solution, moving to a transactional relationship, needs
highest level US leadership. First, such a relationship requires dealing
with Erdogan; if Putin can do it with a geostrategic opponent, why
cannot American and European leaders with an ally, however difficult,
given the stakes.]{.underline} Second, the US needs someone at a very
senior level to complement the American ambassador as the
administration's Turkish file lead, not to communicate with the Turks
but to corral the undisciplined official and unofficial Washington
policy worlds. [That world can torpedo any foreign policy effort, but
doing so regarding Turkey is child's play in the absence of presidential
engagement and a Washington champion.]{.underline}

#### NATO-Turkey co-op is the only way to deter Russia in the Black Sea and the Middle East.

**Ellehuus 19** (Rachel, Deputy Director and Senior Fellow with Europe
Program @ Center for Strategic and International Studies, \"Turkey and
NATO: A Relationship Worth Saving\", Center for Strategic and
International Studies, December 12,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/turkey-and-nato-relationship-worth-saving>)

The first of these is [the Black Sea, where Turkey, as well as fellow
NATO Black Sea littoral states Romania and Bulgaria, are trying to
balance an increasing Russian military presence. While previously
resistant to a greater NATO role in the Black Sea for fear it would
dilute its own influence in the region, Turkey now sees the dangers of
leaving Russian influence and presence in Black Sea
unchecked.]{.underline} With its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014
and entry into the Syrian civil war in 2015, Russia has significantly
increased its presence and combat capabilities in both the Black Sea and
Eastern Mediterranean.

[NATO]{.underline} now [faces an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubble
that restricts allies' freedom of maneuver in the Black Sea, with Russia
capable of attacking from both land and sea.]{.underline} To effectively
counter this, [NATO should establish a more continuous presence in the
Black Sea, revive the idea of a permanent NATO maritime fleet in the
Black Sea, and consider basing more counter-A2/AD capabilities in Turkey
and Romania.]{.underline} Importantly, [Turkey holds unique power to
control access to the Black Sea thanks to the 1936 Montreux Convention,
which governs naval passage through the Turkish Straits,]{.underline}
limiting the number of foreign vessels that can enter the Black Sea via
the Straits and how long these vessels can stay. [This access is
important to both Russia and NATO. Whereas Turkey has proven to be an
impartial and reliable enforcer of the treaty, Russia has pushed the
boundaries of Montreux repeatedly since the Russo-Georgian War in 2008
and, more recently, impeded the course of NATO vessels that have entered
and departed the Black Sea in compliance with the treaty.]{.underline}
More behavior along these lines, or a Russian attempt to leverage its
new, closer relationship with Turkey to secure more favorable access to
the Black Sea, would likely increase Turkey's unease and lead it to rely
more on NATO as a counterbalance.

For its part, the European Union should closely watch Turkey's proposed
construction of the Istanbul Canal to connect the Black Sea to the Sea
of Marmara (and, as such, the Aegean and Mediterranean seas), which is
reportedly drawing interest from Chinese as well as Russian investors.
As the canal would allow ships to sail between the Mediterranean and
Black Sea without transiting the Turkish Straits, and thus abiding by
the restrictions of Montreux, [the European Union and United States
should consider investing in this infrastructure project to ensure they
are in a position to work with Turkey to ensure free and fair transit
through the canal.]{.underline}

A second area where Turkey's immediate security concerns intersect with
the majority of other NATO members is stability [in the Middle
East,]{.underline} most immediately in Syria. To be sure, Turkey's anger
over United States' partnership with the YPG in the fight against the
Islamic State---and NATO's anger at Turkey for its unilateral incursion
into northern Syria---will make progress difficult. But ultimately, [the
two sides share a mutual interest in seeing stability and pluralistic
governance in Syria.]{.underline} This entails [constraining Syrian
president Bashar al-Assad; preventing the return of the Islamic State
and Europe-based Islamic State fighters; and facilitating the delivery
of humanitarian aid, reconstruction, and refugee return.]{.underline}
More broadly, both sides also share an interest in limiting Russian and
Iranian influence in the region. [With the Russian military presence in
Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Crimea now supplemented by the Russian naval
base at Tartus, airbases at Kobani and Khmeimim, and helicopter base at
Qamishli, Turkey is effectively encircled by Russia.]{.underline} It is
in this context that German minister of defence Kramp-Karrenbauer's
suggestion of [an internationally-controlled security zone along the
Turkey-Syria border, possibly NATO-led and backed by the United Nations
in loose partnership with Russia, makes sense.]{.underline} It would
address a situation that immediately and directly affects the security
of Europe and Turkey and demonstrate that the NATO is invested in
addressing Turkey's security concerns.

[While the current standoff between Turkey and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [appears to be moving]{.underline} from bad [to
worse, **it has yet to reach** a breaking point or a **point of no
return.** Although tensions and policy differences continue to plague
US-Turkish relations, efforts by]{.underline} well-meaning
[policymakers]{.underline} within the US government and Turkey's
civilian and military establishment **[point to]{.underline}** perhaps
[**better days to come**, given the resilience and endurance of the
**ties that bind the two nations together**. The US perspective on
Turkey could be traced to many factors, starting with]{.underline} the
[refusal of]{.underline} the [Turkish Parliament to allow US forces to
transit Turkish territory to attack Iraq]{.underline} in 2003 and the
slow Turkish support for the US-led coalition against ISIS. [Turkey
is]{.underline} also [being put on notice by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [for feuding against other NATO
allies]{.underline}---namely, Germany, the Netherlands, Cyprus, France,
and Greece. In the last case, tensio[ns have been brewing in recent
months over]{.underline} new [border disputes in]{.underline} the Aegean
and the refusal of [Greece]{.underline} to extradite a group of Turkish
officers allegedly involved in the failed coup. Although resolving the
Cyprus issue remains high on the US agenda, [tensions between Turkey and
Cyprus over oil and gas exploration rights and access]{.underline} off
the coast of Cyprus [are forcing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the European Union to side with Cyprus and even
entertain sending US naval ships to protect Cypriot gas and oil tracks
at sea. [Despite these and other policy differences]{.underline} over
Syria and other domestic problems facing Turkey, [**both sides seem
reluctant to cause irreparable damage to their alliance**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which [has traditional ties
with Turkey, does not want a military confrontation]{.underline} with
the country over Syria. The most hopeful sign of addressing some of the
protracted problems currently facing US-Turkish relations stems from the
fact that [Turkey is still seen by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as important to America's national
security]{.underline} interests, especially [given Turkey's]{.underline}
geostrategic [location and]{.underline} cultural [familiarity with its
volatile neighbors. Turkey]{.underline} is currently self-absorbed with
its ambitions and Muslim neo-Ottoman nationalist revivalism, but its
unique ballot-box democracy, albeit imperfect by Western standards,
**[will work toward increasing harmonization toward the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its NATO allies in
the long run. This can only happen through a sustained strategic
dialogue.]{.underline}** The idea is to keep Turkey and the United
States engaged while trying to find solutions to the issues that
separate them, because once the current tactical posturing is stripped
away, the strategic alliance becomes more visible. [There
is]{.underline} indeed current [evidence for better US-NATO-Turkish
cross-cultural communication techniques to manage and
resolve]{.underline} outstanding [policy and strategic
differences.]{.underline} In short, [**Turkey is not yet lost**, but
there are challenges]{.underline} facing America and its NATO partners
in how to bridge the growing gap between them and Turkey. This challenge
touches on a fundamental question: What kind of strategic relation- ship
do the United States, NATO, and Turkey want or desire? Clearly, [they
are at a]{.underline} policy and strategic [cross- road.]{.underline}
The answer lies in the need for the United States to craft a new
strategy toward Turkey and vice versa that takes into account the new
realities of Turkish, NATO, and American domestic political dynamics,
their changing nature and character, as well as Tur- key's quest for
regional influence and ambitions and its goal of becoming a great
regional power. **[Turkey, NATO, and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**share Western values, and** **these
values**,]{.underline} although not equal for all partners, **[are keys
to better multicultural harmony if applied properly]{.underline}**
across the board.

In the recent decade, [the U.S. has pursued a strategy to
support]{.underline} armed [Kurdish groups]{.underline} to repel radical
Islamic terror groups, particularly ISIS. [Nevertheless, Turkey has
become increasingly concerned]{.underline} about the strengthening of
the Kurdish administration and its nationalist ambitions. [These
concerns are pushing Turkey into the arms of U.S. rivals]{.underline} in
the region. Both Iran and Russia are expanding their authority in the
region by establishing political and military support for radical
regimes such as Assad's in Syria and political and militant movements
like Hezbollah. These s[trategic policies are increasingly connecting
Iran's and Russia's allies in an ever-strengthening regional security
complex]{.underline}. Given these regional circumstances, [Turkey finds
itself flip-flopping between these rival regional security
complexes.]{.underline} The primary cause for current problems in
U.S.-Turkey relations is not simply the recent actions of the two
countries. The complex view of the IR system facilitates the
understanding that the [U.S.-Turkey relationship is shaped by the
feedback loops generated under]{.underline} both [regional and global
circumstances. The complexity of the international system can
trigger]{.underline} a dramatically [different evolution of relations
between U.S. and Turkey as a feedback (reaction]{.underline}) caused by
the U.S. For example, the U.S. does not hesitate to use methods like
arming the YPG, even if these methods hurt former allies such as Turkey.
As a result[, U.S.-Turkish relations continue to be vulnerable to the
U.S. approach toward]{.underline} minority, [rebel groups which have
problematic bonds with Turkey.]{.underline} The [international roles
that the U.S. and Turkey pursued]{.underline} for themselves in the
post-9/11 era have [had consequences for perceptions of]{.underline}
historical [friendship or hostilities]{.underline} -- what the Regional
Security Complex Theory ties to cooperative or non-cooperative behavior
of states. [There were hostility perceptions among Turkish]{.underline}
military and Foreign Service [chiefs in the wake of the collapse of the
Soviet Union]{.underline} when the U.S. sought to maintain its global
supremacy role. Given its resources, the [U.S. cannot help but be
superior to smaller,]{.underline} poorer [states that do not have
Washington's military capacity. The issue is the way]{.underline} in
which [the U.S. dominates]{.underline} -- that is, [its treatment of its
allies, not considering their strategic]{.underline} security
[concerns]{.underline}, etc. Turkey was deeply concerned with events in
northern Iraq following the 1991 Iraq war. These events amounted to
challenge Turkey's priority of preventing the emergence of an
independent Kurdish administration in northern Iraq. [The hostility
perceptions in Turkey turned to be reciprocal between the U.S. and
Turkey]{.underline} thanks to the feedback loops generated by the 9/11
attacks. The unilateral U.S. reaction to the 9/11 attacks during the
Bush administration undermined the U.S.-led liberal international order
and played no small role in the inauguration of Trump as a president who
questions this order and views local U.S. allies as burdens on the U.S.
[If we acknowledge that the complexity of the i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [system is at play]{.underline} here, the causal
logic of the [complexity approach leads us to expect that Turkey's
internal characteristics can pressure systemic
transformation]{.underline} -- something other than the predictions
generated by the regional security complex approach.83 [A U.S. that
operates with a systemic moral conscience could assist Turkey in
managing its affairs. Facing complexity **invokes improving diplomacy
and collaboration, adopting multilateral solutions**]{.underline} and
soft power **[and constructing]{.underline}** some [**advanced strategic
partnerships**. If the U.S. chooses to nurture its relationships with
allies such as Turkey, the erosion of the U.S.]{.underline} position of
[influence could be mitigated]{.underline} and the U.S. still could be
the primary actor in maintaining stability in the Middle East. The
underlying message of this paper is that [**the U.S. and Turkey are
rebuilding their alliance due to various factors.** Both **countries
could form a revised alliance as an important constituent of the
regional peace system.** Neither]{.underline} of them
[desire]{.underline}s the [continuation of the]{.underline} Syrian
[chaotic status-quo and its accompanying insecurity]{.underline} nor do
they desire Iran to dominate with a greater role in Syria or in the
Middle East. Clearly, [the security of the region is in]{.underline} a
state of greater [flux]{.underline} today than it has been in the past,
yet **[tackling the present challenges]{.underline}** in the Middle East
**[depends on the effective involvement of regional U.S.
partners.]{.underline}**

### Kickout Bad -- Turkey PIC -- 2AC

#### The West needs Turkey, despite its constraints.

**Hess 6/22** (Maximilian, Central Asia fellow @ the Foreign Policy
Research Institute, "Why the West Should Make Peace With Erdogan Now",
Foreign Policy, June 22, 2022,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/22/turkey-erdogan-ukraine-russia-war-west-us-geopolitics-black-sea-europe-energy/>)

However, [the reality is that the West needs Erdogan more than ever.
Russia's]{.underline} brutal, [all-out war against Ukraine has vastly
raised Turkey's profile on the geostrategic chessboard. Ankara has
emerged as a key supplier of drones to Kyiv---shipments it has luckily
shown no intention of halting. Ukraine's chances of victory would be
significantly improved if Turkish arms deliveries were
expanded.]{.underline} Erdogan, who controls access to the Black Sea
through the Turkish Straits, crucially shut the passage to warships in
late February.

At the same time, [Ankara has also been willing to cooperate with Moscow
on Ukraine where Erdogan sees an opportunity.]{.underline} Turkish
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu discussed plans to secure a route for
Ukrainian grain exports with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in
Ankara on June 8, reportedly asking for a 25 percent discount on Turkish
grain purchases as part of the deal. Without Ankara on board, any
Western proposals to break the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports are
dead on arrival.

[The West also needs Turkey on its side in the economic war against
Russia. Ankara's support alone can restrict the flow of sanctioned
Russian goods in and out of the Black Sea, which continue even as
Ukrainian ships are stuck in port.]{.underline} Ankara's help is crucial
in cutting ratlines for Russian money and kleptocrats. [Turkey has
become a major destination for Russian money]{.underline} (and
oligarchs' yachts) [fleeing sanctions and plays a growing role in
supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's new autarkic
economy.]{.underline} Turkey is one of the few major countries that
freely accept Russian payment, [undercutting the impact of Western
banking sanctions. Bringing Turkey onboard would plug one of the largest
holes in the sanctions regime.]{.underline}

Russia's brutal, all-out war against Ukraine has vastly raised Turkey's
profile on the geostrategic chessboard.

But most importantly, [Turkey will be a key player in the reordering of
European energy supplies, not least because it controls energy access
through a number of crucial pipelines.]{.underline} The key to Europe's
Southern Gas Corridor strategy, for example, is gas from Azerbaijan
supplied via Turkey's Trans-Anatolian and Trans-Adriatic
pipelines---inaugurated in 2018 and 2020, respectively---and feeding
into the European gas grid in the Balkans and Italy.

[Erdogan is also actively seeking to develop Turkey's own gas resources
and potentially even link Israeli and Cypriot offshore gas fields to the
European pipeline network. Such efforts are of course complicated by
Greco-Turkish disputes over Cyprus and its surrounding waters. A revived
European-Turkish partnership may be the only way the Eastern
Mediterranean's rich energy resources can be fully
utilized.]{.underline} Such a partnership might also nudge Erdogan to
make an about-face vis-à-vis Russia, where the inauguration of the
TurkStream pipeline in 2020 signaled a new high point in Turkish-Russian
relations.

Finally, [aligning with Erdogan would offer the West more geostrategic
leverage over the Kremlin beyond the war in Ukraine. Turkey is also a
key player in three additional conflicts where Russia is involved:
Syria, Libya, and the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh.]{.underline} Erdogan moved from a policy of benign
neglect to active intervention in these conflicts over the past decade,
[motivated by a desire to boost Turkey's role as a regional power
independent of the West. A resumed partnership with Erdogan offers
further pressure points in the effort to constrain Moscow's global
influence.]{.underline}

#### Turkey kickout collapses deterrence -- laundry list of wars.

**Pry 19** (Peter, Chief of Staff of the Congressional EMP Commission
and served on the staff of the House Armed Services Committee and @ the
CIA, \"Expelling Turkey from NATO would create a dangerous foe\", The
Hill, October 23,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/466747-expelling-turkey-from-nato-would-create-a-dangerous-foe/)

[President Trump ](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/)is right to
[try to accommodate Turkey's legitimate security interests on the Syrian
border]{.underline}, while protecting the Kurds, in order [to keep
Turkey in NATO.]{.underline} 

After the United States, [Turkey has the second-largest standing armed
forces in NATO, with more soldiers]{.underline} (639,000 military,
paramilitary and civilian personnel), [tanks]{.underline} (3,200),
[armored fighting vehicles]{.underline} (9,500), [artillery]{.underline}
(2,400) [and military aircraft]{.underline} (1,067 fighter jets, attack
helicopters and transports) [than Germany, France or the United
Kingdom.]{.underline} Turkey's navy comprises 194 ships, mostly
frigates, corvettes and coastal gunships but including 12 submarines.

Some analysts evaluate [Turkey as among the most militarily powerful
nations, ranking ninth among 137 military powers worldwide.]{.underline}

Do we really want to kick Turkey out of NATO and have its military power
and strategic geography aligned with Russia?

Geographically, [Turkey occupies some of the
most [strategically](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Turkeys-Strategic-Geographical-Location-In-The-World-FK49ZEYTJ) important
territory in the world. It is the only NATO member state in the Middle
East, bordering Syria and Iraq, near Lebanon and Israel, a region that
has been --- and continues to be --- the crucial crossroads of empire
and history since biblical times.]{.underline} Turkey controls the
Bosporus Straits, Marmara Sea and Dardanelles Straits between the Black
Sea and the Mediterranean, giving it the capability to contain Russia's
powerful [Black Sea
Fleet](https://warontherocks.com/2018/07/is-a-new-russian-black-sea-fleet-coming-or-is-it-here/).
Turkey's geographic location and strong military makes it [the anchor of
NATO's southern flank against Russian aggression.]{.underline}

[Turkey also is an unsinkable aircraft carrier, with 98 airports capable
of supporting NATO air operations]{.underline} over the Middle East,
Black Sea and the Balkans.

It is [one of only five NATO states]{.underline} (the others being
Germany, Italy, Belgium and The Netherlands) [storing U.S. tactical
nuclear weapons on its territory.]{.underline} Some 50 B-61 nuclear
bombs are bunkered at Incirlik Air Force Base, controlled by U.S.
personnel stationed there. 

Washington's foreign policy elites are so fixated on recent
Kurdish [contributions](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/flashback-how-us-backed-kurds-defeated-isis-in-kobani-syria/) to
defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) that [they seem to have forgotten
Turkey's much longer record as an ally of the U.S. and
NATO:]{.underline} 

- Turkey fought alongside the U.S. during the [Korean War]{.underline}
  (1950-1953).

- During the [early Cold War]{.underline}, Turkey agreed to basing U.S.
  nuclear bombers and IRBMs on its territory, making Turkey a nuclear
  target for the USSR. (President Kennedy was able to avoid nuclear war
  with the Soviet Union and resolve the October 1962 [Cuban missile
  crisis](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis) by
  secretly promising Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to remove the U.S.
  IRBMs.)

- Turkey joined the U.S. and NATO in [bombing Bosnia during [Operation
  Deliberate
  Force](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/issue3/english/history.html)]{.underline} (1995). 

- Turkey joined the U.S. and NATO in [bombing Serbia during [Operation
  Allied
  Force](https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/allied-force.html)]{.underline} (1999).

- Turkey participated in [Baltic Sea air patrols demonstrating support
  for the NATO Baltic states]{.underline} (2006).

- For years and continuing today, Turkish forces have participated in
  [NATO peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo.]{.underline}

- Turkey provided [military and intelligence support to U.S. operations
  that destroyed the ISIS terrorist "caliphate."]{.underline}

[Turkey's membership in NATO quelled the long cycle of conflicts and
wars with Greece]{.underline}, also a NATO member. Significantly, [even
Turkey's controversial [invasion of Cyprus in
1974](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_3866000/3866521.stm) did
not trigger a war with Greece, in no small part because both are NATO
members.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [Turkey under President Erdogan is abandoning secularism
and democratic norms, becoming an Islamist authoritarian state, and
pulling away from the U.S. and NATO.]{.underline} Indeed, [Erdogan is
beginning to align Turkey with Russia, buying Russian military equipment
over U.S. objections.]{.underline}

[Erdogan even has threatened to develop nuclear weapons, which justifies
withdrawing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Turkey.]{.underline} Yet
[Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel and other Middle East allies all
have legitimate fear of Iran developing nuclear missiles, so threatened
nuclear proliferation by Turkey and others may be a sign of U.S. failure
to uphold its alliance obligations through credible extended nuclear
deterrence and other means.]{.underline}

Turkey controls the flow of Middle Eastern refugees into European NATO,
a crucial role whereby a friendly Turkey can help stabilize its
neighbors --- or an unfriendly Turkey could unleash a human flood into
Europe. 

[Israel, too, will be better served if Turkey remains in NATO and, thus,
a moderating influence on Islamist Erdogan, who eventually may be
replaced by a secular leader.]{.underline} Imagine the threat to U.S.
and Israeli interests if Turkey leaves NATO and becomes another Islamist
rogue state like Iran. 

[Turkey's withdrawal from NATO may, or may not, be historically
inevitable. But the United States should do everything possible to keep
such a valuable ally in NATO and prevent Turkey from becoming a
dangerous foe.]{.underline}

Reason Turkey Will Never Voluntarily Leave NATO\", American Enterprise
Institute - AEI, May 26, 2022,
<https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-real-reason-turkey-will-never-voluntarily-leave-nato/>)

Turkey does not belong in NATO, but [there is no formal mechanism to
expel wayward members. At a minimum, Erdogan gets power by forcing the
United States and other NATO members on one hand, and Russia on the
other to bid for its support.]{.underline} Erdogan's animosity toward
the United States is famous, however. [If ideology rather than material
gain motivates him, however, he gains more from being a Trojan horse in
the consensus-governed alliance than from voluntarily exiting
it.]{.underline}

Back to Mitsotakis: the power of the maps he provided in his meetings
cannot be overstated. There have been hundreds of Turkish violations of
Greek airspace. Such violations are not neutral: Turkey cannot provide
any instance of Greek violations of its airspace or unsanctioned
overflights of its territories. After the United States began utilizing
the port of Alexandroupolis, Turkey began violating airspace over that
location as well. Turkey has also threatened military force against the
Greek island of Kastellorizo.

This brings up a tricky problem. Whenever Turkey ratchets up tensions
with Greece, diplomats seek to defuse tension, and analysts and
journalists talk about the possibility of war between two NATO members.
The dynamics, however, change considerably when Turkey leaves NATO. [Any
attack on Kastellorizo, Mytilene, Chios, Samos, Ikaria, or any other
Greek territory would trigger NATO Article 5 which stated that if any
NATO ally is a victim of an armed attack, it is akin to an attack on
every member of the alliance and all members will respond accordingly.
Simply put, inside NATO, Turkey can be a bully and get away with its
behavior. Outside NATO, however, Erdoǧan would face real consequences
for his actions.]{.underline}

[Erdogan likes to project an image of power but as even the Turkish
people have come to realize, he is in reality a thin-skinned coward.
After multiple purges, the Turkish army is today like Russia's a shell
of its former self. Erdogan will remain in NATO against all pressure
otherwise because to agree to go his own way would be to expose Turkey
for its true weakness.\\]{.underline}

#### Turkish economic interests force them to stay in NATO.

Now, it\'s interesting since these embassies put out statements saying
they won\'t be interfering in Turkey\'s internal affairs. Does it appear
that they were pressured into backing down over this case?

No, I would actually say the opposite. I think [this is a step back for
President Erdoğan. It\'s the first time he\'s stepping down away from
confrontation because he actually threatened to expel these
ambassadors.]{.underline} He said it was a done deal over the weekend.
And of course, now I think that [his administration has walked back the
stated policy. These ambassadors look like they won\'t be
expelled.]{.underline} So, this is one of the first instances we see
Erdoğan is stepping down in the face of a united front of Western
countries --- US and European countries acting together. It\'s quite
significant. Erdoğan, I think in recent years, has benefited from a
strongman image domestically, and a step back, of course, would be [a
big dent in his strongman image.]{.underline}

Turkey\'s relationship with the US and other Western nations has been
strained for some time over a variety of issues. Is this kind of
back-and-forth the new normal between Turkey and the West?

Yes and no. So, the assumption was that in recent months, Erdoğan had
launched the charm offensive and as a resource-poor country, [Turkey
needs international investment to return growth. So, Erdoğan has been,
for about a year now, on his best behavior toward Europe because of deep
economic ties with it and also toward the United States, toward
President Biden. He wants to create a narrative of good ties with Biden
in order for markets to have confidence to invest in Turkey
again.]{.underline}

Turkey\'s currency is also weathering a crisis as it continues to
depreciate. What\'s behind the falling Turkish lira and what\'s the
government\'s role in this?

\... largely economic mismanagement, erratic policies that Erdoğan
detests interest rates or high interest rates, and Turkey has quite high
inflation, so that has to be matched with high interest rates, but
obviously, he\'s voting against those policies, and there has been a lot
of change at the helm of economic policies.

Is the depreciating Turkish lira going to affect Erdoğan\'s position at
home?

Big time. Big time. And I think the reason why [Erdoğan did not follow
up with his threat to expel 10 Western ambassadors is because he was
told by his advisers that if Turkey had a rupture in its ties with its
most important economic partners --- European countries --- it would not
only destroy the country\'s economy, but it would destroy what remains
of Erdoğan\'s base.]{.underline}

**NYT 11** "Talking Truth to NATO"¶ Published: June 10, 2011
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/opinion/11sat1.html?\_r=0

[America's key strategic alliance throughout the cold war is in **far
deeper trouble**]{.underline} [than most members admit. The Atlantic
allies face a **host** of new and old dangers. **Without
more**]{.underline} and wiser **[European military
spending]{.underline}** --- on equipment, training, surveillance and
reconnaissance --- **[NATO faces]{.underline}**, as Mr. Gates rightly
warned, "**[a dim if not dismal future" and]{.underline}** even
"**[irrelevance]{.underline}**."¶ The secretary is retiring at the end
of this month, which is likely one of the reasons he jettisoned the
diplomatic niceties. But not the only one. As he made clear, [this
country can no longer afford to do a disproportionate share of NATO's
fighting and pay a disproportionate share of its bills while Europe
slashes its defense budgets and free-rides on the collective security
benefits.¶]{.underline} [NATO's **shockingly wobbly** performance over
Libya, after the Pentagon handed off leadership, should leave **no
doubt** about the Europeans' weaknesses]{.underline}. And while
America's NATO partners now have 40,000 troops in Afghanistan (compared
with about 99,000 from the United States), many have been hemmed in by
restrictive rules of engagement and shortages of critical equipment. Too
many are scheduled for imminent departure.¶ [The free-rider
problem]{.underline} is an old one but [has gotten]{.underline} even
**[worse]{.underline}** [over the last two decades]{.underline}. During
most of the cold war, the United States accounted for 50 percent of
total NATO military spending; today it accounts for 75 percent. Mr.
[Gates was right when he warned of America's dwindling patience with
allies "unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the
necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own
defense."¶]{.underline} [Decades of **underinvestment**]{.underline},
**[poor spending]{.underline}** choices [and **complacent
denial**]{.underline} about new challenges [have created]{.underline}
what Mr. Gates called [a "two-tiered alliance]{.underline}." He is right
that [too many of its members limit themselves to "humanitarian,
development, peacekeeping and talking tasks," and too few are available
for the combat missions the alliance as a whole has agreed to
assume]{.underline}.¶ Libya, a mission much more directly linked to the
security of Europe than of the United States, strikingly illustrates the
consequences.¶ [Fewer than half of NATO's]{.underline} 28 [members are
taking part]{.underline} in the military mission. Fewer than a third are
participating in the all-important airstrikes. British and French
aircraft carry the main burden. Canada, Belgium, Norway and Denmark,
despite limited resources, have made outsized contributions. Turkey,
with the alliance's second-largest military, has remained largely on the
sidelines. Germany, NATO's biggest historic beneficiary, has done
nothing at all.¶ [Even fully participating members have failed to train
enough targeting specialists to keep all of their planes flying sorties
or to buy enough munitions to sustain a bombing campaign much beyond the
present 11 weeks.¶]{.underline} T[hat should frighten every defense
ministry in Europe. What if they had to fight a more formidable enemy
than Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's fractured dictatorship?¶]{.underline}
Combat is not always the best or only solution. [NATO needs those
European development and peacekeeping capabilities]{.underline}. All
[alliance members must]{.underline} also [have at least the basic
military capacities to meet common threats.]{.underline} [Without that,
the alliance will grow **increasingly hollow** --- a fact that enemies
**will not miss**.¶]{.underline} Mr. Gates was right to speak out. We
hope his likely successor, Leon Panetta, will keep pushing hard. [A
two-tiered military alliance is really no alliance at all.]{.underline}

#### Collapse spurs EU shift -- solves, avoids defence cuts which thump NATO

Doug **Bandow**, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute , 4/22/**13**
"NATOs Lack of Any Serious Purpose Means It Should Retire"
<http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/natos-lack-any-serious-purpose-means-it-should-retire>

[The most plausible continuing NATO role is to train the militaries of
friendly nations to empower them to handle military contingencies in
their own neighborhoods. But that doesn't require a formal military
alliance constantly looking for new wars to fight. The biggest challenge
facing the alliance is shrinking national force structures.]{.underline}
The NATO visitor acknowledged that "all Europeans are cutting their
militaries, including the big spenders." Defense Secretaries Robert
Gates and Leon Panetta both lamented Europe's waning efforts. NATO
Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently admitted: "[if European
defense spending cuts continue, Europe's ability to be a stabilizing
force even in its neighborhood will **rapidly disappear**." There's no
reason to believe the reductions won't continue]{.underline}. Last year
the Brookings Institution published a report reviewing widespread
cutbacks across the continent. Explained Clara Marina O'Donnell:
"[current military spending trends are **reducing the ability of** most
NATO **allies to contribute to international security."** Troop numbers
are coming down sharply.]{.underline} Moreover, recently reported Stars
and Stripes, "Cuts by countries as large as Germany and as small as
Latvia have resulted in program cancellations, changed equipment orders
and, in the case of Britain, a plan to mothball a new aircraft carrier."
Earlier this year Rasmussen declared that "There is a lower limit on how
little we can spend on defense." Where is it? [In 2006 the NATO members
promised to spend two percent of GDP on the military. Today the
Europeans collectively spend 1.5 percent of GDP on defense, compared to
America's five percent.]{.underline} Americans spend \$2333 per person
on the military, compared to just \$503 by Europeans. Despite the
much-maligned budget sequester, Washington continues to account for
roughly 40 percent of the entire globe's military outlays. The visiting
official recognized the problem. If we take Secretary [Gates'
formulation "that **NATO is dead if members don't spend two percent of
GDP**, then NATO is dead as they will not spend two percent of
GD]{.underline}P." Thus, he complained that "focusing burden-sharing on
finances doesn't get us anywhere." Instead, he suggested giving
"burden-sharing a different spin." He argued that despite Europe's
diminishing commitment to the alliance, America still benefited. "The
European allies may be useless for many things, but they still provide
legitimacy and the continent acts as a worldwide operational hub."
However, that legitimacy is of little account if Washington believes a
vital issue to be at stake. [The American people]{.underline} don't
care; they [will support their government even in the face of widespread
international opposition, evident in Vietnam and Iraq, for
instance]{.underline}. What turned the U.S. public against these wars
were the reality of casualties and the perception of failure. Where
legitimacy seems to be important, either the United Nations or a
coalition of the willing would prove sufficient. Nor is a formal
alliance necessary for base access and logistical backing. [Washington
could forge replacement arrangements with individual European states as
well as any continental European military alliance. Given the **deep
differences** of opinion which emerged over such issues as Iraq, Libya,
and Syria, **less formal** cooperative mechanisms would **reduce
political tensions**. A country could offer operational support without
providing combat units or even endorsing a particular conflict. Funding
for a nation's military would not be undercut by participation in an
unpopular international conflict.¶]{.underline} Despite its problems at
home, NATO bizarrely is seeking to expand abroad. Rasmussen recently
traveled to Japan and South Korea to promote NATO cooperation in Asia.
How can a European alliance increasingly incapable of defending Europe
play a role in Asia? [There are opportunities for non-military
cooperation: sharing expertise on civil emergencies, advancing
cyber-security, and promoting non-proliferation.]{.underline} However,
[these relationships could **as easily involve** the European Union as
NATO. Noted Richard Weitz of the Hudson Institute, "while NATO has
adopted a global perspective, its main activities beyond Europe and
Afghanistan thus far have consisted primarily of dialogue."¶ Alliances
should be based on international circumstance]{.underline}. Rasmussen
recently argued that "[The need for a strong military alliance between
Europe and North America]{.underline} has never been stronger." That [is
nonsense]{.underline}. [Neither continent faces an existential military
threat. Neither faces a significant global competitor. Neither has a
compelling interest to meddle in regional conflicts.]{.underline} While
there is much about which the U.S. and Europe should cooperate, [there
is no need for an American-dominated transatlantic military
alliance.]{.underline} Thus, [what is needed is U.S. **burden-shedding**
rather than allied burden-sharing. Europeans could provide forces
sufficient to defend themselves, patrol the Mediterranean, aid the
Central Asia states, and protect their interests in North Africa and the
Middle East. If they chose not to do so, no worries for America. But
**they shouldn't expect Washington to step in**]{.underline}. And U.S.
officials then could stop their unproductive whining about Europe's
defense choices. [America's Cold War security policy shielded war-torn
allies until they could recover and gain the economic means and
political stability to defend themselves. That policy was a great
success. Now **Washington should celebrate by turning NATO over the
Europeans.**]{.underline}

#### EU soft power fails

**Dempsey, 11**

Judy Dempsey, Int\'l Herald Tribune Europe Senior Correspondent,
9/28/11, The Failure of Soft Power,
carnegieeurope.eu/publications/?fa=45617

[Europeans have long believed soft power to be the best
instrument]{.underline} to promote their values and their security. They
have a strong sense of moral superiority about it, particularly when
looking at hard, or military, power. Military action is something that
the Europeans leave to the United States, Britain, and France. Even if
it wanted to, the European Union cannot do it. It lacks the basic
capabilities, such as heavy airlift and logistics. It lacks an
integrated defense policy for armament procurement. It also lacks a
security strategy that includes the use of hard power as an option. The
soft power instruments Europeans have used over the years consist of
development aid and civilian assistance, such as training the police and
judiciary in some countries. The Europeans also sometimes couple soft
power with trade incentives or with sanctions. Above all, they pride
themselves on basing their actions on the defense of human rights which
are, at least officially, at the core of Europe's value system. But
[Europe's record in making soft power the cornerstone of its security
strategy has been patchy]{.underline}. It has been worked incredibly
well in Eastern Europe. Enlargement with its plethora of promises and
incentives is soft power at its most powerful. But Europe cannot enlarge
to the rest of the world. That is where [Europe's soft power policies
have had so little, if any success.]{.underline} Take Iran. [Years of
negotiations with Iran]{.underline} to get it to abandon its nuclear
ambitions [have gotten the Europeans nowhere]{.underline}. Promises of
technical assistance and closer economic cooperation have had no impact
on the regime in Teheran, even though some of the sanctions are biting.
The reason why the Europeans have failed is because Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is just too stubborn. He seems determined to develop
a nuclear military capability for Iran's own geo-strategic interests no
matter what the cost to his people. Soft power can find no grip there.
[Bosnia-Herzegovina]{.underline} [is another case where the instrument
has failed]{.underline}. [Fifteen years after the Dayton accords that
ended the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia is mired in
corruption and misrule.]{.underline} This is despite the presence of a
large EU police force, not to mention the billions of euros the European
taxpayer has poured into this tiny country. The state that the EU is
trying to build has never really been accepted by the ethnic communities
living there. And the EU is not prepared to stop the bullying and
separatist tactics of the Bosnian Serbs in particular. [Afghanistan is
another stain on the EU's soft power record]{.underline}. There, the
Europeans have done too little and too late, wasting the initial good
will of the Afghan people after the Taliban regime was overthrown in
2001. While the U.S. and its coalition forces were distracted by the war
in Iraq, the Europeans did little to fill the gap left in Afghanistan.
Europe's most abject failure is its police-train ing mission there. It
is still under-financed and under-staffed. What a shame for what should
have been a stellar example of the EU's use of soft power.

#### EU soft power fails---4 reasons

Dirk **Messner 07** \["EU as Protagonist of Multilateralism," March,
www.fes.de/ipg/arc_07_d/01_07_d/pdf/03_A_Messner_GB.pdf\]

[Four Weaknesses on the Way to Becoming a Cooperative World
Power]{.underline} However, a number of [weak points must be set
against]{.underline} these assets in terms of [the eu setting itself up
as a cooperative world power]{.underline}. First, [Europe's only limited
economic, technological, and scientific attractive- ness in comparison
with the usa]{.underline} (and in future possibly also China and India)
[implies a loss of »soft power]{.underline}«which should not be
underestimated. [The capacity to act globally is based]{.underline} not
only, perhaps not even principally, on military power, but on top of
that [on political, economic, and cultural attractiveness. Europe
can]{.underline} therefore in future [only become a
relevant]{.underline} »co- operative [world power]{.underline}« [if
it]{.underline} at the same time [overcomes its economic
weaknesses]{.underline} and becomes a motor of innovation in the world
economy. [Secondly]{.underline}, despite the »European Security
Strategy« of 2003 the eu has still not managed to develop [pan-European
interests]{.underline} -- which [can]{.underline} even [be opposed to
individual national interests]{.underline} -- and, on that basis, common
strategies for helping to shape the international system, which can also
withstand »heavy storms and a bumpy journey.« [The crisis
of]{.underline} the eu in the run-up to [the Iraq war showed
that]{.underline} in difficult international crises [it is still the
nation states]{.underline} and their capital cities, [not the
eu]{.underline}, Brussels, or the European Council of Foreign Ministers
[which ultimately are the relevant actors. The dispute between some
European member states]{.underline} con-cerning the reform of the
Security Council last year only [strengthened this
impression]{.underline}. The eu is the most developed regional
cooperation project in the world, but still »work in progress«: no
longer merely the sum of nation states, more than an association of
states, but still clearly not a federal state of Europe. Moreover with
the crisis of [the European constitution]{.underline} the project of a
more effective common eu foreign policy [remains blocked]{.underline}
for the time being. [If this blockade and the loose co-
operation]{.underline} between the foreign policies of the member
states, as well as of the Commission, [remains]{.underline} in place
[the eu's global influence will ulti- mately remain very limited. Only a
common European foreign policy would provide the
opportunity]{.underline} to play a major role in global politics.
[Thirdly, although the eu is regarded worldwide as a »benevolent
player]{.underline}« on the international stage, at the same time [it is
considered a po- litical actor which]{.underline}, in the context of the
troubled further development of the European cooperation and integration
project, [is preoccupied above all with itself, its complicated
decision-making processes and its confused institutional
structures]{.underline}. The breath-taking political and economic dy-
namics in parts of Asia contrast with the often finickyand stolid
machinery of the European Union. And [while the]{.underline} [usa is
reproached with exhibiting the hubris of power the eu must often give
the appearance of being in- volved internationally »with the handbrake
on]{.underline}.« Over against Europe's good international reputation
overall must be set the not unjustified observation that [the eu is
still not a truly globally thinking and capable »cooperative world
power.« Fourthly, the eu's efforts to develop its global capacity to act
continue to be undermined by the internationally widespread image of
»Fortress Europe«. Two things]{.underline} in particular which
[contribute to this image]{.underline} of the walled-in fortress are, on
the one hand, the disputed [immigration and migration
policy]{.underline} of the Union which in the context of rising refugee
move- ments from Africa have gained in importance in recent months;
[and]{.underline}, on the other hand, [above all European agricultural
policy is a symbol of the protectionism which inflicts great damage on
the image]{.underline} of a cosmopolitan actor with a far-sighted
interest in global issues. For example, Europe's intransigence on
agricultural questions in the negotiations with Mercosur on a free trade
zone have harmed Europe's standing in South America. This sketch of the
eu's strengths and weaknesses shows that it has a good starting position
from which to gain significance as a global power without giving rise to
international worries about an aggressive Europe, or one solely
orientated towards its own, narrow interests. On the other hand, the
economic, political and institutional construction work is vis- ible on
which the eu must build in order to translate its global-gover-nance
potential into an effective capacity to act.
