2.8 CHOOSING CAPITALISM TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT: LARGE-SCALE DEPLOYMENT

Finally, a third reason that [**[cap]{.mark}**italism [is **suited
to**]{.mark} the job of **[environmental]{.mark}
restoration**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[protection]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is its ability to
**undertake**]{.underline} [and complete]{.underline} **[projects at
very large scales]{.underline}**. In keeping with a major thesis of this
book, construction at very large scales should give us a little pause,
because of the propensity of capital to metastasize into a source of
political resistance to change. But some global problems, especially
climate change, may require very large-scale enterprises.

For example, [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}** may **[[already]{.underline}]{.mark}**
have [**[passed a threshold]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[climate
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[tech]{.mark}**nology
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} almost certainly [**[needed]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [chemically]{.underline} **[[capture
carbon]{.mark} dioxide]{.underline}** [from ambient air.]{.underline}
But carbon dioxide is only about 0.15% of ambient air by molecular
weight, and [a tremendous amount of]{.underline} ambient [air must be
processed just to capture a small amount of carbon dioxide]{.underline}.
This technology has often been referred to as \"**[direct air
capture]{.underline}**,\" or \"carbon removal.\" [Given
that]{.underline} inherent [limitation, direct air capture technology
[must be deployed **at vast scales**]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to
make any appreciable difference in greenhouse gas concentrations. There
is certainly no guarantee that direct air capture will be a silver
bullet. But [if it is to be an effectual item on a menu of survival
techniques, it will [more **assured**]{.mark}ly be accomplished
[under]{.mark} the]{.underline} incentives of [a **[cap]{.mark}**italist
**economy**]{.underline}.

[Capitalism might]{.underline} [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} [help with
the looming crisis of climate change by helping to]{.underline}
**[[ensure]{.mark} the [supply of]{.mark}]{.underline}** vital life
staples such as [**[food, water]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [other basic needs in future
**[shortages]{.mark}**]{.underline} [caused by
climate-change]{.underline}. [In a climate-changed future, there is
the]{.underline} distinct [possibility that supplies of vital life
staples may run short]{.underline}, possibly for long periods of time.
[**Droughts** are projected]{.underline} to last longer, with water
supplies and growing conditions increasingly precarious. [Capitalist
enterprise could]{.underline}, first of all, [provide the]{.underline}
[**impetus to** finally **reform**]{.underline} a dizzying multitude of
**[price distortions]{.underline}** [that plague **water** supply and
**ag**riculture]{.underline} worldwide. Second, **[capitalist
enterprise]{.underline}** [can]{.underline} **[undertake scale
production]{.underline}** [of some emergent technologies that might
alleviate shortages.]{.underline} [**Desal**ination
technology]{.underline} [can convert salty seawater into]{.underline}
drinkable [freshwater]{.underline}.54 A number of environmental and
economic issues need to be solved to deploy these technologies at large
scales, but [in a crisis]{.underline}, [**solutions will** be more
**likely to present themselves**]{.underline}.

[A technology that is already being adopted]{.underline} to produce food
[is the modernized version of old-fashioned greenhouses.]{.underline}
The tiny country of the Netherlands, with its 17 million people crowded
onto 13,000 square miles, is the second largest food exporter in the
world,55 exporting fully three-quarters that of the United States in
2017.56 The secret to Dutch agriculture is its climate-controlled,
low-energy green-houses that project solar panel-powered artificial
sunlight around the clock. Dutch greenhouses produce lettuce at ten
times the yield57 and tomatoes at fifteen times the yield outdoors in
the United States58 while using less than one-thirteenth the amount of
water,59 very little in the way of synthetic pesticides and, of course,
very little fertilizer given its advanced composting techniques.
[Sustained shortages in a climate-changed future might require that
a]{.underline} **[capitalist]{.underline}** [take hold of **greenhouse
growing and expand production**]{.underline} **[to feed the
masses]{.underline}** [that might otherwise revolt]{.underline}.

2.9 **[CHOOSE CAPITALISM]{.underline}**

[Clearly, the job]{.underline} in front of humankind [is enormous,
complex, and many-faceted]{.underline}. The best hope is to be able to
identify certain human impacts that are clearly harmful to the global
environment, and to disincentivize them. Getting back to notions of
institutions in capitalism, [what is crucial is aligning the right
incentives with profit-making activity]{.underline}. [What capitalism
does **so well**]{.underline} --- beyond human comprehension --- **[is
coordinate activity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[send broad
signals about scarcity]{.underline}**. [Information about a wide variety
of environmental phenomena is]{.underline} extremely [difficult to
collect and process]{.underline}. If a set of environmental taxes can
help establish a network of environ-mental prices, then an unfathomably
large and complex machinery will have been set in motion in the right
direction.

Also, [because of the need for new scientific solutions to this daunting
list of problems, **[new science and tech]{.mark}**nology [is]{.mark}
desperately [**needed**. **Cap**]{.mark}italism **[is tried and
true]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} terms of **[producing
innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Again drawing upon the study of
institutions, it is not so much that individuals need a profit-motive in
order to tinker, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [the prospect of
**[profit]{.mark}**-making **[has to be present]{.mark}** in order for
institutions]{.underline}, including corporations, [to devote resources,
attention, and energy towards the development of solutions]{.underline}
to environmental problems. Corporations can and should demonstrate
social responsibility by attempting to mitigate their impacts on the
global environment, but a much more conscious push for new knowledge,
new techniques, and new solutions are needed.

Finally, **[the scale of needed change is profound]{.underline}**. [Huge
networks of infrastructure]{.underline} centered upon a fossil
fuel-centered economy [must]{.underline} somehow [be replaced or
adapted]{.underline} to new ways of generating, transmitting, consuming,
and storing energy. [A global system of feeding seven billion
humans]{.underline} (and counting), unsustainable on its face, [must be
morphed into something else that]{.underline} can fill that huge role.
[About a billion and a half cars and trucks]{.underline} in the world
[must]{.underline}, over time, [be swapped out]{.underline} for vehicles
that must be dramatically different.

[This is a daunting to-do list]{.underline}, **[but look]{.underline}**
a bit more **[carefully]{.underline}** among the gloomy news. Elon
[Musk]{.underline}, a freewheeling, pot-smoking entrepreneur [shows
signs of breaking into not one, but two industries]{.underline}
dominated by behemoths with political power. Thanks to California
emissions standards, [**auto**mobile manufacturers have developed [cars
that emit a **fraction**]{.mark} of what they did]{.underline} less than
a generation ago. [Hybrid **[e]{.mark}**lectric
**[v]{.mark}**ehicle**[s]{.mark}** have]{.underline} thoroughly
[penetrated an American market that powerful American politicians had
tried to cordon off]{.underline} for American manufacturers only. [At
least two companies have developed **[meat substitutes]{.mark}** that
are]{.underline} now widely judged to be [indistinguishable from
meat]{.underline}, and have established product outposts in the ancient
power centers of fast food, McDonald\'s and Burger King. The tiny
country of [the **Netherlands**]{.underline}, about half the size of
West Virginia, [exports almost **as much [food]{.mark}** []{.mark}as the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, able to ship fresh
produce all the way to Africa. At bottom, **[all of [these
accomplishments]{.mark}]{.underline}** and thousands more
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** and were **[[capitalist]{.mark} in
nature.]{.underline}** While they collectively repre-sent a trifle of
what still needs to be accomplished, [they were also undertaken without
the correct incentives in place, and]{.underline} thus also [represent
the]{.underline} tremendous **[promise of capitalism]{.underline}**.

#### Cap is sustainable -- innovation is key to solve the climate and the alt can't solve

**Karlsson 21** -- Associate Professor in political science at Umea
University (Rasmus, \"Learning in the Anthropocene\" Soc. Sci. 10, no.
6: 233. <https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10060233> 18 June 2021)

Unpacking this argument, it is perhaps useful to first recognize that,
[**stable as the Holocene** may have seemed from a human perspective,
**[life was always]{.mark}** [vulnerable to]{.mark} a number of
**[cosmic risks,]{.mark} such as bolide collisions**, **risks that
[only]{.mark}** advanced **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [can
mitigate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [**the Black Death** of the
14th century should serve as a powerful reminder of the extreme
[vulnerability **of pre-industrial societies**]{.mark} at a
microbiological level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to
think of the Holocene as providing a relatively stable baseline against
which the ecological effects of technological interventions could
hypothetically be evaluated. With most human activities being
distinctively local, nature would for the most part "bounce back" (even
if the deforestation of the Mediterranean basin during the Roman period
is an example of that not always being the case) while larger
geophysical processes, such as the carbon cycle, remained entirely
beyond human intentional control. Even if there has been some debate
about what influence human activities had on the preindustrial climate
(Ruddiman 2007), anthropogenic forcing was in any case both marginal and
gradual. All this changed with the onset of the Great Acceleration by
which humans came to overwhelm the great forces of nature, causing
untold damage to fragile ecosystems and habitats everywhere, forever
altering the trajectory of life on the planet (Steffen et al. 2011b).
[In a grander perspective, **humanity may** one day become an
interplanetary species and thus instrumental in safeguarding **the
long-term existence of biological life**,]{.underline} but for the
moment, [its impact is ethically dubious at best as the glaciers melt,
the oceans fill up with plastics, and vast number of species are driven
to extinctio]{.underline}n. Faced with these grim realities, **[it is of
course not surprising that the first impulse is to seek to restore some
kind primordial harmony and restrain human activities]{.underline}**.
Yet, it is [important]{.underline} to acknowledge that, even if their
aggregate impact may have been within the pattern of Holocene
variability, [**[pre-modern]{.mark}** Western agricultural [societies
were]{.mark} hardly "sustainable" in any meaningful sense. [Experiencing
permanent scarcity]{.mark}, violent [conflict]{.mark} was
endemic]{.underline} (Gat 2013), and as much as some contemporary
academics like to attribute all evils to "capitalism" (Malm 2016),
pre-capitalist societies exhibited no shortage of religious intolerance
and other forms of social domination. It is thus not surprising that
some have argued the need to reverse the civilizational arc further yet
and return to a preliterate hunter-gather existence (Zerzan 2008) even
if this, obviously, has very little to do with existing political
realities and social formations. Under Holocene conditions, the
short-term human tragedy may have been the same, but it did not
undermine the long-term ability of the planet to support life[. In a
world of eight billion people, already accumulated emissions in the
atmosphere have committed the planet to significant warming under the
coming centuries, with an increasing [probability that]{.mark} committed
[warming]{.mark} already [exceeds]{.mark} the **[1.5-]{.mark}**degree
target of the Paris Agreement even if all fossil-fuel emissions were to
stop today]{.underline} (Mauritsen and Pincus 2017). This means that
[**sustained [negative emission]{.mark}**s, presumably **in combination
with [SRM]{.mark}**, [will]{.mark} most likely **be needed** just **to
[stabilize]{.mark}** global **[temperatures]{.mark}**,]{.underline} not
to mentioning countering the flow of future emissions. According to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), assuming that all the
pledges submitted under the Paris Agreement are fulfilled, **[[limiting
warming]{.mark} to 1.5 degrees [will]{.mark} still [require]{.mark}
negative emissions in the range of 100---1000 gigatons of
CO2]{.underline}** (Hilaire et al. 2019, p. 190). The removal of carbon
dioxide at gigaton scales from **[the atmosphere]{.underline}** [will
presumably require the existence of an advanced [industrial]{.mark}
[society]{.mark} since low-tech options, such as afforestation, will be
of limited use]{.underline} (Gundersen et al. 2021; Seddon et al. 2020),
especially in a future of competing land-uses. It is against this
backdrop of worsening climate harms that the limits of "precaution", at
least as conventionally understood, become apparent. [While degrowth
advocates tend to insist that [behavioral change]{.mark}, even
explicitly betting on a "social miracle"]{.underline} (Kallis 2019, p.
195), **[is]{.underline}** always **[preferable]{.underline}** to any
technological risk-taking (Heikkurinen 2018), that
**[[overlooks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [both the scope of the
sustainability challenge and the [lack of public consent]{.mark} to
**any** sufficiently **radical** political project]{.underline}
(Buch-Hansen 2018). While there may be growing willingness to pay for,
say, an electric vehicle (Hulshof and Mulder 2020), giving up private
automobile use altogether is obviously a different animal, to say
nothing about a more fundamental rematerialization of the economy
(Hausknost 2020). [Again, the problem is one in which change either (a)
remains marginal yet ecologically insufficient or (b) becomes
sufficiently radical yet provokes a strong political
counterreaction]{.underline}. A similar dynamic can be expected to play
out at the international level where **[[countries that remain]{.mark}
[committed to growth]{.mark} would quickly [gain a military
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To make matters worse, there is also a
temporal element to this dynamic [since any regime of [frugality]{.mark}
and localism [would]{.mark} have to [be policed]{.mark}
indefinitely]{.underline} in order to prevent new unsustainable patterns
of development from re-emerging later on. All this begs the obvious
question[, if the political and economic enforcement of the planetary
boundaries are]{.underline} **[fraught [with]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
[[political and social difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark}, would it not
be better to instead [try to transcend them through technological
innovation]{.underline}? Surprisingly, any high-energy future would most
likely be subject to many of the same motivational and psychological
constraints that hinder a low-energy future. While history shows that
existing nuclear technologies could in theory displace all fossil fuels
and meet the most stringent climate targets (Qvist and Brook 2015), it
seems extremely unlikely, to put it mildly, that thousands of new
reactors will be built over the course of the coming decades in response
to climate change. Outside the world of abstract computer modelling,
real world psychological and cultural inertia tends to ensure that
political decision-making, at least for the most part, gravitates to
what is considered "reasonable" and "common sense"---such as medium
emissions electricity grids in which wind and solar are backed by
biomass and gas---rather than what any utilitarian optimization scenario
may suggest. Even if the global benefits of climate stabilization would
be immense, the standards by which local nuclear risks are assessed, as
clearly illustrated by the Fukushima accident which led to a worldwide
retreat from nuclear energy despite only causing one confirmed death
(which, though obviously regrettable, has to be put in relation to the
hundred and thousands of people dying every year from the use of fossil
fuels), underscores the uneven distribution of perceived local risks
versus global benefits and the associated problem of socio-political
learning across spatial scales. Almost two decades ago, Ingolfur
Blühdorn identified "simulative eco-politics" as a key strategy by which
liberal democracies reconcile an ever-heightened rhetoric of
environmental crisis with their simultaneous defense of the core
principles of consumer capitalism (Blühdorn 2007). Since then,
declarations that we only have "ten years to save the planet" have
proliferated, and so have seemingly bold investments in renewable
energy, most recently in the form of US President Joseph Biden's USD
2.25 trillion climate and infrastructure plan. Still, without a
meaningful commitment to either radical innovation or effective
degrowth, it is difficult to see how the deployment of yet more wind
turbines or the building of new highways will in any way be
qualitatively different from what Blühdorn pertinently described as
sustaining "what is known to be unsustainable" (Blühdorn 2007, p. 253).
However, all is not lost in lieu of more authentic forms of
eco-politics. [Independent of political interventions, accelerating
**[technological change]{.mark}**, in particular with regard to
computing and intelligent machine labor, may one day [make]{.mark}
large-scale precision [manipulation]{.mark} of the physical world
[possible]{.mark} in ways that may [solve]{.mark} many [problems]{.mark}
that today **seem [intractable]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Dorr 2016).
Similarly, [**[breakthroughs in]{.mark} synthetic [bio]{.mark}logy** may
[hold the key to]{.mark} environmentally benign biofuels and
[carbon]{.mark} utilization technologies]{.underline}. Yet, all such
progress remains hypothetical and uncertain for now. Given what is at
stake, there is an obvious danger in submitting to naïve technological
optimism. What is less commonly recognized is that naïve optimism with
regard to the prospects of behavioral change may be equally dangerous.
**[While [late-capitalist affluence]{.mark} has [enabled]{.mark} many
[postmaterial identities]{.mark} and behaviors, such as bicycling,
[hobby farming]{.mark}, and other forms of emancipatory self-expression,
a [collapsing economy]{.mark} could quickly [lead to]{.mark} a reversal
back to [survivalist values]{.mark}, traditional hierarchical forms of
[domination, and violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Quilley 2011, p. 77).
As such, it is far from obvious what actions would actually take the
world as a whole closer to long-term sustainability. If sustainability
could be achieved by a relatively modest reduction in consumption rates
or behavioral changes, such as a ban on all leisure flights, then there
would be a strong moral case for embracing degrowth. Yet, recognizing
how farreaching measures in terms of population control and consumption
restrictions that would be needed, the case quickly becomes more
ambiguous. [While traditional environmentalism may suggest that
**[retreating from the]{.mark}** global [economy]{.mark} and adopting a
low-tech lifestyle would increase resilience]{.underline} (Alexander and
Yacoumis 2018), it may do very much the opposite by [further fragmenting
global efforts and **[slowi]{.mark}**ng the pace of technological
[innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Without]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
orderly and [**[functioning]{.mark}** world [trade]{.mark} system, local
resources [scarcities]{.mark} would be
**[exacerbated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as seen most recently with the
different disruptions to vaccine supply chains. In essence, given the
lack of a stable Holocene baseline to revert to[, it becomes more
difficult to distinguish proactionary "risk-taking" from "precaution",
especially as many **[ecosystems have]{.mark}** already [been damaged
beyond]{.mark} natural [recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context,
it is noteworthy that many of the [**technologies** that can be expected
to be most crucial for managing a period of prolonged overshoot (such as
next-generation nuclear, engineering biology, large-scale carbon capture
and SRM) are also ones that traditional environmentalism is most
strongly opposed]{.underline} to. 3. Finding Indicators
[**[From]{.mark}** the [vantage point]{.mark} of the
[far-future]{.mark}, at least the kind depicted in the fictional
universe of Star Trek]{.underline}, human **[evolution is]{.underline}**
a fairly straightforward affair along an Enlightenment trajectory by
which ever greater instrumental capacity is matched by similar leaps in
psychological maturity and expanding circles of moral concern. With the
risk of sounding Panglossian, [one may argue that the **[waning of
interstate war]{.mark}** in general and the [fact]{.mark} that [there
has not been]{.mark} any major [nuclear]{.mark} [exchange]{.mark} in
particular, does [vindicate]{.mark} such an **[optimistic
reading]{.mark}** of histor]{.underline}y. While there will always be
ups and downs, as long as the most disastrous outcomes are avoided,
there will still be room for learning and gradual political
accommodation. Taking such a longer view, it would nevertheless be
strange if development was simply linear, that former oppressors would
just accept moral responsibility or that calls for gender or racial
justice would not lead to self-reinforcing cycles of conservative
backlash and increasingly polarizing claims. Still, over the last couple
of centuries, there is little doubt that [human civilization has
advanced significantly, both technologically and ethically (Pinker
2011), at least from a liberal and secular perspective]{.underline}.
However, unless one subscribes to teleology, there is nothing inexorable
with this development and, it may be that the ecological, social, and
political obstacles are simply too great to ever allow for the creation
of a Wellsian borderless world (Pedersen 2015) that would allow everyone
to live a life free from material want and political domination. On the
other hand, much environmental discourse tends to rush ahead in the
opposite direction and treat the c limate crisis as ultimate evidence of
humanity's fallen nature when **[the counter-factual case, that it would
be possible for a technological civilization to emerge without at some
point endangering its biophysical foundations, would presumably be much
less plausible.]{.underline}** From an astrobiological perspective, it
is easy to imagine how the atmospheric chemistry of a different planet
would be more volatile and thus more vulnerable to the effects of
industrial processes (Haqq-Misra and Baum 2009), leaving a shorter time
window for mitigation. Nick Bostrom has explored this possibility of
greater climate sensitivity further in his "vulnerable world hypothesis"
(Bostrom 2019) and it begs to reason that mitigation efforts would be
more focused in such a world. However, since climate response times are
longer and sensitivity less pronounced, climate mitigation policies have
become mired in culture and media politics (Newman et al. 2018) but also
a statist logic (Karlsson 2018) by which it has become more important
for states to focus on their own marginal emission reductions in the
present rather than asking what technologies would be needed to
stabilize the climate in a future where all people can live a modern
life.

and Emissions in 32 Countries,\" Breakthrough Institute, 4-6-2021,

The [past 30 years have seen immense progress **in [improving]{.mark}
the [quality of life]{.mark} for much of humanity**.]{.underline}
Extreme [[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the number of people living
on less than \$1.90 per day --- [has fallen by nearly two-thirds, [from
1.9 **billion to**]{.mark} around [650 **million**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Life expectancy has risen]{.underline}]{.mark} in most of the world,
[along with literacy and access to education]{.underline}, [while infant
mortality has fallen]{.underline}. Despite perceptions to the contrary,
**[the average person born today is likely to have access to more
opportunities and have a [better]{.mark} quality of [life than at any
other point]{.mark} in human history]{.underline}**. [Much of this
increase in human wellbeing has been [propelled by]{.mark} rapid
[economic growth]{.mark} driven largely by state-led industrial policy,
particularly in poor-to-middle income countries.]{.underline} However,
[this growth has come at a cost]{.underline}: [between 1990 and
2019]{.underline}, global [emissions of CO2 **increased by
56%.**]{.underline} [Historically, economic growth has been closely
linked to increased energy consumption]{.underline} --- and increased
CO2 emissions in particular --- leading some to argue that a more
prosperous world is one that necessarily has more impacts on our natural
environment and climate. There is a lively academic debate about our
ability to "absolutely decouple" emissions and growth --- that is, the
extent to which the adoption of clean energy technology can allow
emissions to decline while economic growth continues[. [Over
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [past 15 [years,]{.mark} however, **[something
has begun to change]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Rather than a 21st century
dominated by coal that energy modelers foresaw, **[global [coal]{.mark}
use peaked in 2013 and is now [in]{.mark} [structural
decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [We have succeeded in making [clean
energy cheap]{.mark}, with solar power and battery storage [costs
falling]{.mark} 10-fold since 2009]{.underline}. The world produced more
electricity from clean energy --- [solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear ---
than from coal over the past two years]{.underline}. And, according to
some major oil companies, **[peak [oil]{.mark} is upon us]{.underline}**
--- not because we have run out of cheap oil to produce, but because
[[demand is falling]{.mark} and [companies expect further
decline]{.mark} as consumers increasingly shift to electric
vehicles.]{.underline} The [world has long been experiencing a relative
**[decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between]{.mark} economic [growth
and]{.mark} CO2 [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [with the
emissions per unit of GDP **falling for the past 60
years**]{.underline}. [This is the case even in countries
like]{.underline} **[India and China]{.underline}** that [have been
undergoing rapid]{.underline} economic [growth.]{.underline} But
relative decoupling alone is inadequate in a world where global CO2
emissions need to peak and decline in the next decade to give us any
chance at limiting warming to well below 2℃, in line with Paris
Agreement targets. Thankfully, there is increasing evidence that [the
world is [on track **to absolutely decouple**]{.mark} **CO2 emissions
and economic growth**]{.underline} --- with global [CO2
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially having [[peaked in
2019]{.underline}]{.mark} **[and [unlikely to increase]{.mark}
substantially [in the coming decade]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While an
emissions peak is just the first and easiest step towards eventually
reaching the net-zero emissions required to stop the world from
continuing to warm, it [demonstrates that linkages between emissions and
economic activity are not an immutable law, but rather simply a result
of our current means of energy production.]{.underline} In recent years
we have seen more and more examples of absolute decoupling --- economic
growth accompanied by falling CO2 emissions. [Since 2005,]{.underline}
[[32 countries]{.mark} with a population of at least one million people
**have [absolutely decoupled]{.mark}**]{.underline} emissions from
economic growth, both for terrestrial emissions (those within national
borders) and consumption emissions (emissions embodied in the goods
consumed in a country). This includes the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [Japan, Mexico, Germany, U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, [France, Spain, Poland, Romania, Netherlands,
Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary, Belarus, Austria, Bulgaria, El
Salvador, Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Norway, Ireland, New
Zealand, Croatia, Jamaica, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, and
Cyprus.]{.underline} Figure 1, below, shows the declines in territorial
emissions (blue) and increases in GDP (red). To qualify as having
experienced absolute decoupling, we require countries included in this
analysis to pass four separate filters: a population of at least one
million (to focus the analysis on more representative cases), [declining
territorial emissions over the 2005-2019 period (based on a linear
regression), declining consumption emissions, and increasing real GDP
(on a purchasing power parity basis, using constant 2017 international
\$USD).]{.underline} We chose not to include 2020 in this analysis
because it is not particularly representative of longer-term trends, and
consumption and territorial emissions estimates are not yet available
for many countries. There is a wide range of rates of economic growth
between 2005-2019 among countries experiencing absolute decoupling.
Somewhat counterintuitively, there is no significant relationship
between the rate of economic growth and the magnitude of emissions
reductions within the group. **[While it is unlikely that there is not
at least some linkage between the two factors, there are plenty of
examples of countries (e.g., Singapore, Romania, and Ireland)
experiencing both extremely rapid economic growth and large reductions
in CO2 emissions.]{.underline}** One of the [primary [criticisms
of]{.mark}]{.underline} some prior analyses of absolute [[decoupling
is]{.underline}]{.mark} that they ignore
**[[leakage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specifically, the offshoring of
manufacturing from high-income countries over the past three decades to
countries like China has led to "illusory" drops in emissions, where the
emissions associated with high-income country consumption are simply
shipped overseas and no longer show up in territorial emissions
accounting. There is some truth in this critique, as there was a large
increase in emissions embodied in imports from developing countries
between 1990 and 2005. After 2005, however, [structural changes in China
and a growing domestic market led to a reversal of these trends; the
[amount of emissions "exported"]{.mark} from developed countries to
developing countries **[has]{.mark} actually [declined]{.mark} over the
past 15 years.**]{.underline} This means that, for many countries, [both
territorial emissions and consumption emissions]{.underline} (which
include any emissions "exported" to other countries) **[have jointly
declined]{.underline}**. In fact, on average, consumption emissions have
been declining slightly faster than territorial emissions since 2005 in
the 32 countries we identify as experiencing absolute decoupling. Figure
2, below, shows the change in consumption emissions (teal) and GDP (red)
between 2005 and 2019. There is a pretty wide variation in the extent to
which these countries have reduced their territorial and consumption
emissions since 2005. Some countries --- such as the UK, Denmark,
Finland, and Singapore -- have seen territorial emissions fall faster
than consumption emissions, while the US, Japan, Germany, and Spain
(among others) have seen consumption emissions fall faster. Figure 3
shows reductions in consumption and territorial emissions for each
country, with the size of the dot representing the size of the
population in 2019. **[[Absolute decoupling is
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [There is no physical law requiring
economic growth --- and broader increases in human wellbeing --- to
necessarily be linked to CO2 emissions]{.underline}. All of the
**[[services that we rely on today]{.mark} that emit fossil
fuels]{.underline}** --- electricity, transportation, heating, food ---
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} in principle **[[be replaced by]{.mark}
near-[zero carbon alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though these are
more mature in some sectors (electricity, transportation, buildings)
than in others (industrial processes, agriculture).

https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth

I was going to write a lengthy post explaining why
"**[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}**" --- the idea that we need to halt
economic growth in order to save the planet --- **[[is]{.mark} a very
[bad]{.mark} idea]{.underline}**. But in the meantime, other people have
written that post, or recorded that podcast, and done it well. These
include Branko Milanovic, Kelsey Piper, and Ezra Klein. So instead I'll
write a shorter post trying to catalog and boil down the arguments
against degrowth.

But first, let's go over the standard argument, so we can see why these
new arguments are necessary.

The standard argument against degrowth

First, note that the typical argument against degrowth, which I laid out
in a Bloomberg post a while back, is that we don't need it; [we can
[raise]{.mark} human [living standards **without exhausting the
planet**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This argument was capably put forward by
Andy McAfee, in his excellent book More From Less, which you should buy
and read. Essentially, [the idea that economic growth requires growth in
resource use is **false**]{.underline}; [[rich countries]{.mark} have
started to grow while **[us]{.mark}ing less and [less of the
planet's]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}most important
**[resources]{.underline}**. [For example, here is U.S. use of **fresh
[water]{.mark}** []{.mark}and various **[metals]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[as well as]{.underline} trade-adjusted
[**[carbon]{.underline}**]{.mark} emissions:

height="3.027083333333333in"}

So the idea here is that **[we don't need degrowth]{.underline}**;
instead, [we can keep raising everyone's standard of living **without
exhausting the planet's resources**]{.underline}. Because
[growth]{.underline} doesn't just mean using more and more stuff;
instead, it [can mean finding **more efficient ways** to use the stuff
we have.]{.underline}

[Degrowthers]{.underline} have two counters to this. Their first
counter, typically, is to [show]{.underline} a graph of [resource use
for the entire world, and show that it's correlated with global growth.
This is a **weak response**]{.underline}, for two reasons:

1.  [**[Degrowthers]{.underline}** [have no idea how to
    combine]{.underline} ]{.mark}[various [resources]{.mark} into an
    overall measure]{.underline} of resource use, [so they]{.underline}
    typically [go with gross weight. This is **absurd**]{.underline},
    since **[some materials are recyclable]{.underline}** [and
    others]{.underline} are not --- [if you "use" a ton of copper you
    **still have the copper**, whereas if you "use" a ton of oil, your
    oil is gone]{.underline}. It's also absurd because [it doesn't take
    into account]{.underline} the **[relative abundance]{.underline}**
    of resources --- [if you figure out how to substitute 2 tons of sand
    for 1 ton of oil, you're getting more efficient, since sand is much
    more plentiful]{.underline} than oil (and doesn't pollute as much
    when you use it). [A lot of growth is figuring out how to substitute
    plentiful resources for rare ones, and simply adding up gross
    tonnage **ignores this**.]{.underline}

2.  **[[Past trends are no guarantee]{.mark} of future
    trends]{.underline}**. [Until the 70s]{.underline}, for instance,
    U.S. economic [[growth was]{.mark} closely [correlated with]{.mark}
    both energy use and carbon [emissions]{.mark}; after the 70s,
    [this]{.mark} correlation **broke down completely** and the lines
    [started moving in **opposite directions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
    [Degrowthers present historical curves as if these are
    law]{.underline}s of nature, but we know that **[they are
    not]{.underline}**. The trend is your friend only til the bend at
    the end. And [the fact that [rich countries]{.mark} have hit an
    [inflection point]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}where economic
    growth no longer depends on growing resource **[use [is a strong
    indicator]{.mark} that [industrializing
    countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}like China
    [**[will]{.underline}**]{.mark} also hit this point [as
    well]{.underline}. (And no, falling use in rich countries is mostly
    not due to outsourcing, as the emissions graph above illustrates.)

So [this degrowther argument is just **wrong**]{.underline}. But
[degrowthers]{.underline} have a second, far better
[counter]{.underline} to McAfee's notion that we can have our cake and
eat it too: [Decoupling isn't happening fast enough. If we
wait]{.underline} for China and India and all the countries of Africa to
industrialize in a resource-intensive way like today's developed
countries did, and then to dematerialize their growth like today's
developed countries are doing now, [it will be far too late]{.underline}
and the planet will suffer ecological catastrophe.

**[This argument isn't]{.underline}** as **[strong]{.underline}** as it
sounds --- China and India and [[the rest will]{.mark} be able to
**[take advantage of]{.mark} the efficiency-inducing
[tech]{.mark}nologies** created [by]{.mark} the [developed
countries]{.mark}, like solar]{.underline} power (indeed, they are
already doing so). [And they will be able to embrace "dematerialized"
goods]{.underline} and services [like social networks]{.underline} and
video games (sorry, Xi Jinping) very early in their growth path. [So
these countries' resource use trajectories **won't look quite like the
U.S.**' or Europe's.]{.underline}

But [this degrowther argument does contain a nugget of
truth]{.underline}: Global resource [use is currently]{.underline} on an
[unsustainable]{.underline} trajectory. Here, via Zeke Hausfather, are
the current projections for global warming by century's end, even with
the advances in techologies like solar:

**\[CHART OMITTED\]**

Any one of these scenarios represents utter global catastrophe.

So even if there is a sustainable growth path, we are not currently on
it. About this, degrowthers are right; a gentle, natural transition to
green growth is possible, but is an unaffordable luxury. **[But
[degrowth]{.mark}ers' prescription is]{.underline}** the
**[wrong]{.underline}** one.

[The reason]{.underline}, in a word, [is **politics**]{.underline}. [The
kind of massive intention reordering of global production and
consumption]{.underline} that degrowthers fantasize about [[is]{.mark}
not just **pragmatically [impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[to
implement]{.underline}, [it's the]{.underline} kind of
[thing]{.underline} that essentially **[everyone in the
world]{.underline}** [except]{.underline} for a few very shouty people
in Northern Europe and the occasional [Twitter activist]{.underline}
**[is going to reject]{.underline}**. To see why, let us turn to the
excellent articles/podcasts by Milanovic, Piper, and Klein.

[The political argument against **degrowth**]{.underline}

Milanovic actually has two excellent posts on the topic of degrowth. In
the first one, he lays out why [forcing developing countries to stay in
poverty would be **bad**]{.underline}:

> Let us [suppose]{.underline}, for the sake of the argument, that [we
> interpret "degrowth" as the decision to fix global GDP at its current
> level...Then]{.underline}, unless we change the distribution of

> **quarter of humankind** who earn less than \$2.50 per
> day]{.underline}...[Keeping so many people in **abject

> of degrowth would not condone.

[Enforcing [global degrowth would]{.mark} require **[freez]{.mark}ing
[world income]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}at about \$17,000/year.
That means that [most people in the world would **never even come close
to current rich-world living standards**]{.underline} --- instead, they
would at best only be able to reach the level currently enjoyed in China
or Botswana. Perhaps that's not such a horrible fate, but as Milanovic
notes, [this would require **impoverishing most of the population** of
developed countries]{.underline}. He elaborates on this point in his new
post, pulling no punches:

> \[In order to avoid keeping most of the world in poverty, degrowthers
> must\] introduce a different \[income\] distribution (B) where
> everybody who is above the current mean world income (\$PPP 16 per

> proposition is a **political suicide**]{.underline}.

Milanovic quite rightly waves away degrowthers' protestations that GDP
is not a good measure of human welfare. GDP isn't perfect, he notes, but
it's close enough where the basic point stands.

[Demanding]{.underline} that [people in rich countries accept absolutely
catastrophic declines]{.underline} in their living standards **[is a
political non-starter]{.underline}**. Klein, on his podcast, tries to
point this out as gently as possible:

> I think that [if the political demand of the \[degrowth\] movement
> becomes you don't get to eat beef, **you will set climate politics

> atop those technologies.

[Milanovic is less gentle, calling [this "**outright magical
thinking**]{.mark}".]{.underline} He is correct. [When you look at how
much people in America are willing to sacrifice in terms of their
material well-being in order to fight climate change, it's **far
less**]{.underline} than what Klein is talking about. And Klein is
really softballing it here --- [it's not just giving up **beef** and
**SUVs**, it's a dramatic reduction in the size of **housing** and the
amount of **food** and the ease of **transportation** and the quality of
**medical care**]{.underline} that people in rich countries enjoy. [It
is, frankly, **not happening**]{.underline}.

But [even this vastly understates the political and practical
difficulties of degrowth]{.underline}. Piper adds several key points.
First of all, she notes, because developed countries have been
decoupling resource use and growth for a while now, [curbing resource
use will actually cause a lot more restrictions on developing
countries]{.underline} than Milanovic's simple calculations would
suggest:

> From a climate change perspective, though, there's a problem \[with
> simply reducing rich-world living standards\]. First, it means that
> [degrowth would do nothing about the **bulk of emissions**, which are
> occurring in **developing countries**.]{.underline}

This is an incredibly important point. For example, [[China]{.mark} now
[produces more CO2]{.mark} emissions than the U.S., the EU, and Japan
combined:]{.underline}

> ![Chart, line chart Description automatically
> generated](media/image8.png){width="3.688024934383202in"
> height="2.6039074803149607in"}

(**[And no, this is not because of outsourcing]{.underline}**, as [you
can see by looking at the trade-adjusted emissions
numbers]{.underline}.)

Another way of looking at this is that [China's CO2 emissions per dollar
of GDP are more than twice America's]{.underline}, and about five times
that of the EU. Any global degrowth plan that actually reduces resource
use is going to entail more pain for China than its GDP numbers would
suggest, simply because China is at a more resource-intensive stage of
growth.

[Do you think **China will accept a substantial diminution of its living
standards**]{.underline}, in order [to satisfy the
environmental-economic diktats of activists]{.underline} in Northern
Europe? [If so, you need to **rethink a great many
things**]{.underline}.

Anyway, Piper makes a second crucially important point. So far we've
been waving our hands and talking about lowering rich-world GDP while
raising GDP for poor countries. In fact, economies don't work like that:

> Second, the global economy is more interconnected than Hickel implies.
> When Covid-19 hit, poor countries were devastated not just by the
> virus but by the aftershocks of virus-induced slowdowns in consumption
> in rich countries.
>
> There's some genuine appeal to the idea of an end to "consumerism,"
> but the pandemic offered a taste of how [a sudden drop in rich-world
> consumption would]{.underline} actually [affect the developing
> world]{.underline}. Covid-19 dramatically curtailed Western imports
> and tourism for a time. [The [consequences in poor countries were
> **devastating**. **Hunger** rose, and **child mortality**
> followed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Degrowth would thus require deep changes in the entire way that the
global economy works. Change happens, but not like that; implementing
the kind of reallocation schemes that degrowthers throw around with
abandon would require global economic planning that would put Gosplan to
shame. Klein points this out, again rather gently:

> [[Degrowth is]{.underline}]{.mark}, as its advocates understand it, a
> act of global [economic planning]{.underline} really **[without equal
> anywhere in human history]{.underline}**. It is an act of
> extraordinary central planning.

In other words, **[it is [abject fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Taken together, [these criticisms are **utterly
devastating**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the entire
[degrowth]{.underline} project. In its current form, [it will not
advance beyond a **media fad**]{.underline}. No matter how shrilly
degrowthers quote apocalyptic projections, [the things they call for
simply **will not happen**.]{.underline}

### Sustainable -- Dematerialization

#### Capitalism causes [dematerialization]{.underline} which solves sustainability 

**Zitelmann 21** -- studied history and political sciences, graduating
with a doctorate "summa cum laude" in 1986. His dissertation was
published in both German and English: Hitler. The Policies of Seduction.
Rainer Zitelmann began his career lecturing history at the Freie
Universität Berlin from 1987 to 1992. He then became chief editor at one
of the leading and most prestigious publishing houses in Germany,
Ullstein-Propyläen. He followed this with the role of section editor at
the major German daily newspaper "Die Welt", which he held until 2000.

World?,\" National Interest, 2-12-2021,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/consumption-presumption-are-human-beings-destroying-world-178114)

[Some people claim]{.underline} that [we need to cut our
consumption]{.underline} or there will be no hope for the planet. Such
[[claims]{.mark} are [based]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the thesis that continued growth increases the
rate at which the earth's [[finite resources]{.underline}]{.mark} are
consumed and, moreover, leads to irreversible climate change. And
**[such warnings are [by no means new]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In 1970,
for instance, the Club of Rome attracted a great deal of attention with
the publication of The Limits to Growth. A Report for the Club of Rome's
Project on the Predicament of Mankind, which has to date sold more than
thirty million copies in thirty languages. The book warned people to
change their ways and had a clear message: the world's raw materials,
and in particular, oil would soon be used up. In twenty years, the
scientists predicted, we would have used the very last drop of oil. Of
course, the Club of Rome's models for the depletion of oil---and almost
all other major raw materials---were wrong. [According to the
scenarios]{.underline} presented in The Limits to Growth, [[we
should]{.mark} now [be]{.mark} living on a planet that has been [devoid
of]{.mark} [natural gas, copper]{.mark}, lead, aluminum and tungsten for
decades]{.underline}. And **[we were supposed to have run out of silver
in 1985.]{.underline}** Despite the bleak forecasts, as of January 2020,
the United States Geological Survey estimated silver reserves worldwide
at 560,000 tons. Employing an extensive array of data, the American
scientist Andrew McAfee proves in his book More from Less that
**[[economic growth]{.mark} is [no longer]{.mark} [coupled to]{.mark}
the [consumption]{.mark} of raw materials.]{.underline}** Data for the
United States, for example, show that [[of seventy-two
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, from aluminum to zinc, **[[only six are
not yet post-peak]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, [[despite
the]{.mark} fact [that the]{.mark} U.S. [economy has grown]{.mark}
strongly]{.underline} in recent years, **[[consumption]{.mark} of many
commodities [is]{.mark} actually [decreasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Back in 2015, the American environmental scientist Jesse Ausubel wrote
an essay, "The Return of Nature: How Technology Liberates the
Environment," showing that [Americans are consuming fewer and fewer raw
materials per capita. [Total consumption]{.mark}]{.underline} of steel,
copper, fertilizer, wood and paper, which had previously always risen in
line with economic growth, **[[had plateaued]{.mark} and was now in
constant decline]{.underline}**. Such [across-the-board
reductions]{.underline} in natural resource consumption are [[only
possible because of]{.mark} much-maligned
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[companies]{.mark} are constantly
[developing more efficient production]{.mark} methods and reducing the
amount of raw materials they consume.]{.underline} Of course, **[they
are]{.underline}** not **[doing this]{.underline}** primarily to protect
the environment but **[[to cut costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What\'s
more, a [constant stream of innovations]{.underline} has
[promoted]{.underline} the trend of miniaturization or
[dematerialization]{.underline}. Just think of your smartphone. How many
devices has your smartphone replaced and how many raw materials did they
use to consume? Nowadays, many people no longer have a fax machine or
street atlas because they have everything they need on their smartphone.
Some even use their phones instead of a wristwatch. You used to need
four separate microphones in your telephone, cassette recorder,
Dictaphone and video camera, today you just need one---in your
smartphone. [The finite nature of the world's natural resources is one
argument against growth]{.underline}, **[[climate change]{.mark} is
another]{.underline}**. Let's take China as an example:
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [emits more CO2 than any other
country]{.underline} in the world and is
**[[building]{.underline}]{.mark}** a number of **[new [nuclear power
plants]{.mark} in order to [achieve carbon neutrality]{.mark} by
2060]{.underline}**. With the new build program well underway, China's
first new-generation nuclear power plant recently went into operation.
In the very near future, China intends to start exporting power plants.
[The latest generation of nuclear power plants is much safer than
earlier models---and can play [a pivotal role]{.mark} in the fight
against climate change]{.underline}. In the United States, Joe
[[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} is already [evaluating]{.underline} the
advantages of small modular reactor (SMR) **[nuclear power
plants]{.underline}**. As the name suggests, SMRs are smaller than
traditional nuclear fission reactors and offer a maximum capacity of
three hundred megawatts. In the [U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, for example, a consortium led by Rolls-Royce has
announced plans to [[build]{.underline}]{.mark} up to sixteen
[[SMR]{.mark} power plants]{.underline}. So far, two reactors of this
type are in operation, both onboard the floating nuclear power plant
"Akademik Lomonosov, which supplies heat and electricity to the Siberian
city of Pevec and its one hundred thousand inhabitants. Anticapitalists
blame capitalism for resource consumption and climate change. But
[[political decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}---[such as]{.underline}
Germany's decision to phase out [nuclear
energy]{.underline}---frequently **[[have a negative impact on climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Telling people to cut their
consumption]{.underline} must seem like [pure mockery to
the]{.underline} hundreds of [millions of [people]{.mark}]{.underline}
around the world who are still [living [in]{.mark} extreme
[poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[What they [need]{.mark}
is]{.underline}** more capitalism and **[[economic
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Just like [in
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, where the number of [people living in
extreme [poverty]{.mark} has [fallen from 88]{.mark} percent [in]{.mark}
19[81]{.mark} [to]{.mark} less than [1]{.mark} percent
[today]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Andrew McAfee's book has an
optimistic message about how we don\'t have to turn back the clocks and
cut our consumption: capitalism and technological progress are allowing
us to steward the world's resources, rather than stripping them bare.

### Tech Inev

#### The technology age is [inevitable]{.underline}. Global capitalism, political momentum, and militarism prove. 

**Kelly '16** (Kevin; 2016; Awarded author, founder of Wired Magazine,
citing data from the past thirty years; Book*, The Inevitable:
Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future*)

In the three decades since then, this [[technological
convergence]{.mark} between communication and computation has **spread,
sped up, blossomed, and [evolved]{.mark}**. The internet]{.underline}/
web/ mobile system has [moved]{.underline} from the fringes of society
(where it was pretty much ignored in 1981) [[to]{.mark} the [center
stage of]{.mark} our modern global [society]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
past 30 years [the social economy based on this technology has had its
ups and downs and seen its heroes come and go, but it is very clear
there have been **large-scale trends** governing what has happened.
These broad historical [trends are crucial because]{.mark} the
**[underlying conditions]{.mark}** that birthed them [are]{.mark}
**still [active and developing]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark} strongly
[suggests]{.mark} that [these trends **will continue to
increase**]{.mark} in the next few decades]{.underline}. [There is
**nothing on the horizon to decrease them.**]{.underline} Even the
forces we might think could derail them, like crime, war, or our own
excesses, also follow these emerging patterns. In this book I describe a
dozen of these inevitable technological forces that will shape the next
30 years. "Inevitable" is a strong word. It sends up red flags for some
people because they object that nothing is inevitable. They claim that
human willpower and purpose can--- and should!--- deflect, overpower,
and control any mechanical trend. In their view, "inevitability" is a
free will cop-out we surrender to. [When the notion of the inevitable is
forged with fancy technology]{.underline}, as I do here[, the objections
to a preordained destiny are even more fierce and
passionate.]{.underline} One definition of "inevitable" is the final
outcome in the classic rewinding thought experiment. If we rewound the
tape of history back to the beginning of time and reran our civilization
from the start again and again, a strong version of inevitability says
that, no matter how many times we reran it, every time we end up with
teenagers tweeting every five minutes in 2016. That's not what I mean. I
mean inevitable in a different way. [[There is **bias in**]{.mark} **the
nature of [technology]{.mark}** [that tilts]{.mark} it [in certain
directions]{.mark} and not others]{.underline}. All things being equal,
[the physics and mathematics that rule the dynamics of technology tend
to favor certain behaviors. These tendencies exist primarily in the
aggregate forces that shape the general contours of technological forms
[and do not govern specifics]{.mark} or particular
instances.]{.underline} For example, [the form of an
internet]{.underline}--- a network of networks spanning the globe---
**[was inevitable]{.underline}**, but the specific kind of internet we
chose to have was not. The internet could have been commercial rather
than nonprofit, or a national system instead of international, or it
could have been secret instead of public. [Telephony]{.underline}---
long-distance electrically transmitted voice messages--- [was
inevitable]{.underline}, but the iPhone was not. The generic form of a
four-wheeled vehicle was inevitable, but SUVs were not. Instant
messaging was inevitable, but tweeting every five minutes was not.
Tweeting every five minutes is not inevitable in another way. [[We are
morphing so fast]{.mark} that [our ability to invent]{.mark} new things
[outpaces the rate we can civilize]{.mark} them.]{.underline} These days
it takes us a decade after a technology appears to develop a social
consensus on what it means and what etiquette we need to tame it. In
another five years we'll find a polite place for twittering, just as we
figured out what to do with cell phones ringing everywhere. (Use silent
vibrators.) Just like that, this initial response will disappear quickly
and we'll see it was neither essential nor inevitable. [The kind of
[inevitability]{.mark} I am speaking of here in the digital realm [is
**the result of momentum**]{.mark}**.** The momentum of an ongoing
technological shift. The strong tides that shaped digital technologies
for the past 30 years will **continue to expand and harden** in the next
30 years]{.underline}. These apply to not just North America, but to the
entire world. Throughout this book I use [examples]{.underline} from the
United States because readers will be more familiar with them, but for
each I could have easily found a corresponding example in India, Mali,
Peru, or Estonia. The true leaders in digital money, for example, [are
in Africa and Afghanistan]{.underline}, where e-money is sometimes the
only functioning currency. [China]{.underline} is way ahead of everyone
else in developing sharing [applications]{.underline} on mobile. But
while [culture]{.underline} can advance or retard the expression, the
[**underlying forces** are universal]{.underline}.

### Cap Solves War

#### Solves Nuclear War

**Bedell, '21** (Denise Bedell has an Honors BA in Psychology at the
University of Windsor and wrote a thesis, Peace Through Profit: How
Capitalism Helps Restore and Revive Former Warzones, This is Capitalism
presented by Stephens Inc.,
<https://www.thisiscapitalism.com/peace-through-profit-how-capitalism-helps-restore-and-revive-former-warzones/>,
2021)

[Meet and Greet Looking more closely at]{.underline} the [experiences of
recent war zones]{.underline} makes clear how **[[capitalism]{.mark} can
[bring together]{.mark} former [opponents]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [By
[improv]{.mark}ing citizens' quality of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}
through economic development, and by creating interdependency through
trade, this can [[reduce]{.mark} the [incentive]{.mark} for nations to
take up arms]{.underline} against their neighbors. [Take the
Balkans.]{.underline} The Balkan peninsula is made up of Croatia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia,
Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and the European part of Turkey. This
[region was a hotbed of conflict when the former Yugoslavia]{.underline}
[broke up at the end of the cold war]{.underline} (and, in fact the
region has a long history of armed conflict). The [[Kosovo]{.mark} War
in 1998-1999, for example,]{.underline} was fought [between the Serbian
Yugoslav authority]{.underline} (by then, Yugoslavia was made up of
Serbia and Macedonia) --- which controlled Kosovo --- [and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army]{.underline} (backed by NATO air support). The
[deadly [conflict]{.mark} saw thousands massacred]{.underline} in what a
U.N. court would later deem a "systematic campaign of terror." Those
dark days are far gone, however, and [these [neighbors now work together
in]{.mark} a virtuous [econ]{.mark}omic [cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Early in 2018, Pristina, [the capital of Kosovo, hosted a four-day trade
fair]{.underline} --- at which [70 of the 174 companies present were
Serbian]{.underline}. "I hope [we will send the signal that the
cooperation is already there]{.underline}," noted Marko Cadez of
Serbia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "The people are working, the
people are employing, making products, making profits --- and that is
most important for our country." Or consider relations between [[India
and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [strategic and military
rivals]{.underline} that [have threatened nuclear war on numerous
occasions.]{.underline} [Despite these tensions]{.underline},
[[bilateral trade]{.mark} between the two]{.underline} countries [[was
worth]{.mark} around [\$2.6 billion]{.mark} in 2016]{.underline},
according to Indian government figures. Unofficial estimates suggest
that it is twice that amount --- and that the potential for trade is
many times greater yet. "[Peace building and peacemaking]{.underline}
[will always be subject to the larger political issues]{.underline}
between India and Pakistan," according to a report in 2017 from the
independent and non-partisan federally mandated United States Institute
of Peace (USIP). But, according to USIP, [economic and trade
cooperation]{.underline} can [offers a path toward greater stability and
peace between the countries]{.underline} --- and across South Asia as a
whole. A research report titled "Pakistan-India Relations: Peace Through
bilateral Trade" --- by Muhammad Ali, Noreen Mujahid and Aziz ur Rehman
of the University of Karachi --- determined that by [increasing
bilateral [trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, it [can [help **resolve political
issues**]{.mark} between the two countries]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} **[reduce poverty]{.underline}**. The report,
published in the European Scientific Journal, noted: "[If Pakistan and
India normalize their economic relations]{.underline}, it will enhance
the formal trade --- and as a result, [both the countries will earn
significant revenue]{.underline}, which is lost due to informal trade."
The authors stated that as formal trade volumes rise, "[both governments
will be compelled to]{.underline} **[normalize their political
relations]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[resolve their border
disputes]{.underline}** [in an amicable manner]{.underline}." Hence ---
[as trade increases]{.underline}, [pressure mounts on the
authorities]{.underline} **[to ensure nothing interferes]{.underline}**
[with those economic ties]{.underline}. Internal Strength
[[Capitalism]{.mark} not only [facilitates peace]{.mark} between
nations]{.underline}, **[but also within them]{.underline}**. [Rwanda
experienced]{.underline} a [horrific genocide in the]{.underline}
[1990s]{.underline}. But [since then]{.underline}, the [country has
undergone a dramatic transformation]{.underline} --- in part, [because
of the hard work of companies that have partnered with the
government]{.underline} and outside agencies **[to [create]{.mark}
sustainable [businesses]{.mark} and industries]{.underline}** [that are
building a stable and growing economy]{.underline}. [One of the many
companies]{.underline} [that]{.underline} has [helped engender peace and
create stability]{.underline} since Rwanda's darkest days [is Westrock
Coffee]{.underline}. CEO Scott Ford's pioneering work has helped to
build a sustainable, free-market system for independent coffee producers
in the country. [Ford espoused]{.underline} [a direct]{.underline} trade
[model]{.underline} --- [paying local smallholder farmers a fair market
value for]{.underline} their [coffee beans]{.underline}. He also built
an agricultural training institute for local farmers, many of whom are
women. As [Ford explained]{.underline}: "[What we are trying to do in
Rwanda]{.underline} [is]{.underline} be the engine that
[help]{.underline}s [them create their own \[economic\]
ecosystem]{.underline}." (read more of his story here). Another example
in Rwanda is [[A]{.mark}frica [I]{.mark}mproved
[F]{.mark}oods]{.underline}, which [specializes in fortified foods to
combat malnutrition]{.underline}. At an event earlier this year to mark
the genocide, [AIF's chief executive]{.underline}, Amar Ali, [[outlined
how business]{.mark} can help [prevent]{.mark} the
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that lead to
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. "At Africa Improved Foods, we want to be
a flagship for Rwanda --- not only in what we build and the products we
produce, but also the way we treat each other," he said. "[Everybody is
a human being first]{.underline}, and should be treated as such ---
[irrespective of gender, race, religion, tribe,]{.underline} or any
other categorization." In September of 2018, AIF received an SDG award
for sustainable consumption (based on the UN's Sustainable Development
Goals) from the Swiss Green Economy Symposium. The award recognized the
company for its innovative joint venture in Rwanda, along with the
government of Rwanda, a consortium of various banks, and the
International Finance Corporation, for promoting local production by
buying farmers' maize and soy yields directly at competitive prices.
[AIF's factory in Kigali]{.underline}, the Rwandan capital, [provides
work to some 300 people]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
local-sourcing program [provides around 24,000 Rwandan farmers with
stable, sustainable income]{.underline}. [Capitalism]{.underline} not
only [creates an environment for peace]{.underline} but [[when
cap]{.mark}italism [stumbles]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [so
do]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [prospects]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[for]{.mark} **international [harmony]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [In
2016]{.underline}, [more]{.underline}]{.mark} [countries
[experienced]{.mark} violent [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} [than at any
time in nearly 30 years]{.underline}. Not coincidentally, trade growth
has been in something of a rut for most of the period since the global
financial crisis. [[In that]{.underline}]{.mark} calamitous
[[year]{.underline}]{.mark} of 2016, [[trade growth]{.underline} [fell
below 3%]{.underline}]{.mark} for the fifth consecutive year.

#### Decline causes nationalism, scapegoating, and diversionary conflict. That turns their racism and inequality impacts.

Development, and received the Wassily Leontief Prize for Advancing the
Frontiers of Economic Thought in 2007. Former senior economics

Research Institute in Berlin "Economic Crisis Can Trigger World War."
<http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/02/economic-crisis-can-trigger-world-war/>.

Economic recovery efforts since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis
have mainly depended on unconventional monetary policies. [As fears rise
of yet another international [financial crisis]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[there are [growing concerns about the increased possibility of
large-scale military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

More worryingly, in [[the current political landscape, prolonged
economic crisis]{.mark}, combined with rising economic inequality,
chauvinistic ethno-populism as well as aggressive jingoist rhetoric,
including threats]{.underline}, **[[could]{.mark} easily [spin out of
control and 'morph' into military conflict, and]{.mark} worse, [world
war.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Crisis responses limited

[The [2008]{.mark}-2009 global financial crisis [almost 'bankrupted'
governments]{.mark} and caused systemic collapse]{.underline}.
[[Policymakers managed to pull the world economy from the brink,]{.mark}
but soon switched from counter-cyclical fiscal efforts to unconventional
monetary measures, [primarily 'quantitative easing' and]{.mark} very
[low]{.mark}, if not negative real [interest
rates]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

But while these monetary interventions averted realization of the worst
fears at the time by turning the US economy around, [they did little to
address underlying economic weaknesses]{.underline}, largely due to the
ascendance of finance in recent decades at the expense of the real
economy. Since then, despite promising to do so, policymakers have not
seriously pursued, let alone achieved, such needed reforms.

Instead, [ostensible structural reformers have taken advantage of the
crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts to further 'casualize'
labour markets]{.underline}. This lack of structural reform has meant
that the unprecedented liquidity central banks injected into economies
has not been well allocated to stimulate resurgence of the real economy.

From bust to bubble

Instead, [easy credit raised asset prices to levels even higher than
those prevailing before 2008]{.underline}. US house prices are now 8%
more than at the peak of the property bubble in 2006, while its
price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in 2008 and in
1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great Depression.

[As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, [another economic
crisis]{.mark} --- possibly [more severe than the last]{.mark}, as the
economy has become less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions
--- [is]{.mark} considered **[likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A decade of
such unconventional monetary policies, with very low interest rates, has
greatly depleted their ability to revive the economy.

The implications beyond the economy of such developments and policy
responses are already being seen. Prolonged economic distress has
worsened public antipathy towards the culturally alien --- not only
abroad, but also within. Thus, [[another round of economic
stress]{.mark} is deemed likely to **[foment unrest, conflict, even
war]{.mark}** as it is blamed on the foreign.]{.underline}

International trade shrank by two-thirds within half a decade after the
US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, at the start of the Great
Depression, ostensibly to protect American workers and farmers from
foreign competition!

Liberalization's discontents

**[Rising economic [insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, inequalities and
deprivation are expected to strengthen ethno-populist and jingoistic
nationalist sentiments, and **[[increase social tensions and turmoil,
especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or
threatened.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Thus, **[[ethno-populist]{.mark} inspired chauvinistic [nationalism may
exacerbate tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[leading to
conflicts]{.mark} and tensions among countries, as in the
1930s.]{.underline} Opportunistic leaders have been blaming such
misfortunes on outsiders and may seek to reverse policies associated
with the perceived causes, such as 'globalist' economic liberalization.

Policies which successfully check such problems may reduce social
tensions, as well as the likelihood of social turmoil and conflict,
including among countries. However, these may also inadvertently
exacerbate problems. The recent spread of anti-globalization sentiment
appears correlated to slow, if not negative per capita income growth and
increased economic inequality.

To be sure, globalization and liberalization are statistically
associated with growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism.
[Declining real incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently
strengthened ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening
economic liberalization itself, both within and among
countries.]{.underline}

Insecurity, populism, conflict

Thomas Piketty has argued that a sudden increase in income inequality is
often followed by a great crisis. Although causality is difficult to
prove, with wealth and income inequality now at historical highs, this
should give cause for concern.

Of course, other factors also contribute to or exacerbate civil and
international tensions, with some due to policies intended for other
purposes. Nevertheless, even if unintended, such developments could
inadvertently catalyse future crises and conflicts.

Publics often have good reason to be restless, if not angry, but the
emotional appeals of ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are
leading to chauvinistic policy measures which only make things worse.

At the international level, despite the world's unprecedented and still
growing interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed as the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist
policies without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual
allies.

Avoiding Thucydides' iceberg

Thus, **[protracted economic distress, [economic conflicts or]{.mark}
another [financial crisis could lead to military confrontation]{.mark}
by the protagonists, [even if unintended.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Less
than a decade after the Great Depression started, the Second World War
had begun as the Axis powers challenged the earlier entrenched colonial
powers.

[They patently ignored Thucydides' warning]{.underline}, in chronicling
the Peloponnesian wars over two millennia before, when the rise of
Athens threatened the established dominance of Sparta!

[Anticipating and addressing such possibilities may well serve to help
avoid otherwise imminent disasters by undertaking pre-emptive collective
action, as difficult as that may be.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism [solves war]{.underline} on a massive scale -- it creates lock-in mechanisms that bind countries together and economically dampens conflict -- robust studies 

**Dafoe 14** (Allan Dafoe & Nina Kelsey; assistant professor in
political science at Yale & research associate in international
economics at Berkeley; Journal of Peace Research, "Observing the
capitalist peace: Examining market-mediated signaling and other
mechanisms,"
http://jpr.sagepub.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/content/51/5/619.full)

[Countries with liberal political and economic systems **rarely use
military force** against each other.]{.underline} This anomalous [peace
has been most prominently attributed to the 'democratic
peace']{.underline} -- the apparent tendency for democratic countries to
avoid militarized conflict with each other (Maoz & Russett, 1993; Ray,
1995; Dafoe, Oneal & Russett, 2013).More recently, however, [scholars
have proposed that the [liberal peace]{.mark} could be]{.underline}
partly (Russett & Oneal, 2001) or [primarily]{.underline} (Gartzke,
2007; but see Dafoe, 2011) **[[attributed to]{.mark} liberal [economic
factors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[such as commercial and financial
interdependence]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In particular, Erik Gartzke,
Quan Li & Charles Boehmer (2001), henceforth referred to as GLB, have
demonstrated that [measures of capital openness have a substantial and
**statistically significant association with peaceful** dyadic
relations]{.underline}. Gartzke (2007[) confirms that this association
is robust to a large variety of model specifications.]{.underline} To
explain this correlation, GLB propose that countries [with [open capital
markets]{.mark} are more able to [credibly signal]{.mark} their [resolve
through]{.mark} **the [bearing of]{.mark} greater economic [costs prior
to]{.mark} the outbreak of [militarized conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
This explanation is novel and plausible, and resonates with the
rationalist view of asymmetric information as a cause of conflict
(Fearon, 1995). Moreover, it implies clear testable predictions on
evidential domains different from those examined by GLB. In this article
[we exploit this opportunity by constructing a confirmatory test of
GLB's theory of **market-mediated signaling**. We first develop an
innovative quantitative case selection technique to identify crucial
cases where the mechanism of market-mediated signaling should be most
easily observed]{.underline}. Specifically, we employ quantitative data
and the statistical models used to support the theory we are probing to
create an impartial and transparentmeans of selecting cases in which the
theory -- as specified by the theory's creators --makes its most
confident predictions.We implement three different case selection rules
to select cases that optimize on two criteria: (1) maximizing the
inferential leverage of our cases, and (2) minimizing selection bias. We
examine these cases for a necessary implication of market-mediated
signaling: that key participants drew a connection between conflictual
events and adverse market movements. Such an inference is a necessary
step in the process by which market-mediated costs can signal resolve.
For evidence of this we examine news media, government documents,
memoirs, historical works, and other sources. We additionally examine
other sources, such as market data, for evidence that economic costs
were caused by escalatory events. Based on this analysis, we assess the
evidence for GLB's theory of market mediated costly signaling. Our
article then considers a more complex heterogeneous effects version of
market-mediated signaling in which unspecified scope conditions are
required for the mechanism to operate. Our design has the feature of
selecting cases in which scope conditions are most likely to be absent.
This allows us to perform an exploratory analysis of these cases,
looking for possible scope conditions. We also consider alternative
potential mechanisms. Our cases are reviewed in more detail in the
online appendix.1 To summarize our results, [our confirmatory test finds
that while **market-mediated signaling may be operative in the most
serious disputes, it was largely absent in the less serious disputes**
that characterize most of the sample of militarized interstate
disputes]{.underline} (MIDs). [This suggests either that other
mechanisms account for the correlation between capital openness and
peace, or that the scope conditions for market-mediated signaling are
restrictive]{.underline}. Of the signals that we observed, **[[strategic
market-mediated signals were]{.mark} relatively more [important]{.mark}
than automatic market-mediated signals in the most serious
conflicts.]{.underline}** [We identify]{.underline} a number of
potential scope conditions, such as that (1) [the conflict must be
driven by bargaining failure arising from uncertainty and (2) the
economic costs need to escalate gradually and need to be substantial,
but less than the expected military costs of conflict]{.underline}.
Finally, there were a number of other explanations that seemed present
in the cases we examined and could account for the capitalist peace:
**[[capital openness is associated with]{.mark} greater [anticipated
economic costs of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [capital openness
leads **third parties** to have a greater stake in the conflict and
therefore be more willing to intervene;]{.underline} a dyadic acceptance
of the status quo could promote both peace and capital openness; and
countries seeking to institutionalize a regional peace might
instrumentally harness the pacifying effects of liberal markets. The
correlation: Open capital markets and peace The empirical puzzle at the
core of this article is the significant and robust correlation noted by
GLB between high levels of capital openness in both members of a dyad
and the infrequent incidence of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs)
and wars between the members of this dyad (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001).
The index of capital openness (CAPOPEN) is intended to capture the
'difficulty states face in seeking to impose restrictions on capital
flows (the degree of lost policy autonomy due to globalization)'
(Gartzke & Li, 2003: 575). CAPOPEN is constructed from data drawn from
the widely used IMF's Annual Reports on Exchange Arrangements and
Exchange Controls; it is a combination of eight binary variables that
measure different types of government restrictions on capital and
currency flow (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 407). The measure of CAPOPEN
starts in 1966 and is defined for many countries (increasingly more over
time). Most of the countries that do not have a measure of CAPOPEN are
communist.2 GLB implement this variable in a dyadic framework by
creating a new variable, CAPOPENL, which is the smaller of the two
dyadic values of CAPOPEN. This operationalization is sometimes referred
to as the 'weak-link' specification since the functional form is
consonant with a model of war in which the 'weakest link' in a dyad
determines the probability of war. CAPOPENL has a negative monotonic
association with the incidence of MIDs, fatal MIDs, and wars (see Figure
1).3 The strength of the estimated empirical association between peace
and CAPOPENL, using a modified version of the dataset and model from
Gartzke (2007), is comparable to that between peace and, respectively,
joint democracy, log of distance, or the GDP of a contiguous dyad
(Gartzke, 2007: 179; Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 412). In summary,
CAPOPENL seems to be an important and robust correlate of peace. The
question of why specifically this correlation exists, however, remains
to be answered. The mechanism: Market-mediated signaling? Gartzke, Li &
Boehmer (2001) argue that the classic liberal account for the pacific
effect of economic interdependence -- that interdependence increases the
expected costs of war -- is not consistent with the bargaining theory of
war (see also Morrow, 1999). GLB argue that 'conventional descriptions
of interdependence see war as less likely because states face additional
opportunity costs for fighting. The problem with such an account is that
it ignores incentives to capitalize on an opponent's reticence to fight'
(Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 400.)4 Instead, GLB (see also Gartzke,
2003; Gartzke & Li, 2003) argue [that financial interdependence could
promote peace by facilitating the sending of **costly signals**. As the
probability of militarized conflict increases, states incur a variety of
automatic and strategically imposed economic costs as a consequence of
escalation toward conflict.]{.underline} [Those states that persist in a
dispute despite these costs will reveal their willingness to tolerate
them, and **hence signal resolve**]{.underline}. [The greater the degree
of economic interdependence, the more a resolved country could
demonstrate its willingness to suffer costs ex ante to militarized
conflict.]{.underline} Gartzke, Li & Boehmer's mechanism implies a
commonly perceived costly signal before militarized conflict breaks out
or escalates: if market-mediated signaling is to account for the
correlation between CAPOPENL and the absence of MIDs, then visible
market-mediated costs should occur prior to or during periods of real or
potential conflict (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001). Thus, the proposed
mechanism should leave many visible footprints in the historical record.
[This theory predicts that these visible signals must arise in any
escalating conflict, involving countries with high capital openness, in
which this mechanism is operative]{.underline} Clarifying the signaling
mechanism Gartzke, Li & Boehmer's signaling mechanism is mostly
conceptualized on an abstract, game-theoretic level (Gartzke, Li &
Boehmer, 2001). In order to elucidate the types of observations that
could inform this theory's validity, we discuss with greater specificity
the possible ways in which such signaling might occur. [A conceptual
classification of costly signals The term signaling connotes an
intentional communicative act by one party directed towards
another]{.underline}. Because the term signaling thus suggests a willful
act, and **[a signal of resolve is only credible if it is
costly]{.underline}**, [scholars have sometimes concluded that states
involved in bargaining under incomplete information could advance their
interests by imposing costs on themselves and thereby signaling their
resolve]{.underline} (e.g. Lektzian & Sprecher, 2007). However, the
game-theoretic concept of signaling refers more generally to any
situation in which an actor's behavior reveals information about her
private information. In fact, [states frequently adopt sanctions with
low costs to themselves and high costs to their rivals because doing so
is often a rational bargaining tactic on other grounds: they are trying
to coerce their rival to concede the issue.]{.underline} [[Bargaining
encounters]{.mark} of this type can be conceptualized as a type of
war-of-attrition game [in which each **actor attempts to coerce the
other through the imposition of escalating costs**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Such encounters also provide the opportunity for signaling: when states
resist the costs imposed by their rivals, **they 'signal' their
resolve.**]{.underline} If at some point one party perceives the
conflict to have become too costly and steps back, that party 'signals'
a lack of resolve. Thus, [this kind of signaling arises as a by-product
of another's coercive attempts.]{.underline} In other words, costly
signals come in two forms: self-inflicted (information about a leader
arising from a leader's intentional or incidental infliction of costs on
himself) or imposed (information about a leader that arises from a
leader's response to a rival's imposition of costs). Additionally,
[costs may arise as an automatic byproduct of escalation towards
military conflict or may be a tool of statecraft that is strategically
employed during a conflict.]{.underline} The automatic mechanism
stipulates that as the probability of conflict increases, **[various
[economic assets will lose value due to the risk of conflict and
investor flight]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However, the occurrence of these
costs may also be intentional outcomes of specific escalatory decisions
of the states, as in the case of deliberate sanctions; in this case they
are strategic. [Finally, at a practical level, [we identify]{.mark}
three different potential kinds of economic costs of militarized
conflict]{.underline} that may be mediated by open capital markets:
[**[capital costs from political risk, monetary coercion, and business
sanctions.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

#### Rapid growth key to [space colonization]{.underline}\-\--extinction.

[Ideally]{.underline}, the [mitigation of climate risks
will]{.underline} **[coincide]{.underline}** [with and]{.underline}
**[contribute]{.underline}** [to the development of improved or even
entirely novel **sources of energy**]{.underline} [that will increase
the **long-term chances of humankind's survival**]{.underline} [by means
of]{.underline} **[[space colonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This
[is]{.mark} **not an un[realistic]{.mark} expectation**]{.underline},
[given that the mitigation of climate risks consists]{.underline}, to a
large degree, [of replacing fossil fuels with other, less harmful
sources of energy]{.underline}. However, [some [climate]{.mark} change
[mitigation]{.mark} strategies might actually]{.underline}
**[[harm]{.mark} the [long-term prospects]{.mark} of
humankind]{.underline}**.

First, [it is possible that dominant climate change
[mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} strategies [[will]{.mark} actively
**[exclude]{.mark}** any form of]{.underline} **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [from the repertoire of climate-friendly
energy sources. Existing and experimental]{.underline} (molten salt)
[fission reactors could play a significant role in replacing
carbon-heavy energy sources]{.underline}, but pro-environmental
attitudes often overlap with anti-nuclear sentiments \[65\]. As a
result, and in combination with other problems such as large-scale
market failures of existing fission reactors (one of the reasons being
that generating electricity from fossil fuels is cheaper) \[66\],
nuclear fission does not currently have significant standing as a
"cleantech" contribution to climate change mitigation. From a long-term
perspective, an unfavorable view of nuclear energy in the context of
climate change might mean that technological progress in the areas of
nuclear fission and fusion might come to a halt (for example, due to
explicit bans or implicit disincentives). [If such a scenario came to
be, our [attempts at **colonizing space** would]{.mark}
almost]{.underline} **[certainly [fail]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [There
are currently no alternatives to **fission** and **fusion**, and it
is]{.underline} **[highly improbable]{.underline}** [that Solar power
alone could suffice for sustaining **extraterrestrial
habitats**]{.underline}.

Second, [there is some probability that climate change mitigation
strategies will **change the social order**]{.underline} [towards
a]{.underline} **[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [philosophy. Degrowth
is a vague socio-economic concept and social movement that]{.underline},
in general, [[calls for]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[contraction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the global and national
economies by means [of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[lower
production]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[[consumption]{.mark}
rates]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, to some degree, to
[more **profound changes**]{.underline} [to the "capitalist" system
of]{.underline} **[economic [production]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[67\].
Degrowth or degrowth-like approaches are being actively considered as
climate risk mitigation strategies \[68, 69\], and [degrowth would
almost certainly be a highly effective measure for mitigating climate
change]{.underline}. After all, if we were to drastically reduce or even
completely eliminate the (industrial) sources of greenhouse gases, [the
amount of greenhouse gases that are being emitted would accordingly
drastically sink. [From]{.mark} the **long-term
[perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} **humankind's
[survival]{.mark}**[, degrowth is **problematic**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in at least two ways. [First, there is a risk that the general
[contraction of]{.mark} economic [activity would]{.mark} also slow
or]{.underline} [**[eliminate progress]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the domain of]{.underline}
[**[energy]{.underline}**, [which would,]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn,
[[reduce]{.mark} the [probability of]{.mark} **successful [space
colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline} [due to an absence of **suitable
energy sources**]{.underline}. [Second, and more fundamental: [If
degrowth were]{.mark} to become [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[dominant]{.mark} societal [paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [it is
**uncertain** whether]{.underline}]{.mark} [the long-term survival of
humankind by means of **[space colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[would be]{.mark} regarded a **[desirable]{.mark} goal**]{.underline}.
[In a literal sense, [establishing]{.mark} **extraterrestrial [colonies
would mean growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [the size of the total human
population would grow,]{.underline} and the area of space-time that
humans occupy would grow.

[In a more philosophical sense, [degrowth might]{.mark} even
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[antithetical to]{.mark} space
[colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Even though both degrowth and
space colonization have a similar moral goal]{.underline} -- [increasing
wellbeing]{.underline} -- , [the ends to that goal are very different.
Within degrowth]{.underline} philosophy, [the goal is,]{.underline}
metaphorically speaking, [not to "live beyond our means": We should
strive for "ecological balance", and such a state should increase
the]{.underline} **[average wellbeing]{.underline}**. [But the frame of
reference is the status quo; Earth and humankind as we know it
**today**. [Space colonization]{.mark},]{.underline} on the other hand,
[[operates with a]{.mark} much]{.underline} [**[larger frame]{.mark}**
of reference]{.underline}: **[[All]{.mark} the [future
generations]{.mark} of humans]{.underline}** (and other sentient beings)
[who could enjoy wellbeing if we succeed in colonizing
space]{.underline} -- [and who will categorically be **[denied]{.mark}
that [wellbeing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[if we fail to colonize]{.mark}
space]{.underline} \[70\]. [The goal of space colonization as a **moral
project**]{.underline} [is not to live beyond our means, but to actively
**redefine** and]{.underline} **[expand]{.underline}** [what our means
are through scientific and **technological progress**]{.underline}.

#### Cap gets us [off the rock]{.underline} and solves [every impact]{.underline}.

**Thiessen '20** -- writes a twice-weekly column for The Post on foreign
and domestic policy. He is a fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, and the former chief speechwriter for President George W.
Bush. (Marc A., \"SpaceX's success is one small step for man, one giant

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/01/spacexs-success-is-one-small-step-man-one-giant-leap-capitalism/)

[It was one small step for man, one [giant leap for
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Only three countries have ever launched
human beings into orbit. This past weekend, **[SpaceX became the first
private company ever to do so]{.underline}**, when it sent its Crew
Dragon capsule into space aboard its Falcon 9 rocket and docked with the
International Space Station. [This was accomplished by a company Elon
Musk started in 2002 in a California strip mall warehouse with just a
dozen employees and a mariachi band]{.underline}. [At a time when our
nation is debating the merits of socialism[, **SpaceX**]{.mark} **has
given us [an incredible testament to]{.mark} the power of
[American]{.mark} free [enterprise]{.mark}.**]{.underline} While the
left is advocating unprecedented government intervention in almost every
sector of the U.S. economy, from health care to energy, today [Americans
are celebrating the successful privatization of space
travel.]{.underline} If you want to see the difference between what
government and private enterprise can do, consider: **[It [took a
private company to give us]{.mark} the first [space vehicle]{.mark} with
touch-screen controls instead of antiquated knobs and buttons. It took a
private company to give us [a capsule that can fly]{.mark} entirely
autonomously from launch to landing --- including docking --- without
any participation by its human crew. It also took a private company to
invent [a reusable rocket]{.mark} that can not only take off but land as
well.]{.underline}** When the Apollo 11 crew reached the moon on July
20, 1969, Neil Armstrong declared "the Eagle has landed." On Saturday,
SpaceX was able to declare that the Falcon had landed when its rocket
settled down on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean --- ready to be used
again. That last development will save the taxpayers incredible amounts
of money. [[The cost to NASA]{.mark} for launching a man into space on
the space shuttle orbiter was [\$170 million]{.mark} per seat, compared
with just \$[60 million]{.mark} to \$67 million [on the Dragon]{.mark}
capsule.]{.underline} The cost for the space shuttle to send a kilogram
of cargo into to space was \$54,500; with the Falcon rocket, the cost is
just \$2,720 --- a decrease of 95 percent. And while the space shuttle
cost \$27.4 billion to develop, the Crew Dragon was designed and built
for just \$1.7 billion --- making it the lowest-cost spacecraft
developed in six decades. [SpaceX did it in six years --- far faster
than the time it took to develop the space shuttle]{.underline}. [The
[private sector does it better, cheaper, faster and more
efficiently]{.mark} than government. [Why?
**Competition**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Today, SpaceX has to compete
with a constellation of private companies --- including legacy aerospace
firms such as Orbital ATK and United Launch Alliance and innovative
start-ups such as Blue Origin (which is designing a Mars lander and
whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Post) and Virgin Orbit (which is
developing rockets than can launch satellites into space from the
underside of a 747, avoiding the kinds of weather that delayed the
Dragon launch). [In the race to put the first privately launched man
into orbit, upstart SpaceX had to beat aerospace behemoth Boeing and its
Starliner capsule to the punch]{.underline}. It did so --- for more than
\$1 billion less than its competitor. **[That [spirit of
competition]{.mark} and innovation will [revolutionize space
travel]{.mark} in the years ahead]{.underline}**. Indeed, Musk has his
sights set far beyond Earth orbit. [Already, [SpaceX is working
on]{.mark} a much larger version of the Falcon 9 reusable rocket called
Super Heavy that will carry a deep-space capsule named Starship capable
of carrying up to 100 people to the moon and eventually to
Mars.]{.underline} Musk's goal --- the reason he founded SpaceX --- is
to [**colonize Mars and [make humanity a multiplanetary
species]{.mark}**. He has set a goal of founding a million-person city
on Mars [by 2050]{.mark} complete with iron foundries and pizza
joints]{.underline}. Can it be done? Who knows. But this much is
certain: **[[Private-sector innovation]{.mark} is [opening the
door]{.mark} to a new era of space exploration.]{.underline}** [Wouldn't
it be ironic if, just as capitalism is allowing us to explore the
farthest reaches of our solar system, Americans decided to embrace
socialism back here on Earth?]{.underline}

SpaceX. Private corporations. [[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Seeing this article in the news, [reading]{.underline} day after day
[[the story of budget cuts]{.mark} to N.A.S.A.]{.underline} in regards
to deep-space exploration and other related programs, [got me thinking
about]{.underline} just [how important it will be for private
companie]{.underline}s and corporations [to undertake these
projects]{.underline}...[such as]{.underline} Elon Musk's
[[SpaceX,]{.mark} and [countless others]{.mark}]{.underline} (read the
full list here).

The problem is that [we have gotten it into our heads that Capitalism is
the root cause of our economic woes]{.underline} in the United States,
perhaps [failing to understand that]{.underline} such policies are
something like a double-edged sword: [they [could]{.mark} also [be our
salvation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This article provides a great list of the pro's and con's of Capitalism.
I would recommend you take the short passing of time it requires to read
it through-and-through before continuing.

Now then.

I have never been for for fully-unhindered Capitalism. [I do not believe
that the government should stay out of economic affairs
entirely]{.underline}, for as provided in the article many of the con's
relate to improper regulation (monopolization) as opposed to something
fundamentally wrong, [but I do not believe that any government should be
going about shoving their claws into every economic affair either. There
must be a healthy balance]{.underline}, especially [if Capitalism is to
work as it is supposed to work]{.underline}. The same goes for any
policy. The government should be there to bolster competition between
businesses...not favor one or bail-out the other. The more regulation,
the more interference or amendment, the less it works...but this mix of
regulation and free market must fall in the "goldilocks zone" if the
citizens of said society are to reap its full benefit.

[If not, like planets about a star, the society shall either burn or
freeze]{.underline}.

[One of those benefits is highlighted by]{.underline} Elon Musk's
[[SpaceX]{.mark}: the intervention of [private]{.mark}ly-funded
[companies to do things]{.mark} that a traditional [government]{.mark}
agency [cannot.]{.mark} Namely, the exploration and]{.underline}
eventual [[colonization of Mars]{.mark} in a reasonable, step-by-step
timeframe]{.underline}...[[unlike the]{.mark} "we will get to it
eventually" mindset plaguing]{.underline} the bowels of [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[[government]{.underline}]{.mark}. Were not the policies in place to
foster the growth of private companies, our best chance at getting
people out of Earth-orbit --- the Bush-approved, now-cancelled,
insanely-expensive Constellation program --- would have gone the way of
promises and well-wishes.

It is my hope that Elon Musk and space entrepreneurs like him are not
simply blowing steam, and that one day --- perhaps even within my
lifetime --- I could be on my way to a space hotel on the Moon, flying
aboard a space airliner with the name of a private company plastered
across the side.

[Regardless, [if we humans are to]{.mark} truly [become a multi-planet
species]{.mark} [we must not hinder]{.mark} [economic growth]{.mark}
with narrow thoughts. We must not become confused that the "[problems
down here" and the "problem of getting out there" must be in
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}; they do not need to, and we must not
suppose they should. They are two separate issues with two unique sets
of problems, and thus [this policy of taking resources from one to give
to the other will only ensure that neither issue is given that which it
needs]{.underline}, or enough to fix what must be solved.

### Good -- Warming

#### Cap solves warming -- sustainable, private-industry tech key, alt fails and results in transition wars.

**Smith 19** (Noah Smith; PhD in economics from the University of
Michigan and Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He was an assistant professor
of finance at Stony Brook University; 4/5/19; \"Dumping Capitalism Won't
Save the Planet\";
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism;
Bloomberg)

It has become fashionable on social media and in certain publications to
argue that capitalism is killing the planet. Even renowned investor
Jeremy Grantham, hardly a radical, made that assertion last year. The
basic idea is that the profit motive drives the private sector to spew
carbon into the air with reckless abandon. Though many economists and
some climate activists believe that the problem is best addressed by
modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, many activists believe
that the problem can't be addressed without rebuilding the economy along
centrally planned lines. [The climate threat is certainly dire, and
**carbon taxes** are **unlikely** to be enough to **solve** the problem.
But **[eco-socialism]{.mark}** is probably [**not** going to be]{.mark}
**an [effective]{.mark} method** of addressing that threat.
**[Dismantling]{.mark}** an **entire economic system** [is **never
easy**]{.mark}, and probably [would **touch off armed conflict**]{.mark}
and **[major political upheaval]{.mark}**. In the scramble to win those
battles, even the **[socialists]{.mark}** would almost **certainly
[abandon]{.mark}** their **limitation** on fossil-fuel use --- either to
support military efforts, or to keep the population from turning against
them. The precedent here is the Soviet Union]{.underline}, whose
multidecade effort to reshape its economy by force amid confrontation
with the West led to profound environmental degradation. [The
**[world\'s climate does not have several decades]{.mark}** to spare.
**Even without international conflict**]{.underline}, there's [**[little
guarantee]{.mark}** that **[moving away]{.mark} from capitalism** would
**[mitigate]{.mark}** our **impact** on the environment. Since
**[socialist]{.mark}** leader Evo Morales took power in
**Bolivia**]{.underline}, living standards have improved substantially
for the average Bolivian, which is great. But this has come at the cost
of **[[higher emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Meanwhile, the
**[capitalist]{.mark} U.S** managed to **[decrease]{.mark}** its per
capita **[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} a bit [during this same
period]{.underline} (though since the U.S. is a rich country, its
absolute level of emissions is much higher). In other words, in terms of
economic growth and carbon emissions, Bolivia looks similar to more
capitalist developing countries. That suggests that faced with a choice
of enriching their people or helping to save the climate, even socialist
leaders will often choose the former. And that same political calculus
will probably hold in China and the U.S., the world's top carbon
emitters --- leaders who demand draconian cuts in living standards in
pursuit of environmental goals will have trouble staying in power. [The
**[best hope]{.mark}** for the climate therefore lies in [**reducing**
the **tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon
emissions**]{.mark}. That **[requires tech]{.mark}nology** ---
[**solar**, **wind** and **nuclear**]{.mark} **power**, [**energy
storage**, **electric cars**]{.mark} and other vehicles,
[carbon-free]{.mark} cement production and so on. The [best]{.mark}
climate policy [plans all involve tech]{.mark}nological improvement as a
key feature.]{.underline} Recent developments show that the
[**technology-centered approach [can work]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A
recent report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyzed about [**7000
projects** in **46 countries**, and found that **[large drops in the
cost]{.mark}** of solar power from photovoltaic systems, wind power and
lithium-ion batteries have made utility-scale renewable electricity
competitive with fossil fuels. A **76 percent decline** in the cost of
energy for short-term battery storage since 2012 is especially
important.]{.underline} In a blog post, futurist and energy writer Ramez
Naam underscores the significance of these developments. Naam notes the
important difference between renewables being cheap enough to outprice
new fossil-fuel plants, and being inexpensive enough to undercut
existing plants. The former is already the case across much of the
world, which is among the reasons for an 84 percent decrease in the
number of new coal-fired plants worldwide since 2015. But when it
becomes cheaper to scrap existing fossil-fuel plants and build
renewables in their place, it will allow [**[renewables]{.mark}** to
start [**replacing** **coal** and **gas**]{.mark} much more
quickly.]{.underline} Naam cites examples from Florida and Indiana where
this is already being done. He cites industry predictions that replacing
existing fossil-fuel plants with renewables will be economically
efficient almost everywhere at some point in the next decade.
Electricity is far from the only source of carbon emissions --- there's
also transportation, manufacturing (especially of steel and cement),
home and office heating, and agriculture to worry about. But [the [rapid
advance]{.mark} of **solar** **technology** is a huge victory in the
struggle against climate change, because it will allow people all over
the world to have electricity without cooking the planet. And
[how]{.mark} was this victory achieved? A [combination]{.mark} of
**smart [government policy]{.mark}** [and **private
industry**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Massachusetts Institute of Technology
researchers Goksin Kavlak, James McNerney and Jessika Trancik in a
recent paper evaluated the factors behind the solar-price decline from
1980 to 2012. [They concluded that from 1980 to 2001, government-funded
research and development was the main factor in bringing down costs, but
from 2001 to 2012, the **[biggest factor was economies of
scale]{.mark}**. These economies of scale were **[driven by private
industry increasing output]{.mark}**, but with government subsidies
helping to increase the incentive to ramp up production.]{.underline}
It's apparent, therefore, [that **[both government and profit-seeking
enterprises]{.mark}** have their **[roles to play.]{.mark}** Government
funds the development of early-stage technology and then helps push the
private sector toward adopting those technologies, while [**private
companies** compete to **find ever-cheaper methods**]{.mark} of
implementation. Instead of eco-socialism, it's **eco-industrialism**.
[If there's **any system that can beat climate change, this looks like
it.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: Inequality

#### Inequality is decreasing at [unprecedented rates]{.underline} by [every metric]{.underline}.

Fewer Resources---and What Happens Next*, Chapter 10, pg 235-240,
Kindle, dml)

In 2016 the economist and columnist Noah Smith reviewed [the evidence on
**poverty around the world**]{.underline}, and his conclusion was
notably exuberant: \"This [is]{.underline} incredible---[**nothing short
of a miracle**. Nothing like this has **ever happened before** in
recorded history]{.underline}.\" A graph created by Max Roser clearly
reveals the \"miracle\" Smith was talking about, and how right he was
that [the improvement is **without precedent**]{.underline}. The graph
doesn\'t show the percentage of people living in poverty, but instead
something even more important: the total number of extremely poor people
on earth.

The World\'s War on Poverty

[The **total number of poor people** in the world]{.underline} peaked
right at the time of the first Earth Day in 1970, then [started to
**slowly decrease**]{.underline}. But the real miracle came when
[this]{.underline} happy [decline **accelerated** during the twenty-
first century. In **1999**, **1.76 billion** people were living in
extreme poverty. Just **sixteen years later**, this number had
**declined by 60 percent**, to **705 million**]{.underline}. Hundreds of
millions fewer people are living in poverty now than in 1820, when the
world\'s total population was seven times smaller than it is today.

[Much of this decline is reflective of what occurred in **China**,
which]{.underline}, as we saw in the previous chapter, threw off
economic socialism beginning in 1978 and [**let capitalism work its
poverty-reducing miracles**. But the story of global poverty reduction
**isn\'t a purely Chinese one**]{.underline}. As the graph below shows,
[**every region around the world** has seen **large poverty reductions**
in recent years]{.underline}. The speed of the recent decline indicates
that [it\'s **no longer ridiculous** to talk about **completely
eliminating extreme poverty** from the planet]{.underline}. The World
Bank thinks [this might be possible by **2030**]{.underline}.

[It\'s **not just incomes** that have improved]{.underline}. As I
consult Our World in Data and other **[comprehensive sources of
evidence]{.underline}**, I [**struggle** to find **even a single
important measure** of human material well-being that\'s **not getting
better** in most regions around the world]{.underline}.

One Thing We Say to Death: Not Today

By now the pattern should be familiar: [**life expectancy** at birth has
**gone up around the world**]{.underline} in recent decades:

As we saw in chapter 1, [global life expectancy was about **28.5 years
in 1800**. Over the next 150 years, that number **increased by 20
years**. Then]{.underline}, in the years between 1950 and 2015, it
increased [by **25 more**. These gains are **now
universal**]{.underline}; Southern Africa has regained the 10 years of
expected life lost during its terrifying AIDS crisis.

[One of the reasons life expectancy has **gone up so quickly** is the
**collapse** in both **child** and **maternal mortality** around the
world]{.underline}:

![Chart, line chart Description automatically
generated](media/image14.png){width="3.356687445319335in"
height="2.4763287401574803in"}

[I find these mortality declines **especially fast**, **large**, and
**broad**]{.underline}. Today, [we **still have desperately poor
regions**, **failed states**, and the **decimations of war**. But in
**no region today** is the child mortality rate **higher** than the
world\'s average rate was in **1998**]{.underline}.

Convergent

Trends in maternal and child mortality highlight a critical fact that\'s
often overlooked: [**around the world**, inequality in **most important
measures** of human material well-being is **decreasing**. Poor
countries are **catching up** to rich ones, and **gaps** that were once
large are **shrinking**. Inequalities in income and wealth dominate the
news, and in many places these gaps are large and growing]{.underline}.
They re also important, so well look at economic inequality in the next
two chapters.

[But]{.underline} it\'s true, too, that [there are **other kinds of
inequality** that we should care about as we examine the human
condition: inequalities in **health**, **education**, **diet**,
**sanitation**, and other things that **matter deeply** for the quality
of a person\'s life. Here the news is **profoundly good**; these
inequalities are **collapsing**]{.underline}. As the four horsemen have
galloped around the world in recent decades, they\'ve made life better
not only for those people and countries that were already rich but for
just about everyone else. [**Everywhere**, **fewer mothers** and
**babies are dying**, more kids are **getting an education**, more
people have **adequate nutrition** and **sanitation**.]{.underline}

[It\'s **essential to acknowledge these global victories** because they
show us that **what we\'re doing is working**]{.underline}. Tech
progress, **[capitalism]{.underline}**, public awareness, and responsive
government [are **spreading around the world** and **improving
it**]{.underline}. It\'s often said that insanity is doing the same
thing over and over but expecting different results. The corollary might
be that ignorance is not examining the results of what\'s being done.
Over and over, when we look at the evidence, we see that the four
horsemen are improving our world.

### Permutation

#### The perms solve best -- restructuring capitalism is possible

**Mazzucato '21** \[Mariana; Jan 28; Professor in the Economics of
Innovation and Public Value at University College London where she is
the founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public
Purpose; "Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism," p.
204-10\]

This book has applied what I believe is the immensely powerful idea of a
mission to solving the 'wicked' problems we face today. In it, I have
argued that [tackling grand challenges will only happen if we reimagine
**government as a prerequisite for restructuring capitalism** in a way
that is inclusive, sustainable and **driven by
innovation**.]{.underline}

First and foremost, this means reinventing government for the
twenty-first century -- equipping it with the tools, organization and
culture it needs to drive a mission-oriented approach. It also means
bringing purpose to the core of corporate governance and taking a very
broad stakeholder position across the economy. It means changing the
relationship between public and private sectors, and between them and
civil society, so they all work symbiotically for a common goal. The
reason for the emphasis on rethinking government is simple: **[only
government has the capacity to bring about transform]{.underline}**ation
**[on the scale needed.]{.underline}** The relationship between economic
actors and civil society shows our problems at their most profound, and
this is what we must unravel.

[We can start by recognizing that capitalist markets are an outcome of
how each actor in the system is organized and governed, and how the
different actors relate to one another]{.underline}. This holds for the
private and public sectors and for other sectors such as non-profits.
**[No particular kind of market behaviour is inevitable]{.underline}**.
[For example, the market pressure often cited as forcing a business to
neglect the long term in favour of the short term, as too many companies
do today, is the product of a particular organization of the
market]{.underline}. **[Nor is there anything inevitable in government
bureaucracies]{.underline}** [being too slow to react to challenges such
as digital platforms and climate change.]{.underline} Rather, [both are
outcomes of agency, actions and **governance** structures that are
chosen inside organizations, as well as the legal and institutional
relationships between them. It is all down to design within and between
organizations.]{.underline}

Capitalism is, indeed, in crisis. But the good news is that we can do
better. We know from the past that public and private actors can come
together to do extraordinary things. I have reflected on how, fifty
years ago, going to the moon and back required public and private actors
to invest, to innovate and to collaborate night and day for a common
purpose. Imagine if that [collaborative purpose]{.underline} today was
to [build a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism: green production
and consumption]{.underline}, [less inequality]{.underline}, greater
personal fulfilment, **[resilient health care]{.underline}** and healthy
ageing, sustainable mobility and digital access for all. But small,
incremental changes will not get us to those outcomes. We must have the
courage and conviction to lift our gaze higher -- to lead transformative
change that is as imaginative as it is ambitious, aiming for something
far more ambitious than sending a man to the moon.

To do this successfully, [governments need to invest in their internal
capabilities -- building the competence and confidenc]{.underline}e to
think boldly, partner with business and civil society, catalyse new
forms of collaboration across sectors, and [deploy instruments that
reward actors willing to engage with the difficulties]{.underline}. The
task is neither to pick winners nor to give unconditional handouts,
subsidies and guarantees, but to pick the willing. And missions are
about making markets, not only fixing them. They're about imagining new
areas of exploration. They're about [**taking risks**, not only
'de-risking']{.underline}. And if this means making mistakes along the
way, so be it. Learning through trial and error is critical for any
value-creation exercise. [Ambitious missions also have the courage to
tilt the playing field.]{.underline}

If [government]{.underline} is indeed a value creator that is driven by
public purpose, its [policies should reflect and reinforce]{.underline}
that. Too many green policies today are just minor adjustments to a
trajectory that still favours the old waste-prone behaviours and the
financial casino that worsens inequality. [A healthy economy that works
for the whole of society must tilt the playing field consistently to
reward behaviours that help us achieve agreed and desirable
goals.]{.underline} That means achieving [coherence in a **multiplicity
of fields**]{.underline}, from **[taxes]{.underline}** to
**[regulation]{.underline}**, from **[business law]{.underline}** to the
**[social safety net]{.underline}**.

As emphasized throughout the book, [it is key to not pretend that social
missions are the same as technological ones]{.underline}. With
challenges that are more 'wicked' it is essential that moonshot thinking
is linked with support to underlying government systems. For example, a
[moonshot around]{.underline} disease testing or **[health
priorities]{.underline}** [must interact closely with the public-health
system, not **replace** or **circumvent** it]{.underline}. Similarly, a
moonshot around [clean growth]{.underline} must [interact with transport
systems and planning authorities and understand behavioural
change]{.underline}. Thus it is [critical to]{.underline} perceive
missions not as siloed projects but as being intersectoral, bottom-up,
and [building on existing]{.underline} systems (such as **[innovation
systems]{.underline}**, among others).

Governments cannot pursue missions alone. They must work alongside
purpose-driven businesses to achieve them. As I've argued in this book,
this requires addressing one of the biggest [dilemmas of modern
capitalism]{.underline}: **[restructuring business]{.underline}** [so
that private profits are reinvested back into the economy rather than
being used for short-term financialized purposes]{.underline}. Missions
can accelerate this shift by shaping expectations about where business
opportunities lie and also getting a better return for public
investment. In this sense they can begin to walk the talk of stakeholder
value. This means creating a more symbiotic form of partnership and
collaboration in different sectors, whether in health, energy or digital
platforms. A market-shaping perspective requires governing these
interactions so that intellectual property rights, data privacy, pricing
of essential medicines and taxation all reflect what needs to happen to
reach the common objective. [In health that must mean health innovation
driven by the mission of better health care for all; in energy it must
mean divestment from fossil fuels and the creation of public goods like
green infrastructure and green production systems]{.underline} that
protect the earthly oasis that Armstrong referred to; and in the digital
domain it must mean the use of [digitalization to improve the access of
all people to the power of the technologies of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- while ensuring both data privacy and that our
welfare states are strengthened, not weakened, by digital platforms.

**[Doing capitalism differently]{.underline}** [requires reimagining the
full potential of a public sector driven by public purpose --
democratically defining clear goals]{.underline} that society needs to
meet by investing and **[innovating together]{.underline}**. It requires
a fundamentally new relationship between all economic actors willing and
able [to tackle complexity to achieve outcomes that matter.]{.underline}

[Growing distrust of capitalism follows from]{.underline} its failure to
address major [socioeconomic challenges]{.underline}, not least [climate
change and inequalities]{.underline} in opportunity, income, and wealth.
While private [incentives under capitalism are good at stimulating
**efficiency, growth, and innovation**]{.underline}, [they]{.underline}
also [generate unequal income]{.underline} and wealth distributions
(even in a context of intense competition), often at odds with social
norms of fairness. Moreover, [capitalist systems tend to underinvest in
public goods]{.underline} like education, health care, and social
insurance -- all critical factors in the pandemic response -- while also
discounting negative externalities such as greenhouse-gas emissions.

[These shortcomings of capitalism]{.underline} are predictable, but they
[are **remediable through public policies and institutions**. Tax and
transfer policies and minimum wages]{.underline} can reduce income and
wealth disparities, just as [public investment in education, training,
and health care can enhance opportunity]{.underline} by providing access
to good jobs and fostering the creation of new enterprises. Likewise, [a
price on carbon dioxide and regulations limiting or banning carbon
emissions]{.underline} can help the world avert the existential threat
of climate change.

[Critics of capitalism]{.underline} often [miss]{.underline}
([or]{.underline} choose to [ignore]{.underline}) [that there is **no
single canonical model**]{.underline}. [Europe's]{.underline} various
["social market" models differ]{.underline} significantly [from the
neoliberal variant in the US.]{.underline} And even within the US, there
are important differences between states and localities.

Some of these distinctions have been highlighted in the responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic and recession. All advanced economies have deployed
unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus in the face of
"K-shaped" or "dual" recessions in which lower-wage workers have
suffered disproportionately more than other cohorts. Unlike the US,
[Germany and several other European countries have deployed measures
specifically designed to keep as many workers as possible in their
jobs]{.underline}. Because these countries have generous social
insurance and benefits, including sick leave and family leave, workers
and their families have been able to cope with both COVID-19 and sudden
drops in their incomes.

Differences in national health-care models have also become more
apparent. Unlike European capitalist systems that provide universal
coverage, 14.5% of America's non-elderly population (ages 18-64) remains
uninsured. Moreover, owing to America's heavy reliance on employer-based
insurance, the pandemic has pushed at least 15 million more workers at
least temporarily into the uninsured pool.

With their strong public-health systems, many European countries were
also better equipped to carry out widespread testing and vaccine
distribution. The US, meanwhile, has utterly failed to contain the
virus, and is now delegating the vaccination campaign to under-resourced
state and local authorities.

In another contrast with the US, Europe has dedicated about one-third of
its massive stimulus program to investments aligned with its commitment
to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. America's federal stimulus
measures have been silent on climate with few conditions of any kind.

Within the US, individual states' responses to the COVID-19 crisis
reflect different variants of capitalism. In California, Governor Gavin
Newsom's recent 2021-22 budget proposal reveals some distinctive
features. In terms of health-care coverage, California remains a
national leader with a Medicaid program covering more than 13 million
people. Despite the pandemic-induced recession, the state is increasing
its minimum wage to \$14 per hour in 2021, on track to realize the
target of \$15 per hour in 2022 for all businesses employing 26 or more
workers; many municipalities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco,
have already achieved or exceeded the \$15 target. (On January 1, 2021,
20 other states also raised their minimum wages, whereas the US federal
minimum wage has remained unchanged at \$7.25 per hour since 2009.)

California has also expanded coverage of its Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) and Young Child Tax Credit to include undocumented workers who
are otherwise denied the benefits of federal stimulus packages.
Together, these tax credits applied to 3.6 million California households
in 2020, adding \$1 billion in total income. The state also passed new
legislation significantly expanding unpaid family-leave rights.
Employers with as few as five employees now must provide this option as
well as more time for paid sick leave for workers forced to self-isolate
or quarantine as a result of COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis.

Looking ahead, Newsom has proposed an additional \$600 one-time cash
payment to all taxpayers who are eligible for the state's EITC in 2021.
His proposed 2021-22 budget also earmarks \$372 million to expedite the
distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and includes \$4.5 billion for
programs to drive economic growth and job creation once restrictions on
normal activities have been lifted. These programs include \$575 million
in grants to small businesses and nonprofits, in addition to the \$500
million for such grants implemented in late 2020 amid forced business
closures. The proposal also allocates up to an additional \$50 million
for the California Rebuilding Fund, a public-private partnership, to
support up to an additional \$125 million of low-interest loans to
underserved small businesses throughout the state.

California's distinctive approach to market capitalism also emphasizes
climate sustainability, using both carbon pricing and efficiency
standards to achieve ambitious decarbonization targets. Under a 2018
state law, 60% of electricity must come from renewable resources by
2030, and 100% by 2045. California runs the world's fourth-largest
cap-and-trade system and will be setting even lower caps (and thus a
higher carbon price) next month. In September 2020, Newsom announced an
executive order requiring that zero-emission vehicles account for 100%
of new car sales by 2035. His proposed budget seeks \$1.5 billion to
accelerate the infrastructure investment needed to achieve this goal.

President-elect Joe [Biden has just announced a \$1.9 trillion emergency
rescue plan to counter the pandemic's surge and provide substantial
relief to workers, families, small businesses, and state and local
governments]{.underline}. Prompt congressional passage of this plan is a
critical first step in the renovation of America's outdated neoliberal
version of capitalism. As the economy recovers from the deep and uneven
COVID-19 recession, [the US must "build back better"]{.underline} by
strengthening its social safety net, increasing public investment in
education, health care, and other public goods, and rejoining the global
charge against climate change. **[Lessons from the more successful
variants of market capitalism in Europe and California point the way
forward.]{.underline}**

### AT: Cyber

#### Cyber threat is [legitimate]{.underline}\-\--means and motive exist. 

**Wintch '21** \[Timothy; April 30; active-duty major in the United
States Air Force, M.A. in Military Studies from the American Military
University; Homeland Security Today, "Perspective: Cyber and Physical
Threats to the U.S. Power Grid and Keeping the Lights on,"
<https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/>\]

[Among **critical infrastructure**]{.underline} sectors [in the U.S.,
**energy** is]{.underline} perhaps the most [crucial]{.underline} of the
16 sectors defined by the Department of Homeland Security. [This
sector]{.underline} is so vital because it [provides the energy
**necessary** to run **every other** critical infrastructure
sector]{.underline}. However, [the U.S. **power grid**, the **backbone**
of the]{.underline} energy [sector, is built upon an **aging skeleton**
that is becoming **increasingly vulnerable** every day. Whether from
**terrorists** or]{.underline} nation-states like [**Russia** and
**China**, the]{.underline} power grid [is susceptible]{.underline} to
not just physical attacks, but also [to cyber intrusion]{.underline} as
well. However, much of this threat can be mitigated if the U.S. takes
the appropriate steps to safeguard the power grid and avoid a potential
catastrophe in the future.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism on U.S. soil has been at the forefront
of American consciousness. [**C**ritical **i**nfrastructure provides an
**appealing target** because of the **disproportionally** large impact
even a **small attack** can have on]{.underline} the
[sectors]{.underline}. In particular, [the power grid represents
a]{.underline} particularly [lucrative target]{.underline}, both [in
terms of]{.underline} the [**ease of access** and the **large
impact**]{.underline} it can make. The National Research Council stated
that [the]{.underline} U.S. power [grid is "**vulnerable** to
intelligent **multi-site attacks** by]{.underline} knowledgeable
[attackers intent on causing **maximum**]{.underline} physical
[damage]{.underline} to key components [on a **wide geographical
scale**."]{.underline}[\[1\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn1)
Additionally, the physical security of transmission and distribution
systems is difficult due to the dispersed nature of these key
components, which in turn is advantageous to attackers as it reduces the
likelihood of their
capture.[\[2\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn2)
From 2002-2012, approximately 2,500 physical attacks occurred against
transmission lines and towers worldwide and approximately 500 attacks
against transformer
substations.[\[3\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn3)
[Terrorists have the **motivation** to attack the]{.underline} U.S.
power [grid]{.underline} but [the **very nature** of the **grid** makes
it **highly vulnerable**. The power grid is]{.underline} not only [at
risk from]{.underline} physical attacks, but also [nation-state
**cyberattacks**]{.underline}.

[One nation that has]{.underline} shown [both the **capability** and
**intent**]{.underline} to use attacks against critical energy
infrastructure [is **Russia**]{.underline}, as demonstrated in their
2015 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. A Russian cyber threat group
known as Sandworm, which used its BlackEnergy malware, attacked
Ukrainian computer systems that provide remote control of the Ukraine
power
grid.[\[4\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn4)
This attack, and another in 2016, each left the capital Kiev without
power, prompting cyber experts to raise concern about the same malware
already existing in NATO and the U.S. power
grids.[\[5\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn5)
In any conflict between Russia and NATO, not only would similar
cyberattacks pose a threat, but so would potential physical attacks
severing fuel oil and natural gas lines to Western Europe. [Russia
has]{.underline} both [the capability and intent to **attack** critical
infrastructure, particularly **power grids**, during **future
conflicts** in their "**hybrid warfare**"]{.underline} approach.

[Another nation]{.underline} that has the capability to attack critical
energy infrastructure [is **China**]{.underline}, representing a threat
to not just the U.S. energy infrastructure but also that of our allies
whose support would be vital in a major conflict. A recent NATO report
highlighted this threat from China's Belt and Road Initiative, stating
that ["\[China's\]]{.underline} foreign direct [investment in strategic
sectors]{.underline} \[such as energy generation and distribution\]
[...raises **questions** about whether]{.underline} access and control
over such [infrastructure can be maintained]{.underline}, particularly
[in **crisis**]{.underline} when it would be required to support the
military."[\[6\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn6)
Like Russia, [China has been **active** with **cyber intrusions**
in]{.underline} U.S. [energy infrastructure]{.underline}. The Mission
Support Center at Idaho National Laboratory characterized these as
attacks as "multiple intrusions into US ICS/SCADA \[Industrial Control
Systems/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\] and smart grid tools
\[that\] may be aimed more at intellectual property theft and gathering
intelligence to bolster their own infrastructure, but it is likely that
they are also using these intrusions to develop capabilities to attack
the \[bulk electric system\], as
well."[\[7\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn7)
China, therefore, has both the capability and intent to conduct cyber
intrusions and attacks for myriad reasons.

Another arm of this threat is the reliance the U.S. energy industry has
on imports from China, especially transformers. In early 2020, federal
officials seized a transformer in the port of Houston that had been
imported by the Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Company before sending it to
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque. Sandia is contracted by the
U.S. Department of Energy for mitigating national security
threats.[\[8\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn8)
The Wall Street Journal reported that "Mike Howard, chief executive of
the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility-funded technical
organization, said that the diversion of a huge, expensive transformer
is so unusual -- in his experience, unprecedented -- that it
suggests officials had significant security
concerns."[\[9\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn9)
Previously destined for the Washington Area Power Administration's Ault,
Colo., substation, the transformer is believed to have been seized due
to "backdoor" exploitable hardware emplaced by the Chinese prior to
shipment.[\[10\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn10)
Shortly after these events, President Trump issued Executive Order
13920, "[Securing the United States Bulk-Power
System](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-securing-united-states-bulk-power-system/),"
essentially limiting the import of Chinese-built critical energy
infrastructure components due to concerns about
cybersecurity.[\[11\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn11)
Interestingly, Jiangsu Huapeng "boasted that it supported 10 percent of
New York City's electricity
load."[\[12\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn12)

Franklin Kramer, the former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs, testified before a U.S. House of
Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee during an energy and
power hearing in 2011 and said that a ["**highly-coordinated** and
**structured** cyber,]{.underline} physical, or blended [attack on the
bulk power system]{.underline}, however, [could result in
**long-term**]{.underline} (**[irreparable]{.underline}**) [damage to
key system components in]{.underline} multiple simultaneous or
[**near-simultaneous** strikes."]{.underline} He added that ["an
**outage** could]{.underline} result with the potential to [affect a
**wide geographic area** and cause large]{.underline} population
[centers to lose power]{.underline} for extended
periods."[\[13\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn13)
Even the inclusion of features such as smart grids to [the **overall**
grid structure poses **new vulnerabilities** through]{.underline} their
[connectivity]{.underline}. Kramer stated that "such [connectivity
means]{.underline} that the [distribution system could be a **key
vector** for a]{.underline} national [security **attack** on the
grid."]{.underline}[\[14\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn14)

[the]{.mark} global [economy's physical materials]{.mark}, potentially
[with improved]{.mark} performance and
[sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Significant [[potential
exists]{.mark} to improve the characteristics of materials,
[reduce]{.mark} the [emissions]{.mark} profile of manufacturing and
processing, and shorten value chains.]{.underline} Fermentation, for
centuries used to make bread and brew beer, is now being used to create
fabrics such as artificial spider silk. [[Biology is increasingly being
used to create novel materials]{.mark} that can raise quality, introduce
entirely new capabilities, be biodegradable, and be produced [in a way
that generates]{.mark} significantly [less carbon
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mushroom roots rather than animal hide
can be used to make leather.11 Plastics can be made with yeast instead
of petrochemicals. --- [Increased control and precision in methodology
is occurring across the value chain, from delivery to development and
consumption with more personalization.]{.underline} [[Advances in
biological sciences have made R&D]{.mark} and delivery processes [more
precise]{.mark} and predictable; the character of R&D is shifting from
discovery by accident to rational design]{.underline}. Increasing
knowledge of human genomes and the links between certain genes and
diseases is enabling the spread of personalized or precision medicine,
which can be more effective than the one-size-fits-all therapies of the
past.12 [Precision also [applies to ag]{.mark}riculture, [where]{.mark}
insights from a plant or soil's [microbiome increasingly can be used to
optimize yield]{.mark} as well as to offer consumers with, for instance,
personalized nutrition plans based on genetic tests]{.underline}.13 ---
The capability to engineer and reprogram human and nonhuman organisms is
increasing. **[[Gene therapies]{.mark} could [offer]{.mark} complete
[cures of]{.mark} some [diseases]{.mark} for the first
time]{.underline}**. The same [technical advances that are driving
capabilities that improve human health can be used to introduce valuable
new traits that, for instance, improve the output or yield of nonhuman
organisms like microbes, plants, and animals. [Crops can be]{.mark}
genetically [engineered]{.mark} to produce higher yields and be more
heat- or drought-resistant, for instance]{.underline}. By permanently
genetically altering the vectors spreading disease (such as mosquitoes),
[gene drives could be used to prevent vector-borne diseases, including
malaria, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, and Lyme disease]{.underline},
although they also come with ecological risks.14 --- New
**[[methodologies using]{.mark} automation, machine learning, and
proliferating [biological data are enhancing discovery]{.mark},
throughput, and productivity in R&D]{.underline}**. Biology and
computing together are accelerating R&D, thereby addressing a
productivity challenge. McKinsey analysis in 2017 found that the ratio
of revenue to R&D spending in the biopharmaceutical industry hit a low
point in productivity between 2008 and 2011.15 [An explosion of
biological data due to cheaper sequencing can be used by biotech
companies and research institutes that increasingly are using robotic
automation and sensors in labs that could increase throughput up to ten
times]{.underline}.16 Further, advanced analytics, more powerful
computational techniques, and AI can be leveraged to provide better
insights during the R&D process. --- Potential is growing for interfaces
between biological systems and computers. A new generation of biomachine
interfaces relies on close interaction between humans and computers.
Such interfaces include neuroprosthetics that restore lost sensory
functions (bionic vision) or enable signals from the brain to control
physical movement of prosthetic or paralyzed limbs. Biocomputers that
employ biology to mimic silicon, including the use of DNA to store data,
are being researched. DNA is about one million times denser than
hard-disk storage; technically, one kilogram of DNA could store the
entirety of the world's data (as of 2016).17 While these are early days,
**[the [scope and scale]{.mark} of these emerging capabilities [could
have a broad impact on economies]{.mark} and societies, touching
multiple domains both directly and indirectly]{.underline}**. [These
[applications]{.mark} may [change everything from the food]{.mark} we
consume to textiles [to]{.mark} the types of [health]{.mark} treatments
we receive and how we build our physical world.]{.underline} The
potential value is vast. As noted, as much as **[[60 percent of the
physical inputs to the global economy could be produced
biologically]{.mark}, and even [modest progress]{.mark} toward that 60
percent number [could be transformative]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Beyond
the physical world, [[innovations could]{.mark} transform prevention,
diagnostics, and [treatment]{.mark} of [disease.]{.mark} At least 45
percent of the global disease burden could be addressed with
capabilities that are scientifically conceivable today]{.underline},
according to our analysis. [Bio innovations, such as high-throughput
screening, CRISPR, and machine learning for analyzing large and complex
biological data, have also begun to shape R&D]{.underline}. We estimate
that roughly 30 percent of private-sector R&D in major economies is in
industries where biological data, biological inputs, or biological means
of production could be used.18

### AT: Artificial Intelligence

#### AI regulation is [good]{.underline}! Positive benefits solve extinction. 

**Tzimas '21** \[Themistoklis; 2021; Faculty of Law at the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki; Legal and Ethical Challenges of Artificial
Intelligence from an International Law Perspective, "Chapter 2: The
Expectations and Risks from AI," p. 9-32\]

Therefore, [it is]{.underline} only [natural to be]{.underline} at least
[skeptical towards a future with entities possessing equal or superior
intelligence and levels of autonomy; the prospect even of **existential
risk** looms as **possible**]{.underline}.7

AI that will have reached or surpassed our level of intelligence make us
wonder why would highly autonomous and intelligent AI want to give up
control back to its original creators?8 Why remain contained in
pre-deﬁned goals set for it by us, humans?

[Even AI in its **current** form]{.underline} and narrow intelligence
[poses risks because of its **embedded-ness** in an ever-**growing
number** of **crucial aspects of our lives**. The role of AI in
**military**, **ﬁnancial**]{.underline},9 [**health**, **educational**,
**environmental**, **governance networks**-among **others**---are areas
where **risk** generated by AI---even **limited**]{.underline}---
autonomy [can be **diffused** through]{.underline} [**non-linear
networks**, with **signiﬁcant** impact--- even
**systemic**]{.underline}.10

The answer therefore to the question whether AI brings risk with it is
yes; as Eliezer Yudkowski comments the greatest of them all is that
people conclude too early that they understand it11 or that they assume
that they can achieve it without necessarily having acquired complete
and thorough understanding of what intelli- gence means.12

Our projection of our---lack of complete---understanding of the concept
of intelligence on AI is owed to our lack of complete comprehension of
human intelligence too, which is partially covered by the prevalent and
until now self- obvious, anthropomorphism because of which we tend to
identify higher intelligence with the human mind.

Yudkowski again however suggests that AI "refers to a vastly greater
space of possibilities than does the term "Homo sapiens." When we talk
about "AIs" we are really talking about minds-in-general, or
optimization processes in general. Imagine a map of mind design space.
In one corner, a tiny little circle contains all humans; within a larger
tiny circle containing all biological life; and all the rest of the huge
map is the space of minds-in-general. The entire map ﬂoats in a still
vaster space, the space of optimization processes."13

Regardless of what our well-established ideas are, there are many,
different intelligences and even more signiﬁcantly, there are
potentially, different intelli- gences equally or even more evolved than
human.

From such a perspective, the unprecedented---ness of potential AI
developments and the mystery surrounding them emerges as not only the
outcome of pop culture but of a radical transformation of our---until
recently---self---obvious identiﬁcation of humanity with highly evolved
and dominant intelligence.14

[The **lack of understanding** of intelligence and therefore of AI may
be **frightening** but **does not lead necessarily to regulation**---at
least to a **proper** one. We could **even** be led into **mak**ing
potentially **catastrophic choices**, on the basis of **false
assumptions**.]{.underline}

[On top of our lack of understanding, we should add a sentiment of
**anxiety**]{.underline} as well as of expectations, [which intensiﬁes
as an atmosphere of emergency]{.underline} and of expected
groundbreaking developments [grows]{.underline}. The most graphic
description of this feeling is the potential of a moment of singularity,
as mentioned above according to the description by Vinge and Kurzweil.

As the mathematician I. J. Good--Alan Turing's colleague in the team of
the latter during World War II---has put it: "Let an ultraintelligent
machine be deﬁned as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual
activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is
one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could
design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an
"intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far
behind. Thus the ﬁrst ultraintelligent machine is the last invention
that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to
tell us how to keep it under control."15 This is in a nutshell the
moment of singularity.

The estimates currently foresee the emergence of ultra or super
intelligence---as it is currently labelled---or in other words of
singularity, somewhere between 20 and 50 years from today, further
raising the sentiment of emergency.16 We cannot even foretell with
precision how singularity would look like but we know that because of
its expected groundbreaking impact, both states and private entities
compete towards gaining the upper hand in the prospect of the
singularity.17

Despite the fact that such predictions have been proven rather
optimistic in the past18 and therefore up to some extent inaccurate,
there are reasons to assume that their materialization will take place
and that the urgency of regulation will be proven realistic.

After all, part of the disappointments from AI should be blamed on the
fact that certain activities and standards, which were considered as
epitomes of human intelligence have been surpassed by AI, only to
indicate that they were not eventu- ally satisfactory thresholds for the
surpassing of human intelligence.19 Partially because of AI progress we
realize that human intelligence and its thresholds are much more
complicated than assumed in the past.

The vastness's of deﬁnitions of intelligence, as well as its
etymological roots are enlightening of the difﬁculties: "to gather, to
collect, to assemble or to choose, and to form an impression, thus
leading one to ﬁnally understand, perceive, or know".20

As with other relevant concepts, the truth is that until recently our
main way to approach intelligence for far too long was "we know it, when
we see it". AI is an additional reason for looking deeper into
intelligence and the more we examine it, the most complicated it seems.

The combination of lack of complete understanding of intelligence, the
unpredictability of AI, its rapid evolution and the prospect of
singularity explain both the fascination and the fear from AI. Once the
latter emerges, we have no real knowledge about what will happen next
but only speculations, which until recently belonged to the area of
science ﬁction.

We are for example pretty conﬁdent that the speed of AI intelligence
growth will accelerate, once self---improvement will have been achieved.
The expected or possible chain of events will begin from AI capacity to
re-write its own algorithms and exponentially self---improve, surpassing
human intelligence, which lacks the capacity of such rapid
self---improvement and setting its own goals.21

We can somehow guess the speed of AGI and ASI evolution and possibly
some of its initial steps but we cannot guess the directions that such
AI will choose to follow and the characteristics that it will
demonstrate. Practically, we credibly guess the prospects of AI beyond a
certain level of development.

Two [**existential issues** could emerge: ﬁrst, an imbalance of
intelligence at **our expense**]{.underline}---with us, humans becoming
the inferior species---[in favor of non-biological entities and secondly
a lack of even fundamental conceptual communication between the two most
intelligent "species". Both of them heighten the fear of **irreversible
changes**]{.underline}, once we lose the possession of the superior
intelligence.22

[However, we need to consider the **expectations as well**. The
**positive side**]{.underline} [focuses on the so-called **friendly**
AI, meaning AI which will **beneﬁt** and **not harm** humans, thanks to
its advanced intelligence]{.underline}.23

[AI bears the promise of signiﬁcantly enhancing human life on various
aspects, beginning from the already existing, narrow
applications]{.underline}. The [**enhance**d
**automation**]{.underline}24 in the industry [and the shift
to]{.underline} **[autonomy]{.underline}**,25 [the take---over by AI of
tasks]{.underline} even at [the]{.underline} **[service
sector]{.underline}** which can be considered as "tedious"---i.e. in the
banking sector---[**climate** and **weather forecasting**]{.underline},
[**disaster** response]{.underline},26 [the potentially better
**coop**eration among different actors in complicated matters such as in
matters of **information**, **geopolitics** and **i**nternational
**r**elations]{.underline}, [**logistics**, **resources**]{.underline}
ex.27

[The realization of the positive expectations depends up to some extent
upon the **complementarity** or not, of AI with **human**
intelligence]{.underline}. However, what friendly AI will bring in our
societies constitutes a matter of debate, given our lack of unanimous
approach on what should be considered as beneﬁcial and therefore
friendly to humans---as is analyzed in the next chapter.

[Friendly AI for example bears the prospect of freeing us from hard
labor or even further from **unwanted** labor; of generating further
economic **growth**; of dealing in unbiased, speedy, effective and
cheaper ways with sectors such as **policing**]{.underline},
[**justice**, **health**, **environment**al **crisis**, natural
**disasters**, **education**, **governance**, **defense**]{.underline}
[and several more of them which necessitate decision-making, with the
involvement of sophisticated intelligence]{.underline}.

[The synergies between human intelligence and AI "promise" the
**enhancement of humans in most of their aspects**]{.underline}. Such
synergies may remain external---humans using AI as external to
themselves, in terms of analysis, forecasts, decision---making and in
general as a type of assistant-28 or may evolve into the merging of the
two forms of intelligence either temporarily or permanently.

The second profoundly enters humanity, existentially---speaking, into
uncharted waters. Elon Musk argues in favor of "having some sort of
merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence" and his
company "Neuralink" aims at implanting chips in human brain. Musk argues
that through this way humans will keep artiﬁcial intelligence under
control.29 The proposition is that of "mind design", with humans playing
the role that God had according to theologies.30

While the temptation is strong---exceeding human mind's capacities, far
beyond what nature "created", by acquiring the capacity for example to
connect directly to the cyberspace or to break the barriers of
biology31---the risks are signiﬁcant too: what if a microchip
malfunction? Will such a brain be usurped or become captive to
malfunctioning AI?

The merging of the two intelligences is most likely to evolve initially
by invoking medical reasons, instead of human enhancement. But the
merging of the two will most likely continue, as after all the limits
between healing and enhancement are most often blurry. This development
will give rise, as is analyzed below, to signif- icant questions and
issues, the most of crucial of which is the setting of a threshold for
the prevalence of the human aspect of intelligence over the artiﬁcial
one.

Human nature is historically improved, enhanced, healed and now,
potentially even re-designed in the future.32 Can a "medical science"
endorsing such a goal be ethically acceptable and if yes, under what
conditions, when, for whom and by what means? The answers are more
difﬁcult than it seems. As the World Health Organi-
zation---WHO---provides in its constitution, "Health is a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or inﬁrmity".33

Therefore, why discourage science which aims at human-enhancement, even
reaching the levels of post-humanism?34 Or if restrictions are to be
imposed on human enhancement, on what ethics and laws will they be
justiﬁed? How ethically acceptable is it to prohibit or delay
technological evolution, which among several other magniﬁcent
achievements, promises to treat death as a disease and cure it, by
reducing soul to self, self to mind, and mind to brain, which will then
be preserved as a "softwarized" program in a hardware other than the
human body?35

After all, "According to the strong artiﬁcial intelligence program there
is no fundamental difference between computers and brains: a computer is
different machinery than a person in terms of speed and memory
capacity."36

While such a scientiﬁc development and the ones leading potentially to
it will be undoubtedly, groundbreaking technologically-speaking, is it
actually---ethically- speaking---as ambivalent as it may sound or is it
already justiﬁed by our well--- rooted human-centrism?37

Secular humanism may have very well outdated religious beliefs about
afterlife in the area of science but has not diminished the hope for
immortality; on the contrary, science, implicitly or explicitly predicts
that matter can in various ways surpass death, albeit by means which
belong in the realm of scientiﬁc proof, instead of that of metaphysical
belief.38

If this is the philosophical case, the quest for immortality becomes
ethically acceptable; it can be considered as embedded both in the
existential anxiety of humans, as well as in the human-centrism of
secular philosophical and political victory over the dei-centric
approach to the world and to our existence.

From another perspective of course and for the not that distant
philosophical reasons, the quest for immortality becomes ethically
ambiguous or even unacceptable.39 By seeking endless life we may miss
all these that make life worth living in the framework of ﬁniteness. As
the gerontologist Paul Hayﬂick cautioned "Given the possibility that you
could replace all your parts, including your brain, then you lose your
self-identity, your self-recognition. You lose who you are! You are who
you are because of your memory."40

In other words, once we begin to integrate the two types of
intelligence, within ourselves, until when and how we will be sure that
it is human intelligence that guides us, instead of the AI? And if we
are not guided completely or---even further---at all by human
intelligence but on the contrary we are guided by AI which we have
embodied and which is trained by our human intelligence, will we be
remaining humans or we will have evolved to some type of meta-human or
transhumant species, being different persons as well?41

AI promises tor threatens to offer a solution by breaking down our
consciousness into small "particles" of information---simplistically
speaking---which can then be "software-ized" and therefore "uploaded"
into different forms of physical or non-physical existence.

Diane Ackerman states that "The brain is silent, the brain is dark, the
brain tastes nothing, the brain hears nothing. All it receives are
electrical impulses\--not the sumptuous chocolate melting sweetly, not
the oboe solo like the ﬂight of a bird, not the pastel pink and lavender
sunset over the coral reef\--only impulses."42 Therefore, all that is
needed---although it is of course much more complicated than we can
imagine---is a way to code and reproduce such impulses.

Even if we consider that without death, we will no more be humans but
something else, why should we remain humans once technologies allow us
be something "more", in the sense of an enhanced version of "being"? Why
are we to remain bound by biological evolution if we can re-design it
and our future form of existence?

Why not try to achieve the major breakthrough, the anticipated or hoped
digita- lization of the human mind, which promises immortality of
consciousness via the cyberspace or artiﬁcial bodies: the uploading of
our consciousness so that it can live on forever, turning death into an
optional condition.43

Either through an artiﬁcial body or emulation-a living, conscious
avatar---we hope---or fear---that the domain of immortality will be
within reach. It is the prospect of a "substrate-independent minds," in
which human and machine consciousness will merge, transcending
biological limits of time, space and mem- ory" that fascinates us.44

As Anders Sandberg explained "The point of brain emulation is to
recreate the function of the original brain: if 'run' it will be able to
think and act as the original," he says. Progress has been slow but
steady. "We are now able to take small brain tissue samples and map them
in 3D. These are at exquisite resolution, but the blocks are just a few
microns across. We can run simulations of the size of a mouse brain on
supercomputers---but we do not have the total connectivity yet. As
methods improve, I expect to see automatic conversion of scanned tissue
into models that can be run. The different parts exist, but so far there
is no pipeline from brains to emulations."45

The emulation is different from a simulation in the sense that the
former mimics not only the outward outcome but also the "internal causal
dynamics", so that the emulated system and in this particular case the
human mind behaves as the original.46 Obviously, this is a challenging
task: we need to understand the human brain with the help of
computational neuroscience and combine simpliﬁed parts such as simulated
neurons with network structures so that the patterns of the brain are
comprehended. We must combine effectively "biological realism
(attempting to be faithful to biology), completeness (using all
available empirical data about the system), tractability (the
possibility of quantitative or qualitative simulation) and understanding
(producing a compressed representation of the salient aspects of the
system in the mind of the experimenter)".47

The technological challenges are vast. Technologically speaking, the
whole concept is based on some assumptions which must be proven both
accurate and feasible.48 We must achieve technology capable of scanning
completely the human brain, of creating software on the basis of the
acquired information from its scanning and of the interpretation of
information and the hardware which will be capable of uploading or
downloading such software.49 The steps within these procedures are
equally challenging. Their detailed analysis evades the scope of this
book.

Some critical questions---they are further analyzed in the next
chapters---emerge however: how will we interpret free will in emulation?
What will be the impact of the environment and of what environment? How
will be missing parts of the human brain re-constructed and emulated?
What will be the status of the several emulations which will be
created---i.e. failed attempts or emulations of parts of the human
brain---in the course of the search for a complete and functioning
emulation? Will they be considered as "persons" and therefore as having
some right or will they be considered as mere objects in an experimental
lab? How are we going to decode the actual subjective sentiments of
these emulations? Essentially, are emulations the humans "themselves"
who are emulated or a different person? Even further what will human and
person mean in the era of emulation?

From a different perspective, the victory over death may be seen as a
danger of mass extinction, absorption or de-humanization. In this new,
vast universe of emulations will there be place for humans?50

From the above---mentioned discussion, it becomes obvious that at a
large extent, the prospect of risk or of expectation is a matter of
perspective, for which there is no unanimous agreement in the present.
This may be the greatest danger of all, for which Asimov warned us:
unleashing technology while we cannot communicate among us, in the face
of it.

The existential prospect as well as the risks by AI may self-evidently
emerge from technological advances but are determined on the basis of
politico---philosophical or in the wider sense, ethical assumptions.
This is where the need for legal regulation steps in. Such a need was
often underestimated in the past in favor of a solely technologically
oriented approach---although exceptions raising issues other than
technological can be found too.51 The gradual raising of
ethic---political, philosoph- ical and legal issues constitutes a rather
recent development, partially because of the realization of the
proximity of the risks and of the expectations.

The public debate is often divided between two "contradictory" views:
fear of AI or enthusiastic optimism. The opinions of the experts differ
respectively.

Kurzweil, who has come with a prediction for a date for the emergence of
singularity---until 2045---expects such a development in a positive way:
"What's actually happening is \[machines\] are powering all of us,"
Kurzweil said during the SXSW interview. "They're making us smarter.
They may not yet be inside our bodies, but, by the 2030s, we will
connect our neocortex, the part of our brain where we do our thinking,
to the cloud."52

In a well-known article---issued on the occasion of a ﬁlm---Stephen
Hawking, Max Tegmark, Stuart Russell, and Frank Wilczek shared a
moderate position: "[The potential **beneﬁts** are **huge**;
**everything that civilization has to offer** is a product of **human**
intelligence; we cannot **predict** what we might achieve when this
intelligence is **magniﬁed** by the tools **AI** may provide, but the
**eradicat**ion of **war, disease, and poverty**]{.underline} [would be
high on anyone's list. Success in creating AI would be the **biggest
event in human history**. . . Unfortunately, it **might also be the
last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks**]{.underline}."53

Still, [the [degrowth]{.mark} project [is **nowhere near**]{.mark}
enjoying [the]{.mark} degree and type of [support it needs]{.mark} if
its policies are to be implemented through democratic
processes]{.underline}. [The number of political parties]{.underline},
labour [unions, business associations and international organisations
that have]{.underline} so far [embraced degrowth is modest to say the
least]{.underline}. [Economic and political [elites]{.mark}, including
social democratic parties and most of the trade union movement, [are
**united** in]{.mark} the [belief that]{.mark} economic [growth is
**necessary and desirable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This consensus finds
support in the prevailing type of economic theory and underpins the main
contenders in the neoliberal project, such as centre-left and
nationalist projects]{.underline}. In spite of the world\'s
multidimensional crisis, [a [pro-growth]{.mark} discourse in other words
continues to be hegemonic: it [is]{.mark} widely considered **[a]{.mark}
matter of [common sense]{.mark}** that continued economic growth is
required]{.underline}.

It is also noteworthy [that economic and political [elites]{.mark}, to a
large extent, continue to [support the]{.mark} neoliberal [project,
**even in the face of its**]{.mark} **evident
[shortcomings]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
20[[08]{.mark} financial [crisis **did not**]{.mark} result in the
[weaken]{.mark}ing of transnational financial [capital]{.mark} that
could have paved the way for a paradigm shift]{.underline}.
[[Instead]{.mark} of coming to an end, neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}
has arguably [entered a **more authoritarian
phase**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bruff, 2014). [The main reason the power
of [the **pre-crisis coalition remains intact**]{.mark} is that
governments stepped in and saved the dominant fraction by means of
massive bailouts]{.underline}. [It is a foregone conclusion that this
fraction and [the wider coalition]{.mark} behind the neoliberal paradigm
(transnational industrial capital, the middle classes and segments of
organized labour) [will consider]{.mark} the [degrowth]{.mark} paradigm
[**unattractive** and]{.mark} that such social forces [will **vehemently
oppose**]{.mark} the implementation of [degrowth
policies]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Rees, 2014: 97).

While degrowth advocates envision a future in which market forces play a
less prominent role than they do today, degrowth is not an antimarket
project. As such, it can attract support from certain types of market
actors. In particular, it is worth noting that social enterprises, such
as cooperatives (Restakis, 2010), play a major role in the degrowth
vision. Such enterprises are defined by being 'organisations involved at
least to some extent in the market, with a clear social, cultural and/or
environmental purpose, rooted in and serving primarily the local
community and ideally having a local and/or democratic ownership
structure' (Johanisova et al., 2013: 11). Social enterprises currently
exist at the margins of a system, in which the dominant type of business
entity is profit-oriented, shareholder-owned corporations. The further
dissemination of social enterprises, which is crucial to the transitions
to degrowth societies, is -- in many cases -- blocked or delayed as a
result of the centrifugal forces of global competition (Wigger and
Buch-Hansen, 2013). Overall, social enterprises thus (still) constitute
a social force with modest power.

Ougaard (2016: 467) notes that one of the major dividing lines in the
contemporary transnational capitalist class is between capitalists who
have a material interest in the carbon-based economy and capitalists who
have a material interest in decarbonisation. The latter group, for
instance, includes [manufacturers of equipment for the production of
renewable energy]{.underline} (ibid.: 467). As mentioned above,
[degrowth advocates have singled out renewable energy as one of the
sectors that needs to grow in the future]{.underline}. As such, it seems
likely that the owners of national and transnational companies operating
in this sector would be more positively inclined towards the degrowth
project than would capitalists with a stake in the carbon-based economy.
Still, [the prospect of the "green sector" emerging as a driving force
behind degrowth currently appears meagre]{.underline}. [Being under the
control of transnational capital]{.underline} (Harris, 2010), such
[companies generally embrace the "green growth" discourse, which 'is
deeply embedded in neoliberal capitalism' and indeed serves to adjust
this form of capitalism 'to crises arising from contradictions within
itself']{.underline} (Wanner, 2015: 23).

In addition to [support from the social forces engendered by the
production process, a political project 'also needs the political
ability to mobilize majorities in parliamentary democracies, and a
sufficient measure of at least passive consent']{.underline} (van
Apeldoorn and Overbeek, 2012: 5--6) if it is to become hegemonic. As
mentioned, [degrowth enjoys little support in parliaments, and certainly
the pro-growth discourse is hegemonic among parties in
government]{.underline}.5 [With capital accumulation being the most
important driving force in capitalist societies, political
decision-makers are generally eager to create conditions conducive to
production and the accumulation of capital]{.underline} (Lindblom, 1977:
172). [[Capitalist states]{.mark} and international organisations
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[**"programmed"** to facilitate]{.mark}
capital [accumulation]{.mark}, and do as such constitute a strategically
selective terrain that works to the disadvantage of the degrowth
project]{.underline}.

[The main advocates of the degrowth project are grassroots]{.underline},
small fractions of left-wing parties and labour unions as well as
academics and other citizens who are concerned about social injustice
and the environmentally unsustainable nature of societies in the rich
parts of the world. The project is thus ideationally driven in the sense
that support for it is not so much rooted in the material circumstances
or short-term self-interests of specific groups or classes as it is
rooted in the conviction that degrowth is necessary if current and
future generations across the globe are to be able to lead a good life.
While there is no shortage of enthusiasts and creative ideas in the
degrowth movement, [it has only modest resources compared to other
political projects]{.underline}. [To put it bluntly, the [advocates of
degrowth **do not possess instruments**]{.mark} that enable them [to
force]{.mark} political [decision-makers to listen to -- let alone
comply with -- their views]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, [they are in a
weaker position than the labour union movement was in its heyday, and
they are in a far weaker position than the owners and managers of large
corporations are today]{.underline} (on the structural power of
transnational corporations, see Gill and Law, 1989).

6\. Consent

It is also safe to say that [degrowth enjoys no "passive consent" from
the majority of the population]{.underline}. For the time being,
[[degrowth remains **unknown** to most]{.mark} people]{.underline}.
[Yet, [if it were]{.mark} to become generally [known, most]{.mark}
people [would]{.mark} probably [**not** find the vision]{.mark} of a
smaller economic system [appealing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is not
just a matter of [degrowth being 'a **missile word** that]{.mark}
backfires' because it **[triggers negative feelings]{.mark}** in people
when they first hear it]{.underline} (Drews and Antal, 2016). [It is
also a matter of the actual content of the degrowth
project]{.underline}.

Two issues in particular should be mentioned in this context. First, for
many, the anti-capitalist sentiments embodied in the degrowth project
will inevitably be a difficult pill to swallow. Today, [the vast
majority of people find it almost impossible to conceive of a world
without capitalism]{.underline}. [There is a 'widespread sense that not
only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but
also that it is now impossible to even imagine a coherent alternative to
it']{.underline} (Fisher, 2009: 2). As Jameson (2003) famously observed,
[[it is]{.mark}, in a sense, [**easier to imagine the end of the world**
than]{.mark} it is to imagine the end [of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [not only is degrowth -- like
other anti-capitalist projects -- up against the challenge that most
people consider capitalism the only system that can function; it is also
up against the additional challenge that it speaks against economic
growth in a world where the desirability of growth is considered common
sense]{.underline}.

Second, [[degrowth is **incompatible** with]{.mark} the
[lifestyles]{.mark} to which [many]{.mark} of us who live in rich
countries have become accustomed]{.underline}. [Economic growth in the
Western world is, to no small extent, premised on the existence of
consumer societies and an associated consumer culture most of us find it
difficult to completely escape]{.underline}. In this culture, [social
status, happiness, well-being and identity are linked to
consumption]{.underline} (Jackson, 2009). Indeed, it is widely
considered a natural right to lead an environmentally unsustainable
lifestyle -- a lifestyle that includes car ownership, air travel,
spacious accommodations, fashionable clothing, an omnivorous diet and
all sorts of electronic gadgets. [This Western norm of consumption has
increasingly been exported to other parts of the world, the result being
that never before have so many people taken part in consumption patterns
that used to be reserved for elites]{.underline} (Koch, 2012). [If
degrowth were to be institutionalised, many citizens in the rich
countries would have to adapt to a materially lower standard of
living]{.underline}. That is, while the basic needs of the global
population can be met in a non-growing economy, not all wants and
preferences can be fulfilled (Koch et al., 2017). Undoubtedly,
[[many]{.mark} people in the rich countries would [experience]{.mark}
various [limitations on]{.mark} their [consumption]{.mark} opportunities
[as]{.mark} a [**violent encroachment** on]{.mark} their [personal
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [whereas many recognize that
contemporary consumer societies are environmentally unsustainable, fewer
are prepared to actually change their own lifestyles to reverse/address
this]{.underline}.

At present, then, the degrowth project is in its "deconstructive phase",
i.e., the phase in which its advocates are able to present a powerful
critique of the prevailing neoliberal project and point to alternative
solutions to crisis. At this stage, not enough support has been
mobilised behind the degrowth project for it to be elevated to the
phases of "construction" and "consolidation". It is conceivable that at
some point, enough people will become sufficiently discontent with the
existing economic system and push for something radically different.
Reasons for doing so could be the failure of the system to satisfy human
needs and/or its inability to resolve the multidimensional crisis
confronting humanity. Yet, [various **[material and ideational
path-dependencies]{.mark}** currently [stand in the way]{.mark} of such
a development, particularly in countries with large
middle-classes]{.underline}. [[Even if]{.mark} it were to happen that
[the majority wanted a break with the]{.mark} current [system, it is
**far from given**]{.mark} that a system based on the ideas of [degrowth
is what they would demand]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No transition\-\--degrowth assumes magic!

Impasse by Magical Thinking\". No Publication. 2-23-2021.

[The difficulty]{.underline} of discussion [with
**degrowers**]{.underline} [comes from the fact that they]{.underline}
and the rest of us [live in]{.underline} two [different]{.underline}
ideological [worlds. **[Degrowers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[live in a
world of **magic**]{.underline},]{.mark} [where]{.underline} merely [by
listing]{.underline} the names of [desirable ends they]{.underline} are
supposed to somehow [happen]{.underline}. [[In that world, one does not
need]{.underline}]{.mark} to bother with numbers or **[[facts,
trade-offs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, first or second bests; [one merely
needs to conjure up]{.underline} what he/she **[desires]{.underline}**
and it will be there.

Now degrowers are not irrational people. The reason why they are pushed
in this magical corner is because when they try to "do the numbers" they
are led to an impasse. They do not want to allow for significant
increase in world GDP because it will, even if decoupling (of which they
are skeptical) happens, drive energy emissions too high. [If one wants
to keep world GDP more or less as now one must]{.underline} (A)
"[freeze]{.underline}" [today's global income distributions so that some
10-15% of the world population continue to live below the absolute
poverty line]{.underline}, and [one-half of the world population below
\$PPP 7 dollars per day]{.underline} (which is, by the way,
significantly below Western poverty lines). [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} however **[[unacceptable to the poor
people]{.mark}, to the poor countries, and even to
degrowers]{.underline}** themselves.

[Thus they]{.underline} must [try something else]{.underline}: introduce
[a]{.underline} different [distribution]{.underline} (B) [where
everybody]{.underline} who is [above the current mean world
income]{.underline} (\$PPP 16 per day) [is driven down]{.underline} to
this mean, and the poor countries and people are, at least for a while,
allowed to continue growing until they too achieve the level of \$PPP 16
per day. But [the problem with that approach is that one would have to
engage in a massive reduction of incomes for all those who make more
than \$PPP 16 which is practically all of the Western
population]{.underline}. Only 14% of the population in Western countries
live at the level of income less than the global mean. This is probably
the most important statistic that one should keep in mind.
[[Degrowers]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[need to **convince 86% of the
population living in rich countries** that]{.mark} their [incomes are
too high and need to be reduced. They would have to preside over
**economic depressions for about a decade**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
then let the new real income stay at that level indefinitely. (Even that
would not quite solve the problem because in the meantime, many poor
countries would have reached the level of \$PPP 16 per day and they too
would have to be prevented from growing further.) It is quite obvious
that [such a [proposition is a **political
suicide**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus [**[degrowers do not wish to spell
it out]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### You can't just [wish away]{.underline} the current system. 

Andrew **SAYER 95**, Reader in Social Theory and Political Economy at
Lancaster University \[*Radical Political Economy: A Critique*, 1995, p.
33-34\]

[Any criticism presupposes the possibility of a better way of
life]{.underline}; to expose something as illusory or contradictory is
to imply the possibility and desirability of a life without those
illusions and contradictions. This much has been established by critical
theorists such as Habermas and Apel. Yet the notion that critique
implies a quest for the good is a highly abstract one. [Up to a point,
particular critiques do imply something]{.underline} a little [more
specific than]{.underline} the standpoint of [a better
life]{.underline}. The [critique of capitalism\'s]{.underline} anarchic
and uneven [development implies a critical standpoint or contrast space
of an imagined society with]{.underline} a rationally ordered and
[even]{.underline} process of [development. The critique of class points
to the desirability of a classless society]{.underline}. Naturally,
society would be better if its illusions, conflicts and contradictions
were reduced, but [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} naturally [[want to know
**how** this could be achieved]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[desirability]{.underline}]{.mark} of a life without contradictions or
illusions [[does not make it feasible]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Critical social science does not merely identify illusions,
irrationality or contradictions but attempts to provide explanations of
their sources, locating the \'unwanted determinations\' of behaviour, as
Bhaskar (1989) puts it. [It would be strange]{.underline}, to say the
least, [if an analysis of the causes of]{.underline} problems such as
[hunger and exploitation were unable to indicate anything about
alternatives which would eliminate them. [If a critical theory
**cannot** ]{.mark}**begin** to [indicate how to eliminate
problems]{.mark} we must]{.underline} inevitably [[be suspicious]{.mark}
of its claims to have identified their causes. [If the
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} implied by a critical standpoint [[is
**not feasible**,]{.mark} then any [critique]{.mark} made from that
standpoint [is]{.mark}]{.underline} thereby **[seriously
[weakened]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Not to put too fine a point on it, the
[critique of]{.underline}, say, [capitalism]{.underline}\'s anarchic and
uneven development would [lose much of its force if all]{.underline}
\[END PAGE 33\] [advanced economies were necessarily]{.underline}
anarchic and [uneven]{.underline} in their development, though one could
still criticize advanced economies - not just capitalist ones - from the
very different standpoint of a \'deep ecology\', calling for a return to
small-scale, more primitive economies (Dobson, 1990).

[We need to know enough about the]{.underline} critical standpoint and
the implied [alternative to be able to judge]{.underline} first [whether
it really is feasible and desirable]{.underline}. Since knowledge is
\'situated\' and bears the mark of its author\'s social position, this
includes assessing whose standpoint it is made from. Does it privilege
the position of a particular group (e.g. male workers, advanced
countries)? Does it imply a society without difference? If it suggests
greater equality on whose terms is equality to be defined?7 [We
have]{.underline} also [to ask whether [remedying]{.mark} one set of
[problems would generate others]{.mark}]{.underline} (it usually does),
[and whether these would be worse]{.underline} than the original
problems. [This is rarely considered in radical political economy,
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} usual [implicit [assumption]{.mark} being
[that all bad things go]{.mark} together [in capitalism and all
good]{.mark} things [under socialism/communism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
[it is possible that some of the]{.underline} \'contradictions\' involve
[[dilemmas]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[can\'t be eliminated along with
capitalism]{.mark}. [Evaluations]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of
desirability therefore [[need to be]{.mark} cross-[checked with]{.mark}
assessments of [feasibility, and **optimistic assumptions**]{.mark} of
inevitable improvement **[suspended]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[There are two kinds of feasibility]{.underline} which might be
considered:

> 1 [whether a certain]{.underline} desired [end-state or goal can be
> realized]{.underline} - for example, how people can be politically
> mobilized to make it happen; and
>
> 2 [whether]{.underline}, assuming enough people are willing to try to
> make it happen, [the goal or end-state is feasible in
> itself]{.underline}, e.g. could one have an advanced economy without
> money?

[It is]{.underline} usually [only the first of these questions that
radicals address]{.underline}, the standard response to utopian
discussions being not \'would it work?\' but \'yes but how are you going
to get from here to there?\' But while many might think it idle to
ignore (1), it is surprising how little attention is given to (2), [as
if the journey mattered more than the destination]{.underline}. I fully
accept that I am not offering suggestions on (1) in this book, and only
ideas pertinent to (2): but then [I don\'t see how large-scale political
mobilization can precede a well-worked out conception of a feasible
alternative]{.underline}.

### Transition Wars -- Alt

#### Alt fails\-\--[transition wars]{.underline} and [domestic pressure]{.underline} means the alt [abandons fidelity]{.underline} to the environment.

**Smith \'19** \[Noah; 4/5/19; Bloomberg Opinion columnist, former
assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University; \"Dumping
Capitalism Won't Save the Planet,\"
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism\]

[It has become **fashionable**]{.underline} on social media and [in
certain publications to argue that **capitalism is killing the
planet**]{.underline}. Even renowned investor Jeremy Grantham, hardly a
radical, made that assertion last year. [The **basic idea** is that the
**profit motive** drives the **private sector** to **spew
carbon**]{.underline} into the air with reckless abandon. Though many
economists and some climate activists believe that the problem is best
addressed by modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, [many
activists believe that the problem can't be addressed **without
rebuilding** the **economy**]{.underline} along centrally planned lines.

[The climate threat is certainly dire]{.underline}, and carbon taxes are
unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [But eco-socialism
is]{.underline} probably [**not** going to be an **effective method** of
addressing that threat. **Dismantling** an **entire economic system** is
**never easy**, and probably would **touch off armed conflict** and
**major asdasd upheaval**. In the scramble to win those battles, even
the socialists would almost certainly abandon their limitation on
**fossil-fuel use**]{.underline} --- [either to support **military
efforts**, or to keep the population from turning against them. The
precedent here is the **Soviet Union**, whose multidecade effort to
**reshape its economy** by **force** amid **confrontation** with the
West led to profound **environmental degradation**. The world\'s climate
does not have several decades to spare]{.underline}.

[Even **without international conflict**, there's **little guarantee**
that moving away from capitalism would **mitigate our impact** on the
environment]{.underline}. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power
[in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially]{.underline}
for the average Bolivian, which is great. [But this has come at the cost
of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed to **decrease
its per capita emissions**]{.underline} a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, [in terms of **economic growth** and **carbon
emissions**, Bolivia looks]{.underline} similar to more
[capitalist]{.underline} developing countries. [That suggests that
**faced with a choice** of enriching their people or helping to save the
climate, even **socialist leaders** will often choose the former. And
that same political calculus will probably hold in China and the
U.S.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [leaders who
demand **draconian cuts** in **living standards** in pursuit of
environmental goals will have **trouble staying in power**]{.underline}.

[The **best hope** for the climate therefore lies in **reducing the
tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon emissions**.
That requires **technology**]{.underline} --- [**solar**, **wind** and
**nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars** and other
vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The **best climate
policy** plans all involve **technological improvement** as a **key
feature**.]{.underline}
