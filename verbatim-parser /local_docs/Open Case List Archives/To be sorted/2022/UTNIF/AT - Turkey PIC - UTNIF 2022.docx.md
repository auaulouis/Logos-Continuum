### Russian Deterrence

#### Turkey can be cooperative and is key to deterring Russia

**Jeffrey 22** (James Jeffrey, Former ambassador to Iraq and Turkey, and
Special Envoy to the Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, "The NATO
Accession Crisis Risks Final Collapse of the Alliance-Turkey
Relationship," Wilson Center, 6/15/22,

[Turkey's rejection of NATO accession for Sweden and Finland, beyond
undercutting NATO's response to Russia's aggression, reflects a deeper
rift between the West and Turkey.]{.underline} This is further manifest
by Ankara's recent threat to expand into northern Syria and its
overflights of Greek territory. [For the sake of the Alliance, immediate
responses are vital, but the rift will worsen unless Washington and
European capitals work with Ankara to fundamentally shift their
relationship. While such a shift has long been advisable given Turkey's
importance, the existential threat of Russian aggression for both Turkey
and the Alliance make it urgent]{.underline}. Almost overnight Ankara
lashed out against Finland and Sweden, threatening to block their NATO
accession if they did not cut real and alleged ties to the PKK. A month
ago, Washington hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu and
signaled a new bilateral strategic dialogue. This included possible
sales of F-16's to Ankara, symbolically ending the bitter dispute over a
Turkish Russian missile purchase, and Washington's subsequent cutting
Turkey from the F-35 program. Turkey was also following analogous
rapprochement with Arab states, Israel, Greece, and Armenia, and now
plays a central role in the Ukrainian conflict providing weapons,
closing the Straits to Russian naval reinforcements and pressing on
various diplomatic exchanges. Then almost overnight Ankara lashed out
against Finland and Sweden, threatening to block their NATO accession if
they did not cut real and alleged ties to the PKK, and followed up with
the aforementioned threats in Syria and escalation in the Aegean.
Predictably, American commentators reacted vigorously, even suggesting
once again for Turkey to be thrown out of NATO. Shifting attitudes
toward Turkey Such dramatic flips in Turkish policy, gelding any
predictable diplomacy, have become a hallmark of both Turkish president
Erdogan and the convoluted internal political system with his party,
dependent on an extremist nationalist partner. Such flips also make
efforts to resolve issues such as those above (let alone the underlying
rift between Ankara and NATO allies), a high-risk endeavor which most
Western leaders avoid, writing Turkey off as a lost cause. [But as
Ukraine has demonstrated, Turkey is vital to containing Russia, as it
has been to NATO's nuclear deterrence, missile defense against Iran,
operations in the Balkans, and Afghanistan. It is just too big, too
important, and at times too problematic to ignore. While the Ukraine
conflict is now generating strife between Turkey and NATO over
Scandinavian accession, it also offers a chance to improve relations
between them.]{.underline} That conflict resembles nothing seen since
the late 1930s and immediate post-war period, with the very survival of
the world order at stake. [Winning this conflict, by maintaining
Ukraine's survival as an independent state and deterring new Russian
aggression, while avoiding escalation into the unknown, is a categorical
imperative not experienced since the Cold War.]{.underline} While this
is true of the Alliance as a whole, it is especially relevant for
Turkey, a front line state with a long history under Russian pressure.
Furthermore, [experience shows Turkey can be cooperative. The Bush
administration worked well with Turkey on counter-PKK operations, and
the Obama administration negotiated a NATO anti- Iranian ballistic
missile radar deployment. The 2019 Pence-Erdogan ceasefire in Northeast
Syria still holds despite Turkish threats, and the two capitals handled
well President Biden's acknowledgment of Armenian genocide]{.underline}.
And, ironically, despite deep geostrategic hostility and recent military
clashes, Russia and Turkey maintain productive presidential-level
relations, with Putin and especially Erdogan usually following a
'no-surprises' principle. [The Turks understand that accession of Sweden
and Finland to NATO is critically important for a positive Ukraine
outcome.]{.underline} The Turks understand that accession of Sweden and
Finland to NATO is critically important for a positive Ukraine outcome.
They know it would strengthen the West's long-term against Russian
aggression and underline the solidarity of the international front
against Moscow, without, as Putin admitted, directly threatening Russia.
But what Ankara may not get is that its penchant for dangerous haggling,
not only over accession but with its Aegean and northern Syria threats,
undercuts that solidarity and the whole Russia containment categorical
imperative. Turkey would then be blamed and likely ostracized
permanently within NATO. So, the question is, why does it keep running
such risks?

#### NATO requires Turkish support to deter Russian efforts in the Black Sea

**Tol and Isik 21** (Gönül Tol, professor at George Washington
University's Institute for Middle East Studies; Yörük Isik, geopolitical
analyst based in Instanbul; "Turkey-NATO ties are problematic, but there
is one bright spot", Middle East Institute,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/turkey-nato-ties-are-problematic-there-one-bright-spot)

When it comes to Turkey-NATO ties, Ankara is regarded as more of a
problem than an ally these days. Not only did it purchase a Russian
S-400 air defense system, but its gunboat diplomacy in the eastern
Mediterranean also raised the specter of military conflict between NATO
allies when Greek and Turkish naval flotillas steamed directly toward
each other this past summer. **[There is one region, however, where
Turkey can help NATO efforts: the Black Sea.]{.underline}**

Since its annexation in 2014, the **[Crimean Peninsula has become a
Russian military fortress.]{.underline}** Moscow has significantly
increased its military presence in a region that Russian President
Vladimir [Putin considers the centerpiece of Russia's power projection
into the Mediterranean]{.underline}. It has now enough assets,
reinforced with
new [ships](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1047869183768317952?s=20) and [submarines](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1110869857157943297?s=20) with
powerful Kalibr missile systems, to overwhelm any coalition in these
waters. **[But Moscow wants more.]{.underline}** In 2021, the Russian
army will receive almost 3,500 pieces of new equipment, and two-thirds
of the military budget will go toward purchases of armaments and
upgrades. This includes the Ministry of Defense's latest Strategiya
automatic surface surveillance system in the Black Sea.

**[A growing American presence and a new Turkish strategy]{.underline}**
In response, the [U.S. Navy has stepped up its own military presence in
the Black
Sea](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1354842068519161863?s=20). In
the last two weeks, the USS Donald Cook and the USS Porter, guided
missile destroyers, and the USNS Laramie, a refueling ship, entered the
Black Sea in what has been the largest deployment in the region since
2017. Both destroyers are armed with Raytheon Tomahawk cruise missiles,
bringing real firepower to the Black Sea theater. The U.S. Navy's
appearance is an unmistakable show of force, demonstrating that it can
operate in a wide geography and without help from regional allies, if
necessary. America's presence in the Black Sea is important to check
Russian expansionism, but **[a more effective strategy calls for a
coordinated response from regional allies such as Turkey.]{.underline}**
Turkey's relationship with NATO and the U.S. in particular has been
rocky of late. Ignoring warnings from NATO and the threat of sanctions
from the U..S, Turkey went ahead with its purchase of the Russian S-400
air defense system, taking delivery of the first shipment in mid-2019.
But despite its growing defense partnership with Moscow, Ankara is
equally uneasy about the growing Russian military presence in a region
where Turkey once had the edge. In a 2016 plea to Turkey's NATO allies,
Turkish President Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan said the Black Sea had become
a "Russian lake" and called for a greater NATO presence, reversing a
decades-old Turkish policy of keeping the alliance out.]{.underline}**

**[Turkey has developed a multi-pronged strategy to counter Russian
influence in the Black Sea.]{.underline}** One important leg of that
strategy is on the home front, where Turkey is strengthening its navy.
[A project called MILGEM, a contraction of the Turkish for "national
ship" (milli gemi), was launched to design and construct naval vessels
in-country, including ADA class corvettes.]{.underline} In 2018,
the [Pakistani Navy signed a
contract](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1178795282798202880?s=20) to
acquire four of these ships from Turkey's state-run defense contractor
ASFAT, the first successful export of these vessels. Turkey has also
been building up its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities to
counter Russia's growing A2/AD assets in the Black Sea by ordering four
new frigates, called both Istanbul and MILGEM II. The frigates are based
on the ADA class corvette design but extended by 14 meters to enable the
inclusion of a vertical launching system for surface to air missiles.
The naval version of the
army's[ Korkut](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/970694646216249345?s=20) low-altitude
air defense system, Gökdeniz, will be added to the inventory for the
first time with the frigate. The
national [Atmaca](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1191311364343681024?s=20) anti-ship
missile will also be integrated into the first unit of the class, TCG
Istanbul, which is forecast for entry into service later this year.
Balancing Russia through regional military cooperation **[Turkey is
taking steps on the foreign policy front as well, stepping up its
cooperation with Ukraine, Georgia, and Azerbaijan]{.underline}**. Ankara
views these countries as instrumental in its efforts to balance the
Russian military presence in the Black Sea and South Caucasus. Since
Russia's annexation of Crimea, Turkish-Ukrainian relations have expanded
significantly. Last year, Erdoğan unveiled a \$36 million military aid
package for Ukraine. The two countries agreed to cooperate on the design
and manufacture of aircraft engines, radar
units, [drones](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1108309446034423808?s=20),
and navigation systems and consider collaboration on advanced technology
projects, such as ballistic missile systems. Turkey also plans to sell
its ships to Ukraine as part of a much bigger defense deal, which, if it
comes to fruition, could change the balance of power in the Black Sea.
Besides cooperation in defense industries, **[the Ukrainian and Turkish
navies
also [conduct](https://www.newsweek.com/estranged-russia-turkey-and-ukraine-join-forces-447473) joint
training in the Black Sea to showcase their ability to operate \"in
accordance with NATO standards.\" Turkey has also invested in shoring up
the defenses of Georgia, another Black Sea country threatened by
Russia's growing influence in the region]{.underline}**. [Turkey

of dollars to the Georgian Ministry of Defense to reform the country's
military logistics and transfer defense capabilities to its northeastern
neighbor while advocating for the extension of NATO membership to
Georgia, a move Russia opposes.]{.underline} Turkey's defense
cooperation with Azerbaijan has been growing as well, which was on full
display in the fighting in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh
late last year, when Ankara threw its full military support behind Baku.
Turkish drones provided Azerbaijan a huge advantage in the conflict,
which ended with Azerbaijan capturing significant swathes of territory
from Armenian forces. **[Turkey's military exports to Azerbaijan rose
six-fold in 2020, with Azerbaijan jumping to the top of the list of
Turkish arms buyers in September]{.underline}**. NATO and the Black Sea
[**NATO should support these Turkish efforts**. It should also establish
a permanent "Black Sea Maritime Patrol" group modeled on the successful
Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean.]{.underline} Operation Sea
Guardian is a flexible effort that can potentially cover the full range
of NATO's maritime security needs. **[In accordance with NATO's
"framework nation" concept, Turkey can be assigned the leading nation
role in the Black Sea and smaller members can integrate their own, more
limited capabilities into an organizational structure provided by
Ankara.]{.underline}** Mirroring other NATO missions in the Baltic or
Mediterranean, **[Turkey can play a coordinating role to bring in other
NATO allies willing to participate and provide support.]{.underline}**
Such a force would require NATO's coordination and political pressure
among non-Black Sea members to commit in advance to a regular and
rotational maritime presence in the Black Sea, in line with the 1936
Montreux Convention, which limits the presence of warships from
non-littoral states to a maximum of 21 days. Although the development of
such a multinational unit would require a sustained diplomatic effort,
**[once active, it would boost NATO's deterrence in a strategic region
that has become a springboard for Russia to project power from Georgia
all the way to Syria and Libya.]{.underline}**

#### Turkey is key in international cooperation with NATO for emerging technologies, AI, and biotechnology -- several benefits to keeping Turkey

[As technology continues to evolve, with the rise of autonomous
vehicles, the blockchain industry, and artificial intelligence, Turkey,
NATO and others continue to invest heavily in global technological
advancements]{.underline}. The global technological [developments allow
for various responses to geo-political issues, but also have the
potential to add more nuance to international issues.]{.underline}
**[The response to the rise in new and emerging technologies relies on
international coordination and cooperation.]{.underline}** [Domestic
advancement in Turkey, for instance, involves international issues and
stakeholders. **Turkey, the United States and NATO have continued to
develop and manufacture technological devices for space, communications
and vehicles**]{.underline}. In fact, NATO's Deputy Secretary General
Mircea Geoaña has [emphasized the increasing significance of
international cooperation on Artificial Intelligence (AI)]{.underline}
"as the most pervasive emerging and disruptive technology, especially
when combined with other technologies [such as big data, autonomy or
**biotechnologies**]{.underline}" (NATO, 2021). NATO uses the Science
and Technology Organization (STO) to maintain modern technology advances
for further development. The transatlantic collaboration amongst NATO
Member-states allows for these advancements to reach their full
potential in a world facing developing challenges.

[Start-up businesses also reap the benefits of Turkey's technological
advancements]{.underline}. Internet companies such as Trendyol and
Hepsiburada are becoming major players in the Turkish internet market,
and have attracted attention from Silicon Valley in the U.S. Along with
this, Turkey is the 20th largest market for eCommerce in 2020, and has
attracted the attention of several American companies. In 2020, the
centre joined the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C41R)
Network. In taking a more global approach, the goal of the center is to
research the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI),
autonomous vehicles, and blockchain technology. Each of these are issues
of focus for the U.S. as well.

[It is clear that Turkey is contouring its policies and posturing itself
to become a leading country in the field of digital revolution while the
United States uses its continued advancements and investments to combat
threats]{.underline}. Technological advancements made in **[Turkey
highlight the role of trans-atlantic and global partnerships while
international investments]{.underline}**, with the United States for
instance, enable a comprehensive understanding of the new and emerging
challenges. [Global cooperation is **paramount** in the sharing of new
technological advancements when crises arise and the most efficient
manner to respond to them.]{.underline} The universal elements of
technology allow geo-politics and foriegn policy to thrive in
efficiency; however, understanding the setbacks and stagnation in
regions is equally important.

### US-Turkey Partnership

#### Alliance and cooperation with Turkey is key for NATO and U.S. deterrence strategies that is neccessary to fighting Advantage 1's impacts

This **[research suggests that it is the strength of the US-Turkish
political-security relationship that is the most important factor for
ensuring the credibility of the United States' extended nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**. In fact, the credibility of the US nuclear
umbrella has little to do with the type of its nuclear weapons, the
number of warheads, or the negative image of US nuclear competency
generated from the Air Force's nuclear handling missteps. Instead, [US
credibility depends on Turkey's perception of its political, economic,
and military ties with the United States. It is the quality of that
broader relationship that will also have the greatest influence on
whether or not Turkish leaders pursue an independent nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline}. [Turkey generally measures the strength of its
security relationship with the United States through the lens of the
reliability of bilateral and multilateral security and partnership
agreements such as NATO]{.underline} and the European Union (EU).
Although there are many ways to measure the strength of these types of
relationships---domestic polls, media tone, treaties, and agreements---
the perception of national leadership is the most important. [It is the
highest level of Turkish decision makers that will decide the merits of
continued reliance on the US extended nuclear deterrent.]{.underline}
Undoubtedly, domestic influence and external security threats influence
those decision makers, but [for Turkey, it is the perception of alliance
strength that will have the most influence on its nuclear proliferation
decisions.]{.underline}

**[Cyprus has been priority number one in Turkish foreign affairs for
many years]{.underline}**. The island has been a highly contentious
issue for both Greece and Turkey, as well as for the international
community. [The tensions between the two countries have slowed down the
strategic partnership between the EU and NATO in its fullest
sense]{.underline}. According to the North Atlantic Council decision of
2002 Cyprus and Malta are excluded from participating in EUNATO meetings
concerning 'strategic cooperation' between the two sides of the
Atlantic. However, the EU, based on the community solidarity principle,
does not want to leave Cyprus out of this security dialogue. [Turkey
insists on the validity of the North Atlantic Council decision of 2002
and blocks the participation of Cyprus in the NATO-EU strategic
cooperation]{.underline}, Cyprus blocks Turkish membership and
participation in the EU decision making mechanisms concerning security
in return. Given all these tensions, **[there is still no guarantee that
once the Cyprus problem is resolved, the EU and NATO will automatically
cooperate.]{.underline}** All the attention is now on this mutual
blockade and the Cyprus problem is often blamed for non-cooperation
(Buharalı, 2008). The Cyprus problem has transcended regional bickering
to become an international problem**[. It is a long lived debate and an
agreement does not seem to be reached soon.]{.underline}** One has to
acknowledge that even if the Cyprus problem were solved today, many
complications remain. [The EU and the United States have different
approaches to security that might make it difficult to work
together.]{.underline} Furthermore Turkey is still only a candidate
member, and would not be allowed in the EU decision making processes.
The [EU-NATO cooperation needs an active Turkish presence to be
effective in the region.]{.underline} The different approaches of the EU
and the US may be the biggest problem impeding the transatlantic
security alliance in the future. The EU as a soft power does not use the
same means as the hard power United States and vice-versa. The division
of tasks between the EU and NATO has created yet another problem. 6 It
would be much less costly and easier to overcome the problems in the
conflict zones if the two could decide on who is doing what. For now,
instead of waiting for the Cyprus problem to be solved, new grounds for
cooperation have to be found.
