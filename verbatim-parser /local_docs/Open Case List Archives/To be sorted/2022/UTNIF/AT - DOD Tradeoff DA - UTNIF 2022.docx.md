### Ukraine Thumper + Not Zero-Sum

#### Ukraine thumps the Asia pivot AND it's not zero-sum

**Madhani and Megerian 22** (Aamer Madhani and Chris Megerian, "Biden's
China 'pivot' complicated by Russia's war in Ukraine," AP News, 2022,
<https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-biden-business-china-d47d4b2215de708b55a12bc4b648818d)>

President Joe [Biden set out to finally complete the "pivot to
Asia,]{.underline}" a long-sought adjustment of U.S. foreign policy to
better reflect the rise of America's most significant military and
economic competitor: China. [But Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has
made that vexing move **even more complicated**]{.underline}. China's
government has vacillated between full embrace and more measured
responses as Russian President Vladimir Putin prosecutes his war, making
the decisions for Biden far more layered. Biden and China's Xi Jinping
are scheduled to speak by phone on Friday, a conversation that the White
House says will center on "managing the competition between our two
countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of
mutual concern." [The Biden administration is left needing to **focus
east and west at the same time**]{.underline}, [balancing]{.underline}
[not simply economic imperatives but military ones as well]{.underline}.
"**[It's difficult. It's expensive]{.underline}**," Kurt Campbell, the
coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs on the White House National
Security Council, said during a recent forum of maintaining a high-level
U.S. focus in two regions. "**[But]{.underline}** it's also essential,
and I believe [we're entering a period where that's what will be
required of the United States]{.underline} and of this generation of
Americans." [Biden has been deeply invested in rallying NATO and Western
allies to respond to Russia]{.underline} with crippling sanctions,
supplying an overmatched Ukraine military with \$2 billion in military
assistance --- including \$800 million in new aid announced Wednesday
--- and addressing a growing humanitarian crisis. Eastern flank NATO
allies, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, have
made clear to the Biden administration that they want the U.S. to
increase its military presence in the region and do more to address the
worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. More than 3
million Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in recent weeks.
[Though the war in Ukraine has dominated Biden's focus of
late]{.underline}, [White House officials]{.underline} insist they
**[haven't lost sight of China]{.underline}** --- and are watching
intently to see how Xi decides to play his hand.

#### Distraction now AND the military is unprepared in Asia

**Montgomery and Bowman 22** (Mark Montgomery, senior fellow at the
Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Bradley Bowman, senior director
of the Center on Military and Political Power at FDD, "Apply the lessons
from Ukraine in the Taiwan Strait," Defense News, 2022,
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/03/08/nine-lessons-from-ukraine-to-apply-in-the-taiwan-strait/)>

[With the **world's attention fixed** on]{.underline} the national
security and humanitarian catastrophe in [Ukraine]{.underline} caused by
Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion, [a similar
disaster is brewing in the Pacific]{.underline}. [Taking a page from
Putin's playbook, the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party, or
[CCP]{.underline}, [is methodically assembling combat power to coerce or
conquer the free people of Taiwan]{.underline}. [Preventing that from
happening will require Washington to learn the right lessons
from]{.underline} the disaster in [Ukraine]{.underline}. [Among them is
the need for Washington to **spend less time worrying** about provoking
authoritarian bullies and more time working to defend]{.underline}
threatened [democracies]{.underline} before the invasion starts. This is
especially critical as U.S. forces are much more likely to be directly
involved in a response to coercion against Taiwan. For 25 years, Beijing
has pursued a determined strategy featuring military modernization,
technological advancements, economic infiltration, cyberattacks and
persistent disinformation campaigns. These efforts have focused on
building a world-class military, erasing American military supremacy in
the seas and skies around Taiwan, and preparing for a potential attack
designed to establish CCP dominion over Taiwan. Meanwhile, **[the United
States has been distracted]{.underline}** elsewhere, **[unable to focus
its strategic and fiscal efforts on the rising power in
China]{.underline}**. [This has been compounded by consistent
congressional failures to provide the Pentagon with the timely,
sufficient and predictable funding necessary to modernize U.S. forces
and maintain sufficient readiness and capacity]{.underline}. Indeed,
[the Department of Defense has received on-time funding only once in the
last 13 fiscal years]{.underline}. Exacerbating these dynamics,
[Washington has been slow in addressing serious concerns and specific
requests for resources identified by Indo-Pacific Command]{.underline}
in successive reports to Congress. Just last year, the command again
warned that [the military balance of power in the region continues to
become "**more** **unfavorable**" for America and its
allies]{.underline}.

[The United States, our allies]{.underline}, and our partners worldwide
[are united in support of Ukraine]{.underline} in response to Russia's
premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war against Ukraine. We have
not forgotten Russia's earlier aggression in eastern Ukraine and
occupation following its unlawful seizure of Crimea in 2014. The United
States reaffirms its unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and
territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders,
extending to its territorial waters. Ukraine is a key regional strategic
partner that has undertaken significant efforts to modernize its
military and increase its interoperability with NATO. It remains an
urgent security assistance priority to provide Ukraine the equipment it
needs to defend itself against Russia's war against Ukraine. [Since
January 2021, the United States has invested more than \$4.5 billion in
security assistance]{.underline} to demonstrate our enduring and
steadfast commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
[This includes more than \$3.8 billion since Russia's launched
its]{.underline} premeditated, unprovoked, and brutal [war against
Ukraine]{.underline} on February 24. Since 2014, the United States has
provided more than \$6.5 billion in security assistance for training and
equipment to help Ukraine preserve its territorial integrity, secure its
borders, and improve interoperability with NATO.

### \-\--xt: Not Zero-Sum

#### The US [can]{.underline} focus on both regions at once

**Kroenig 22** (Matthew Security, deputy director of the Atlantic
Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and a professor in
the Department of Government and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign
Service at Georgetown University, "Washington Must Prepare for War With
Both Russia and China," *Foreign Policy*, 2022,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/18/us-russia-china-war-nato-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/)>

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear: [How can the United States]{.underline}
[manage]{.underline} two revisionist, autocratic, nuclear-armed great
powers ([Russia and China]{.underline}) [simultaneously?]{.underline}
[The answer, according to many]{.underline} politicians and [defense
experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to Russia in
Europe to focus on]{.underline} the greater threat posed by
[China]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific. **[This would be a
mistake]{.underline}**. **[The United States]{.underline}** remains the
world's leading power with global interests, and it **[cannot afford to
choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Instead,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [should develop a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and
China at the same time]{.underline}. In recent weeks, Biden has sent
several thousand U.S. troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for
good reason. A major war in Ukraine could spill across international
boundaries and threaten the seven NATO allies that border Russia,
Belarus, and Ukraine. Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin
succeeds in Ukraine, why would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear
interest in resurrecting the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable
Eastern European countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic
states---might be next. A successful Russian incursion into a NATO
ally's territory could mean the end of the Western alliance and the
credibility of U.S. security commitments globally. The threat posed by
China is also serious. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years. This is a war the United States might lose. If China
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well on its way to disrupting the
U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to doing the same globally.
Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly working together. As this
month's summit between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shows,
Moscow and Beijing are forging a closer strategic partnership, including
on military matters. These dictators could coordinate dual attacks on
the U.S. alliance structure or opportunistically seize on the
distraction provided by the other's aggression. In other words, there is
a serious risk of simultaneous major-power wars in both Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. To address this problem, many have proposed answers that
simply will not work. The Biden administration initially hoped to put
relations with Russia on a "stable and predictable" footing to focus on
China, but Putin had other ideas, as the world is now seeing in Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Washington does not get to decide how its adversaries
sequence their aggression. Others have expressed hope that Washington
can peel these powers apart or even align with Russia against China, but
these are not realistic solutions. The misguided view gaining the most
recent acceptance, however, is that Washington should simply choose the
Indo-Pacific over Europe. Politicians and experts argue that the United
States lacks the resources to take on both Russia and China. They point
to China's power and Asia's wealth and argue that Asia should be the
priority. While Washington pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries,
such as Germany, should step up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed,
the Biden administration's National Defense Strategy, which has been
delayed due to the Ukraine crisis, is expected to focus on China without
offering a clear solution to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy
starts with clear goals---and Washington's objectives are to maintain
peace and stability in both Europe and Asia. [A good
strategy]{.underline}, however, [starts with clear goals, and
Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and stability in **both**
Europe and Asia]{.underline}. U[.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies]{.underline}. Indeed, the European Union,
not Asia, is the United States' largest trade and investment partner,
and this imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States
seeks greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
Moreover, [**the United States is not France**; it is **not compelled**
to make gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due
to constrained resources]{.underline}. In short, publishing [a defense
strategy that can only handle one of the United States' great-power
rivals]{.underline} (which is what is expected from the forthcoming
national defense strategy) [is planning to fail]{.underline}.

security environment and laying the groundwork for future stability
operations with allies and partners]{.underline}. Security cooperation,1
in the form of noncombat military-to-military activities, includes
"normal" peacetime activities, such as building the long-term
institutional and operational capabilities and capacity of key partners
and allies, establishing and deepening relationships between the United
States and partner militaries, and securing access to critical areas
overseas. Security cooperation also can include conducting
quasi-operational efforts, such as helping U.S. partners and allies
manage their own internal defense.

### Asia Pivot Bad

#### Pivot to Europe solves Russia war, pivot to Asia causes it

**McKinley** **22** (Michael McKinley, non-resident senior adviser at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "It's Time to Pivot
Back to Europe," *Politico*, 2022,
<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/24/its-time-to-pivot-back-to-europe-00011324>)

President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the separatist republics of
Luhansk and Donetsk, which opened the door to the wider assault on
Ukraine that is now underway, is a game-changer on a historic scale. It
underscores, like nothing else, that the drift away from Europe by the
United States over the past 20 years in pursuit of wars and priorities
elsewhere has been short-sighted. Like 1949, the year in which the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization came into being, [America and its European
allies are facing a moment requiring a profound redefinition of their
security, political and economic ties]{.underline}. Going forward,
[a]{.underline} strategic, not tactical, [pivot back to Europe **should
be the driving imperative** of American foreign policy]{.underline}. In
doing so, it is important to accept reality: Putin called the bluff of
the not-very-collected West, which was equivocating by placing only
selective sanctions on Russia for its virtual annexation of part of
Ukraine. Putin is unlikely to be deterred by a staggered escalation of
these measures meant to allow room for him to change course: He is dead
set on achieving at least a partial reconstitution of the Russian empire
as he sees it and forcing the creation of a new security architecture
for Europe. Putin's words need to be taken seriously instead of being
dismissed as ramblings or misleading. For all the lingering suggestions
that there is still time for diplomacy, Putin could not have been
clearer this week that he was also setting the stage for more aggressive
steps in the very near future. He even raised a non-existent nuclear
threat to Russia from a NATO-dominated Ukraine and again dismissed
Ukrainian national identity as a fiction. Arriving at this point, too
many commentators and politicians spent months resorting to dismissive
rhetoric about Putin even as he outmaneuvered Western leaders. They
belittled Russia --- as a declining power, a declining economy and as a
nation fearful of democratization on its borders. They argued that the
United States and NATO allies could force Putin to rethink his actions
--- even though there has been no sign of him reconsidering course. Some
argued that Putin would not risk war given the likely costs. It is now
possible to see the limits of their world view. The inviolability of a
nation's sovereignty and its right to decide its own security alliances
have also been presented as self-evident truths. In the case of Ukraine,
however, many of us side-stepped uncomfortable questions about why NATO
did not invite the country to join, and about the precedents set for
Finland and Austria after World War II to ensure their neutrality. A now
prophetic article by Henry Kissinger in 2014 makes it clear that
something like the neutrality option would have been a more desirable
outcome for Ukraine and reflected the reality of Ukraine's situation.
The West will find it difficult to break the momentum that Russia is
building, or to reverse the new realities Putin is creating.
[Russia]{.underline} may not be a colossus, but it remains one of the
most powerful countries in the world, with a nuclear arsenal, a
modernized military and a serious player in international oil and gas
markets. It [cannot]{.underline}, in other words, [be dismissed only as
a "regional power threatening its neighbors out of
weakness,"]{.underline} and while it is becoming an outright
dictatorship by smothering democracy at home, that is not a central
concern in the current crisis. [Russia can project its military
globally]{.underline} --- as its interventions in Syria and elsewhere
have shown. [It can wage cyberattacks on Europe and the United States
with relative impunity]{.underline}. Putin has triumphed in political
showdowns with leaders like Turkey's President Erdogan and, even as
Russia's relationship with Europe in general turns adversarial, the
likes of Serbia and NATO member Hungary appear more sympathetic to
Putin. World leaders until last week came to Putin as he limited his own
international travel --- and gave little away. Russia's diplomatic
fortunes are hardly crumbling elsewhere, as evidenced by a rising
entente between China and Russia --- aligned in their security interests
against perceived Western encroachment. There is another factor at work,
and that is that Putin's view of history, often seen as opportunistic,
does appear to be a primary driver of his actions. And it is not his
worldview alone. The incorporation of Russian-speaking populations
inside neighboring borders after 1991 remains an issue for nationalists
in Moscow; and the West has systematically downplayed how NATO expansion
since 1997 has looked to a generation of Russian leaders, and not just
President Putin. It is not dovish, as a recent New Yorker article
suggested, or appeasement as a British defense minister stated, to take
these perceptions into account in the current crisis. The deep
undercurrents of historical myth drive almost every nation into
destructive paths. It is in this context that the United States and its
allies have chosen to draw a line in the sand over a further Russian
military intervention in Ukraine which has now materialized on a major
scale. The relative success of President Joe Biden in preserving a
united front with European allies on a gradual escalation of sanctions
masks the lingering challenges of fully cohering on strategy. There have
been differences between the responses by the United States and Britain
on the one hand; the French and the Germans on another; and disparate
governments like Italy (opposed to energy sanctions as late as this past
weekend) and Hungary (offering veiled sympathy to Russia's demands).
French President Emmanuel Macron until recently was openly discussing
the need for a new security architecture for Europe. Chancellor Olaf
Scholz of Germany told national reporters on his return from Moscow that
"we just can't have a possible military conflict over a question that is
not on the agenda" regarding Ukraine's future membership in NATO. As EU
foreign ministers met in Brussels this week, there were continued
differences between those arguing for "incrementalism" on sanctions like
Germany and Italy, and those wanting a more forceful response. There may
be greater unity now as the scale of the Russian invasion becomes clear,
but the proof will only be evident in the coming days. The allies'
caution in recent days contrasted with President Zelensky's increasing
concern as options close around him. The gathering of senior NATO and EU
ministers at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 18-20, as well as
the presence of a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Kamala Harris,
did not convey the strongest confidence on an agreed approach to Russian
aggression. President Zelensky's speech at the gathering was a searing
indictment of the lack of decisiveness of Western nations over the last
many years, and Ukrainian ministers were publicly critical of the slow
pace of the imposition of sanctions since the recognition of the
separatist republics by Russia. [Western governments are now at a real,
not hypothetical crossroads]{.underline}. The invasion is underway, and
Putin would appear to be achieving his long-stated objectives, some of
which he began to make clear 15 years ago in a speech to the 2007 Munich
Security Conference. He has torn up the 2015 Minsk agreement which was
meant to be the foundation for talks between Ukraine and Russia
regarding the future of the Donbas. Putin is calculating he can survive
sanctions for an indefinite period as he builds a significant war chest
of foreign reserves. He is also betting on a swifter and easier military
victory in Ukraine than Western analysts are predicting. If either of
these scenarios were to hold, NATO, EU and American threats or actions
would end up ringing hollow to most of the rest of the world. Putin, in
short, means to complete what he has started, and more. As Lithuanian
Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis suggested, Ukraine may not be
the end of the story, and Belarus' renewed and total subservience to
Moscow can, in retrospect, be seen as prelude to Putin's attempt to do
the same to Ukraine. In responding to Russia's expanding aggression in
Ukraine, Western nations will build towards ever more severe sanctions.
There will be United Nations resolutions and condemnations. Russian
oligarchs may lose their right to residence and investment in London and
Paris. Nord Stream 2 is being suspended and may be canceled. NATO may be
strengthened; European members may finally spend 2 percent of their GDP
on defense. NATO may accelerate military assistance to Ukraine or arm an
insurgency in Ukraine in the future. The broader international community
may be galvanized into supporting harsher measures to punish Russia
depending on the scale of the conflict. Longer-term, however, the latest
developments suggest it is time to rethink the West's approach to the
next phase of dealing with Putin. That will entail recognizing that the
security landscape of Europe is being changed as we watch, in real time,
and is unlikely to be turned back to what it was any time soon. The
response must stop Russia from destroying the post-World War II
architecture that has largely preserved peace for 70 years. Doing so
will require another historic decision and response. [We need to
revitalize NATO and the transatlantic economic and political relations
which have been **weakened for two decades as the United States
prioritized Asia**]{.underline}, abandoned trade agreements, diverted
NATO to fight wars farther afield and allowed allies to take for granted
the alliance's centrality to their own collective defense. In the
process, we may rediscover that [the future of the United States is
still **most fundamentally impacted by what happens in
Europe**]{.underline}.

#### Asia pivot causes Russian aggression and solve focus on Asia can't solve Chinese aggression

**Gerecht and Takeyh** **22** (Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former Middle
Eastern targets officer in the Central Intelligence Agency, is a senior
fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Ray Takeyh, a
senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, "The Folly of the
'Pivot to Asia': China is a rising challenge, but neglecting Europe and
the Middle East won't help America confront it.," *Wall Street Journal*,
<https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-folly-of-the-pivot-to-asia-pacific-china-russia-global-power-nato-11647981737)>

[Seldom has a diplomatic phrase been more reckless than]{.underline} the
Obama administration's "**[pivot to Asia]{.underline}**." The U.S. has
never been able to disentangle itself from key regions of the world, as
the war in Ukraine demonstrates. But [the notion that a new "Pacific
century" should become the nation's defining priority surely has
**emboldened adversaries** elsewhere and **called into question** other
alliances, including the most indispensable, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization]{.underline}. The question that ought to haunt the [White
House]{.underline} today is whether its ignominious retreat from
Afghanistan in the name of ending so-called forever wars, and its
[stream of press releases insisting that China is the only rival worthy
of attention, prompted]{.underline} an impetuous Vladimir [Putin to
undertake the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II]{.underline}. In January 1950, Secretary of State Dean Acheson gave a
speech placing Korea outside America's defense perimeter, thus inviting
aggression from North Korea. Often overlooked in that speech is Mr.
Acheson's insistence that "it is a mistake . . . to become obsessed with
military invasions" when thinking strategically about Asia and the
Pacific. Acheson seemed to assume that the dilemmas of newly independent
Asian states came from internal subversion stemming from economic
stagnation. To be fair, the Truman administration didn't shrink from its
responsibilities in Europe when war broke out in the Korean Peninsula.
The U.S. has been a global power for a century and has always given some
regions and countries priority over others. Early in the Cold War,
Europe's economic rehabilitation and its military defense preoccupied
America's politicians and strategists. In the 1960s, as the Cold War
stabilized in Europe, the U.S. turned its gaze toward Asia, where a
truculent China and an eastward-looking Soviet Union were both bent on
exporting revolution. With 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, the Far East
became a priority. And in the aftermath of 9/11, the Middle East took on
importance as Washington hunted down terrorists and sought, however
haphazardly, to refashion a political culture that had generated so much
hate. [Before]{.underline} Barack [Obama, no president had insisted that
the exigencies of one region mandated ignoring others]{.underline}. The
U.S. fought prolonged wars in East Asia, yet Washington didn't claim
that these conflicts meant that it had to pivot from Europe or Latin
America. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were beset by Vietnam; they
didn't complain about "forever wars" and the need to leave the Far East.
When George W. Bush found himself mired in Iraq, he didn't proclaim that
Europe and Asia no longer mattered. Burden sharing has been an objective
of all U.S. presidents. [The strategic neglect of Asia-firsters is
new]{.underline}. Joe Biden must be considered the least authentic of
China hawks. Much more than Mr. Obama, he has brandished the China
threat as cover for isolationism. Even the hasty departure from
Afghanistan was in part justified as a means of focusing on China.
Leaving Afghanistan would somehow, Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told us, make the U.S. stronger vis-à-vis Xi Jinping. At home Democrats
partly justified exorbitant domestic spending as a means of rebuilding
an America better able to resist China. Yet Mr. Biden hasn't taken any
serious military measures, or reinitiated a free-trading alliance, to
confront Beijing. This disconnect between words and deeds might have
been starkest when, soon after his inauguration, Mr. Biden held a summit
meeting with Mr. Putin---whom Democrats had denounced throughout Donald
Trump's presidency as a threat to democracy---where he pressed for a
"stable and predictable" relationship with Moscow. Much of the cheap
talk about pivoting stems from U.S. frustrations in the Middle East. The
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan caused the political class to question its
assumptions about American power. Yet the Middle East remains. Energy
markets are still global. Fracking hasn't made Persian Gulf oil less
important to America's national security. The perverse interplay between
Arab authoritarian states and Islamic radicalism (the former feeds the
latter) continues. Iran's nuclear ambitions, unimpeded by arms-control
diplomacy, will soon confront the international community. As Mr. Putin
has shown, a revisionist leader, armed with nuclear weapons and nursing
grievances, can easily rattle, if not upend, financial markets and
cherished assumptions. [For the foreseeable future, the Far East will
have a prominent place in America's strategic imagination]{.underline}.
China's conversion from a communist laggard to a rich and militarily
powerful fascist state has Western leaders in a bind, given that they
literally bet the bank on the hope that investment and trade would
somehow pacify Beijing's ambitions. **[But China's rise doesn't mean
that Europe matters little]{.underline}** or that the Middle East can be
ignored. The U.S. isn't Sweden. **[When America retreats, everyone
suffers]{.underline}**.

### US-Europe Relations Solve China War

#### US-Europe relations are a force-multiplier that solve Chinese aggression

France's fretting should serve as a warning to the Biden administration.
[The US focus on East Asia continues to rock relations between
Washington and its European allies. In transitioning its strategic
priorities towards the Pacific]{.underline}, **[the United States cannot
succeed]{.underline}** alone. [Incorporating allies and
partners---including those in Europe---in]{.underline} the planning,
negotiating, and implementation stages of [its efforts to manage threats
from China will be critical]{.underline}. The effort should also pay
dividends. [By restoring and reinvigorating damaged European alliances,
the United States will be **better positioned** to manage threats in
**East Asia and elsewhere**]{.underline}.

#### Europe is a key counterbalance against Chinese leadership

British, French, and Spanish ties with Africa are important in pushing
back against China's growing influence in the continent. European

important trade partner and plays a key role in the American economy. It
is home to many U.S. military bases used for important
missions]{.underline}, most recently during the evacuation from
Afghanistan. Its scientific and technological achievements contribute to
American prosperity---the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that the president of
the United States and millions of others recieved would not have been
made without German partnership. **[America can't afford to take Europe
for granted]{.underline}** anymore. They need us and **[we need
them]{.underline}**. The hard part of alliance management is supposed to
be responding to the needs, wants, and objectives, and insecurities of
the other side. But lately, the United States has had more trouble
figuring out what its own needs, wants, and objectives in Europe
are---or if it has any at all.

### China Not a Threat

#### The US has the overwhelming military advantage

[The US military dominates the strategic, tactical, and operational
levels of warfare across the spectrum. The Pentagon is implementing
sophisticated network warfare programs]{.underline} such as the Advanced
Battle Management System, Project Convergence, and Joint All Domain
Command and Control. [China is concerned]{.underline} about the lethal
and distributed US military, equipped with a potent combination of
quantity and quality of weapon systems. [The USN surpasses the PLAN in
rapid deployment, maneuverability, and expeditionary warfare
capabilities. The overwhelming display of US military power since 1945
**is a credible deterrent for Beijing**]{.underline}. [Since the First
Gulf War, the United States has demonstrated its capability of
destroying the adversary through preemptive strikes consisting of
long-range weapon systems such as cruise missiles in the first few days
of the war, giving no time for the adversary to
retaliate]{.underline}.75 According to Taylor Fravel, **[China is not a
military superpower]{.underline}**.76 [There is not]{.underline} much
[evidence about China's plans for global military capabilities on par
with the United States. China's military power is miniscule as compared
to United States' former adversary the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
**[China's military will be thinly stretched]{.underline}** defending
the third-largest country in the world. [The top echelons of the CCP and
PLA acknowledge US military advantages]{.underline}. [Chinese
scholars]{.underline} like Xu Ruike and Sun Degang [admit]{.underline}
that [China is an economic heavyweight but is a military featherweight
and **will remain so** for the coming decades]{.underline}.77 **[US
primacy]{.underline}** in the post--Cold War world **[has prevented
World War III]{.underline}**. The two most likely contenders for
expansion, North Korea and China, have restricted their militaries
within their borders. [The United States retains **unrivaled** military
power, and China is **not in a position to challenge it**]{.underline}.

#### The US leads across all military spectrums

Why **[China Cannot Challenge the United States]{.underline}**

People's Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) [Major]{.underline} General
Zhang Shaozhong [ranked Chinese military power in 2020 in the fifth
place]{.underline} behind the United States, Russia, Britain, and
France, [while PLAN surface power was ranked in the eighth
place]{.underline} behind Japan and India. The Peoples Liberation Army
Air Force ([PLAAF]{.underline}) [was ranked seventh]{.underline} in the
world, due to its lack of fourth-generation fighter planes and high-end
drones. In General Shaozhong's view, China will become the
second-largest military power in the world only in 2049, when it
celebrates its centennial anniversary.27 The US Military as an Economic
Deterrent [The US military plays the central role of economic
deterrence]{.underline}. The Communist Party of China
([CCP]{.underline}) [gains its legitimacy from economic
development]{.underline}. [It is possible that China could target Guam
with its small fleet of]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missiles
([ICBM]{.underline}). [However, the use of ICBMs will lead to massive
retaliatory strikes by the United States leading to total annihilation
of China's military and economic centers of gravity]{.underline}.28 The
USN Maritime Strike Tomahawk Cruise Missile Block V will destroy coastal
cities like Shanghai, obliterating China's hi-tech industries in a
matter of hours. The CCP leadership is inexperienced in nuclear matters
as it lacks exposure to a nuclear warfare strategy as practiced by the
United States and Russia. [China's nuclear policy is based on low-level
deterrence, "minimum deterrence," and its nuclear arsenal remains small
and vulnerable]{.underline}.29 **[Threatening the United
States]{.underline}** with 200 nuclear weapons **[is not an
option]{.underline}**. Geographically, the United States and China are
similar in size. However, [China's economy will be decimated by a few US
nuclear weapons, as its critical infrastructure is concentrated on the
coastlines and not dispersed like the US infrastructure]{.underline}. [A
war will lead to a loss of China's exports]{.underline} to the United
States worth USD 310 billion. The war will result in a decline in
industrial production, unemployment, and inflation, causing an economic
crash and a people's revolution. As seen from World War II, the United
States will experience reverse economic gains and benefit from the war,
resulting in high employment and industrial growth. It is expensive to
be a superpower. Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War two and a half
millennia ago, "first count the cost."30 China's defense budget cannot
compete with the combined power of United States, India, Japan, and
Australia. The United States alone spends more on national defense than
China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
Japan, South Korea, and Brazil combined.31 Can China afford it? An arms
race will lead to an increase in China's military spending, affecting
its development goals. The Absence of War-fighting Experience The United
States has an analytical learning process in place---China does not.32
Lessons learned have been well documented by the US military in the form
of doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures. The US military has
been documenting lessons learned since as early as the Boxer Revolution
during the China campaign.33 The US military has been led by outstanding
military generals like George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, George
Patton, and David Petraeus, while China always lacked great generals.
The world sends its military officers to US military institutions and
not China's military colleges. [The PLA strategy is based on Mao's
theory of the weak contender fighting a stronger adversary through
deceit and deception. China's only option is an asymmetric
strategy]{.underline} due to its incapability to fight symmetric wars.
Chinese scholars have authored books like Science of Military Campaigns,
Science of Military Strategy, and Unrestricted Warfare.34 However, China
is unable to convert the strategies and tactics mentioned in these books
into an executable doctrine. The Lack of Power Projection Power
projection capabilities set a superpower apart. From its Charm Offensive
to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has been wielding its
economic power to compel US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific
region to align with China, which has not been greatly successful.35
China lacks global reach, as it does not have foreign defense treaties
or logistical bases abroad equipped with military stockpiles.36 During a
war with the United States, soliciting Pakistan's military support looks
difficult, as China's all-weather friend has been hesitant to cut its
military ties with the United States. [China is constrained to operate
beyond the unrefueled range of its aircraft, warships, and
submarines]{.underline}. [US nuclear-powered carriers can rule the seas
for four years before being refueled]{.underline}. China's
nonnuclear-powered AC can barely operate beyond its green waters. The
Type 903 replenishment ship can only support two to three ships for
approximately two weeks.37 The USN's 68 nuclear-powered submarines have
been prowling the world's oceans displaying naval power, while the
PLAN's nuclear-powered submarines are unable to do so. Fighter aircraft
operating without a package of air-refueling tankers, Airborne Warning
and Control System aircraft, or a network of expeditionary airfields
cannot travel very far. The PLAAF's capability to target US bases in the
Pacific is hindered by a lack of air-refueling capacity. A flight group
of eight J-11B Flankers will have to be simultaneously refueled twice by
two air-refueling tankers for a seven-hour flight.38 The PLAAF will have
to deploy 20 percent of its tanker fleet to refuel the Flankers. The
PLAAF has 10 tankers for more than a thousand fighter aircraft, while
the USAF has 625 tankers for 1,956 fighter aircraft.39 The tankers will
be the prime targets for the USN potentially putting the Flankers at
risk. [China's only existing bomber, the H-6K, is reverse engineered
from the 1950s Soviet-designed Tu-16 bomber]{.underline}. The bomber is
incapable of attacking Hawaii---even when equipped with CJ-10 cruise
missiles. The H-6K has a range of 3,800 miles, while Hawaii is 5,157
miles from the closest H-6K base. The H-6K cannot attack nearby US
bases, as the bomber will be detected on open seas by the US C4ISR
systems. [PLAAF fighters are unable to escort the bombers, as they
cannot match its range]{.underline}.40 An Archaic Military [Less than 30
percent of China's surface forces, air force, and air defense forces and
55 percent of its submarine fleet were modern in 2011]{.underline}.41.
Subsequently, nothing much has changed, as a substantial percentage of
China's military remains obsolete.42 [China's military faces
institutional shortcomings]{.underline} arising from obsolete command
structures, low quality of personnel, and corruption.43 The military has
weaknesses centering on supporting capabilities such as logistics,
inadequate airlift, and deficient air defense and antisubmarine
warfare.44 The PLA's loyalty to the CCP has hampered its competence.45
China's military training and operational capabilities and competences
do not match US standards.46 PLAAF pilots fall short on the requirement
of executing sophisticated aerial maneuvers during unplanned
operations.47 [China's military structure presents significant cultural
challenges]{.underline},48 [as it emphasizes control above
command]{.underline}.49 [A culture of risk aversion and low levels of
trust in subordinates impacts the PLA effectiveness]{.underline}.50 A
highly centralized structure does not allow the PLAN to operate
autonomously during a war. Therefore, a political commissar is
positioned on PLAN warships and submarines.51 The USN values autonomy
from the individual to the institution, which reflects its emphasis on
commanding at sea.52 Nation states cannot project power globally through
a rigid command-and-control system.53 [PLAN submarines have the worst
safety record in the world]{.underline}.54 The PLAN's rudimentary
nuclear missile submarine fleet carries a limited number of missiles.55
The PLAN cannot threaten the US mainland, as its submarines will have to
sail through chokepoints such as the Kuriles and the Ryukyus islands,
Luzon Strait, Taiwan Strait, and the Philippine archipelago---all of
which are controlled by the USN.56 These chokepoints, forming a
crescent-shaped chain, are also a defensive line for US containment
policy; and the United States is involved in monitoring them. The PLAN
submarine power is outdated, compared to the overwhelming USN undersea
warfare capabilities. The US submarine arm brings strategic deterrence
to the Indo-Pacific through a wide array of capabilities such as
antisubmarine warfare antisurface warfare precision land strike;
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and special warfare
capabilities. Soviet weapon systems were much sought after by the United
States to learn their strengths and weaknesses. Numerous Soviet-made
fighter aircraft defected during the Cold War. An Iraqi MiG 21 defected
to Israel, while a Soviet MiG 25 landed in Japan. The aircraft were
later handed over to the United States to decipher the technical
details. However, US intelligence is not similarly orchestrating any
defections of PLAAF fighter aircraft, as the United States is not
interested in obsolete Chinese technology. Instead, China is stealing
weapon data or reverse engineering US weapon systems.57 The
CCP-controlled military press described the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark
fighter aircraft as a "flopping fish" and criticized it for lacking the
stealth capabilities of the F-35 Lightning.58 The US F-117 Nighthawk
stealth fighter entered service in 1983 and saw combat during the First
Gulf War, while the fifth-generation F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning
fighter aircraft have been deployed in conflict zones. However, the
PLAAF has not operationally inducted the J-31 fighter aircraft while the
J-20 fighter aircraft has not yet proven its capabilities in any
bilateral or multilateral military exercise. The much-hyped Chengdu J-20
is a heavy fighter aircraft comparable to the MiG 31, which is
essentially an interceptor and not a multirole or an air superiority
aircraft. China's Vulnerable A2/AD Zones A study of modern wars suggests
that [the United States will **decimate** China's military without
entering the A2/AD zone]{.underline}. This is how the United States
devastated Iraqi defenses in 1990. US strategic depth in Asia will allow
military planners to concentrate the military at different locations.
[The United States has a devastating array of lethal weapon
systems]{.underline}, such as submarines, [for countering China's A2/AD
strategies]{.underline}. During the First Gulf War, the United States
launched 297 Tomahawks, which destroyed the Iraqi military.59 Ohio-class
submarines can operate unhindered in the adversary's A2/AD zone closer
to the shore; thus, striking targets far inland. Collectively, four
Ohio-class submarines installed with 616 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise
missiles would obliterate China's military. The inexperienced PLAN AC
group will be destroyed by long-range antiship missiles (LRASM),
Tomahawks, and Mark 48-Mod 7 torpedoes launched from USS Key West, USS
Oklahoma City, USS Topeka, and USS Asheville submarines based in Guam.
The USN and USAF have signed a USD 414 million contract for autonomously
guided with onboard sensors, jam-resistant, and difficult to detect
antiship LRASM.60 The stealthy Zumwalt-class warship---equipped with
emerging technologies---can sail undetected in littoral waters and
contested territories to launch LRASM and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
China is constructing military bases on islands in the South China Sea;
however, this military infrastructure is vulnerable to US weapon
systems, as the islands lack natural defenses and camouflage.61 During a
war, the bases will be annihilated by the USN as the PLA cannot hide
behind hills and forests. Once destroyed, these facilities cannot be
supported from the mainland, as the logistical supplies will be
demolished by the USN. China's military modernization may enhance A2/AD
zones, but it does not contribute to a blue-water, sea-control
capability.62 [China's Hyped DF-21 Missile]{.underline} The antiship
DF-21 missile, carried by colossal transporter erector launchers, has a
range of 1,400 miles. The missile regiments are based in the barren Gobi
Desert, which makes it an easy target for the US military. [The DF-21
has been tested on a stationary ship, but it has not yet been
successfully tested against a moving target]{.underline}.63 A system of
systems is required to track the AC,64 acquire the precise location,
keep the missile locked on the target, penetrate the carrier's
multilayered defenses, and provide mid-course updates as within one hour
the ship will have moved 30 miles. China does not know about the DF-21
performance against the US CSG countermeasures.65 The United States and
Russia have not yet developed a missile equivalent to the DF-21.
However, China lacks the C4ISR systems to strike targets at that range.
China does not release the missile testing data, leading to many
questions, including whether it can hit moving targets. Does it have
precision targeting technologies?66 Until proven otherwise, [the
functionality of the missile is based on nothing but circumstantial
inference and speculation]{.underline}.

### No China War

#### **No US-China war**

**Lei 20** (Cui Lei, PhD and MA in International Politics, associate
research fellow with the China Institute of International Studies,
7-24-2020, \"Despite heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\",
*South China Morning Post*,
<https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk>)

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**
of all, [**deterrents** to a flare-up are]{.underline} much
**[strong]{.underline}**er [**in US-China relations** than in US-Soviet
relations]{.underline}. Although economic and people-to-people ties
between China and the US are declining, they are still close compared to
US-Soviet ties. [It is **hard to decouple** two **closely intertwined
economies** and **societies**.]{.underline} Take two examples. [China is
expected to become the world\'s **largest consumer market**, a
temptation **hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from
the US. And in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students**
study in the US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}. Many universities go to great lengths to woo
international students. Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology even sued the government over its new visa restrictions,
now aborted, on international students. [Second, **even if** there is
decoupling, the pain would **not be too great** and can be **kept out**
of the **national security sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In
fact, for national security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will
make both sides more secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's
information technology equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US
will be more relaxed. If China cannot get advanced technologies from the
US and its technological progress slows down, the US will be less
anxious. In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China. Economic decoupling is undeniably more
painful for China than for the US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which
was hit hard by the US oil embargo because of its lack of natural
resources, China has no such problems. Given its large domestic market,
losing the US as a major customer is not a disaster for China, and can
be compensated through more dynamic economic activities at home. China
can also make up for being freezed out of technological exchanges by
turning to indigenous innovation. As for the US, it can import goods
from other developing countries, albeit less cheaply. The relative loss
is acceptable when weighed against the heightened perception of economic
independence and security. [Third, the ideological confrontation between
China and the US is **less intense**]{.underline} than that during the
Cold War. Unlike the obsession with ideology in those days, [the line
between capitalism and socialism is **blurred** today. The **market
economy** has become **universally recognised** as the best way to
promote economic growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries
have embraced democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still
long for the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world,
[after **many years** of fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most
American people are **not interested** in promoting democracy
abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China just wants to **preserve its
political system** and has **no interest in exporting it** to other
countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological **antagonism** in
China-US relations can easily be **eased** by calculations of realistic
**interests**, which create conditions for **compromise and
cooperation**. **Fourth**, both China and the US have **many options
other than war** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While they
have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential
conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, [both countries are
**adept at operating in grey zones** and fighting psychological, public
opinion or diplomatic warfare **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate in
Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship. In
addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in the
US, the latter can **wield the stick of sanctions** when use of force is
**highly risky** or not worth it.]{.underline} [When both sides have
**many tools and options,** why would they **rush to war** to achieve
their goals? **Last**]{.underline} but not least, [the **imbalance of
power** will act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet
Union did not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was
not the case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union was at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, [a country
needs the **will to fight** before **going to war,** even if it is
stronger militarily than its adversary. Having fought **years of
meaningless wars**, the US is **weary of war**]{.underline}. [China,
too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US strength,
**especially** when its own economy is **slowing down** and it is facing
**various domestic challenges**]{.underline}, [China would **not wish**
to **recklessly start a war with the US**. In summary, the possibility
of a **hot war** between China and the US is **very
small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a cold or hot
confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation of the
momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

#### No SCS escalation -- China is taking calculated risks to avoid conflict 

**Nielsen 19** (Nicolai Fogth Gjøde Nielsen, holds a master's degree in
International Relations - European Studies and a bachelor's degree in
Language and International Studies, both of which were obtained from
Aalborg University in Denmark. "How China Avoids War in the South China
Sea." The National Interest, The Center for the National Interest, 15
Jan. 2019,
nationalinterest.org/feature/how-china-avoids-war-south-china-sea-41677,
WC)

[China has been able to avoid an all-out conflict in the region by
taking only small bursts of actions that are unlikely to cause any
detrimental fallout from neighboring countries.]{.underline} [This
strategy of **below-the-threshold expansion** allows China to acquire
strategic territories]{.underline}, **[since Chinese actions are
calibrated to avoid full-on war]{.underline}**, [despite very negative
responses from its neighbors]{.underline}. Russia's President Vladimir
Putin, as an exception, has expressed his support for China's
territorial claims, stating that Russia does not recognize the fact that
the Court of Arbitration ruled against the Chinese claim of the Spratly
Islands, nor that China has violated the sovereign rights of the
Philippines by intervention.

Despite the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration[, the outcome
ultimately is in China's favor, as a bilateral agreement between China
and the Philippines enables China to retain the artificially built
islands**. This is just one example of a case that highlights China's
growing confidence and influence in the region**]{.underline}. This is
arguably a long-term gain for Beijing since China has built artificial
islands in the disputed areas and restricted access for Filipino
fishermen and oil exploration vessels even inside the Philippines' own
exclusive economic zone.

[China is likely trying to gain enough influence in the region to
challenge and push out the United States completely from the South China
Sea. Beijing does not try to provoke a war with its neighbors as it
would be too costly and counterproductive]{.underline}. [This is
especially because the cost of a war with America and its East Asian
allies would not be worth the potential territorial gains]{.underline}.
[Instead, China is operating from a **rational standpoint** and conducts
its actions based on **calculated consideration of the
consequences**]{.underline}. At the same time, it is increasingly
evident that China is not interested in maintaining the pro-American
current status quo in the regional balance of power.

### China Not Revisionist

#### China [isn't revisionist]{.underline}

**McKinney and Butts 19** (Jared Morgan McKinney, PhD candidate at the
S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological
University (Singapore). Nicholas Butts, Center for Strategic and
International Studies Pacific Forum Young Leader, "Bringing Balance to
the Strategic Discourse on China's Rise", *Journal of Indo-Pacific
Affairs*, pg. 75-76, 2019,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/JIPA/journals/Volume-02_Issue-4/McKinney.pdf>)

In the abstract, such claims are alarming---in context, and in balance,
rather humdrum. In fact, [the **evidence** of a]{.underline}ny [Chinese
intention to]{.underline} destroy, or even merely
**[undermine]{.underline}** and exploit, [the current order is
**slight**]{.underline}. [China **is**]{.underline} certainly [using
its]{.underline} growing [military power to **defend** its **claims in
the SCS**]{.underline} and even---on occasion--- to coerce its
neighbors. [It uses **protectionist**]{.underline} economic
**[policies]{.underline}** to boost the prospects of Chinese companies
and reduce competition. [It employs **economic statecraft**]{.underline}
to serve its interests abroad. And it certainly is opposed to America's
policy of global democracy promotion. [However, **none** of these
positions **fundamentally challenge the existing order**, **none** of
them **radically depart** from America's **own actions** when it was a
**rising power**]{.underline} in the nineteenth century, [and none of
them **obviously surpass** America's **own contemporary record** of
**order subversion**]{.underline}.

When [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates was a rising
power, it [took **half of Mexico**]{.underline} [and **considered taking
the rest**,]{.underline} [it **colonized** the **Philippines** and
**Hawaii**]{.underline}, [and it **unilaterally seized** the **maritime
choke points of the Caribbean**]{.underline} (Puerto Rico and Cuba).21
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [used
**tariffs**]{.underline}---which by 1857 averaged 20 percent22 and by
the end of the nineteenth century were "the highest import duties in the
industrial world"23---[to **protect its industries**]{.underline}. [It
**stole intellectual property**]{.underline},24 [and]{.underline} it
[**ideologically challenged** the governments of the "Old
World."]{.underline} Today, despite no longer being a rising power, [the
U]{.underline}nited [States has launched]{.underline} two **[disastrous
invasions]{.underline}**, **[tortured prisoners]{.underline}**, [and
dispatches **drone strikes at a whim** with **little international legal
authority**]{.underline}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make a
right; it is that [international order is **much more resilient** than
**critics seem to realize**]{.underline},26 [and it is **utopian** to
expect any **rising Great Power** to act in a way that **uniformly
satisfies** one's **moral scruples**,]{.underline} evolving, in
Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible' status quo
power."27

Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took place in the
context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but the more
important point is that the long nineteenth century (1815--1914)---the
era of America's rise---was the first iteration of the New Peace.28 The
implication is that [relative peace **can** and **has** **coexist**ed
with **limited wars**, **property** and **territorial thefts**, acts of
**coercion**, and **aggressive assertions of status.** This does not
mean any of these are **desirable**]{.underline}--- they are [not---but
it shows that they **need not be fatal to the system**]{.underline}.
[Insofar as there **is** a lesson from that **first period** of
**relative peace**, it is that **Great Power confrontation** is the
**one thing that is fatal**]{.underline}. [Accepting this does not mean
**capitulating** in **every instance**, as implied by
some]{.underline},29 [but it **does** mean **rediscovering** the rules
of **Great Power competition**]{.underline}30 alongside the art of
strategy.31

Focusing only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the
established powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which [China,
**has**]{.underline}, in fact, [**conformed** to the **existing
order.**]{.underline} As a RAND Corporation report published in 2018
concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a conditional one---of
the international order: "Since [China undertook a **policy of
international engagement**]{.underline} in the 1980s ... the level and
quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most other
states."32 The way in which **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping, following his
2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [has been heralded as the
**most prominent champion of international order** and **defender of
globalization**]{.underline} underscores the fact that [there are
**different elements** of this order, and that China supports **many**,
if not **most, of them**]{.underline}. [Even in places where China is
**supposedly "altering"** the current order, Beijing tends to
simultaneously **affirm that order**]{.underline}. [China's Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank]{.underline}, for instance, actually
**[mirrors existing structures]{.underline}**, and China has
intentionally copied elements and "best practices" of the World Bank and
Asian Development Bank. [China is **playing the same game**, even if it
is **seeking a bigger role within it**]{.underline}.33

concerns]{.underline}--- and as long as the [war]{.underline} in
Afghanistan continues, it [will]{.underline} rightly [garner significant
attention and resources from all sectors of the U.S.
government]{.underline}. [When it comes foreign policy priorities,
urgency outweighs importance, so regular decisions about the war require
the highest-level attention at the White House, the State Department,
and the DOD]{.underline}. [For the senior-most national security
officials, time is precious, and dedicating enough time to issues such
as climate change or China can be **crowded out by the need for regular,
high-level engagement on life-or-death decisions**]{.underline} in
Afghanistan.

#### Specifically, undermines Asian deterrence

• Opportunity cost #5: Two decades of military conflict have eroded U.S.
military readiness. [While the U.S. military has global
responsibilities, it has finite resources, and nothing drains U.S.
military readiness like an active war]{.underline}, as made clear by the
2017 report of a Task Force on Defense Personnel co-chaired by former
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and former National Security
Adviser James Jones.39 For the Pentagon, [prosecuting]{.underline} the
[war]{.underline} in Afghanistan [is a top-level priority that
**requires significant time** from its top officials as well as
tremendous resources]{.underline}---[from regular rotations of thousands
of personnel to equipment to budget expenditures]{.underline}. [With
pressing needs to bolster U.S. force posture in Asia and Europe to deter
threats from Russia and China]{.underline} and adapt the military to
emerging threats such as cybersecurity, [the U.S. military will have a
difficult time dedicating the necessary attention and resources to these
threats while **fighting an indefinite war**]{.underline} with roughly
14,000 troops in Afghanistan.
