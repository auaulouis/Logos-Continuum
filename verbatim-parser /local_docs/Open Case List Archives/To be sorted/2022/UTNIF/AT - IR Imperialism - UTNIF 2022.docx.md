2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? Taken literally, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe. This suggests a rather low threshold for what counts as a global
catastrophe. An event causing just one death on each continent (say,
from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a global catastrophe, because
surely these deaths would be catastrophic for the deceased and their
loved ones. However, in common usage, a global catastrophe would be
catastrophic for a significant portion of the globe. Minimum thresholds
have variously been set around ten thousand to ten million deaths or
\$10 billion to \$10 trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or
death of one quarter of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell
2004). Others have emphasized catastrophes that cause long-term declines
in the trajectory of human civilization (Beckstead 2013), that human
civilization does not recover from (Maher and Baum 2013), that
drastically reduce humanity's potential for future achievements (Bostrom
2002, using the term "existential risk"), or that result in human
extinction (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). A common theme across all these
treatments of GCR is that [some catastrophes are vastly more important
than others]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to recognize
this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983). Without nuclear
winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred million people.
This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity would presumably
carry on. However, with nuclear winter, per Sagan, [humanity could go
extinct. The loss would be not just an additional four billion or so
deaths, but the loss of all future generations.]{.underline} To
paraphrase Sagan, the loss would be billions and billions of lives, or
even more. Sagan estimated [500 trillion lives, assuming humanity would
continue for ten million more years, which he cited as typical for a
successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number **may even be an
underestimate**]{.underline}. The analysis here takes an adventurous
turn, hinging on the evolution of the human species and the long-term
fate of the universe. On these long time scales, the descendants of
contemporary humans may no longer be recognizably "human". The issue
then is whether the descendants are still worth caring about, whatever
they are. If they are, then it begs the question of how many of them
there will be. Barring major global catastrophe, Earth will remain
habitable for about one billion more years 2 until the Sun gets too warm
and large. The rest of the Solar System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and
(if it exists) the multiverse will remain habitable for a lot longer
than that (Adams and Laughlin 1997), should our descendants gain the
capacity to migrate there. An open question in astronomy is whether it
is possible for the descendants of humanity to continue living for an
infinite length of time or instead merely an astronomically large but
finite length of time (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way,
the stakes with global catastrophes could be much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives. Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007),
but they have limited practical significance. [This can be seen when
evaluating GCRs from a standard risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude
framework.]{.underline} Using Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it
follows that reducing the probability of global catastrophe by a mere
one-in-500-trillion chance is of the same significance as saving one
human life. Phrased differently, **[society should try 500 trillion
times harder to prevent a global catastrophe than it should to save a
person's life.]{.underline}** [Or, preventing one million deaths is
equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability of global
catastrophe]{.underline}. This suggests **[society should make extremely
large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives]{.underline}**. Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
society should be willing to spend at least that much to prevent a
global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend at least
\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of
global catastrophe. Thus while reasonable disagreement exists on how
large of a VSL to use and how much to count future generations, even
low-end positions suggest vast resource allocations should be redirected
to reducing GCR. This conclusion is only strengthened when considering
the astronomical size of the stakes, but the same point holds either
way. The bottom line is that, as long as something along the lines of
the standard riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being
used, then even tiny GCR reductions merit significant effort. This point
holds especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
permanent harm to global human civilization. The discussion thus far has
assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is not
universally held. People often value some people more than others,
favoring themselves, their family and friends, their compatriots, their
generation, or others whom they identify with. Great debates rage on
across moral philosophy, economics, and other fields about how much
people should value others who are distant in space, time, or social
relation, as well as the unborn members of future generations. This
debate is crucial for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed, if
each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [While everyone
has the right to their own views and feelings, we find that the
strongest arguments are for the widely held position that all human
lives should be valued equally]{.underline}. This position is succinctly
stated in the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the
1848 Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be
self-evident: that all men and 3 women are created equal". [Philosophers
speak of an agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere" (Nagel 1986) or
a "veil of ignorance" (Rawls 1971) in which each person considers what
is best for society irrespective of which member of society they happen
to be. Such a perspective suggests valuing everyone equally, regardless
of who they are or where or when they live. This in turn suggests a very
high value for reducing GCR,]{.underline} or a high degree of priority
for GCR reduction efforts.

**Preventing existential risk and framing it as a "we" claim is
[good]{.underline}.**

**Coles and Susen 18**---Research Professor at the Institute for Social
Justice at Australian Catholic University AND Reader in Sociology at the
School of Arts and Social Sciences of City, University of London (Romand
and Simon, "The Pragmatic Vision of Visionary Pragmatism: The Challenge
of Radical Democracy in a Neoliberal World Order," Contemporary
Political Theory May 2018, Volume 17, Issue 2, pp 250--262)

Visionary pragmatism is driven by a political ethos that accents radical
receptivity and a sense that a greater degree of wildness in our efforts
is indispensable for transformative democratic movements. While some of
my earlier works accented the ethical character of receptive generosity
in political life, Visionary Pragmatism argues that [receptivity is
**indispensable** for **generating democratic power**]{.underline} --
precisely [because receptivity involves **vulnerability**,
**relationship formation**, **capacities to modulate**, and **learning
in unexpected ways** amidst **difficult differences**]{.underline}.
Drawing on my engagements with the movement for democratic action
research in Northern Arizona, I argue that [receptive practices
**engender remarkable capacities** for **fostering grassroots critique**
and **alternatives**, **powerful political assemblages across
differences**, and **transformative dynamics** in the face of what
otherwise appear to be **intractable problems**. Our **best** and **most
powerful possibilities** for co-creating urgent democratic change
**almost always advance** along pathways **engendered partly through
relationships of careful attentiveness** to what we **initially took to
be oblique**, **unintelligible** -- or, perhaps, even
**odious**]{.underline}.

For these reasons, my political, theoretical, and pedagogical
engagements move across many different configurations and a wider range
of situations, ideologies, modes, and commitments than most. [Eschewing
a single subject position]{.underline}, in Visionary Pragmatism, I
experiment with first-person plurals in which [the 'we' **morphs** in
relation to the **different loci of initiative**]{.underline} that
animate my reflections. [Sometimes 'we' refers to **proponents of
radical** and **ecological democracy very broadly**, sometimes to
**scholars in higher education**, sometimes to **political
theorists**]{.underline}, sometimes to the action research movement that
formed among people at Northern Arizona University and its community
partners, sometimes to a specific action research team, [sometimes to
**all people facing the possibility of planetary ecological
collapse**]{.underline}. Among the many things I find compelling about
the writing of **[James Baldwin]{.underline}** is how he [shifts his
pronouns **without notice**]{.underline} -- for example, [**sometimes**
using '**we**' to represent **black people**, sometimes as an **uncanny
member of the white-majority United States**. This]{.underline}
rhetorical shiftiness [**encroaches upon** and **pulls his readers** --
**especially white readers** -- **beyond** the '**innocence that
constitutes the crime**' of their **assumed individual** and
**collective white subjectivities**]{.underline} [in ways that work in
**visceral**, **relational**, and **conceptual registers**]{.underline}
(Baldwin, 1992, p. 6). [Such uncertainty has **significant capacity to
erode habits** and **defences**, as one finds oneself **unexpectedly
drawn into perspectives**, **locations**, **energies**, and
**tendencies** that **unsettle** and **reorient one's own
subjectivity**]{.underline}. Much of my work has theorized 'moving
democracy', and my rhetorical shifting of the first-person plural is a
textual practice that aims to enhance this in ways that facilitate
reflection.

Throughout Visionary Pragmatism, I argue that [there are **powerful
reasons for active hope**. At the same time, we **do not live far from
tipping points** beyond which **planetary ecological collapse**,
**globalizing neoliberal fascism**, and **violent chaos** may
**overwhelm our efforts**. I **do not think so much** in terms of
**pessimism** or **optimism** as I do about **seizing** and
**co-creating opportunities** for **catalysing dynamic changes** in
theory and practice that **foster a powerful movement** of **receptive
democracy**, for **complex democratic commonwealth** and **ecological
flourishing**. In one sense]{.underline}, as Walter Benjamin's
discussion of Paul Klee's 'Angelus Novus' makes poignantly clear, [it is
**always 'too late' for so much** and **so many**, as catastrophic
history **keeps piling wreckage at our feet**. **At the same time**,
there are]{.underline} what Benjamin (1968) calls [']{.underline}weak
messianic powers' that emerge as [the **retroactive force** of salvaged
aspects of past struggles **ignite sparks with emerging
struggles**]{.underline} to explode the continuum of progress. [In this
sense]{.underline}, up to our day, [it is **never altogether too
late**]{.underline}. With the language of 'game-transformative
practice', I argue that [a **visionary-pragmatic movement**]{.underline}
of radical democracy [must do something analogous in response to the
**fierce urgency of now**, to **avoid a sixth extinction** in which this
possibility **could well become a casualty**]{.underline}.

**Priming of existential risk focuses on *[compassion]{.underline}*
which results in progressivism**

Support for Barack Obama and John McCain in the 2008 Presidential
Election,\" Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, Vol. 9, No. 1,
p. 263-266, IC)

The present findings extend those of Rothschild et al. (2009).
**[Rothschild]{.underline}** et al. **[showed that priming religious
fundamentalists with compassionate values]{.underline}** that were
clearly tied to their religious foundations in either Christianity or
Islam **[led to lower level of support for the use of violence against
Iran among Americans and to less hostile attitudes toward the United
States]{.underline}** (including less support of martyrdom attacks)
**[among Iranians; in the absence of priming these compassionate values,
death reminders led to increased support for violence among both
groups]{.underline}**. The present study goes beyond a religious context
to show that **[in the absence of being faced with compassionate values,
death reminders increased support for]{.underline}** John **[McCain; but
when oriented toward compassionate values, MS increased support for
Barack Obama]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** study also
**[provides convergent support for a growing number of findings that
existential threat is capable of motivating defense of progressive,
prosocial values like tolerance, egalitarianism, and
empathy]{.underline}** (Gailliot et al., 2008; Greenberg et al., 1992;
Rothschild et al., 2009; Schimel et al., 2006). **[Because people
possess a variety of resources for buffering existential fear, terror
management trajectories can be quite malleable]{.underline}**. Thus,
**[increasing the salience of]{.underline}** a particular aspect of
one's cultural worldview, such as **[the prosocial value of compassion,
can motivate increased adherence to this value after reminders of
death]{.underline}**. As such, examining the effects of MS in light of
individual differences in progressive value orientation might be a
useful direction for the future research on the psychology of politics
and/or intergroup relations. For example, emerging research suggests
that **[compassion might be found in the perception of interdependence
among diverse groups of people, helping to reduce or eliminate
reactionary, hostile forms of worldview defense]{.underline}**. Motyl et
al. (2009) report that **[priming a perception of a common humanity
attenuated an increase in anti-Arab prejudice and hostile immigration
policy among Americans reminded of death. This compassionate
perception]{.underline}** of a common humanity **[can]{.underline}**
also **[be observed]{.underline}**, rather ominously, **[in universal
dangers]{.underline}** (i.e., global warming) **[that threaten humanity
as a whole]{.underline}**. In research conducted with both Americans and
Palestinians living in Israel, Pyszczynski et al. (2009) demonstrated
that the **[perception of]{.underline}** such **[global threat bolsters
support for peaceful coexistence in the face of increased death
awareness]{.underline}**. Future research on these values and concerns
might provide useful directions for those seeking peace and political
harmony among groups embroiled in long-standing conflicts. The present
analysis of compassion also offers potential insights into understanding
reactions to other political figures. Weise et al. (2008) found that MS
motivated securely attached adults to support John Kerry instead of
Bush. Given that secure attachment is linked to compassion and empathy
(e.g., Mikulincer et al., 2005), the existentially motivated activation
of secure adult attachment systems may have increased support for Kerry
to the extent that he was perceived as the more compassionate candidate.
However, comparing the current study with Weise et al. suggests a
crucial distinction between the ability of Obama and Kerry to capitalize
on the MS-induced need to achieve psychological equanimity by rigorously
defending culturally cherished values. Whereas both men might very well
have been harbingers of compassion, for Kerry, this may have been
obscured by his relatively dry speaking style and meeker presence;
Obama, on the other hand, wore compassion on his sleeve (Steinhauser,
2008). Thus, it may have been that Obama's frequent, eloquent outbursts
of compassion boosted his support by priming thecultural defense of this
value amid frequent discussion of issues involving reminders of
mortality (e.g., healthcare, Iraqi occupation, Russian invasion of
Georgia, etc.). It is important to note, however, that the present
analysis does not imply that compassionate associations are limited only
to Democratic candidates. Indeed, as the quote which opens this paper
illustrates, then-President George W. Bush co-opted the term
"compassionate conservative" during his second campaign, a move that may
have helped garner support, assuming both that he was perceived as the
more compassionate candidate and that such values were made salient. The
present **[research]{.underline}** also **[contributes to understanding
the nature and specificity of responses to thoughts of
death]{.underline}** (cf, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, & Maxfield,
2006). Like a number of other studies, here we tested the impact of MS
against that of personal uncertainty. **[Proponents of the uncertainty
management model claim that MS effects are actually a result of
increased personal uncertainty, which motivates efforts to regain a
sense of certainty by defending the validity of one's cultural worldview
and confidently adhering to its norms and values (]{.underline}**e.g.,
Van Den Bos, Poortvliet, Marjolein, Miedema, & Van den Ham, 2005).
**[The]{.underline}** present **[study demonstrates that uncertainty
concerns did not impact political preferences, or produce reactions to
cultural values]{.underline}** (e.g., compassion) **[similar to those
triggered by MS]{.underline}**. The recently proposed
**[uncertainty-threat model]{.underline}** (e.g., Jost, Glaser,
Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003) **[claims that uncertainty and mortality
threat both produce a shift toward political conservatism.
Critics]{.underline}** of this model (e.g., Anson et al., in press;
Greenberg & Jonas, 2003), on the other hand, **[have argued that the
motivated social-cognitive foundations]{.underline}** (i.e., dogmatism;
intolerance of ambiguity; personal need for closure, structure, or
order; etc.) **[of political ideology are not limited to a conservative
shift]{.underline}**, but can readily trigger support for progressive
change. **[The present study provides clear and direct evidence for the
latter contention: MS-induced threat is]{.underline}** indeed **[capable
of motivating support for either conservative or progressive
politicians, depending on the values that are salient at the
time]{.underline}**. This idea, however, does raise an interesting
possibility with regard to interpreting the present effects. The
compassionate value statements were designed for this study to directly
emphasize the value of compassion. While the comparison statements were
designed to lack such references, it is possible that these statements
might have been construed as priming wisdom. Previous research (e.g.,
Landau et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2004, 2005) demonstrated that MS
motivated increased support for authoritarian candidates, and for Bush
specifically, without moderating factors such as a wisdom induction.
This is consistent with the notion that Republican candidates tend to
enjoy increased support from those reminded of mortality because these
candidates tend to emphasize American superiority. However, McCain was
considerably older than Obama and held his Senate seat for much longer;
thus, he may have been seen as "wise" relative to Obama's "na¨ıvete." If
this were the case, and if the neutral value condition's statements did
´ prime wisdom, this may have motivated increased support for McCain
after death reminders. While the participants in this study were by no
means representative of the diverse American electorate, they provided
crucial insight into the psychological impact of each candidate's
campaign and even of the candidates themselves. **[Embedded within a
social climate boiling over with death reminders]{.underline}** (e.g.,
war, terrorism, fear-mongering rhetoric, etc.), **[people may latch onto
certain political leaders in an effort to affirm their faith in the
permanence and validity of their particular culture]{.underline}**.
However, it would seem that **[the individual can achieve
this]{.underline}** leader-based worldview defense **[in several
different ways. Depending on the salience of particular cultural values,
a person might be motivated to follow a conservative leader who
rigorously asserts the fundamental superiority of one's
culture]{.underline}** and aggressively "defends" it from the clutches
of evil, **[or they might be motivated to support progressive prototypes
of their more compassionate social values]{.underline}**. As Ernest
Becker (1973, p. 139) concluded, "\[The human\] is a trembling animal
who pulls the world down around his shoulders as he clutches for
protection and support and tries to affirm in a cowardly way his feeble
powers. The qualities of the leader, then, and the problems of people
fit together in a natural symbiosis.

Added-**[value of scenario analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to **fill the gap**
between **IR theory** and **real-world problems**]{.underline}, "an
increasing number of [scholars]{.underline} have come to [embrace a
spirit of **intellectual openness**, recognizing both the need for
**greater flexibility** in the **theoretical formulations** and the
**possibility of complementarity** by **other theories** and
approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12). [This]{.underline} section discusses
the [added value of scenario analysis as a **complementary approach** to
**traditional IR methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious advantage of
**scenario analysis as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [lies]{.underline} by definition [in its
ability to **tackle future events**.]{.underline} As mentioned before,
[there are no specified instruments within traditional IR methods which
would allow scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The
only exception is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which
is, however, distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [this method is helpful for **overcoming** enduring **cognitive
biases**---mental errors such as **linearity**, **presentism**, and
**group think** caused by the **subconscious** and **simplified
information processing of humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111--
112). [Humans have the tendencies to focus on the present at the expense
of the future and to think about the future in linear terms by
extrapolating past trends into the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992)
points out, "we tend to bias our historical and our theoretical analyses
too much toward continuity (...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to
[introduce **discontinuities into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt
to determine what causes them to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if
Gaddis does not explicitly mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts
underlying scenario approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis
attends to "**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions**
about **continuous** and **linear patterns of
development**"]{.underline} (Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The
[**process of scenario development** invites the participants to
**reveal** and **question convictions** which have **so far remained
unchallenged**, and to **question the linearity of world
developments**.]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [foresight helps IR scholars to **exit** the
**tunnel vision** on world affairs and discover potentially valuable
nonlinear lines of development. These can be both **innovative** in
terms of **scholarship**, and **policy-relevant** by offering a
**reflection** on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline} Thus, [it
can facilitate the **intellectual capability** to **think the
unthinkable**]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[innovative research topics **confront the uncertainties** that are
**crucial for policymakers** to be monitored closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[possibility to **accommodate multiple driving forces**, to **take into
account different values** they might take and finally to **combine them
with each other** and **see how they affect the dependent variable**,
makes the scenario approach quite unique. Traditional IR methods work
with a limited number of independent variables]{.underline}, formulate
and test hypotheses usually based on the relation between a single
causal variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex causal
trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background, we
agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and providing academia with a tool for "**actionable
clarity** in **understanding contemporary global issues**"]{.underline}
(p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [scenario analysis can be perceived as a tool towards **more
exchange between academia and policy-making** that can contribute to a
**better understanding between the two** worlds. For policymakers, it
provides the opportunity to consider **long-term trends**]{.underline}
(an occasion not often found in the day-to-day nature of politics). [For
academics, it provides insight into which trends are most concerning for
policy-makers, allowing them to check and ultimately enhance the
**relevance of their research agendas**.]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

These [government]{.underline} or quasi-government think tank
[**simulations** often provide]{.underline} very similar [**lessons**
for]{.underline} high-level players as are learned by
**[students]{.underline}** in educational simulations. Government
[participants learn about the **importance** of **understanding foreign
perspectives**]{.underline}, the need to practice internal coordination,
[and the **necessity** to **compromise and coordinate**]{.underline}
with other governments in negotiations and crises. During the Cold War,
political scientist Robert Mandel noted how **[crisis
exercises]{.underline}** and war games [forced]{.underline} government
officials to overcome ''bureaucratic myopia,'' moving beyond their
normal organizational roles and thinking more creatively about how
others might react in a crisis or conflict. [The **skills of
imagination** and the subsequent ability to predict **foreign interests
and reactions** remain critical for **real-world foreign policy
makers**]{.underline}. For example, simulations of the Iranian nuclear
crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the Brookings Institution's Saban
Center and at Harvard University's Belfer Center, and involving former
US senior officials and regional experts\*highlighted the dangers of
misunderstanding foreign governments' preferences and misinterpreting
their subsequent behavior. In both simulations, the primary criticism of
the US negotiating team lay in a failure [to **predict accurately** how
**other states**]{.underline}, both [**allies and adversaries**, would
behave **in response** to **US policy initiatives**.]{.underline}

[By **university age**, students]{.underline} often [have a
**pre-defined view** of **international affairs**]{.underline}, and the
literature on simulations in education has long emphasized how such
[exercises **force students** to challenge **their assumptions** about
how other governments **behave** and how their own government
works]{.underline}. Since simulations became more common as a teaching
tool in the late 1950s, educational literature has expounded on their
benefits, from encouraging engagement by breaking from the typical
lecture format, to improving communication skills, to promoting
teamwork. More broadly, [**simulations** can deepen **understanding** by
asking **students** to link **fact and theory**]{.underline}, providing
a context for facts while bringing theory into the realm of practice.
These exercises are particularly valuable in teaching international
affairs for many of the same reasons they are useful for policy makers:
[they force **participants** to ''grapple with the issues arising from
**a world in flux.**]{.underline} Simulations have been used
successfully to teach students about such disparate topics as European
politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US response to the mass killings in
Darfur. Role-playing [exercises]{.underline} certainly [encourage
**students** to learn **political and technical facts**]{.underline}\*
but they learn them [in a **more active style**]{.underline}. Rather
than sitting in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, [students
actively research]{.underline} ''their'' government's positions
[and]{.underline} actively [argue]{.underline}, brief, and negotiate
with others. Acts can change quickly; [**simulations** teach students
how to **contextualize and act** on information]{.underline}.

**[2AC -- Debating Nuclear Risk Good]{.underline}**

**Debating [nuclear risk]{.underline} is good.**

**Bernstein '18** \[Aron; September 21st; Emeritus Professor of Physics
at MIT; The Bulletin, "Reducing the risk of nuclear war begins in the

The need for education on nuclear weapons. When it comes to nuclear
weapons, the [students]{.underline} of [today have **less lived
experience** to draw on than older generations]{.underline}. [Today's
typical **college student**]{.underline} [was born after the end of the
Cold War]{.underline} and has no memory of a time when most Americans
were deeply afraid of nuclear war (excluding, to an extent, the fiery
exchange of threats between President Trump and Kim Jong-un last year).
Perhaps as a result, these students also have very limited knowledge
about nuclear weapons. [The majority do not have a strong
understand]{.underline}ing of what **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**
[are, their destructive power, or their role in the international
order]{.underline}, [and even fewer have a sense of how many nuclear
weapons exist]{.underline}. They [are not aware of the]{.underline}
\$[1.2 trillion]{.underline} nuclear **[modernization
program]{.underline}**, in which the majority of costs come from
modernizing and improving delivery systems rather than performing the
technically necessary maintenance of the nuclear warheads. [History
education on the Cold War often addresses the US-Soviet arms race of
that time, but nuclear weapons]{.underline} [issues in other
regions]{.underline}---[such as]{.underline} [the tense situation
between India and Pakistan---are rarely ever mentioned. The]{.underline}
distant, but [persistent]{.underline}, [possibility of an
**unintentional nuclear launch**]{.underline} due to unauthorized
access, technical failure, or a cyberattack on warning systems, is also
overlooked, as is general information about which states possess nuclear
weapons [today]{.underline}.

In short, students in the United States (and likely elsewhere) typically
graduate from high school having received almost no information on
nuclear weapons. [It is]{.underline} [generally]{.underline}
[**assumed** that]{.underline} [today's]{.underline} American [public
simply **doesn't care** about the]{.underline}
**[complicated]{.underline}** [and somewhat]{.underline}
**[abstract]{.underline}** [issues of **nuclear weapons** and
**deterrence** because they **rarely affect people's lives
directly**]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, an alternative
explanation exists: [The]{.underline} American [public doesn't know
enough]{.underline} about nuclear weapons [to have much political
opinion on them, **but**]{.underline} [if they had **more knowledge**,
that could **change**]{.underline}. If so, [educating students **on
nuclear weapons**]{.underline} on a large scale [could have the
**long-term effect**]{.underline} [of creating an]{.underline} American
[public that is **politically engaged**]{.underline} [on the
nuc]{.underline}lear [issue and **motivated to hold its elected leaders
accountable**]{.underline} [for implementing nuclear policy that
**reduces the risk of nuclear war**]{.underline}.

For some students, education on nuclear issues may have an impact beyond
just putting nuclear weapons on their radar (pun intended). Today's
[**students** are the **next politicians, scientists, and journalists**,
and some]{.underline} of them [will]{.underline} inevitably [be tasked
with addressing the nuc]{.underline}lear [issue in their
careers]{.underline}. For these students, [early exposure to the
issues]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [in an educational context could
be **useful preparation** for grappling with those issues
professionally]{.underline}. Indeed, [for some]{.underline} students,
[learning about **nuclear weapons** could have a **decisive impact** on
their career trajectory and **inspire them**]{.underline} [to dedicate
themselves to solving **these problems**]{.underline}.

Richter-Montpetit; GR\]

Racism is a powerful, malignant force in world politics, and our
discipline, IR, has deeply problematic entanglements with it. It is a
serious matter both to come intellectually to grips with this and to
find the most effective strategies to act on it. [We worry
that]{.underline} [more serious **problems**]{.underline} [and
**possibilities** are **marginalised**]{.underline} [by an ultimately
very **inward-looking** and **scholastic exercise**]{.underline} [where
a particular definition of racism and]{.underline} a specific
[theoretical perspective makes it possible to deem the vast majority of
scholarship in IR 'racist', 'methodologically white' and 'antiblack'-
every work that does not explicitly follow one exact version of
anti-racist scholarship]{.underline}. Especially, [the role
played]{.underline} in H&RM's argumentation [by]{.underline} our **[sins
of omission]{.underline}** [does]{.underline} ultimately seem to [rest
on the premise that **only** their **distinct form**]{.underline} [of
scholarship can be redeemed]{.underline}, because even post-colonial
scholarship and critiques of euro-centrism are not enough; [you are a
racist if you do not follow exactly this particular route]{.underline}.
It is not important whether your scholarship actually supports or
hinders anti-racist analysis or political engagement; [it is all about
**who you cite**]{.underline} [and what **declarations you
make**]{.underline}. **[Here]{.underline}**, [a theory is not judged by
**what can be done with it**]{.underline}, [but by the question whether
**self-appointed anti-racists** can find **supposedly problematic
sentences** somewhere in its key texts]{.underline}. In this section, we
will first point out that the H&RM article is a personal attack on us
for racism, despite their reassurances about the opposite. Then, we
discuss what an analysis of structural racism (systems of power) could
amount to, given that they claim to do one but utterly fail to do so,
resorting instead to a pretend examination of the foundations of ST.
Next, we discuss what could be methodological guidelines for actually
proving whether or not a theory like ST is racist.

[H&RM's usage of the term racism for all scholarship that does not
foreground race as the primary theme, means that **99% of IR will be
'racist'**]{.underline}. [There will be **no room** for any other
scholarship]{.underline} (unless you will live with the moniker of being
racist). [Not only does this seem **very unproductive**]{.underline} [in
terms of disciplinary conversations, not to talk of **diversity** and
**pluralism**, it]{.underline} also [means that it becomes **very hard**
to use the category of 'racism' for **critical purposes**]{.underline}
[for those cases where it **actually is at stake**]{.underline} in a
sense closer to what the rest of the discipline, and indeed the public
discourse, means by it. [It has been **watered down**]{.underline} [by
the fact that everyone but those in critical whiteness studies have been
deemed racist]{.underline}, one by one, where we just happened to get
the special honour of being among the first. [H&RM might protest that
this is not their plan, but we **fail to see how this can be
avoided**]{.underline} [when the logic they apply is that the term
racist can be based primarily on **sins of omission**]{.underline} [in
the sense of a theory being focused around other
categories]{.underline}.

As documented above, they claim numerous times that ST 'occludes' or
'refuses' various dynamics relating to race that they find important,
but they never offer any basis for concluding that the theory makes it
harder to see these things, only that it does not as such zoom in on
them. This does not have to do with a choice particularly regarding race
but the structure and nature of the theory as a general analytical
apparatus that can be applied to all instances where actors try to
securitize or desecuritize something, and the user is free then to
include race more or less in this analysis, just as the theory is not
deciding how important nationalism is or gender51, but it enables the
analysis of the way different categories and distinctions become
politically mobilised in security struggles.

[H&RM will probably argue that if you do not mention race in these
contexts, you '**hide' it**]{.underline}. **[Three
answers]{.underline}**: [1) **no**, there is a difference between **not
mentioning** and **hiding**, it takes a step more of the critic to show
that the theory **prevents** something from being
articulated]{.underline} or that it uses abstractions that stand in the
way of articulating race; that certainly is the case for some theories,
so it is a legitimate avenue of critique, but they haven't shown this,
[2) the theory is **intentionally**]{.underline} (as we have explained
numerous times) **[minimalist]{.underline}** in having a clear
conceptual core and then [not putting all kinds of factors like the role
of media or populism into the theory \-- **not** because we haven't
noticed these factors but because they **belong in applications**, and
the theory exactly allows you to study these phenomena, 3) we
are]{.underline} very [explicit that one of the **advantages of a
minimalist theory**]{.underline} [is the ability to **combine it** with
other theories]{.underline} especially general theories [about the
nature and structures of society]{.underline}; one should not build out
ST to become a general theory of society or international relations,
better in any specific usage of the theory combine it with the theories
one finds productive for the particular research project. (Wæver 2011,
2015) The latter point has come up in replies to the 'sociological'
version of ST (Balzacq), which has more of a tendency to add all
relevant factors to the theory, while the classical Copenhagen version
is tight and invites combination with theories that complement it, which
could exactly be theories of race and racism. Our ultimate concern here
is: how do we actually get to study racism in world politics in a
practically and politically helpful way?

When developing our own framework, ST, [we took **care**]{.underline}
[to make sure it could do critical work in concrete analyses, in our
view on racism as well]{.underline}, and H&RM fail to show that this is
not the case. In addition, we have then on a more mundane, human level
engaged ourselves in various ways to foster non-Western scholarship and
theories in IR (Tickner & Wæver 2009; Acharya & Buzan 2010, 2019). One
has for instance co-founded a book-series with the aim to identify
"alternatives for thinking about the 'international' that are more in
tune with local concerns and traditions outside the West" and
"provincializing the West" (quoting from the Routledge homepage of the
book series); the other has amongst many other things re-written this
history of the IR discipline to show both that it has ignored
non-Western contributions and that the Western part of it is indebted to
'scientific racism' (Buzan & Lawson 2015; Acharya and Buzan 2019).
Closer to ST, the project in Buzan & Wæver 2003 was to a large extent to
challenge the euro-centrism enshrined in dominant conceptions of
polarity and of the relationship between global and regional, to enable
theories to be more attentive to actual security dynamics in 'most of
the world'.

Surely, all of these efforts can be critically assessed as to what has
been helpful and what hasn't. But we find it strange that H&RM choose to
ignore completely the possibility of assessing the ability of ST to form
the basis for helpful analyses of racism. They neither look at those
analyses that have actually been done, nor do they show systematically
why it would be impossible to do so. On the contrary, [they limit
themselves to highly abstract and indirect attributions of racism to the
theory as such through various unconvincing routes]{.underline}. From
this they deduce (without any discussion) that ST can't inform studies
of racism (and when it has actually done it, they presumably are able to
magically make those publications go away) (see section 6 below).

[H&RM offer **no explanation**]{.underline} [as to how their type of
analysis helps in combating racism]{.underline}. [It is
**unclear**]{.underline} [if it is a kind of **ground clearing
operation**]{.underline} [to be followed up by new and better theories
after getting us out of the way]{.underline}. [Or whether they believe
that we are so much a part of the oppressive structures that attacking
us is in itself liberating]{.underline}. Or \-- as we will consider
below in more detail \-- the whole exercise is more about making
universities more inclusive and hospitable to students and scholars of
colour. Closely linked to the latter option, [their rationale could be
that the attack is meant more as a kind of 'happening' drawing attention
to the question of race]{.underline}. [Especially in the latter case, it
would be intentional that the article plays ambiguously with making a
very personal attack while pretending not to]{.underline}.

**IR scholarship regarding the liberal order is [not]{.underline}
irredeemably racist**

Relations,'"

In this interesting and important yet flawed book, [Vitalis seeks to
bridge the "vast gulf divid\[ing\] international relations from Africana
studies," bringing the "racism \[of the discipline of **i**nternational
**r**elations\] to light]{.underline}." [Conventional narratives of the
field's history, he argues, trace it to the rise of realism and national
security concerns in the years around World War II, adding a few
historical thinkers, such as Thucydides, to claim a timeless
intellectual pedigree.]{.underline} But [this ignores]{.underline} both
the **[extensive mainstream scholarship]{.underline}** [of the first
decades of the twentieth century that dealt with colonialism and racial
issues and the pioneering work of African American writers in what he
calls "the Howard School."]{.underline} Consigning both to the memory
hole, he says, paints a distorted picture of the discipline's origins
and nature, obscuring the role that international relations scholarship
has played in the construction and perpetuation of white Western
dominance. These are major claims, and some of them hold up better than
others. [Vitalis is correct to shine a spotlight on]{.underline} the
forgotten academic work of the first third of the twentieth century and
offers a timely reminder of just [how prevalent racialized thinking was
and how central a role imperialism]{.underline}---**[as opposed to
straightforward great-power relations]{.underline}**---[played in global
affairs]{.underline}. [Back then, for example, "policy relevance" in
political science often meant figuring out how to train good colonial
administrators]{.underline}. Vitalis also provides a service by telling
the story of scholars such as Alain Locke, Ralph Bunche, and Rayford
Logan, enriching readers' understanding of midcentury [intellectual
debates over U.S. foreign policy and tracing]{.underline} how
[racism]{.underline} operated inside various professional institutions.
Vitalis [is]{.underline} **[less convincing]{.underline}**, however, in
casting his analysis [as an indictment of the postwar discipline of
international relations, let alone **its contemporary
incarnation**]{.underline}. To get there, one has to share his politics.
V[italis sees a project of U.S. imperial domination playing out over the
course of the past century, with the "subjection" continuing today,
"through new-old policies of intervention, tutelage, and targeted
killings in new-old zones of anarchy and civilization
deficit."]{.underline} Given such a reading of U.S. foreign policy, it
is not surprising that he believes "the history of ideas, institutions,
and practices \[in the field\] has a constitutive role in their present
forms and functions"---or that he sees today's mainstream international
relations scholars as handmaidens of an evil national security state and
as the direct descendants of their racist predecessors of a century ago.
Scorning the notion that the postwar liberal international order
represents anything particularly new or admirable, Vitalis scores a few
points in noting how long it took for some [earlier social and racial
hierarchies]{.underline}, both international and domestic, to erode. But
he refuses to accept the fact that they [have]{.underline} indeed
**[eroded]{.underline}**. One is left wanting more analysis of how and
why the attitudes and **[patterns of domination]{.underline}** Vitalis
describes [gave way over time]{.underline}, and how the midcentury
theorists and [practitioners of the liberal international
order]{.underline} understood and [handled the paradoxes of its
**halting and inconsistent implementation.**]{.underline}

**There is no monolithic IR -- the field is [reflexive]{.underline} and
[effective]{.underline} -- its [track record]{.underline} of
[prediction]{.underline} proves. AND, sweeping criticisms of a
fragmented field of research don't answer the [specificity]{.underline}
of our studies.**

<https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/>

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign **policy choices** are
**not sui generis**, there are patterns across space and time that
**inform decision-making**]{.underline}. Policymakers recognize this and
routinely draw lessons from history when making foreign policy
decisions. As noted below, policymakers in other areas such as
development and public health routinely rely on broader, more general
studies to craft policy. And, [**broader scholarship** can **improve**
foreign policy performance, as evidenced by the ability of **IR
academics** to build on their own work to **predict outcomes**,
including for example **forecasting** the lengths of the conventional
and insurgency phases of the U.S.--Iraq conflict in the
2000s]{.underline}. But, even if one were to accept the limits of
general work, there is a growing body of academic work that evaluates
foreign policy tools as applied to a specific country or region. These
studies ask questions such as whether: Development projects reduced
insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone strikes reduced insurgent
violence in Pakistan; Development programs increased civic participation
and social capital in Sudan; Building cell phone towers in Iraq reduced
insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate combatants into society in
Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in Liberia increased the
legitimacy of the government there; Road projects in India reduced
insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's failure in Congo;
Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent attacks from militants.
This is not by any means a dismissal of professional intelligence work.
Academics are not intelligence analysts: They do not have access to
contemporary intelligence data, nor are they generally trained to do
things like examine the latest satellite photos of North Korean nuclear
activities and make judgments about North Korea's current plutonium
production. And certainly, academic IR work can never replace
professional intelligence work. But the best policy decisions marry
timely, specific intelligence with academic work that has a more general
perspective. A third critique is that much of this academic work on
foreign policy tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too
quantitative and technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik
Voeten, [there is a **danger** in **not appreciating** the
**importance** of **rigorous research design**, including sophisticated
**quantitative techniques**, for **crafting effective
policy**]{.underline}. [**Sophisticated research design** is not the
enemy of effective policy, it is **critically necessary** for
it]{.underline}. Certainly, [the current academic focus on building
research designs that permit causal inference speaks exactly to what
policymakers care about the most: if implementing a certain policy will
cause the desired outcome]{.underline}. Or, put differently, [**bad
research** designs make for **bad public policy**]{.underline}. [A
classic example is school busing]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline}
19[60s]{.underline} [and]{.underline} early 19[70s]{.underline}, [some
cities adopted voluntary integration programs for public
schools]{.underline}, in which families could volunteer to bus their
children to schools in neighborhoods with different racial majorities.
[Policymakers used the favorable results for the voluntary programs to
make the improper inference that mandatory busing policies would also
work]{.underline}. [The result was bad public policy and
violence]{.underline} in the streets. [Sophisticated **technical
methods** can improve our ability to make **causal inferences**,
and]{.underline} can help [solve]{.underline} other **[empirical
problems]{.underline}**. Consider that the heart of successful
counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine, winning the
support of the population. [Assessing whether certain policies do win
public support requires collecting opinion data]{.underline}. A
conventional method for measuring popular opinion is the survey, but of
course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas may be unwilling to
reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of fear for their
personal safety. [Methodologists have crafted sophisticated techniques
for addressing this issue, improving our ability to measure public
support for the government in these areas]{.underline}. These techniques
have been used to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.
[Going forward, we will continue to need advanced methodologies to
address pressing policy questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S.
military's commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this
commitment will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science
that address outstanding questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in
which mixed gender units engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective
than male-only units? How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion
in combat? How might mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual
assault, both within the military and of assault committed by troops
against civilians? [Certainly, **other areas** of public policy
understand the importance of rigorous research design]{.underline}.
[Economic and development policy communities read the work of and employ
economics Ph.D.s.]{.underline} [Policymakers incorporate the findings of
sophisticated studies on policy areas such as **microfinance**, **gender
empowerment**, and **foreign aid**, knowing the best policy decisions
must incorporate these studies' findings]{.underline}. Or consider
public health policy. [**Lives are literally on the line** as
decision-makers must make decisions about issues such as
**vaccinations**, **nutritional recommendations**, and **air
quality**]{.underline}. [Policymakers know they must use sophisticated
technical studies executed by epidemiologists and other public health
academics to craft the best policies]{.underline}. Critics will argue
that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from contemporary academic
IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics let go of an obsession
with technique, they will then be better able to connect with
policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree that IR
academics need to find ways to communicate their results in clear,
non-technical language. But [the **technical components** of the work
**need to be there**]{.underline}. [Stripping them out **directly
undermines** the ability of the research to give the **right** kinds of
policy **recommendations**]{.underline}. Let me conclude by noting that
I am sympathetic to the concern that IR academics should think about the
big picture as well as smaller questions, the forest of grand strategy
as well as the trees of foreign policy tools. [**IR academics** have the
potential to **make real contributions** to big picture
**debates**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of grand
strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates foreign
policy means and ends. [The nature of the IR subfield and its
integration of political economy and security, and its ability to think
about structure as well as units, make it especially well positioned to
consider these broad questions]{.underline}. The ability of IR academics
to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of many
reasons why [political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield
of [IR and resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions]{.underline}. Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers
need to know their tools]{.underline}. [**Rigorous IR research** is the
**only way to evaluate them effectively**]{.underline}.

Dominance in International Relations?", Routledge Publishing,
forthcoming

[Since the **1970s**]{.underline}, [a 'critical' movement has been
developing in the humanities and social sciences denouncing the
existence of]{.underline} '**[Western dominance']{.underline}** [over
the worldwide production and circulation of knowledge]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, [thirty years after the emergence of
this]{.underline} promising [agenda]{.underline} in International
Relations (IR), [this discipline has **not** experienced a]{.underline}
major [shift]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} volume [offers a
counter-intuitive and original contribution to the understanding of the
global circulation of knowledge]{.underline}. **[In contrast to the
literature]{.underline}**, it argues that [the internationalisation of
social sciences]{.underline} in the designated 'Global South' **[is not
conditioned]{.underline}** [by the existence of a presumably 'Western
dominance']{.underline}. Indeed, [although discriminative practices such
as Eurocentrism and gatekeeping **exist**,]{.underline} [their existence
**does not lead to a unipolar structuration of IR
internationalisation**]{.underline} [around 'the West'.]{.underline}
[Based on these empirical results]{.underline}, [this book reflexively
questions the role of critique in the **(re)production of the social and
political order.**]{.underline} Paradoxically, [the anti-Eurocentric
critical discourses **reproduce the very Eurocentrism they
criticise**]{.underline}. This book offers methodological support to
address this paradox by demonstrating how [one can use]{.underline}
discourse analysis and [reflexivity to produce innovative results and
decentre oneself from the vision of the world]{.underline} one has been
socialised into.

\*note: the identity of the author isn't immediately obvious but he
links his book title in the comments, and you can look that up and it
reveals his identity

[Where I **disagree with the author**, however, is his **very concept of
the 'Eurocene.'**]{.underline} [If the present international state
system **wasn't working** for states across the globe it would be
**dying out**, but **it seems to strengthening**]{.underline}. [There is
**no way** we are getting through what I will remain calling the
anthropocene without **some level of a command economy** for
**resources** and research direction for technologies]{.underline}.
[Many of these resources will be **scare** and will be **competed
over.**]{.underline} [The **competitive nature of the state system**
means something **Darwinistic** is occurring]{.underline}, [which is
good as we do not yet have the answer for surviving our current era and
so **multiple approaches must be tried** and **the best will serve as
models** for others and the worst will die out. I]{.underline} also
**[do not see anything particularly European about modernity
anymore]{.underline}**. [While a new era did begin with the biological
and demographic takeover of the western hemisphere and its forceable
wedding to Europe]{.underline}-previously a minor and not particularly
important subcontinental peninsula of Asia-**[any Eurasian
actor]{.underline}** [could have potentially done the **same
thing**]{.underline}. [The bureaucratic state was first born in
**China**]{.underline} [and the agricultural state came from the
**Middle East**]{.underline}, [and those strike me as **just as
relevant** to where we are now than the maritime-industrial states of
post medieval Europe.]{.underline} Furthermore, [as India and China move
their way into full industrialization]{.underline} on their own terms
[and countries like Japan have long held that position dating back to
the colonial era]{.underline}, [I find **little to argue** for something
called **specifically** 'The Eurocene.']{.underline} That being said,
the author is entirely correct that our currently unsustainable methods
of development are a type of self-replicating virus imposed by force.
But so too will any solutions have to follow that path. It may come as
no surprise that I, a person very into geopolitics (and making
speculative realist geopolitics in particular) also take a more neutral
tone on the field than this author. [I think geopolitics are **as likely
to get us out of this mess**]{.underline} [as they are to dig us
deeper.]{.underline} [Aside from general environmental goals, I see
**little universal** in how we will escape from pollution and mass
extinction and more a variety of paths which depend on the varying
ecologies of different countries]{.underline}. As it is, [some countries
will benefit from climate change and their interests **cannot be said to
be comparable** with those who will suffer.]{.underline} **[A stateless
world is a de facto neoliberal world in practice]{.underline}** [and the
author's fear of political homogenization is not caused by realism or
geopolitics but rather **prevented by those same actors**]{.underline}.
Diversity can only thrive in the absence of grand universal projects. So
our approaches are very clearly different as **[I see realist
geopolitics as the guarantor of ideological, economic, and ecological
diversity, not its foe]{.underline}**. But Grove is an excellent writer
so I enjoyed his take on it anyway.

**Grove's move is totalizing, preemptive, and cedes the present to
fascists**

[Timeless pessimism, hopeless critique]{.underline} Hope is a Form of
Extortion. (Jairus Grove, Savage Ecology, 2019: 25) Both Rutger Bregman
(2014) and Franco Berardi (2011) have written extensively on this
pessimism. In different ways and with different aims, they argue that
[despite the **huge** and **real**]{.underline} ([although highly uneven
and inequitable]{.underline}) [progress that we]{.underline} (in this
case, many of us who live in the West) [have made in helping more people
live longer, healthier, happier lives, we no longer believe we can
**improve further**]{.underline}. [We have become **collectively
disappointed**]{.underline} [by the **failures** of
**political**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[technological]{.underline}** [vision]{.underline}; [shocked by the
**downsides** of]{.underline} **[modernity]{.underline}**, [stunned by
the **scale** and **complexity** of our challenges]{.underline} [-- and
by the **pace** of **change**.]{.underline} As Jonathan Meades (2014)
observed, [change itself has changed: for many in the West, it used to
mean change for the better2]{.underline} [but for too many people that
is no longer the case.]{.underline} This fear of change itself has
exacerbated the problem, leading to a stasis of ideas, a lack of daring,
deficit of vision and vacuum of purpose. [Even faced with the
existential crisis of climate change, our responses have been
**piecemeal** and **incremental**]{.underline}. Too often even the
bolder proposals have been mealy mouthed or, worse, have framed human
life itself as the problem (e.g. Sparrow, 2019; Wilkinson, 2020). A
pious puritan streak in the environmental movement seems to relish in
the idea of a future of less, a restricted and spartan life, purged of
joy. It has not been widely embraced. Both Bregman and Berardi note that
majorities or significant minorities of people in richer countries have
long believed their children will be worse off than they are (see, e.g.
Pew, 2019) -- but they don't wish to actively spur this process along.
[There has been]{.underline} [no credible]{.underline} **[positive
vision]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[radical change]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[countervail]{.underline}** [this]{.underline}
**[negativity]{.underline}** [and so we drift, **seemingly
helpless**]{.underline} [as well as **hopeless**]{.underline} [in the
**interregnum of ideas**]{.underline}. As Bregman puts it: the real
crisis of our times, of my generation, is not that we don't have it
good, or even that we might be worse off later on. No, [the real crisis
is that we can't **come up with anything better**.]{.underline}
(Bregman, 2014: 22) He goes on to note that [we have become so **wary**
of positive visions of progress that: today we **stamp out dreams of a
better world before they can take root**]{.underline}. [**Dreams** have
a way of turning into **nightmares**]{.underline}, goes the cliche´.
**[Utopias]{.underline}** [are a breeding ground for
**discord**]{.underline}, **[violence]{.underline}**, [even]{.underline}
**[genocide]{.underline}**. Utopias ultimately become dystopias; in
fact, a utopia is a dystopia. (Bregman, 2014: 23) [Examples of this way
of thinking are plentiful but,]{.underline} for convenience, [one need
to look no further than **Jairus Grove's**]{.underline} scintillatingly
pessimistic keynote at the Hamburg Sessions (forthcoming as an essay in
NP and based on his 2019 book, [Savage Ecology]{.underline}).3 [It is
not that Grove doesn't make **compelling**]{.underline} [critical
arguments]{.underline} -- he does and in brilliant, imaginative ways --
[but]{.underline} that [they **lack balance.**]{.underline} And balance
matters, whether we are reckoning with horrendous pasts or trying to
boldly imaging new futures. [To see, or certainly to **dwell
on**]{.underline}, **[only]{.underline}** [the **bad** in what we in the
West have collectively done]{.underline} (however, Grove or anyone else
defines who we are), [over the entire course of our past and present is
**grossly unfair**]{.underline}. [It also amounts]{.underline}, in
effect, [to a **counsel of despair,**]{.underline} [however much Grove
protests to the contrary or **claims to eschew nihilism**]{.underline}.
In his keynote, [having written off our past and present, Grove also
explicitly urged us in Europe and the West **to stop imagining better,
progressive futures**]{.underline}, [arguing that this has led to
precisely the problems he identified]{.underline}. [Grove's critique
thus not only leaves us **out of time**]{.underline} ([without an
**avowable** past, present or future) but also leaves us **without
space**]{.underline} [for **contesting** **negative**, **regressive**
and **repressive**]{.underline} [political trends]{.underline}. In his
book, he laments the 'debilitating stupor' in which the work of thinkers
like Theodor Adorno and Giorgio Agamben leaves us (Grove, 2019: 238).
But [Grove's own pessimism, if we took it seriously, would leave
Europeans **without a political leg to stand on**. It would]{.underline}
[leave us]{.underline} in just such a stupor -- or worse --
[with]{.underline} no solid ground and no lever: [no way to move the
world and no platform for positive, progressive change. Why bother, if
everything we do only makes things worse? However much harm
we]{.underline} Europeans and [Westerners have done, we **haven't**
done, **don't** and won't **only do harm**]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} real [danger of Grove's type of **timelessly
pessimistic** and **literally hopeless**]{.underline} [critique is that
(]{.underline}again, if [taken seriously]{.underline}) [it breeds only
**damaging inertia**]{.underline}, **[inaction]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[resentment]{.underline}** -- [its **hopelessness**
makes it a **debilitating critique**]{.underline}; [its]{.underline}
**[timelessness]{.underline}** [offers **no possibility of
salvage**]{.underline}, [let alone **progress**]{.underline}. [It
**cedes the ground of action** to those]{.underline} [who many of
us]{.underline} (including Grove) [would]{.underline} **[explicitly
disagree with]{.underline}** -- [whether to exponents of '**traditional'
approaches**]{.underline} [to IR who are more than happy to offer policy
advice or, worse, to **authoritarians** and **populists**]{.underline}
[in practical politics]{.underline} (as ably described in Johanna
Sumuvuori's essay in this issue). [Critical scholars]{.underline} too
[rarely see it as their task to construct positive visions of better
worlds]{.underline}. [Instead, too often they content
themselves]{.underline} (if no one else) [with **evermore**]{.underline}
thoroughgoing **[deconstructive critique]{.underline}** -- including of
other critical academics. Whether totalising or parasitic, even some of
its leading proponents admit that [IR's critical project
has]{.underline}, thus far, [had]{.underline} **[insufficient
impact]{.underline}** [on the world at large]{.underline} (Austin, 2017,
2019). Few critical scholars will thank me for this comparison, but, in
their pessimistic, misanthropic zeal, they echo what French President
Emmanuel Macron called the 'sad passions' of the author Michel
Houellebecq4 (Carre\`re, 2017). They may not share Houellebecq's
politics, but many critical scholars certainly share his exhaustive (and
exhausting) disenchantment with contemporary (neo)liberal societies, the
state of Europe and of the West. Too often they also share his
miserabilist outlook on the impossibility of change for the better and
the futility or harm of even trying to improve things. [Grove does
propose several forms of political action:
**micro-kindnesses**]{.underline}, [however vague]{.underline} (e.g.
'the impossible generosity and affirmation of deconstruction', 2019:
231); **[resistant acts]{.underline}** [by **brave
individuals**]{.underline} ([e.g. 'William ''Fox'' Fallon, who
sacrificed his prestigious position as head of \[US Military\] Central
Command]{.underline} because he would not go along with the plan to
attack Iran', 2019: 232); [embracing entirely **new 'forms of
life5**]{.underline} '[; or **welcoming apocalypse as driver of
change**]{.underline} (2019: 229--248). [Grove **will not be confused
with Goldilocks** anytime soon -- these forms of action each seem either
**too little** or (**much**) **too much.** Few of us would question the
**value** of and **need** for **kindness**]{.underline} and, indeed, the
most hopeful part of Grove's book is the touching introduction where he
details many of the kindnesses he has himself benefitted from, mainly
from people in the West where he has spent most of his life. [There is
also, clearly, a role for resistance and for the kinds of acts that
Grove notes have prevented executions and even nuclear war.
**Yet**]{.underline} [without a **wider programme**]{.underline},
[without a **bigger** **positive vision**]{.underline}, [kindness and
resistance **cannot sufficiently change our world for the
better**]{.underline}. [Apocalypse, on the contrary, **changes too
much**]{.underline}, [junks **too much that is good** and is **rarely
likely to be an appealing option**]{.underline}, [or something we can
all get behind. The apocalyptic aspect of Grove's position]{.underline},
like that of many critical scholars, [seeks to inflict destructive harm
on Western institutions rather than constructively reform
them]{.underline} -- something Houellebecq would also relish.
Apocalyptic change also smacks of the recklessly callous, negative sides
of early 20th-century futurism (Marinetti, 1909), as Grove acknowledges
when asking 'How do we go wild without the cruelty of indifference?'
(2019: 280). Again, a more balanced approach to boldness would help. [To
be clear, major change is needed]{.underline} -- that was the whole
point of the Hamburg Sessions and the motivation behind giving it the
theme of 'Un-Cancelling the Future'. I've argued elsewhere that [the
kind of socio-economically regressive, technocratic, defensive
liberalisms that have dominated large parts of the last 40 years in the
West have a lot to answer fo]{.underline}r (Tallis, 2018). So too, of
course, does the type of narrowly, teleological individually atomising
(neo)liberalism that neither saw (Fukuyama, 1992) nor allowed (Fisher,
2009) alternative visions of politics, societies and economies. Mark
Fisher (2009), echoing the artist Gerhard Richter (Elger, 2009), called
this myopic liberalism 'Capitalist Realism'. You don't have to be a
Marxist or even a leftist to see that a mandated lack of alternatives
and a commensurate narrowing of possibilities and horizons is a bad
thing. As noted above, both climate change and sociotechnical upheavals
in the ways we work and live need bold visions to address the challenges
they pose while also seizing the opportunities they present. [It is,
however, **eminently possible** to recognise the **full
horrors**]{.underline} [of Europe's (colonial) pasts and presents
without **immediately discounting** the **possibility of
improvement**]{.underline} [coming from the West]{.underline}, from
Europe. [Similarly, one can recognise the myriad problems that Europeans
have caused while also **celebrating** the many **positive things** they
have also achieved.]{.underline} Moreover, it is possible to use those
achievements as inspirations for better ways of doing things -- as
catalysts to new, progressive creativity and to positive visions of the
future. Just as Kraftwerk did in the [fragile yet fertile Germany of the
second half of the 20th century when they acknowledged the abyss yet
still sought a better future, including as atonement for that
past.]{.underline} The cancellation of the future William Gibson
recently tweeted ''In the 1920s, the phrase 'the 21st Century' was
already popubiquitous. How often do we see the phrase ''the 22nd
Century'', now?''. And it's true -- we don't have these dates anymore.
As a boy, as a young man, I had mental pictures of the 21st Century. But
I don't have any sense of 2050 or 2100 -- except as a deterioration or a
collapse. (Simon Reynolds, Hamburg Sessions 2019, see essay in this
issue) I return to Kraftwerk below but first, a little more is needed on
the ramifications of contemporary hopelessness. [Rather than striving to
create **new** and **compelling** **positive**]{.underline},
**[progressive]{.underline}** [visions, many thinkers **content
themselves with critique**]{.underline} (Austin, 2017) while
[others]{.underline}, [like Grove, see **positive**, **progressive**
visions and **futures**]{.underline} -- [especially those coming from
Europe or the wider West -- as being **necessarily harmful in
themselves. This is postmodernism as hangover**]{.underline}. [The
depressed]{.underline} -- and depressing -- [aftermath of the
**shortcomings**]{.underline}, **[broken promises]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[unintended consequences]{.underline}** [of
modernisms of different kinds,]{.underline} in which strange connections
are made and selective, **[guilty memory runs amok]{.underline}**
(Fisher, 2014). **[Forgetting the good,]{.underline}** [it fuses the
bewitchingly pertinent]{.underline} [aspects of the post-positivist
critical project]{.underline} (which influenced many of us, myself very
much included), [with more zealously **(self-)destructive** and
**paralysing tendencies**]{.underline}. As Fisher puts it:
'Deconstruction \[is\] a kind of pathology of scepticism, which induced
hedging, infirmity of purpose and compulsory doubt' (2014: 16). In this
mode, [scholarship]{.underline} [no longer seeks to **invent the train**
but **fixates** on the **train crash**]{.underline} [or even
**pre-empts** and **precludes the train's invention** for fear of the
**seemingly inescapable** **imagined** **train crash to
come.**]{.underline} [Like Grove's denunciation of the future, many of
the critiques of (popular) modernisms are not so much **wrong** as
**imbalanced**]{.underline} (although some are wrong of course, others
not even). [They take **insufficient account** of modernisms'
**multiple** and **meaningful** **successes**]{.underline} (there's no
time here, but see, e.g. Fisher, 2014: 22; or Meades, 2014, for a
flavour). This leaves us in an odd situation where [many]{.underline} of
the [scholars]{.underline}, commentators and others who criticise
neoliberalism, capitalist realism and so on[, find themselves in de
facto agreement with its notion that there should be **no
alternative**]{.underline}. In this view, [we **simply shouldn't do big
vision politics** because our 'schemes to improve the human condition'
have not only 'failed' but will **always**, **inevitably**, **do more
harm than good**]{.underline} (Scott, 2008). [This
approach,]{.underline} all post and no modern, [will take us
**nowhere**]{.underline}, **[even as it fast-forwards the academic
careers of its exponents]{.underline}**. The future visions that are
left, on the left, tend to be Marxist ones (see, e.g. Grove, 2019: 198--
202). Tarred not only by the brush of the communisms that actually
existed (and their distinctly less balanced ledger than that of
modernism more widely) they understandably fail to inspire mass
enthusiasm. Many of their proponents are still really more interested in
explaining the failure to bring about the inevitable (full communism) in
the past and present than in imagining new futures that go beyond the
narrow world view and limiting subjectivity of too many Marxist
approaches (see, e.g. Scribner, 2003; Sˇitera, 2015). This has done
little to address the crisis of hope or to countervail prevalent
contemporary pessimism. [The **loss of the belief** in the]{.underline}
**[progressive future]{.underline}** -- [that **tomorrow** can be
**better** than yesterday and today -- and the related erosion of faith
in our ability to **positively shape our own destiny**]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} what Berardi (2011: 13) called '[the slow cancellation
of the future']{.underline}. As Simon Reynolds noted in his Hamburg
Sessions keynote (included in this issue of NP), the cancellation may
have started slowly in the 1970s, but, by the 2000s, it had picked up
speed and its effects could start to be seen. The first of these -- its
more (neo)liberal variant -- was the feeling of living in an endless
present. For a lot of people in the West, this has been comfortable in
many ways (although often unevenly and unfairly) and has had distinct
advantages over the past (the extension of rights and opportunities to
broader swathes of the population) but without much hope, optimism or
greater purpose. Unless it provokes the nostalgic responses outlined
below, [this **endless present** can lead to a sense of
**ennui**]{.underline}, [a **lack of direction** and **loss of
momentum**]{.underline}. [The second, more overtly
**sinister**]{.underline}, [variant that **fills the vacuum** left by
the **dearth**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[positive]{.underline}**,
**[progressive]{.underline}** [visions for the future takes the form of
**darker re-enchantments** focused on the (**imagined)
past**]{.underline} (e.g. Campanella and Dassu\`, 2019). [Whether
'**making America great again'**]{.underline}, '**[taking back
control']{.underline}** [in the United Kingdom or claiming to offer an
'**alternative for Germany'**]{.underline}, [these movements are
fundamentally premised on a **backward-looking politics**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[nostalgia]{.underline}**. [The **pessimism about the
present** and **worries about the future**]{.underline} [on which these
movements have each capitalised have given rise to an **increasingly
defensive**]{.underline} [politics of **closing down** and
**protecting**]{.underline}, [at the expense of opening up and
integrating]{.underline}. **[Nativism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[pessimism]{.underline}** **[tend to go hand in hand]{.underline}**:
[shrinking pies bring narrowed]{.underline} [horizons and hasten the
circling of wagons around exclusive and chauvinistic visions of national
communities]{.underline}. Too often, this retro-rightism has been met
only with retro-leftism or a tired centrism that merely seeks more of
the same, to smooth the endless present. But that can change \...

6\. The two faces of security -- and of peace [Security]{.underline},
especially [state security, tends to be enacted in contexts of the
violently contested **political authority**]{.underline}. [Often it is
enacted through **violent power**]{.underline}, rebranded as legitimate
force. Small wonder that some in the development community, including
those who drafted SDG 16, hesitate to use the word at all. [But
**although** security is a **deeply disputed** idea, it is also a
**highly necessary** one]{.underline}. [Security functions
simultaneously as an analytical construct, as a **frame for policy** and
as a **moral narrative**]{.underline}. It is distinct from the equally
ambiguous if less contentious concept of peace. Yet, at the same time,
[it is]{.underline} often seen as [**essential** to the preservation of
**peace**]{.underline}. Most of the things that international
decision-makers, political and security elites and development
practitioners do in security's name are supposed to protect the safety
and welfare of people in a world of multiple challenges and threats.
However, [there is a tendency to slide from **global**, to **national**,
to **citizen** and to human security and back again, without enough
serious reflection on how they **interconnect**]{.underline} and on
where tensions and contradictions lie hidden. Development agencies have
too often plunged into security policies and programmes, without a clear
understanding of where they might lead, who would benefit and how they
might go wrong. The ambiguities stem in part from a deep-seated tension
between two distinct visions of security (summarised in Table 3), which
interconnect, yet are in deep tension with eachother. [On the **one
hand**]{.underline}, [security can be seen as a process of political and
social ordering, aiming to reduce violence and keep the
peace]{.underline}. As such it is territorially organised and kept in
place globally as well as nationally through the authoritative
discourses and practices of power, including socially sanctioned
violence. [It connects to conceptions of what Galtung termed 'negative
peace': the ending of overt violence, without necessarily **transforming
the conditions** giving rise to this violence]{.underline} [or attending
to the **quality** of the **subsequent peace**]{.underline}. In this
view security is a public good delivered in principle by states, much
like official or donor-driven development.29 Yet in a world where states
and indeed the international order face sustained challenges, security
is often kept in place also through alternative nonstate or 'hybrid'
networks of violence and protection.30 Moreover, security is far from
being an unalloyed public good. In principle, it is equally shared and
socially inclusive, even if in practice it is anything but, especially
at the insurgent margins where insecurity is most acute. For [in
practice it protects **socially embedded power**, established property
relations and **social privilege** -- and reinforces global, national
and local **inequalities**]{.underline}. [On the **other hand**,
security can be seen]{.underline} (in the vernacular) [as an
**entitlement of citizens**]{.underline} and more widely human beings
[to **social peace** and **protection from violence**, abuses of
**rights** and **social injustice**, along with other **existential
risks** such as **famine** or **disease**]{.underline}. [It connects to
the idea of '**positive peace'**, including **transformations** in the
social conditions giving rise to violence and deepening the
**relationships between states and** their **citizens**]{.underline}.
The vernacular understandings, day-to-day experience, resilience and
agency of the people and groups who are 'secured' and 'developed' are in
this view the touchstone by which to evaluate security and violence
reduction[. Most people **fall back** upon their **social identities**
-- as women and men, members of families, clans, castes, ethnic groups,
sects, religions and nationalities -- to navigate their social worlds,
to **respond to insecurity**]{.underline} and violence and (sometimes)
to organise for violence. At the same time, [these **identities** are
**written into** the **structures of power and
inequality**]{.underline}, [being deployed to **establish hierarchies of
citizenship** and **patterns of exclusion**]{.underline}. Ensuring that
security is inclusive and not simply the security of particular groups
or the property of the well-armed, powerful and wealthy, is fraught with
difficulty and must be negotiated at multiple levels. 'Security in the
vernacular' is the term used here rather than the interlinked but
distinct concepts of 'human security' and of 'citizen security'
popularised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
World Bank,31 which fit in the conceptual toolboxes of development
practitioners, humanitarian agencies and intervention forces. Both human
and citizen security have come under criticism for 'securitising'
development by framing poverty, exclusion and vulnerability through
security lenses, and thus paving the way for military interventions in
the affairs of fragile states.32 '[**Security in the vernacular'** paves
the way for more precise and detailed empirical scrutiny of how security
and plays out in particular local and national contexts. It highlights
the experience and social agency of those who are 'secured'. And it
underscores the transformative potential of security as an
**entitlement**]{.underline}, [which can be **actively claimed** by
those who **challenge** the **deeply rooted legacies** of
**insecurity**, **exclusion** and **injustice**]{.underline}. Both these
faces of security have their underside, most obviously the first.
'Seeing like a state' even with the best of intentions can lead to the
interests of citizens being sacrificed to an unbending vision of
national security or of top-down development (as even in Nyerere's
Tanzania).33 It is also open to abuse -- for instance, to prop up
authoritarian regimes; to advance the interests of predatory elites; to
impose exclusionary economic and social policies; to justify state
secrecy and surveillance of citizens; or to justify the hegemonies and
military adventurism of major world powers. And it tends to be closely
if complexly related to 'seeing like a corporation', most obviously in
enclave economies, where privatised security arrangements in protected
enclaves may indeed destabilise or weaken the state.34 The
[**deformations** of **security in the vernacular** tend to be more
hidden]{.underline}, but no less damaging -- for instance, [the
submission of minorities and refugees to campaigns of exclusion and
violence by populist majorities]{.underline}; [forms of **popular
justice** that **violate the rights**]{.underline}, dignity and safety
of supposed perpetrators; or grass roots endorsement of 'traditional' or
customary institutions, which perpetuate gender and other inequities.
Moreover, local-level insecurities can persist or even worsen, when a
state, like India or Brazil, is considered to be stable, or a region or
locality is considered to be secure. Neither face of security can be
considered without the other. The relationship between them is utterly
crucial. The capacity of states to protect their citizens is at the
basis of the social contract.35 That is, [the rights and security of
citizens]{.underline} and people [are the bedrock of state and
international security -- or at least they **should be**]{.underline}.
But [these entitlements cannot be protected without some kind of
**social order**]{.underline}, however achieved. [And how and by whom
social order is assured are both **affairs of governance** and **vital
concerns** for **everyone** who lives under the **leaky umbrella** of
**political authority**]{.underline}. **[Political
stability]{.underline}**, **[durable institutions]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[rule of law]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[effective and accountable security apparatuses]{.underline}**
**[are]{.underline}** not just **[desirable attributes of
states]{.underline}** but are also in many respects conditions of the
security of people. However, [they **come at a price**]{.underline}, not
just in taxes, but also [because of the need for **constant vigilance**
to ensure that those charged with delivering security do not ignore or
still worse violate the entitlements of those they are supposed to
protect]{.underline}.

**[2AC -- Heg Bad]{.underline}**

**Pursuit's inevitable**

**Mearsheimer 11** John J. Mearsheimer, the "R. Wendell Harrison
Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University
of Chicago" Jan/Feb 2011 "Imperial By Design"

[The downward spiral the United States has taken was anything but
inevitable. Washington has always had a choice in how to approach grand
strategy. One popular option among some libertarians is
isolationism.]{.underline} This approach is based on the assumption that
there is no region outside the Western Hemisphere that is strategically
important enough to justify expending American blood and treasure.
Isolationists believe that the United States is remarkably secure
because it is separated from all of the world's great powers by two
giant moats---the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans--- and on top of that it
has had nuclear weapons---the ultimate deterrent---since 1945. But in
truth, [**there is really no chance that Washington will adopt this
policy**,]{.underline} though the United States had strong isolationist
tendencies until World War II. For since then, [an internationalist
activism, fostered by the likes of the Rockefeller Foundation, has
thoroughly delegitimized this approach. American policy makers have come
to believe the country should be militarily involved on the world
stage]{.underline}. Yet though no mainstream politician would dare
advocate isolationism at this point, the rationale for this grand
strategy shows just how safe the United States is. This means, among
other things, that it will always be a challenge to motivate the U.S.
public to want to run the world and especially to fight wars of choice
in distant places. [Offshore balancing]{.underline}, which was America's
traditional grand strategy for most of its history, [is but another
option]{.underline}. Predicated on the belief that [there are three
regions of the world that are strategically important to the United
States]{.underline}---Europe, Northeast Asia and the Persian Gulf---[it
sees]{.underline} [the United States' principle goal as making sure no
country dominates any of these areas as it dominates the Western
Hemisphere]{.underline}. This is to ensure that dangerous rivals in
other regions are forced to concentrate their attention on great powers
in their own backyards rather than be free to interfere in America's.
The best way to achieve that end is to rely on local powers to counter
aspiring regional hegemons and otherwise keep U.S. military forces over
the horizon. But if that proves impossible, American troops come from
offshore to help do the job, and then leave once the potential hegemon
is checked. [Selective engagement also assumes that Europe, Northeast
Asia and the Persian Gulf are the only areas of the world where the
United States should be willing to deploy its military might. It is a
more ambitious strategy than offshore balancing in that it calls for
permanently stationing U.S. troops in those regions to help maintain
peace]{.underline}. For selective engagers, it is not enough just to
thwart aspiring hegemons. It is also necessary to prevent war in those
key regions, either because upheaval will damage our economy or because
we will eventually get dragged into the fight in any case. An American
presence is also said to be valuable for limiting nuclear proliferation.
But [none of these strategies call for Washington to spread democracy
around the globe---especially through war. The root cause of America's
troubles is that it adopted a flawed grand strategy]{.underline} after
the Cold War. From the Clinton administration on, the United States
rejected all these other avenues, instead pursuing global dominance, or
what might alternatively be called global hegemony, which was not just
doomed to fail, but likely to backfire in dangerous ways if it relied
too heavily on military force to achieve its ambitious agenda. Global
dominance has two broad objectives: maintaining American primacy, which
means making sure that the United States remains the most powerful state
in the international system; and spreading democracy across the globe,
in effect, making the world over in America's image. The underlying
belief is that new liberal democracies will be peacefully inclined and
pro-American, so the more the better. Of course, [this means that
Washington must care a lot about every country's politics. With global
dominance, no serious attempt is made to prioritize U.S. interests,
because they are virtually limitless. This grand strategy is "imperial"
at its core]{.underline}; its [proponents believe]{.underline} that the
[United States has]{.underline} the right as well as the [responsibility
to interfere in the politics of other countries]{.underline}. One would
think that such arrogance might alienate other states, but most American
policy makers of the early nineties and beyond were confident that would
not happen, instead believing that other countries---save for so-called
rogue states like Iran and North Korea---would see the United States as
a benign hegemon serving their own interests.

[The finding that]{.underline} U.S. [entanglement is rare **has
important implications for international relations
scholarship**]{.underline} and U.S. foreign policy. For scholars, **[it
casts doubt on classic theories of imperial overstretch]{.underline}**
in which great powers exhaust their resources by accumulating allies
that free ride on their protection and embroil them in military
quagmires.22 [The U.S. experience instead suggests that **great powers
can dictate the terms of their security commitments and that allies
often help their great power protectors avoid strategic
overextension.**]{.underline} For policy, [the rarity of U.S.
entanglement suggests that the United States' current grand strategy of
deep engagement]{.underline}, which is centered on a network of standing
alliances, does not preclude, and [may]{.underline} even
[facilitate]{.underline}, U.S. **[military restraint]{.underline}**.
Since 1945 the United States has been, by some measures, the most
militarily active state in the world. [The most egregious cases of U.S.
overreach]{.underline}, however, **[have stemmed not from
entangling]{.underline}** alliances, [but from the penchant of American
leaders **to define national interests expansively**,]{.underline} to
overestimate the magnitude of foreign threats, and to underestimate the
costs of military intervention. Scrapping alliances will not correct
these bad habits. In fact, [disengaging from alliances may unleash the

Unipolarity is not Peaceful.' Reviewed by William Wohlforth" October
31st, http://www.h-net.org/\~diplo/ISSF/PDF/ISSF-AR17.pdf

Third, setting up the article as a claim that unipolarity is not
peaceful runs into a problem: **[Unipolarity is peaceful. The Most
Peaceful. Ever. Period]{.underline}**. No one expects any imaginable
anarchic inter-state system to be perfectly peaceful, with no war at
all. In my 1999 paper, I stressed that "[unipolarity **does not imply
the end of all conflict**\... It simply means the absence of two big
problems" --- hegemonic rivalry and counter-hegemonic balancing---that
were present in all earlier systems. As a result "unipolarity favors the
absence of war among the great powers." Like any statement]{.underline}
[about the war-proneness of any international system, **this is a
relative claim**.]{.underline} [International relations scholarship does
not have theories that make anything other than relative predictions
about the war-proneness of systems]{.underline}. [Monteiro tries but
fails to escape this reality. He writes: "Rather than assess the
relative peacefulness of unipolarity vis-à-vis bipolar or multipolar
systems, I identify causal pathways to war that are characteristic of a
unipolar system and that have not been developed in the extant
literature (12). The latter portion of this sentence is exactly right,
but the former bit is contradicted just a few pages later when Monteiro
presents evidence that "Unipolarity is the most conflict prone of all
systems .. ." (18). While conflict researchers debate the causes, they
are nearly united in agreeing that the post-1990 international system is
**the least afflicted by war**.5 **There are many ways to measure**
war]{.underline}

[: the overall number that occur, the number of people killed, the
probability that any state will be at war in any year, the size or cost
of military forces compared to economic output or population, or,
perhaps best, the probability that any individual will die as a result
of organized inter-group violence. **By all those measures, we are
living in the most peaceful period**]{.underline} since the modern
inter-state system took shape in the seventeenth century. Indeed,
Stephen [Pinker assembles masses of evidence to suggest that **there has
never been a less violent time in all of human history**.6 It is hard to
think of any way to measure war that does not show the unipolar period
as remarkably peaceful--- except for the ones Monteiro uses: "the
percentage of years that great powers spend at war, and the incidence of
war involving great powers," (18) with the United States defined as the
only great power after 1990. That is a very convoluted way to say 'Iraq
and Afghanistan.' **The fact that the United States ended up in two
grinding counter-insurgency operations in no way contradicts the claim
that unipolarity is unprecedentedly peaceful.**]{.underline} But that
reaction concerns the framing rather than the substance of the article.
[One can dismiss as America-centric the claim that unipolarity is
war-prone and still regard Monteiro's carefully]{.underline} [crafted
arguments as promising advances]{.underline}. Further investment in
refining and evaluating these arguments is warranted, for [even if we
agree that unipolarity has been pretty darned peaceful, it surely
doesn't seem that way to anyone in or around the U.S.
military]{.underline}. [Along with most security scholars]{.underline},
[I've regarded the post-1991 military interventions as permitted **but
not dictated by unipolarity**]{.underline}. [That **at least leaves open
the possibility of strategic learning**, as happened]{.underline} [back
in biplolarity]{.underline}. Even though the bipolar structure and U.S.
grand strategy remained constant, [bloody conflicts in **Korea and
Vietnam** prompted Washington to get out of the direct military
intervention business in favor of proxy wars]{.underline} and less
costly covert operations. Similarly, [the new "Iraq syndrome" might
**tame interventionist impulses** even as unipolarity
endures]{.underline}. But Monteiro's message is gloomier. "The
significant level of conflict the world has experienced over the last
two decades," he warns, "will continue as long as U.S. power remains
preponderant." (38). That's a scary message even if that "significant
level" is far lower than in any other known interstate system. So while
I hope Monteiro is wrong, there is no doubt that his article has
decisively altered the terms of the debate on this crucial issue.

**[2AC -- China Threat Con]{.underline}**

**Empirically disproven.**

Tenzin **Dorjee 21**. Senior researcher at Tibet Action Institute and a
PhD candidate in the political science department at Columbia
University. \"Opinion: Anti-China is not anti-Asian\". Washington Post.
4-6-2021.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/06/anti-china-is-not-anti-asian/

However, [some]{.underline} commentators [are arguing that the U.S.
foreign policy establishment's criticism of the Chinese government is to
blame for the domestic problem of anti-Asian violence]{.underline}. This
specious claim, which China's state-run media quickly exploited, has
been most prominently advanced in the mainstream Western media by
distinguished novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen and political scientist Janelle
Wong, who claim that "bipartisan political rhetoric about Asia" and
successive administrations' "critical takes" on China fuel anti-Asian
violence. This narrative, which weaponizes Asian American vulnerability
to shield Beijing from international criticism, is as dangerous as it is
fraudulent.

First of all, let's be clear that [there is no bipartisan political
rhetoric targeting Asia]{.underline}, a continent of nearly 50 nations.
[Conflating Asia with China is the geopolitical equivalent of assuming
all Asians are Chinese, precisely the **kind of racial lumping that the
writers themselves sensibly caution against**.]{.underline}

To be sure, criticism of the Chinese government by policymakers in
Washington has escalated in recent years. But [the overwhelming volume
of the rhetoric targeting Beijing has been prompted not by abstract
geopolitical competition but by tangible grievances, including China's
**genocide in Xinjiang**]{.underline}, intensifying **[repression in
Tibet, dismantling of democracy in Hong Kong and sweeping crackdown on
Chinese civil society]{.underline}**. [Some of Beijing's harshest
critics are Asian Americans]{.underline}. [Uyghur refugees, Hong Kong
democrats, Chinese dissidents and Tibetan exiles such as
myself]{.underline}, whose communities back home reel under Beijing's
boot, [are **urging Congress to censure China for its
crimes**]{.underline}. [Asking lawmakers of conscience to hold their
tongue on Beijing's genocide to supposedly prevent racial violence here
is to set up a **false trade-off between Asian American safety and
Uyghur lives**, both of which should be treated as
**nonnegotiable**.]{.underline}

Moreover, **[there is no research-based evidence that American
lawmakers' legitimate criticism of Beijing has a causal effect on
violence against Asians]{.underline}**. In fact, [Washington's political
rhetoric has been rising steadily over the past half decade, during
which Beijing built the **Uyghur internment camps**, demolished **Hong
Kong's democracy** and chipped away at the **liberal international
order**]{.underline}. **[Anti-Asian attacks remained rare]{.underline}**
[during this whole period, soaring only when the pandemic
hit]{.underline}. [If China had contained covid]{.underline}-19 within
its borders, or if the United States had succeeded in keeping it out,
[no amount of congressional criticism against Beijing would have made us
afraid to ride the subway at night.]{.underline}

[market reforms, the Chinese people **experienced the fastest increase
so far in their standard of living.**]{.underline}

**Competition rhetoric doesn't cause their impacts.**

However, [particular representations **do not automatically lead to
particular responses** as, for instance, proponents of the so-called
\'CNN effect\' would argue]{.underline} (for an overview of the debates
among academic, media and policy-making circles on the \'CNN effect\',
see Gilboa 2005; see also, Dauber 2001; Eisensee/Stromberg 2007;
Livingston/Eachus 1995; O\'Loughlin 2010; Perlmutter 1998. 2005;
Robinson 1999, 2001). [There is **no causal relationship** **between a
specific image and a political intervention**]{.underline}, [in which a
dependent variable]{.underline} ([the image]{.underline}) [would explain
the outcome of an independent one]{.underline} ([the act]{.underline}).
David [Perlmutter]{.underline} (1998: l), for instance, [explicitly
challenges, as he calls it, the \'visual determinism\']{.underline} [of
images, which dominates political and public opinion]{.underline}.
[Referring to findings based on public surveys]{.underline}, [he argues
that the formation of opinions]{.underline} by [individuals depends
**not on images** but on their idiosyncratic predispositions and
values]{.underline} (see also, Domke ct ah 2002; Perlmutter 2005). Yet,
[it should also be noted that visuals function as unquestioned
referents]{.underline} in international politics [when underlining the
necessity of such specific policy practices as sanctions,]{.underline}
deterrents and/or military cooperation. A good example of this is
satellite imagery, which plays a pivotal role in the surveillance and
assessment of missile or nuclear proliferation activities by so-called
\'rogue states\' like Iran and North Korea. [Regarded as providing
compelling evidence about the stage of development]{.underline} of
nuclear facilities [or about the collaboration between suspect states,
satellite images point to a nexus between visuality, knowledge and
international politics]{.underline} wherein this way of seeing
consequently enables governments to make legitimate statements, draw
conclusions and take informed political action. In sum, [the visual
provides the foundation for knowledge generation and. in doing so,
bestows political responses with legitimacy]{.underline} (cf. Moller
2007). A now famous case-in-point is Colin Powell\'s PowerPoint
presentation at the United Nations Security Council in February 2003. In
the briefing, the then US Secretary of State showed satellite images
that allegedly proved the existence of Iraqi \'Weapons of Mass
Destruction\'. What was remarkable about Powell\'s presentation was that
the visual emerged as the primary referent for the US government\'s
casus belli, which, in the words of MacDonald ef ai (2010: 7-8),
disclosed the fact that the \'logic of geopolitical reason is now
inseparable from its visual representation\' (see also, Campbell 2007c;
Der Derian 2001). [The causal theory of the \'CNN effect\',]{.underline}
[or what Perlmutter]{.underline} (1998: 1) [has called above \'visual
determinism\', misconceives of how the visual recasts the political
realm itself]{.underline} (Hansen 2011[). Rather than asking whether an
image caused an intervention]{.underline}, [it should be asked instead
how the visual has been involved in structuring the understandings of
**legitimate action**]{.underline}, [and how visual representations of
different policy options affect particular security practices
(]{.underline}Williams 2003: 527). For instance, [many scholars have
shown that images can provoke particularly emotive
responses]{.underline} (Bleiker/Hutchison 2008; Crawford 2000;
Hariman/Lucaites 2007; Mercer 2006; Ross 2006). Just one example of the
(deliberate) evocation of an emotional reaction is the numerous
fundraising campaigns that have been run by different humanitarian aid
organizations over the years, in which imagery plays an essential role
(Bell/Carens 2004; Dogra 2007; Manzo 2008).

[The United States **must compete with China**]{.underline} and
**[confront the Chinese government]{.underline}** on a range of issues
[while simultaneously **combating the rise of anti-Asian
racism**]{.underline} at home. [These two missions are **not at odds
with each other**]{.underline}, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
would have you believe. In fact, [they]{.underline} must [go **hand in
hand**]{.underline}. In Alaska last weekend, Chinese government leaders
sought to stoke our country's racial divisions, accusing the United
States of having "slaughtered" African Americans, to deflect criticism
over Beijing's mass atrocities against its Uyghur Muslim population.
Meanwhile, [CCP propaganda outlets have been using the
killing]{.underline} last week in the Atlanta area [of]{.underline}
eight [innocent]{.underline} people (six of them [Asian]{.underline})
[to cast aspersions on those who are condemning the Chinese government's
atrocities]{.underline}. [Beijing's goal is to **conflate and
confuse**]{.underline} two **[related but distinct
issues]{.underline}**: [challenging the Chinese government
and]{.underline} the need to [fight racism]{.underline} in the United
States. But [their gambit amounts to **presenting a false choice**
between doing one or the other.]{.underline} "[It is part of a broader
strategy that the Chinese Communist Party is enacting to **undermine our
democracy**]{.underline}," Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) told me in an
interview. "So [when you see them creating that **false
equivalency**]{.underline} . . . [it is their way to **sow
discord**]{.underline} in our society, because [they understand when we
are not united, we are weaker]{.underline} in leading the world [in
confronting]{.underline} their [bad behavior]{.underline}." Murphy, a
former Pentagon official who came to the United States as a child
refugee from Vietnam, said that the use of racist language by former
president Donald Trump and other GOP officials plays into the CCP's
hands. Yet at the same she emphasized that [U.S. leaders have to be able
to **speak**]{.underline} honestly and **[critically about the CCP's
negative behaviors]{.underline}**, including its mishandling of the
covid-19 pandemic. The rise of racism against Asian Americans not only
hurts the United States' ability to deal with China, but also it harms
efforts to make common cause with our regional allies and partners such
as Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. Those governments' ability to join
the United States in confronting China is hurt when members of their
diaspora communities are mistreated in the United States.
"[We]{.underline} have to be able to [make a **very clear
distinction**]{.underline} that [our adversary and competitor is the
**Chinese Communist Party, not the Chinese people**]{.underline}, and
certainly **[not]{.underline}** the **[Asian Americans]{.underline}**
who live here and who have contributed so much to this country," Murphy
said. "When we attack Americans of Asian descent, we attack ourselves."
[Some]{.underline} American commentators [argue that]{.underline} the
[effort to confront the Chinese government's behavior]{.underline} has
[fueled]{.underline} the staggering rise in [hate and violence directed
at Asians and Asian Americans]{.underline} in the United States. [It's
certainly true that Trump's racist rhetoric]{.underline} regarding the
coronavirus fueled hate and [conflated the two issues,
tragically]{.underline}. And U.S. government efforts to confront CCP
influence operations in our country have at times unfairly targeted
people of Chinese origins. Such targeting of Asians and Asian Americans
makes us weaker at home and abroad. **[We must]{.underline}** learn
from, **[not repeat, examples]{.underline}** from history [when U.S.
foreign policy negatively affected American minorities]{.underline},
including the mass internment of U.S. citizens and noncitizens of
Japanese descent during World War II and the mistreatment of Arab and
Muslim Americans after 9/11. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the son of
Indian immigrants, told me that **[the United States has to out-compete
China without replicating the paradigms]{.underline}** of the Cold War.
But, he said, [we must]{.underline} also **[stand up to the
authoritarian and repressive model the Chinese government]{.underline}**
is putting forward [without ceding our moral authority]{.underline}.
"[That has to be the balance]{.underline}, enhance America's strategic
interest but **[clearly reject provocative rhetoric]{.underline}**
that's intended to play to a base," he said. "[There's a way to **frame
our moral position as a liberal democracy**]{.underline} . . . [without
coming]{.underline} off as [demonizing an entire
civilization]{.underline} in a way that hurts Chinese or Chinese
Americans." [Khanna and]{.underline} Rep. Mike [Gallagher]{.underline}
(R-Wis.) have co-sponsored a bill, the Endless Frontier Act, to revamp
the National Science Foundation to **[try to out-compete China through
technological innovation]{.underline}**. Senate Majority Leader Charles
E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) are cooperating on
companion legislation in the Senate. These efforts will be a major test
of whether bipartisan cooperation on the China challenge is possible.
**[It's not the drive to confront China that is fueling hate and
racism]{.underline}** against Asians in America. Political [opportunists
are abusing that effort by fueling bigotry]{.underline} to score
political points. This makes a unified strategy to confront the Chinese
government only more difficult to achieve. In fact, addressing racism at
home is crucial to winning the competition with China in the long run.
"[We have to be aggressive in our policies and working with our
allies]{.underline} to combat the violations the Chinese are making,
[but at the same time, **we can hold the CCP accountable without
scapegoating Asian Americans**]{.underline}," Murphy said. "And we have
a responsibility to do that."

N.S.: One question I have is, [will there be]{.underline}
**[buy-in]{.underline}** [from the American public for a Cold War style
confrontation]{.underline}? Americans remember quite vividly how the
Bush administration lied about WMDs in Iraq and pushed us into a
pointless and horribly destructive war. On the other hand, [negative
opinions of China]{.underline} **[are running quite high]{.underline}**,
[and a recent poll showed that for the first time, a majority of
Americans **support using military force**]{.underline} to defend
Taiwan. So where do you see public opinion going on this issue? Also, a
follow-up question here. [Some people are worried that a Cold War style
confrontation with China will result in]{.underline} a **[racist
backlash]{.underline}** [against Asian people]{.underline} in the U.S.
[That **seems plausible**]{.underline} given the recent wave of
anti-Asian attacks, which seems to have been [exacerbated by
Trump\'s]{.underline} \"**[China virus]{.underline}**\"
[language]{.underline} in 2020. And of course the memory of how the U.S.
treated Japanese Americans during World War 2 looms large. What can we
do at the policy level to ensure that there\'s no such backlash? H.B.:
Let\'s side aside Iraq for a moment: I think the idea that Bush lied is
an overstatement, but that\'s a separate debate (and the war was indeed
destructive and counterproductive). There are [certainly the makings of
a **bipartisan consensus** on China]{.underline} in the United States.
[COVID turned Americans against China to a degree that Beijing building

the CCP\'s cynicism and irresponsibility could cause concrete harm to
Americans and their livelihoods. There is [bipartisan

of \"would you want to defend X\" sort of questions, Americans are
clearly more concerned about the fate of Taiwan than they were before.
For now, the [consensus is still broader than it is

change over time. [As for the]{.underline} **[racism

rooted, at least partly, in the imperative of making America more
attractive and competitive in the Cold War]{.underline}. So hopefully
our [leaders will treat competition with China not as a reason to bring

Throwing the Baby Out with the Bathwater? [Chan warns that the discourse
on **Thucydides's Trap** and **power transition** can create a
**self-fulfilling prophecy**. If leaders **believe** in Thucydides's
Trap and act accordingly, it may **create** the anticipated conditions
that **make war more likely**.]{.underline} [Talking and thinking in
terms of Thucydides's Trap will influence the state's construction of
its identity as well as its definition of interests and
preferences]{.underline}. The discourse is harmful because it encourages
'othering' the opponent and contributes to confrontation. Should we,
then, throw out the proposition that war is more likely when the system
is undergoing a power transition? It might be worthwhile to go back to
what Thucydides's Trap refers to: "the severe structural stress caused
when a rising power threatens to upend a ruling one. In such conditions,
not just extraordinary, unexpected events, but even ordinary flashpoints
of foreign affairs, can trigger large-scale conflict."\[112\]
[**Instead** of **creating a self-fulfilling prophecy**, this statement
should induce **caution** from leaders in **Beijing and
Washington**.]{.underline} **[Understanding the danger of war is the
first step to avoid being trapped in it]{.underline}**. Like Chan,
[Allison seeks to offer]{.underline} "a set of
**[principles]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} strategic
**[options]{.underline}** [for those seeking to **escape Thucydides's
Trap**]{.underline} and avoid World War III."\[113\] Obviously,
[historical analogies cannot completely capture an ongoing]{.underline}
event. Allison himself cautions against "facile analogizing" and
emphasizes that "the differences matter at least as much as the
similarities."\[114\] [The purpose of **analogizing Thucydides's Trap**
is not to **shoehorn** China and the United States into the roles of
**Athens** and **Sparta**]{.underline} respectively, as Chan suggests
(17-18), [but to underscore the **enduring feature** of international
politics throughout the ages]{.underline}. [The dynamics of conflict
highlighted by Thucydides **remain**]{.underline} as
**[relevant]{.underline}** today as it was two thousand years ago. [Many
scholars accuse structural theory of determinism]{.underline}, as Chan
does, (14, 34), [**even though** structuralists **do not adopt it**.
States can go to war for a **variety of reasons**]{.underline}.
[**Attempting to isolate a single cause for all wars is impossible**.
The proposition that war **tends** to break out during a power
transition is better understood as a **probabilistic**---**not
deterministic**---statement. The **structural tensions** cause by power
shifts can substantially **increase the probabilities of war**, much
like **dry leaves** waiting for a spark, but it does not mean that war
will **inevitably break out**.]{.underline} Properly understood,
[Thucydides's Trap **cautions** us to **be prepared for the danger of
war** during a power transition.]{.underline} Overall, Chan's book
provides a stronger critique of power transition theory than of
Thucydides's Trap. Students of power shifts should take his argument
seriously and avoid the pitfalls he identifies. We should not, however,
hastily dismiss the warnings of Thucydides's Trap.

**Attempting IR predictions about China is both possible and
desirable\-\--even if inaccurate\-\--because giving up on bounding
assessment of threats results in security dilemmas**

First, motives can be known. Mearsheimer is correct in observing that
[assessing motives can be difficult, but this does **not** mean that the
task is **impossible**. There clearly are ways of finding out
information about the goals of states and the means with which they plan
to achieve them. One of the most important roles of intelligence
analysts]{.underline}, for example, [is to determine state interests and
expected behavior based on obtained information. The possibility that
information may be flawed should **not** lead to a **rejection** of all
information. People make decisions based on less than perfect knowledge
all of the time. This ability to know motives extends to future motives,
because an analyst can use information such as **historical trends** to
observe **consistencies** or constant **evolutions** of motives.
Prediction of the future is necessarily less certain in its accuracy,
but the **prediction can still be made**]{.underline}.104 Second, even
if there is still some uncertainty of motives, the rational response is
not to assume absolute aggression. Assuming aggressive motive in a
situation of uncertainty ignites the security dilemma, which could
actually decrease a state's security. Mearsheimer calls this tragic, but
it is not necessary. An illustrative example is Mearsheimer's analysis
of the German security situation were the United States to withdraw its
military protection. Mearsheimer argues that it would be rational for
Germany to develop nuclear weapons, since these weapons would provide a
deterrent, and it would also be rational for nuclear European powers to
wage a preemptive war against Germany to prevent it from developing a
nuclear deterrent. 105 This scenario is not rational for either side
because it ignores motives. If Germany knows that other states will
attack if it were to develop nuclear weapons, then it would not be
rational for it to develop nuclear weapons. And if other states know
that Germany's development of nuclear weapons is only as a deterrent,
then it would not be rational to prevent German nuclear development. The
point is that [**the security dilemma exists because of a lack of
motivational knowledge, so the proper response is to try to enhance
understanding of motives, not discard motivational knowledge
altogether**. Misperception is certainly a problem in international
politics, but reducing misperception]{.underline} would allow states to
better conform to defensive realist logic, which results in preferable
outcomes relative to offensive realism. 106 Assessing motives [is
**vital in the case of the rise of China**, because mutually preferable
outcomes can be achieved]{.underline} if China is not an aggressive
power, as offensive realism would have to assume, but is actually a
status quo power with aims that have limited effect on the security of
the U.S. and other potentially affected countries. I do not mean here to
claim with certainty that China is and will always be a status quo
power, and [policymakers likely have access to more intentional
information than what is publicly known]{.underline}. [At the very
least, valuing motivational assessments **empowers policymakers** to act
on this knowledge, which is preferable because of the possibility of
**reduc**ing **competition** and **conflict**]{.underline}.

**[2AC -- Realism/Perm]{.underline}**

**Perm do both -- IR is reflexive, constantly changing and can be
re-appropriated**

**Abraham, 17**---Johns Hopkins University (Kavi Joseph, "Making
Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial Thought,"
International Political Sociology (2017) 11, 221--238, dml)

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that [those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with a number of possible responses:
one is to **deem realism**, in all its **complex** and **contradictory
manifestations**, as a **failed**, **unethical**, and **fundamentally
racist/imperial project**]{.underline}. A second response is to
politically align against liberalism, while holding this partnership at
arm's length. [A third response]{.underline}, derived from Ayoob's
(2002) subaltern realism, [is to work on an **epistemic register**,
**selectively taking insights** from realist traditions that help better
explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this [failing **does not
delegitimize other realist insights**]{.underline}. What is important
for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to combine plausible
realist insights with other categories that can grasp the extent of
global politics, including the dynamics of the postcolonial experience,
better. The final response is the one I advance. To adopt a mode of
argumentation concerned with [building a counter-imperial machine is to
neither **dismiss constituencies** that become caught up in imperial
formations, nor merely to **tactically align with them**; rather,
**establishing resonant connections** among postcolonial and realist
lines of thought, **highlighting shared dispositions** to difference, is
to push the latter toward **repositioning itself on new ethical lines**
that **limit contemporary forms of violence**. To recover a minor
position in realism is **not to accept all realist positions**, nor is
it to synthesize or convert any theoretical line into a coherent
framework. It is]{.underline}, however, [to **amplify the shared
spirituality** that informs both realist and postcolonial thinking,
drawing constituencies toward **prudential** rather than **imperial
defenses of difference**. It is to **furnish current research agendas**
with an **anti-imperial focus**, to seek the **creative possibilities**
that may arise when divergent constituencies meet, interfuse, and
shift]{.underline}. Thus, our response to Morgenthau, as to other
realists, is to cultivate the connections that do exist, not for
epistemic reasons but for a political project that strengthens
counter-imperial movements. Thinking from the Present By way of
conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that motivates a
theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial thinking. If the
ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of liberalism and
its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a return to
classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and above
postcolonial approaches. However, [the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a **counter-imperial machine**]{.underline}, to
cultivate a shared spirituality [that can **gather diverse** and
**divergent constituencies** to confront dangerous
practices]{.underline}. In my estimation, [countering an imperial
machine that operates in **complex ways** and at **complex sites**
requires a political strategy as **unwieldy** and **diffuse**, linking
constituencies that we **may otherwise dismiss**.]{.underline} [That a
tradition of realism **regularly circulates through halls of power**
across the globe **should be reason not to reject righteously** but
rather to **leverage its authorized status**. We can talk about
**imperialism**, **knowledge production**, and **race** here, while they
can talk about **anarchy**, **power**, and **self-interest** there---or
we can theoretically work on the lines of thought that **reverberate
among us**]{.underline}. To reiterate, building a countermachine is not
driven to "pragmatic" reconciliation or consensus and, thus, remains
distinct from the "eclecticism" of other plural approaches popular in IR
today. While the combinatory logic of paradigmatic synthesis has its
place, the connections between realist and postcolonial thought
articulated here are made in a far more agonistic manner. Rather than
produce something like a "postcolonial-realism," [this]{.underline}
argument [involves pushing contemporary realist scholarship toward **new
research agendas** and **new forms of critique**]{.underline} that both
capture a spirit internal to its own traditions while confronting the
realities of contemporary global politics. It engages with minor
positions along the realist canon to orient today's realism away from
the logic of great power politics operating under anarchy toward an
understanding of how the logic of liberal order permits forms of
imperial intervention. Needless to say, [drawing together realist and
postcolonial thought]{.underline}, as this essay has done, [can be met
with **analytical skepticism** and **political hostility**. A mode of
argumentation that **refuses comparisons** of theoretical cores or
non-truncated readings of select theorists strikes a note of
**analytical evasion**]{.underline}. To this there is no defense---other
than that already discussed at length. On the other hand, if the
expressly political purpose of this work is accepted, [the argument
anticipates **strong political reservations**: why align the project of
postcolonial theory with realism, an **unethical tradition of
militarism** and **realpolitik**?]{.underline} To this I would respond
that while a kind of strategic essentialism has its place, [**reducing**
"realists" to a coherent body of thought not only **obscures the
complexity** of their thinking]{.underline} (see never-ending
interpretations of Machiavelli as an example) [but **reproduces the
narrative of transhistorical unity** that some realists use to
**authorize unethical policy programs** in the first place]{.underline}.
More critically, however, [in embodying an **unproductive
ahistoricism**, it poses conventional realist categories of **anarchy**,
**selfinterest**, and **military power** as the **political problem to
confront** whereas the present historical context **demands attunement**
to how some of these drives]{.underline} (militarism, national interest)
[**connect with discrete problems** of liberalism and imperial
practices]{.underline}. In fact, there are good reasons to think that
the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and Morton
2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR theory
is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of a US liberal
world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while realism may
have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must theorize
from the present. In doing so, we may find that [countering imperial
formations **may benefit from resonances established**]{.underline} not
just **[among]{.underline}** postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and
other "critical" theorists but [**contemporary realists** who identify
links between liberalism and imperialism]{.underline} (Walt 2013).
Indeed, [if realism as a policy program defending the national interest
is **entangled with current militaristic** and **imperial
interventions**, we should **push the premise** of this statement, that
**difference should be defended**, in **anti-imperial** and **prudential
directions**. Doing so may allow **new openings to emerge** in the
present sense of closure, **new strategies to think** and **defend
alternative politics**]{.underline}. In this way, we may more fully
embody postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow
critique or brash conversion but rather attentive translation.

**Balance-of-power concerns [structure]{.underline} state behavior, even
if they can't explain [everything]{.underline} states do.**

**Blagden, 18**---Senior Lecturer in International Security at the
Strategy and Security Institute, Department of Politics, University of
Exeter (David, "Realism, Uncertainty, and the Security Dilemma: Identity
and the Tantalizing Promise of Transformed International Relations,"
*Constructivism Reconsidered: Past, Present, and Future*, Chapter 12, pg
205-216, dml)

The previous section documented how [social variables **might** be taken
as having the **potential** to transform international
politics]{.underline}. This section now turns to an explanation of why
[it is]{.underline} so [**hard to fulfill** such seeming
transformational promise]{.underline}. Running throughout is the
argument that [while playing a particular social role or expressing a
particular cultural identity are certainly state interests, they are
**necessarily subordinate** to political **survival**]{.underline} (as a
sovereign entity with control over its own foreign policy),
"physiological" **[security]{.underline}** (the safety from death and
harm of the state's population), [and]{.underline} economic
**[prosperity]{.underline}** (a baseline level of which is necessary to
ensure physiological security). Put simply, [if a state and its
population do not exist, it **cannot achieve anything
else**]{.underline}---such as fulfilling a social role or expressing a
cultural identity---either.36 And since survival, security, and
prosperity all have a material base---as Wendt recognizes via his "rump
materialism" (he simply does not think the material base yields
determinate outcomes)---so too must states necessarily put the defense
of such interests ahead of social role fulfillment if they want to be in
a position to play any sort of role in future.37 [That is **not to
suggest** that states **do not**]{.underline} sometimes---or, indeed,
often---[make ideationally driven foreign policy choices that are
**detrimental** to their other interests. It is simply a description of
states' **incentive structure**, which **much of the time** they end up
following]{.underline}. [It is necessary]{.underline} at this point [to
defend the notion that there is, in fact, a **material base independent
of the social world** and that characteristics of that material base can
yield **causal outcomes**]{.underline}. After all, [military technology
does not descend as **manna from heaven**, but rather is created via
**human agency** in response to perceived threats]{.underline}, and thus
it necessarily contains a dose of military culture and broader social
identity from the outset. The same goes for the overall share of
national economic resources allocated to defense, and indeed, money
itself is a socially constructed store of value, albeit one premised
upon underlying materially underpinned wealth.38 Any assessment of
strategic priorities is necessarily filtered through the
strategic-cultural lens of the institution(s) doing the assessing;
asking one's navy for an analysis of the relative merits of sea denial
versus power projection, for example, necessarily delivers an answer
infused with that navy's historical trajectory, its sense of its role in
the nation and the world, its internal politics, and so forth. The
broader question of whether the sea--- like other geographical
features---constitutes a strategic barrier or a highway similarly
requires cultural interpretation. Even technologies with such seemingly
self-evident destructive power as nuclear weapons are not self-evidently
"good" or "bad," either morally or strategically, absent social
interpretation. One might see them as "bad" because of the potential
humanitarian consequences of their use (or because of the constraints
they impose on conventional military options), or "good" because of the
casualties in conventional war they prevent (and deterrence that they
enable at low relative cost). Their political meaning is thus socially
constructed, even if the physiological effects on human bodies of their
detonation have only one possible outcome. If military technology and
resources require a social component to be both developed and
meaningfully deployed, then Wendt's contention that there is indeed a
"rump" material base but that it is simply indeterminate---in the
absence of a friend/enemy distinction---as a cause of international
outcomes becomes alluring.39 Crucially, however, [each of these social
choices involves a **decisive material effect** that is **not open to
interpretation**. It may be debatable whether nuclear weapons are
"**good**" or "**bad**," but the **effect** that one will
have]{.underline} on the city and its population of frail, carbon-based
human animals over which it detonates [represents a **single**,
**determinate outcome**]{.underline}---and a state facing another state
armed with them must therefore make certain necessary calculations based
around that capability.40 In the same vein, [while]{.underline} the
[strategic threat/opportunity]{.underline} constituted by geographical
features, such as the oceanic moats enjoyed by the United States and
United Kingdom, [may be a matter of interpretation, the **underlying
material factor**]{.underline}---humans' inability to cross water
without spending resources on capital (ships) that could otherwise have
been spent on further ground forces---[yields certain **necessary
outcomes**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the very **foundation** of relations
between major powers]{.underline} after 1945---secure second-strike
nuclear deterrence and its disincentivization of conventional
aggression41---[rests on a physical "**fact**"]{.underline}: the
relative impenetrability of water to the electro-magnetic spectrum and
the associated survivability that it provides to ballistic missile
submarines. [The same goes for the decision over what **share
of**]{.underline} national economic [**resources** to allocate to
defense. Choosing a proportion may indeed be a **socially** and
**ideationally informed political choice**, but the **underlying size**
of the resource pools]{.underline}---and the military potentiality that
they underpin--- rests on the total size of the state's capital stock
(both human and physical), which [is **not a matter of social
interpretation**]{.underline}. And while military technology is indeed
developed in response to human agency, it is done so from within the
technical bounds of the feasible. Such rebuttals apply more widely:
[while the balance of power]{.underline}, including resources and
technology, [is]{.underline} indeed necessarily [interpreted through
states' social lenses, it nonetheless **conditions the bounds of the
possible** even in the absence of social content]{.underline}. And when
those possibilities include hostile use, certain behaviors are
necessitated by prudent states seeking survival for their populations.
Realists should indeed be castigated if they infer predictions solely
from the balance of currently existing military hardware---a thin and
intellectually impoverished understanding of relative power---and
critics are correct to point out that a large stock of materiel is not
the same as being able to compel another to do that which they would not
otherwise have done, in line with the behavioral output understanding of
power commonly associated with Dahl (as distinct from the input
understanding).42 But [viewing total state power in terms of **overall
assets**]{.underline}, defined as the state's total stock of physical,43
financial,44 and human capital,45 [does a **better job** of]{.underline}
first [encompassing all the **relevant
resources**]{.underline}---equipment, stores of value, human bodies and
brains---[and]{.underline}, second, [providing an **effective measurable
proxy** for the **underlying causes** of behavioral power]{.underline}
(given that [the latter can only be observed **ex post**, and is
therefore **not an effective predictor** of outcomes]{.underline}).
[None of this is to **deny** that there is a **social element** to the
construction of all these power resources]{.underline}, or indeed that
the "material" itself involves a large dose of social input, and this
chapter is therefore not attempting to "settle" the debate over the
precise nature of the relationship. [It is simply to point
out]{.underline}, rather, [that states' power resources and their
effects are **not wholly socially constructed** and that the nonsocial
element **produces certain effects**]{.underline}. Turning to specific
arguments over states' pursuit of status, the notion that achieving a
particular elevated status and thus fulfilling a certain
international-social role might be a goal of states is relatively
uncontentious.46 For instance, one insightful recent constructivist work
on Britain's pursuit of international status suggests at the outset that
states' social roles are not the same as their interests, ambitions,
values, or capabilities.47 Yet the same work later asserts that social
role actually produces national interests, thus implying that states
cannot in fact have interests besides those constituted by identity.48
Such conceptual tensions are symptomatic of a theoretical dilemma: the
more minimal former assertion is the harder to refute, yet the more
ambitious latter claim is necessary if constructivists are to escape the
realist retort that fulfilling a social role is merely an interest of
states---and a subordinate one to materially underpinned survival at
that---rather than the interest. Escaping this retort is in turn
necessary if constructivists are to be able to claim that anarchy is
indeed what states make of it socially, since transforming the
prevailing culture of anarchy would require states to lower their guard
against each other---and thus accept higher risk to their survival, at
least while the hoped-for transformation was taking place---in pursuit
of an international-social value. The less contentious point---that
playing a particular social role is one of multiple interests---opens
the way to conceding that the most fundamental state interests remain
"political" survival (of state territory and institutions), "biological"
security (of the citizenry's bodies), and preserving some baseline level
of economic prosperity, since a state that cannot survive cannot achieve
anything else. But if that is the case, then from these materially
underpinned vital interests follows a need to be capable of defending
them against potential foes---and that, if it comes to it, means
accomplishing certain military missions.49 Such military capability is
necessarily underpinned by material resources, even as it also has a
socially constructed dimension. Such capability can be provided
independently (internal balancing), via allies (external balancing), or
through some combination of the two---prudent strategy, including
eschewing avoidable confrontation and aligning with the preferences of
powerful allies, is a key aspect of state success50---but either way, it
rests on some friendly actor's underlying resources. And reliance on
external balancing brings its own dangers, as recently experienced by
European NATO, when one's allies turn coercive.51 In short, [such an
analysis]{.underline}---while conceding that social role and status are
important to states, all else held equal, and that such concerns
sometimes drive them to act in imprudent ways---nonetheless [suggests
that hedging]{.underline} against abandonment, coercion, or outright
destruction [via balance-of-power positioning is **likely to remain
pervasive**. This is **not to say** that there will not be variation in
the **extent** and **severity** of such competition. All manner of
ideational variables might exacerbate or reduce tensions]{.underline},
as discussed above, and even in the absence of such social forces,
overt, intensive competition may yield self-destructive outcomes if it
increases another side's insecurity and causes them to adopt a more
offensively capable strategic posture in response.52 [The
point]{.underline}, rather, [is simply that conflict will never be a
**wholly absent possibility** and that that reality **must condition
states' calculations**]{.underline}---often to the point of some level
of defensive hedging, if the state has the resources and technology to
make that feasible---even in times of broadly cooperative relations. [A
similar retort can be made against the claims that threat perception and
military doctrine are both so **fundamentally skewed** by culture that
they may be **commonly** and **wholly disconnected** from
balance-of-power concerns]{.underline}, and which subsequently allow for
an end to military balancing, mutual threat, and security competition.
While this short chapter is clearly not the place for an extensive
review, the success of many states--- particularly resource-rich
ones---in aping military technological and professional best practice
would seem to suggest that much of the time states are able to achieve
what Gray, borrowing from marketing theory, dubs "good enough" force
postures in the face of strategic uncertainty.53 Similarly, when states
do "die" in the face of foreign aggression---a rare occurrence in
post-1945 international politics---it is more often as a consequence of
their relative military weakness and geographical vulnerability than as
a consequence of a failure to perceive a looming threat.54 Indeed, a key
contribution of the neoclassical realist research program has been to
demonstrate that [while domestic-political variables may **filter
strategic behavior** in multifarious and often nefarious ways, there are
still **underlying balance-of-power structural pressures** at the
international-systemic level that states **usually respond to**, even if
they do so **belatedly** or **imperfectly**]{.underline}.55 In short,
while Waltzian "socialization" toward accurately perceiving threats and
formulating effective military doctrine may frequently be hindered---and
sometimes terminally compromised---by cultural factors, [as a
description of the **workings of the international system** as a
whole]{.underline} (as he intended his theory to be), [realist
predictions of enduring concern and possible competition over the
distribution of material power are **not undermined** by]{.underline}
this recognition.56 Tellingly, despite their strong **[ideational
commitments]{.underline}** toward democracy promotion and human rights
enforcement under the banner of upholding international order, Western
states have recently had the reprioritization of balancing against
increasingly capable rivals forced upon them by developments in the
balance of power, whether that be China's rise in Asia for the United
States or Russia's (partial) resurgence in Europe for the rest of
NATO.57 Finally, [even **national identity** and]{.underline} the
**[nationalism]{.underline}** it engenders---the ideational "master
variable" underpinning the nation-state system---[is itself forged by
the interaction of **political group identity** and the **survival
imperative** under structural anarchy]{.underline}. To paraphrase Tilly,
[war **makes the state**, and the state **makes war**]{.underline}.58
[Modern nation-states may have **originated** as political groups of
individually weak human beings with some shared identity connection, but
their choice to **form states** as protective war machines capable of
generating]{.underline} the military [power]{.underline} necessary [to
defend]{.underline} against similar political units, [and the subsequent
mutual reinforcement of national identity and state strength, is **very
much consistent** with realism's predictions of the **consequences of
international structural anarchy**]{.underline}. Indeed, as noted
earlier, Mearsheimer uses these grounds to argue that nationalism and
realism are mutually supportive theories.59 In the post-- Cold War
world, moreover, mutually threatening political groups' need to generate
the military power necessary for security under anarchy---the security
dilemma, in short---helps to explain the explosion of ferocious
ethnonationalist and sectarian conflict within and between the new
states emerging from the collapse of previously multiethnic communist
federations, secular Middle Eastern autocracies, and so forth.60 Such
conflict has in turn forged the identity of the states and state-like
entities emerging from it. In short, [while it is **certainly not
impossible** for national identities to shift]{.underline}, as noted
above, [the **process** of their generation nonetheless suggests that
they are **endogenous** to---rather than **readily capable of
exogenously shifting** to transform---international systemic security
competition and balance-of-power positioning]{.underline}, that they are
as much a dependent variable as an independent variable. Uncertainty and
the Menacing Shadow of the Future The previous section outlined why some
of the otherwise most convincing [constructivist variables]{.underline}
at work in international politics nevertheless [**cannot promise** to
transform international politics away from a world of "**realist**,"
**security-motivated balance-of-power positioning**]{.underline}. This
section turns to discuss why [this is something that social variables
will **continue to struggle with** as long as there is an international
system]{.underline}. [The **principal barrier** to states ever setting
aside their inclination to guard against each other and instead embrace
each other as "friends"---**no matter how strong** their]{.underline}
leaders' or citizens' [desire to **transform the culture** of
international anarchy---is **uncertainty** over others'
intentions]{.underline}, particularly their future intentions.61
Following the logic of the prisoners' dilemma, a state62 that trusts
that another means it no harm while the other state concludes that it
now has an opportunity to pursue advantage may be punished severely for
its complacency, rendering such trust perilous, particularly in security
affairs, where defection from cooperation could result in the end of the
"game" for one party.63 The meaning and implications of this
"uncertainty" assumption merit consideration, however. Human beings are
constantly trying to impose certainty on a contingent world via
cognitive heuristics and neural shortcuts, for the sake of their own
mental well-being.64 Indeed, since humans derive meaning and value from
the self-imposed certainty of ideational reinforcement, so too they can
derive benefit from the entrenchment of both amity with and enmity
against "others," even when this creates other complications and
dangers.65 As a result, much of international politics is influenced by
habit, both the habit of friendship and the habit of animosity.66
"Uncertainty" also means different things to different people: for
realists, it is a condition from which to infer fear about others'
possible behavior; for constructivists, by contrast, it may simply refer
to the inherent indeterminacy of information until it is imbued with
social content.67 It may be possible to build trust in others' benign
intent over time and thereby escape security competition, meanwhile,
through their costly signaling: forgoing capabilities and policy options
that a potential aggressor would not want to do without.68 States can
also have the certain "friendship" of those with whom they are balancing
against a third-party threat, and if that threat is long-lived, then so
too may be the certainty of alliance.69 Illustrating this "uncertainty
about uncertainty,"70 consider one of the highest profile oft-invoked
security dilemmas: the Cold War escalation of U.S.-Soviet hostility,
during which the most seminal security dilemma theorization took
place.71 Robert Jervis---one of the concept's foremost
progenitors---subsequently questioned whether the Cold War can be
understood as a security dilemma after all, understood as a tragic cycle
of mutual threat between nonrevisionist security seekers driven by
uncertainty over the other's intentions. Neither side was "uncertain"
over whether the other was an adversary. And as subsequent archival
revelations document, each side did want to destroy the other, and
correctly inferred as much of its opponent.72 Jervis's "recantation" of
the Cold War-as-security-dilemma is itself bounded, however, and this
bounding sheds light on the ways in which varieties of uncertainty can
still operate even between states with "certain" mutual intent. "Greedy"
states versus "security-seeking" states are themselves binary ideal
types that mask an underlying spectrum. Practically all states are
greedy, in terms of wanting to improve their lot, if the costs are low
enough.73 Conversely, few states are greedy to the point of total
unconcern for security; not even Nazi Germany desired limitless global
war. While there may not have been uncertainty over each side's Cold War
intent, therefore---enmity-driven desire to defeat and ultimately
destroy the other---there was still uncertainty over underlying
motivations. 74 A desire to exterminate an enemy population may entail
quite different behavior than a desire for ideological supremacy, for
example, and the two may therefore merit different policy responses,
even though both fall within the domain of "hostile" intent. Such doubt
over motivations---even within the cognitively "certain" domain of
U.S.-Soviet enmity---still added up to a variety of security dilemma:
[the **most salient question** for Americans was not "**is the Soviet
Union an enemy?**" but rather "**what might Moscow do** about situation
X, in Y circumstances, at time Z?" The same is evident]{.underline} in
major power politics [today. Washington is not "uncertain" over whether
or not China and Russia are its "adversaries,"]{.underline} defined in
broad and obvious terms, [but there is a **high degree of uncertainty**
over what **types** of rivals they represent and their **associated
future strategic choices**. Recognition of uncertainty's nonbinary
nature]{.underline}, in short, [**does not undermine** the argument that
states' inability to know others' future behavior with perfect
reliability **incentivizes them to worry** about possible future
dangers]{.underline}. Realists disagree over prospects for avoiding
security competition through signaling motivations, of course,75 but all
variants are united by recognizing the enduring significance of the
balance of material power.76 On top of these qualifications to the
uncertainty-over-intentions assumption come disagreements over the most
appropriate response to such uncertainty. [Conceding that we can never
know another state's future intentions with mathematical certainty, and
therefore that the worst-case outcome]{.underline}---surprise attack by
a concealed aggressor---[will always remain a hypothetical possibility
**does not**]{.underline} necessarily [**imply** that security is
**maximized** by treating such a scenario as **likely**]{.underline}.
Provoking war for fear of possible future war is like committing suicide
for fear of death, and given the balancing often generated by hostile
behavior, provoking others into uniting against oneself through
attempted power maximization can ultimately reduce one's security.77
[While worst-case contingencies **always merit consideration**, policy
planning]{.underline}---particularly decisions over how much of the
national resource base to devote to defense ("guns") versus consumption
and productive investment ("butter")78---[**necessitates probabilistic
calculations** of the relative dangers of **overarmament**]{.underline}
(provoking balancing alongside domestic economic immiseration) [versus
**underarmament**]{.underline} (attack by a better-armed adversary).79
Intense security competition can therefore be an irrational and
self-defeating response to mere uncertainty over future intentions, in
the absence of other threat data.80 Both "realist" and "constructivist"
variables can feature among this threat data and therefore play a
crucial part in determining the optimal strategic response to such
intentions uncertainty, and that in turn conditions whether the
potential threat posed by each side's capabilities, be they latent or
realized, manifests itself as a security dilemma. For many realists, the
offense-defense balance of technology and geography determines whether
uncertainty over others' intentions merits military confrontation and
determines the (in)stability of states' strategic relations.81 For
constructivists, the solidarity/enmity borne of sociocultural
similarity/difference may be equally decisive. But [**neither** of these
observations---that uncertainty neither carries a single meaning nor
prescribes a single strategy---undermines the **core claim** that
survival has a **material base** that necessitates **continual
security-motivated concern** for one's position in the balance of power.
Survival may]{.underline} indeed [be "**multiply
realizable**,"]{.underline} with social/ideational variables informing
the path taken, alongside various "realist" variables. [But]{.underline}
given all [states']{.underline} need to safeguard a materially based
hierarchy of interests without wholesale reliance on others' politically
contingent (and therefore capricious) benevolence---whether that be
potential abandonment by erstwhile allies, potential attack by erstwhile
neutrals, or potential coercion by either---their [position in the
balance of power will **always remain relevant** to their future
security]{.underline}. And [given that situation, the conditions for
**mutual threat** and an associated **security dilemma** to re-emerge
are **unlikely to be permanently expunged**]{.underline}, despite such a
deterioration going unrealized indefinitely in many cases due to other
overlying factors.82 [Fear of future conflict]{.underline}---at least
against some state, if not against any specific state---thus [remains an
**endemic feature** of international politics]{.underline}. And much of
that is still down to the enduring concerns of structurally based
realism: international-systemic anarchy, its absence of a reliable
sovereign enforcer of global peace, and the associated dangers of
offensively capable peers of unreliably benevolent intent. Tellingly,
while many contemporary states have achieved mutual "friendship," they
have rarely sustained it once the strategic factors holding them
together---such as alliance against a mutual threat, shared membership
of a great(er) power's dependency network, or some other mutually
beneficial exchange---have disappeared. This suggests that such
"friendship" is as much a dependent variable (an outcome of realist
balancing behavior) as an independent variable (a transformational force
in international politics).83 Even within the zone of friendship that
had come to characterize the European "community" by the late 1980s, for
example---probably the deepest case of intersubjective recognition,
cooperation, and sovereignty pooling to date---Britain and France still
worried intensely about the potential power imbalances created by German
reunification, and they were not content until reunified German power
was subordinated via a restated US commitment to NATO.84 As noted
previously, moreover, via both Trump and Brexit---ideationally motivated
shifts in foreign policy orientation85---Euro-Atlantic security
relations have recently displayed a dramatic backsliding, raising the
specter of alliance breakdown and coercive confrontation. The relative
power of all sides is critical to their ability to resist/dispense such
coercion and safeguard future security even in the possible absence of
alliance support. Even within the EU, the ability of members to resist
or dispense coercion comes down to relative power: witness Greece's
experience at German hands in the context of the Eurozone crisis, and
contrast it with the lack of sanction for Franco-German breaches of EU
rules.86 And between NATO and Russia, a 1990s moment of optimism over
developing friendship has retrenched to coercive confrontation as an
outcome of each other's choices.87 All these developments---which can be
interpreted as negative movement along the spectrum between cooperation
and conflict---illustrate the continuing centrality of relative power to
safeguarding a hierarchy of national interests without dependence on the
changeable commitments of others. As a consequence, [the **base
conditions** for the security dilemma will **always exist** between
sovereign states under anarchy, even if it lies]{.underline} wholly
**[dormant]{.underline}** for most states most of the time, thanks to
overlying factors. [Interstate friendship does not render deterioration
to a security dilemma **impossible**, and neither does interstate
animosity **preclude**]{.underline} stable and durable
**[cooperation]{.underline}**.88 [So while identity---which]{.underline}
in any case [is "**sticky**" and **slow to change**---certainly matters
to security relations, it is **unlikely to trump** some combination of
**power** and **informational variables**]{.underline}.89 Of course, if
international relations were transformed by the emergence of a single
world-state, the system would no longer be anarchic and the
units-formerly-known-asstates would not need to rely on relative power
for their security, and thus such competition would end.90 That
requirement, however, does not look likely to be fulfilled anytime soon.
Conclusion [Conflict and cooperation is not some binary "**either/or**"
condition, but]{.underline} rather [a **spectrum**]{.underline}. So too
the [security concerns]{.underline} borne of uncertainty over
motivations [are not some irreversible "on/off" switch]{.underline}, be
that permanently severe or permanently solved. There is certainly far
more peace in the world than the most pessimistic readings of realism
would seem to imply,91 and ideational similarity and solidarity---as
well as the power and informational variables beloved of
realists---clearly have something to do with this.
[Interests]{.underline} within the parameters of continuing to survive
[are **socially constituted**]{.underline}, and even the route to
survival itself represents an ideationally informed choice. [But the
need to safeguard a **materially underpinned hierarchy of interests** if
states are to continue to exist]{.underline}---a necessary prerequisite
to performing any kind of social role---[still incentivizes them to
**value their position** in the balance of power as a
**safeguard**]{.underline} against future dangers. Of course, [states
**can** and **do** disregard certain incentive structures in favor of
others]{.underline}.92 [But until **all** states are known to have done
so---a **high bar indeed**---the potential for security competition to
re-emerge]{.underline} in the international system [will **continue to
exist**]{.underline}. And knowing that, states will continue to prize
the capabilities to provide for their own security . . . and so on,
creating enduring conditions for security dilemmas to one day reappear,
even though they go overlain by other factors in most international
relationships most of the time. Both realists and constructivists
therefore have work to do, in terms of both refining their paradigmatic
cores and recognizing the necessity of analytically eclectic
cross-pollination [to explain many of the **most pressing questions** of
real-world international politics]{.underline}. Realists must do more to
incorporate identity as a variable that produces systemically
significant variation in behavior rather than as some adjunct bolt-on,
whether that be via the post-1990s boom of neoclassical theorization or
attempts at microfoundationally elaborated structural realism.93
Porter's work on the interaction of power and habit in determining US
grand strategy is a good recent example, while---as noted
earlier---Snyder's Myths of Empire remains a key benchmark.94
Constructivists, for their part, must continue to investigate the
relationship between states' potentially infinite array of socially
constituted interests, their materially underpinned hierarchy of core
survival requirements, and the enduring concern for relative power that
the latter generates. Along the way, [both sides must be **circumspect**
in their appeals to allegedly "**smoking-gun**" examples]{.underline}.
For realists to claim that structure alone explains World War II or the
Cold War, for example--- missing the universalist ideologies of German
Nazism, Soviet communism, or US liberalism---would be a stretch indeed.
Equally, constructivists' most beloved examples---amicable US-Canadian
relations along an easily passable land border, the relative
underarmament of Germany and Japan, greater American fear of a few North
Korean atomic bombs than hundreds of British thermonuclear warheads, the
rise of European Union, and so forth---can all be readily explained with
reference to balances of capability and information. "Analytic
eclecticism" is easy to profess, but the most pressing contemporary
questions of world politics require that theorists practice it too. [For
those **not interested** in resolving **paradigm wars** or "**isms**"
debates]{.underline}, meanwhile, [the intersection of
**material-structural pressures** on state behavior with socially
constituted foreign policy preferences **provides ample scope** for
investigating **crucial real-world questions** of our time]{.underline}.
Viewed in rationalist terms, this might involve investigating the role
of social variables in informing leaders' utility functions, and thus
their preference orderings under the overall structural constraint of
needing to ensure continued survival. Just how far could the United
States meddle in the Middle East at the behest of domestic interests,
for example, before it critically harmed its power position vis-à-vis
China? Extending the previous point, has US unipolarity created unique
space for a "crazy" foreign policy that disregards the balance of
power---both by the United States itself and by close US allies---and
will this change if or when unipolarity wanes?95 Relatedly, just how far
can the likes of Germany and Japan sustain their pacifistic foreign
policy orientations in the face of US relative decline or disengagement
and the likely associated need for them to provide more for their own
security? Changing tack, how does a small power like Sweden---say---make
its trade-off between providing mobile forces for an EU Battlegroup (a
cause it values), on the one hand, and maintaining large amounts of
conscripts and armor on its eastern border to hedge against Russia (a
threat that it cannot be rid of), on the other? Are UK efforts to
rebrand as an "aid superpower" facilitated by a nuclear deterrent and
the US alliance, say, providing leeway to follow an ideational foreign
policy under the cover of a "good enough" military umbrella? In short,
[there is scope for **any number** of midlevel theories of foreign
policy under the **constraint of still recognizing** that interstate
balance-of-power considerations **continue to structure** the
international system]{.underline}.

**Even if it's not perfect it's [best]{.underline}.**

[In today\'s emerging world order, the Cold War-like confrontation
between the United States and China is not as rigid as it was between
the U.S. and Russia]{.underline}. Neither the U.S. nor China is in any
position to gather a group of committed warriors behind themselves
willing to fight for unsaturated material benefits or noble ideological
causes. [Solid alliance structures based on common threat perceptions
and unshakeable collective identities seem to have already given way to
short-term pragmatic cooperation across rival camps]{.underline}.
Compartmentalization has now become the buzzword defining frenemy-like
relations between countries. [Turkish-Russian relations of the last
decade offer a textbook example in this regard.]{.underline} While the
two countries are at odds with each other concerning many issues topping
the geopolitical agenda of the wider Middle East, the South Caucasus and
Eastern Mediterranean regions, they have simultaneously developed the
ability to manage their crises lest they get out of control. [All
countries, irrespective of their material power capabilities, are now
trying to improve their ability to resist the emerging tumultuous
developments **by increasingly adopting a nationalistic approach to
international relations.**]{.underline} Standing unyielding abroad while
going through a restoration process at home is now the most feasible
strategy that strategists recommended to national decision-makers to put
into use. [Speaking the language of populist nationalism and investing
in material power capabilities are now common trends across the globe.
What better evidence can one find than the European Union, the showcase
of liberal understating of international politics, trying now to become
a geopolitical power in order to survive in the world of carnivorous
powers, such as the U.S., China and Russia]{.underline}? While we are
going through a transitional process in global politics in which
geopolitical cards are being reshuffled, no particular country,
including the two behemoths, lays its cards on the table. [Of all
international relations theories, **it is structural realism that
defines today\'s world order the best.**]{.underline} [States do not
trust each other]{.underline}. The anarchical nature of international
relations impedes long-term cooperation. [Trust is lacking.
International organizations are mere tools used by states in order to
gain an advantage at the expense of the other.]{.underline} Material
power maximization is the key not only to mere survival but also to
regional/global supremacy. [States are extremely jealous of their
sovereign rights to determine what is right or wrong for
themselves.]{.underline} Conflict is the rule whereas cooperation the
exemption. Concerns over cheating and relative gains prevent states from
developing trust-based relations. [Distribution of material power
capabilities among states determine who would call the shots in global
politics and who would be at the mercy of others]{.underline}; [hard
power is becoming more and more important than soft power to survive in
this jungle. Self-help is the only strategy to rely on]{.underline}.
Nationalism outbids internationalism in the competition among
alternative ideologies. [The nation-state is the most legitimate
political community in which liberalism or democracy could
survive.]{.underline} The most sacred identity that individuals might
theoretically possess is the idea of citizenship. [Peace and stability
in the world can only be attained through the formation of a stable
balance of power among great powers, which are the only actors that
matter in international politics. **Any attempt to help build a global
community of humankind thriving on a universal civilization or political
and economic rights is futile.**]{.underline} Though states, middle and
small powers, in particular, try to preserve their strategic autonomy,
they cannot help but choose between balancing or bandwagoning in the
mid- to long-term. So long as they can, [many middle powers will try to
avoid choosing one side at the expense of the other. Yet this will prove
to be extremely difficult, as the stiff competition between Washington
and Beijing turns out to become an abject enmity in the years
ahead.]{.underline} **[We are fast moving away from a rule-based
international order in which liberal and constructivist accounts of
international relations would have more explanatory power than the
time-tested structural realism.]{.underline}**

[This article introduces]{.underline} political scientists to
[scenarios]{.underline}---future counterfactuals---[and demonstrates
their value]{.underline} in tandem [with other methodologies and across
a]{.underline} wide [range of research]{.underline} questions. The
authors describe best practices regarding the scenario method and argue
that [scenarios contribute to **theory building**]{.underline} and
development, [identifying **new hypotheses**, analyzing
data-poor]{.underline} research [topics, articulating **"world views,"**
setting]{.underline} new research [agendas, **avoiding cognitive
biases**, and teaching]{.underline}. The article also establishes the
low rate at which scenarios are used in the international relations
subfield and situates scenarios in the broader context of political
science methods. The conclusion offers two detailed examples of the
effective use of scenarios. In his classic work on scenario and Duncan
1993; Leufkens, Haaijer-Ruskamp, Bakker, and Dukes 1994; Baker, Hulse,
Gregory, White, Van Sickle, Berger, Dole, and Schumaker 2004; Sanderson,
Scherbov, O\'Neill, and Lutz 2004). [Scenarios]{.underline} also [are a
**common tool** employed by]{.underline} the [policymakers]{.underline}
whom political scientists study. [This]{.underline} article [seeks to
elevate the status of scenarios in political science by
demonstrating]{.underline} their [usefulness for theory building and
**pedagogy**. Rather than]{.underline} constitute [mere speculation
regarding an unpredictable future]{.underline}, as critics might
suggest, [scenarios assist]{.underline} scholars [with]{.underline}
developing [testable **hypotheses**]{.underline}, gathering [data, and
identifying a theory\'s]{.underline} upper and lower
[bounds]{.underline}. Additionally, [scenarios are an **effective way to
teach students** to apply theory to policy]{.underline}. In the pages
below, a "best practices" guide is offered to advise scholars,
practitioners, and students, and an argument is developed in favor of
the use of scenarios. The article concludes with two examples of how
[political scientists have invoked the scenario method to
improve]{.underline} the [specifications of]{.underline} their
[theories, propose **falsifiable hypotheses**, and design]{.underline}
new **[empirical research]{.underline}** programs. Scenarios in the
Discipline What do counterfactual narratives about the future look like?
Scenarios may range in length from a few sentences to many pages. One of
[the most common uses of]{.underline} the [scenario]{.underline} method,
which will be referenced throughout this article, [is to study the
conditions under which **high-consequence, low-probability**
events]{.underline} may [occur]{.underline}. Perhaps [the best
example]{.underline} of this [is **nuclear warfare**]{.underline}, a
circumstance that has never resulted, but has captivated generations of
political scientists. For an introductory illustration, let us consider
a very simple scenario regarding how a first use of a nuclear weapon
might occur: During the year 2023, the US military is ordered to launch
air and sea patrols of the Taiwan Strait to aid in a crisis. These
highly visible patrols disrupt trade off China\'s coast, and result in
skyrocketing insurance rates for shipping companies. Several days into
the contingency, which involves over ten thousand US military personnel,
an intelligence estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike
against US air patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States
conducts a preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on
the Chinese mainland. The US strike is far more successful than Chinese
military leaders thought possible; a new source of intelligence to the
United States---unknown to Chinese leadership---allowed the US military
to severely degrade Chinese targeting and situational awareness
capabilities. Many of the weapons that China relied on to dissuade
escalatory US military action are now reduced to single-digit-percentage
readiness. Estimates for repairs and replenishments are stated in terms
of weeks, and China\'s confidence in readily available, but "dumber,"
weapons is low due to the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of
the successful US strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese
publics. The Chinese Government concludes that for the sake of
preserving its domestic strength, and to signal resolve to the US and
Taiwanese Governments while minimizing further economic disruption, it
should escalate dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield
nuclear device against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific
region. [This]{.underline} short story [reflects a future event
that]{.underline}, while unlikely to occur and far too vague to be used
for military planning, [contains]{.underline} many [**dimensions of
political science** theory. These include]{.underline} the following:
what leaders perceive as ["limited," "proportional," or "escalatory"
uses of force]{.underline}; the [importance of]{.underline} private
[information about capabilities]{.underline} and commitment; audience
[costs in international politics; the relationship between
**military**]{.underline} expediency **[and political
objectives]{.underline}** during war; [and]{.underline} the role of
[compressed timelines for decision making]{.underline}, among others.
The purpose of this article is to explain to scholars how such stories,
and more [rigorously developed narratives that specify variables of
interest]{.underline} and draw on extant data, may [**improve the study
of IR**. An important starting point is]{.underline} to explain how
[future counterfactuals]{.underline} fit into the methodological canon
of the discipline.
